            Israeli forensic examiners have identified the remains of a deceased Israeli hostage returned from Gaza as those of Dror Or, the prime minister's office said on Wednesday.
    


            Earlier in the day, Hamas transferred the remains to Israel through the Red Cross. The handover leaves two deceased hostages – an Israeli and a Thai national – still in Gaza from Hamas' October 7, 2023 attacks on Israel.
    


            Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire agreement in October, ending two years of war that killed more than 69,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry, and reduced much of the enclave to rubble.
    


            As part of the deal, Hamas agreed to release the remainder of the 251 hostages – dead and alive – that it kidnapped on October 7. The last 20 living hostages were released in mid-October.
    


            Or, 48, was killed in Kibbutz Be'eri during the attacks. He was initially believed to have been abducted, but in May 2024 his family was informed that he had been killed in the attack alongside his wife, Yonat. His body was taken to Gaza.
    


            The parents left behind three children, two of whom were also abducted and taken into Gaza but were released in November 2023.
    


            In Hebrew, Dror means “freedom” and Or means “light.” Or's family said his name described him perfectly: “a free spirit spreading strong light around the world,” according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
    


            Or was described by the forum as a devoted father. He was the chief cheesemaker at the Be'eri dairy, and a yoga teacher.
    


            The release of his remains comes after a series of such transfers in recent weeks as Hamas has handed over the deceased hostages still in Gaza.
    


Israeli intelligence has assessed that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza. But Hamas has continued to search for remains in different parts of the enclave.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has continued to organize rallies in Tel Aviv and elsewhere across Israel calling for the release of the remaining deceased hostages.
    


These are the hostages released from Gaza, and whose bodies still remain

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","CNN exclusive: Colombian president says oil is ‘at the heart of' US pressure campaign on Venezuela","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/americas/colombia-petro-venezuela-oil-us-latam-intl","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 17:18:19 GMT","


            As US military activity ramps up in the Caribbean and the Pacific, Colombia's president alleged the Trump administration's pressure campaign on Venezuela is more about accessing the South American country's oil than fighting drug trafficking.
    


            “(Oil) is at the heart of the matter,” Gustavo Petro told CNN in an exclusive interview, noting that Venezuela has what are considered the largest oil reserves in the world.
    


            “So, that's a negotiation about oil. I believe that is (US President Donald) Trump's logic. He's not thinking about the democratization of Venezuela, let alone the narco-trafficking,” he continued, adding that Venezuela is not considered a major drug producer and that only a relatively small portion of the global drugs trade flows through the country.
    


            Petro has been at odds with Trump since he returned to the White House. In the past year, the Colombian leader has harshly criticized the Trump administration's immigration policies, its support for Israel and its military activity around Latin America.
    


            On Tuesday, he accused the US of trying to impose its will on its neighbors, comparing its actions to imperialism. “The United States cannot be considered an empire, but one of the nations among others,” the president said.
    


            In response to Petro's comments, a US State Department spokesperson said the Trump administration remains “firm in its counter-drug operations in the Caribbean and its commitment to protecting Americans from the (Venezuelan President Nicolás) Maduro regime's deadly poison.”
    


            CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            Asked if he had a message to the American people, Petro replied, “My message is the one they give to all members of the United States special forces: Your function, as they say in the oaths, is to fight against oppression. I repeated that on the streets in the United States, and it also cost me,” Petro said.
    


            He appeared to be referring to the US State Department revoking his visa at the conclusion of the UN General Assembly in September after he publicly called on American soldiers to disobey Trump and “not to point their rifles at humanity.”
    


            It's one of the many actions the Trump administration has taken against the Colombian leader in recent months.
    


Colombians caught in fallout of Trump-Petro feud



            In October, the US Treasury sanctioned Petro, accusing him of playing a “role in the global illicit drug trade,” a claim the Colombian leader has rejected.
    


            The sanctions were imposed days after Trump said he would halt all US payments and subsidies  to Colombia, claiming Petro “does nothing to stop” the production of drugs in his country.
    


            Petro defended his efforts to fight the drug trade, telling CNN that his government had seized more cocaine than any other in history. “So much so that in recent years, I have managed to ensure that the growth in crops, which is stagnating, is far surpassed by the growth in seizures,” he said.
    


            Asked why Trump hadn't acknowledged this, Petro said: “Because of pride. Because he thinks I'm a subversive thug, a terrorist, and things like that, simply because I was a member of the M-19,” a Colombian guerrilla movement active in the 1970s and 1980s.
    


            Petro also told CNN that he believes the US is comparing him to Maduro.
    


            His comments come a day after the US designated the Cartel de los Soles, an alleged drug trafficking group that the US has claimed Maduro leads, as a foreign terrorist organization. Venezuela has denied the claims, and experts say the phrase is more a description of allegedly corrupt government officials than an organized crime group.
    


            While Maduro has a problem with democracy, Petro said he is not that convinced about the Venezuelan president's drug trafficking links.
    


            “The problem of Maduro is called democracy … the lack of democracy,” Petro told CNN, adding that “no Colombian investigation … has shown us a relationship between Colombian drug trafficking and Maduro.”
    


            According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Venezuela is not a cocaine-producing country. Of the 3,700 tons of coca produced worldwide, more than 2,500 tons come from Colombia, while Venezuela does not appear on production maps, according to the UNODC, which said: “The majority of Colombian cocaine is being trafficked north along the Pacific coast.”
    


            Investigators from the US Drug Enforcement Agency reached similar conclusions, writing in their annual report published in March that 84% of the cocaine seized in the US comes from Colombia.
    


            Over the weekend, Colombian news program Noticias Caracol reported alleged links between Colombian officials and dissidents of the now-defunct rebel group FARC. According to the report, senior military and intelligence officials shared sensitive intelligence with the armed groups and advised them about how to secretly acquire weapons and evade military scrutiny.
    


            Petro has denied the allegations but acknowledged to CNN on Tuesday that ties between officials and drug traffickers have existed for years, even before he took office.
    


            A spokesperson for the US State Department said it is aware of the recent reports and urged Petro and other Colombian institutions to “thoroughly investigate these allegations and take all appropriate actions.”
    


            Colombia has long been Washington's most reliable ally in South America on security and defense. In 2022, the Biden administration designated the Andean country as a “major non-NATO ally.”
    


            Despite recent tensions at the top, US-Colombia relations remain intact.
    


            US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has made clear publicly that the administration's issues are with Petro, not the institutions in Colombia.
    


            “Our relationships with the people of Colombia, the economic sector of Colombia, the majority of people in politics in Colombia, and their institutions, in particular their defense institutions, are strong and enduring, and they're going to be strong and enduring long after this individual is no longer the president there,” Rubio previously said.

UNITED NATIONS, November 26. /TASS/. The UN Security Council and the General Assembly have published a joint letter to initiate the procedure of electing the global organization's new secretary-general.

The letter, published by UN Security Council's current president Sierra-Leone, says that it ""serves to begin soliciting candidates for the position while also setting out the modalities for submitting and considering nominations.""

It encourages member states to ""strongly consider nominating women candidates,"" because so far there have been no female UN secretaries-general.

It also notes ""the importance of regional diversity in the selection of Secretaries-General.""

Candidates to the post are nominated by member states, and each country can nominate only one contender. For the nomination, countries are to send relevant letters to the chairs of the Security Council and the General Assembly. In turn, candidates are to present their vision of the organization's development, and declare their sources of income. If a candidate is working at a UN body, he is to suspend his duties for the period of election to avoid conflict of interest.

The election itself is expected to take place in late July 2026.

The term of the current head of the global organization, Antonio Guterres, ends on December 31, 2026. Rafael Grossi, Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has formally declared his candidacy for the next UN Secretary-General.

The UN secretary-general is elected by the UN Security Council and approved by the General Assembly for a five-year term with a possibility of re-election. The number of terms is not limited, but the longest-serving secretaries served for ten years. In accordance with the existing practice, a secretary-general should not come from the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - Russia, the United Kingdom, China, the United States and France.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, November 26. /TASS/. The US and Ukraine presented a condensed peace proposal to Russian representatives in the UAE; lifting sanctions on Russia will need unanimous EU approval; and Washington presses Caracas by labeling the Cartel de los Soles a terrorist group to force political change. These stories topped Wednesday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

Negotiations between the United States and Ukraine on the American peace plan continued in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on November 24-25, following a round held in Geneva on November 23. The Financial Times (FT) was the first to report on November 25, citing sources, about US Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll's trip to Abu Dhabi, almost simultaneously with Politico and CBS News. The New York Times reported that two other prominent American negotiators - Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steven Witkoff - did not fly from Switzerland to the UAE. Experts argue that Washington may be using symbolic, informal negotiations to pressure Moscow towards concessions, Vedomosti writes.

According to FT, Driscoll is conducting talks with head of Ukraine's military intelligence Kirill Budanov (listed in Russia as a terrorist and extremist), as well as with some Russian representatives. Axios, citing sources, reported that Russia was allegedly represented by the ""head of military intelligence,"" without specifying a name.

Driscoll's talks are most likely unofficial, head of the Ukraine Department of the Institute of CIS Countries Ivan Skorikov told Vedomosti. In his view, the choice of the US negotiator carries particular symbolic significance: before any official high-level meeting, Washington may seek to signal readiness to ""appease"" Moscow and secure concessions on several points of the peace plan. Moreover, a meeting between American and Russian representatives in the UAE is likely intended to outline the steps both sides would take should the peace process collapse by the end of November.

According to Politico, Driscoll's objective in the UAE was to present to Russian officials the peace plan that the United States and Ukraine discussed on November 23, which has been reduced from 28 points ""to roughly 19."" Lavrov had earlier said that Russian authorities had only received the unofficial version of Trump's 28-point plan and had not seen any other drafts.

Russian authorities consider it appropriate to discuss only the document agreed upon in Alaska, Skorikov noted. ""Therefore, the Europeans' proposals are not subject to discussion, as they would merely delay the peace process,"" he said.

 

Lifting sanctions on Russia will require consensus within the European Union and coordination with the United States, a Member of the European Parliament told Izvestia. The timeline and mechanism for any potential rollback of restrictions have not yet been determined, but such a provision appears in both the American and the European versions of the peace plan for Ukraine. At the same time, the European Union will retain the legal framework enabling it to impose restrictions, and the process of lifting them could be hindered by individual EU member states opposed to normalizing relations with Moscow, experts noted.

""EU decisions on sanctions traditionally require unanimous approval by the member states. At the same time, the EU continues to work in close cooperation with the United States and other international partners to maintain a unified and coordinated approach,"" Tomas Zdechovsky, a Member of the European Parliament from the largest and leading group, the European People's Party, told Izvestia. At present, however, there is no clear timeline for easing the restrictive measures, he said.

Ivan Timofeev, Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council (RIAC), told Izvestia that the European Union will not abandon the legal mechanisms governing the imposition of sanctions against Russia. This means Brussels will be able to reinstate restrictions against Russia at any moment, even those that may be lifted.

""In other words, Council of the EU Regulations No. 833/2014 and No. 269/2014 will remain in force. We see this, in particular, with the example of Belarus, against which the EU has imposed sanctions since 2004. Periodically they ease them, but the legal mechanisms behind these sanctions are never abolished,"" the analyst told Izvestia.

Since 2022, the European Union has adopted 19 sanctions packages, and preparations for a new set of restrictions are already underway. In addition, sanctions introduced in 2014 remain in effect. The EU's promise to lift restrictions ""gradually"" appears too vague for now, Valdai Club expert Andrey Kortunov told the newspaper.

""There are so many sanctions - tens of thousands, that it is always possible to find certain measures that can be easily lifted by an executive decision in the United States or the European Union. Some sanctions require approval from legislative bodies, and others require bilateral consultations and agreements,"" he told Izvestia. ""The key question, therefore, is what exactly is meant by sanctions relief: which sanctions are being lifted, in what sequence, and to what extent the decision can be considered universal,"" he added.

 

A decision by the US Department of State to designate the so-called Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization has taken effect. According to US authorities, this drug cartel is allegedly headed by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro himself. The move steps up pressure on the leadership of the Latin American country. As CNN reported, President Donald Trump intends to force Maduro from office without resorting to military action. Experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta argue Maduro's departure remains unlikely.

The designation of the Cartel de los Soles as a foreign terrorist organization, the US administration stated, expands the range of maneuver available to American authorities. Counterterrorism operations provide a mechanism that allows the United States to justify actions that might otherwise be viewed as violations of international law. This applies both to the possibility of direct intervention in Venezuela and to strikes on vessels in the Caribbean region, which began in September of this year and have already resulted in more than 80 deaths.

The decision is also intended to increase psychological pressure on Maduro. CNN wrote, citing a well-informed source, that Trump hopes to achieve a change of regime in Venezuela without resorting to military action.

According to Dmitry Rozental, Director of the Institute of Latin America of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Maduro's voluntary departure from office currently appears unlikely. ""This would be the optimal outcome for the US: securing certain concessions from Venezuela without the use of military force. This is because an operation would entail significant costs for the United States - militarily and in terms of the political fallout, given that it would be met negatively in many Latin American countries. Therefore, the US would prefer to resolve everything through a negotiating process. Another matter is whether Maduro himself and his inner circle are prepared for this,"" the expert told Nezavisimaya Gazeta.

The potential negotiating process being discussed in the media could involve a number of concessions from Venezuela. ""In the oil and economic spheres, this could mean certain privileges for American capital and replacing Russian and Chinese businesses. But this is a scenario in which the chavistas would be taking a major risk by relying solely on the United States,"" he said.

In the political sphere, the discussion could concern the activities of branches of US government agencies on Venezuelan territory, primarily the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Rozental believes. Such measures would hardly provide tangible benefits to Washington, but they would at least constitute a demonstrative gesture signaling strengthened US influence in the region.

 

As discussions of Washington's peace plan continue, Kiev has also entered into debate over the potential peacetime size of its Armed Forces. Figures of 600,000, 800,000, and even 1 mln service members are being circulated. Yet maintaining ""an army of one million"" under peacetime conditions would inevitably push Ukraine into default, analysts inside the country warn.

According to experts interviewed by Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a million-strong Ukrainian army would be financially ruinous, strategically unacceptable to Russia, and that any realistic security arrangement should involve troop levels closer to pre-conflict norms and include broader international participation.

Back in late January, speaking with journalists at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Vladimir Zelensky said that without such security guarantees as an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO or the deployment of foreign contingents on its territory, Kiev would need to expand its army to 1 mln troops. Since Ukraine does not have the necessary funds, he added, European countries would have to cover the upkeep of the armed forces.

The question of financing such decisions is far from theoretical—especially at a time when Washington has announced the cessation of financial support for Kiev. And in European capitals, which had previously debated how to transfer nearly $300 bln in frozen Russian assets concentrated in the European Union, leaders must now also contend with another provision of the US plan that would effectively place control of those funds under their authority.

Evgeny Semibratov, Deputy Director of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Forecasts at the Peoples' Friendship University of Russia, told Nezavisimaya Gazeta that the proposed troop levels of 600,000, 800,000, or 1 mln in the Ukrainian Armed Forces are clearly unacceptable from Russia's perspective. ""By the way, some time ago President Vladimir Putin mentioned that during the Istanbul negotiations in spring 2022, Moscow insisted on the Ukrainian Armed Forces troop level of 250,000-300,000. If we look at what this number was before the military conflict triggered by the 2014 coup, we find that under then-President Viktor Yanukovych the Ukrainian army numbered 230,000-250,000. Therefore, the level that appears adequate today would be 200,000-250,000 troops. This would allow the Ukrainian state to carry out its necessary functions, but would exclude the formation of a new military fist threatening Russia's security,"" Semibratov emphasized.

The expert also noted that Russia and Global South countries should be included in the ongoing discussions surrounding potential security guarantees for Ukraine.

 

US company Ramoco Fuels intends to lease all 194 Lukoil gas stations located in the United States. The total value of the transaction is $150 mln, with the purchase to be completed no later than December 31, 2027, sources familiar with the American proposal told Izvestia. Experts characterize it as relatively modest, estimating the discount at roughly 50-70%. The Russian company may decline the offer.

According to one of the sources, Ramoco is proposing a 24-month master lease that would automatically convert into the purchase of Lukoil's entire US retail fuel business ""as soon as all regulatory, environmental, and franchising requirements have been met.""

Sofya Lukinova, head of the legal department at VMT Consult, told Izvestia that a lease-to-own arrangement could be viewed as a reasonably balanced solution that would allow foreign operations to continue until sanctions are lifted. ""Funds received under the lease agreement would also be blocked in a special account unless OFAC authorizes their use for operational needs,"" she added.

Experts consider Ramoco Fuels' proposal rather modest. According to the industry portal InfoTEK, the cost of a single gas station in Europe typically ranges between €2 mln and €3 mln. The price depends on numerous factors, including location, station size, traffic volume, the presence of a convenience store, and various additional services such as a car wash or service station.

Olga Orlova, head of the Industry Department at the Institute of Oil and Gas Technology, stressed that each gas station's valuation is highly individual and depends on many variables, but Ramoco Fuels' offer can clearly be considered below market, representing a discount of approximately 50-70%.

In Orlova's view, the buyer's proposed structure is generally workable. However, if the Russian company considers the amount insufficient, the offer will simply be turned down. It is also possible, she concluded, that all the assets will ultimately be sold to a single investor, in which case Ramoco Fuels would have to negotiate with that buyer and present a higher price.

Justice department maintains that Trump administration didn't violate judge's order to return flights to US

The Department of Justice said in a statement that Kristi Noem, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, was the one who made the decision to continue with the deportation flights of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador in March, despite a federal judge's directive that the flights must be returned to the United States.

In a court filing on Tuesday, the justice department said that “Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove provided DHS with legal advice regarding the court's order as to flights that had left the United States before the order issued, through DHS Acting General Counsel Joseph Mazzara” and that “after receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court's order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador”.

The justice department argued that “as explained below, that decision was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court's order”.

The filing came as James Boasberg, a US district judge, recently resumed his inquiry into whether the Trump administration violated his March orders to halt the deportation flights.

That month, the Trump administration had invoked the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act, designed primarily for use in wartime, to deport roughly 250 alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador's Cecot mega-prison.

Boasberg had quickly issued a temporary restraining order and issued a verbal directive ordering that the deportation flights already in the air be returned to the US.

However, the White House insisted at the time that the detainees were no longer in US territory when the order came down, and claimed that the ruling did not apply and so the planes were not turned around.

In the filing on Tuesday, the justice department maintained that the administration did not “violate” Boasberg's order.

“Although the substance of the legal advice given to DHS and Secretary Noem is privileged, the government has repeatedly explained in its briefs – both in this court on appeal – why its actions did not violate the court's order, much less constitute contempt,” the government wrote.

“Specifically, the court's written order did not purport to require the return of detainees who had already been removed, and the earlier oral directive was not a binding injunction, especially after the written order.”

The White House and DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new filing.

After spending several months in the notorious El Salvador prison, the Venezuelan nationals were repatriated to Venezuela in July in a deal between the US and Venezuelan governments.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Bruna Ferreira, who has a child with the White House press secretary's brother, is now in custody at an ICE facility

US politics live – latest updates

Karoline Leavitt's nephew's mother has been detained by US immigration agents in Revere, Massachusetts, as part of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Bruna Ferreira, a Boston-area resident who migrated with her family to the US from Brazil as a child, is now in custody at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Louisiana, according to the Boston radio station WBUR, which first reported the arrest.

The White House press secretary's brother, Michael Leavitt, 35, had a relationship with Ferreira, 33, and they had a son, Michael Leavitt Jr, aged 11.

Ferreira was leaving her home to pick up her son from school in New Hampshire when her car was “suddenly swarmed” by ICE agents, according to the Boston Globe. Ferreira's sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, told the outlet that the agents demanded her name and driver's license, but Ferreira did not have an identification card.

“They were not the most gentle with her,” she told the Globe.

“I'm sure my sister was terrified, frantic. She's been here since she was six years old. She's more American than she is anything else. I'm sure she tried to just use whatever she could come up with in the moment. However, it didn't really help very much.”

A White House source familiar with the situation said: “This individual is the mother of Karoline's nephew and they have not spoken in many years. The child has lived full time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born. He has never resided with his mother.”

Separately, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed that “ICE arrested Bruna Caroline Ferreria [sic], a criminal illegal alien from Brazil. She has a previous arrest for battery. She entered the US on a B2 tourist visa that required her to depart the US by 6 June 1999. She is currently at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center and is in removal proceedings.”

They added: “Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, said in a statement to WBUR that Ferreira had a “previous arrest for battery”.

Neither the record of Ferreira's arrest record or how any charges were resolved were immediately available.

At a minimum, Ferreira's detention and likely deportation has brought home the close or casual connections many Americans have to the administration's immigration crackdown.

Leavitt, the 28-year-old New Hampshire native, is best known for her high-ranking role as Trump's spokesperson. Leavitt began her career interning at Fox News in 2016 before serving in the communications office during Trump's first term.

When Trump entered office for a second time in January, Leavitt made history by becoming the youngest-ever White House press secretary.

Less is known about her brother except that he won $1m in a DraftKings fantasy sports contest in 2014, according to The North Andover Eagle Tribune. At the time, the newspaper said, Leavitt and Ferreira were engaged and their son was eight months old.

In a statement to WBUR, Leavitt said: “My only concern has always been the safety, wellbeing, and privacy of my son.”

Ferreira's attorney, Todd Pomerleau, told CNN that his client had been arrested on 12 November and was currently in the middle of a “lawful immigration process” for US citizenship.

Ferreira's sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, has now started a GoFundMe page to help with legal costs to fight the ICE charges and permit her sister to stay in the US.

Ferreira has maintained her legal status through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program which grants temporary protection from deportation for those who entered the country as children, according to the post.

Ferreira has “followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing”, according to her sister's GoFundMe page. As of Wednesday morning, more than $16,000 has been raised.

“She is hardworking, kind, and always the first to offer help when someone needs it,” Dos Santos Rodrigues wrote. “Whether it's supporting family, friends, or even strangers, Bruna has a heart that puts others before herself.”

The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that Daca recipients have been among those detained in immigration sweeps, although steps taken by Trump to end Daca during his first term were blocked by the supreme court.

In a recent statement to the Associated Press, McLaughlin said those with status under the Obama-era program “are not automatically protected from deportations”, adding, “Daca does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Bloomberg publishes extraordinary transcripts of secret discussions, but their provenance remains unclear

Bloomberg's scoop showing how Trump aide Steve Witkoff coached the Kremlin on the best way to get into Trump's good graces is extraordinary for what it tells us about Witkoff's dubious loyalties and the Kremlin's potential influence over US negotiation efforts. But equally interesting is the leaked material itself and where it may have come from.

The story covers two intercepted phone calls: one between Witkoff and top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, and another between Ushakov and Kirill Dmitriev, who has been deeply involved in negotiations with the Trump White House.

Bloomberg's story was published without any byline or dateline, presumably because noting where the story was written or who wrote it could give clues as to the identity of the source. Bloomberg says only that it has “reviewed and transcribed audio” of the two phone calls, without giving any hint as to the sourcing or any checks done to verify authenticity.

Given the agency's reputation for rigorous reporting however, it can be assumed that the source was considered to be very trustworthy before a decision was made to publish.

Ushakov, who was on both of the calls, appeared to confirm the authenticity of the recordings on Wednesday: although he claimed some of it was “fake”, he said he would not comment on the rest because the calls were confidential, and said leaking such discussions is “of course unacceptable”.

In an interview with the newspaper Kommersant, Ushakov said some of his conversations were conducted on encrypted government channels, but suggested the calls with Dmitriev and Witkoff may have been made over WhatsApp. “There are certain conversations on WhatsApp that, generally speaking, someone might somehow be able to listen to,” he said.

The content of the calls provides proof of what many already suspected about Witkoff's closeness to the Russian position in negotiations. The question of who took the highly unusual step of leaking such sensitive audio to a news agency is more complicated.

“It's really hard to speculate. It could be 100m different things, including somebody on the Russian side trying to hurt Witkoff's reputation,” said Daniel Hoffman, a former CIA Moscow station chief.

Russian intelligence agencies have a long pedigree of intercepting and releasing sensitive political calls, but there is no obvious motive for Moscow to have compromised Ushakov, a key aide to Vladimir Putin, and Witkoff, Russia's friendliest interlocutor in the Trump administration. However, given reports of splits in the Kremlin elite over who manages relations with the US, nothing can be ruled out.

Ukraine may have the motive to make the call public – Kyiv is extremely uneasy with Witkoff's role in negotiations and would be keen to undermine his position, as well as publicise the shocking extent of collaboration between the Kremlin and the White House adviser. But the risk of a catastrophic bust-up with the Americans if caught would probably give Ukrainian officials pause for thought, and it would also be an impressive technical coup for Ukrainian agencies to be able to monitor a WhatsApp call that took place outside Ukrainian territory.

One senior former intelligence official said that while any number of agencies could have intercepted the call, the most likely source was someone inside the US system.

“There are different ways of intercepting calls, including traditional signals intelligence methods, cyber-attacks, and having access to the devices, so anything is theoretically possible, but my strong suspicion is that this came from the US side, and if that's the case, you have two entities who are capable of doing this, the CIA and the NSA,” said the official.

There are many people inside US intelligence agencies unhappy with the current administration and its policies on Ukraine and Russia, but leaking audio of the call would be a difficult and potentially extremely dangerous move for any disgruntled employee.

One notable detail is that Bloomberg obtained audio of the recording, rather than just a transcript or report of the call, suggesting the source was either directly involved in intelligence collection or senior enough to obtain the raw audio. Another former intelligence official suggested a European intelligence service horrified at Witkoff's pro-Russian position was most likely to be behind the leak.

What makes the publication so surprising is that, if the interception of Ushakov's calls was part of a longstanding penetration, releasing the information would probably cause him to change his device and communication habits, and thus would close down a fruitful intelligence window for whichever agency had obtained it.

“It's completely unsurprising that any number of agencies might have got hold of this recording, but it's extremely surprising that someone would leak it,” said one of the former officials.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's declaration that a “Taiwan contingency” could amount to a threat to Japan's national security — which would allow it to exercise its right of collective self-defense — has triggered a serious downturn in Japan-China relations.

In an escalation of regional tensions, Beijing has advised its citizens against traveling to Japan, conducted live-fire drills in the Yellow Sea and sent its coast guard to waters surrounding the disputed Diaoyutai Islands (釣魚台), known in Japan as the Senakukus.

In truth, a Taiwan contingency has long been a matter of international concern — just ask any number of nations in the Asia-Pacific region that have expressed similar concern over cross-strait relations.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr in August said that, in the event of an armed conflict between China and the US over Taiwan, his nation would inevitably be drawn into the war. Owing to its proximity, the Philippines would not be able to stand on the sidelines, he said. Marcos' remarks were met with a protest from China, but were not withdrawn.

In a rare joint statement released after a bilateral meeting in August, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also emphasized the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. In a clear demonstration of concern, they voiced their opposition to the threat or use of force or coercion, or any unilateral change to the “status quo.”

The successive visits of US, Australian and European naval ships to the Taiwan Strait have a primary strategic goal — to prevent a Taiwan contingency from erupting into a worldwide security and economic disaster.

When the Russian war with Ukraine began more than three years ago, Japan was the first nation in Asia to openly condemn Russia's invasion. It leveled economic sanctions, delivered humanitarian aid and earned international approval for accepting more than 2,000 refugees from Ukraine in 2022, of which many had no pre-existing ties to Japan.

US ally Japan has demonstrated particular concern over peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. It has been monitoring for a possible Taiwan contingency, which it takes to mean a Japan contingency — a sentiment first declared by former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and reaffirmed by Takaichi. It sees Chinese military intimidation against Taiwan as not just a threat to peace in the Asia-Pacific region, but to security worldwide. Japan is clear on the fact that it is only by demonstrating strong support for Taiwan that it can meaningfully counter China and guard against a contingency.

Yao Chung-yuan is an adjunct professor and a former deputy director of the Ministry of National Defense's strategic planning department.

When US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) agreed to a one-year truce in their trade war, temporarily easing China's strict export controls on rare earths and other critical minerals, a quiet sigh of relief swept through corporate headquarters from Paris to Warsaw. However, the underlying structural reality has not changed: Because China controls global supplies — owing to its unrivaled extraction and processing capacity — Europe remains dangerously dependent.

Europe imports nearly all the rare earth magnets it uses in manufacturing electric vehicles, wind turbines and defense systems, as well as the lithium, cobalt and graphite that underpin battery production. With most of the refining of these materials occurring outside its borders, a temporary suspension of Chinese export restrictions merely buys time.

Since Europe would remain vulnerable for the foreseeable future, the only question is whether it would use this reprieve to prepare for what could be coming. When thinking about its economic future, resilience — the ability to absorb shocks that would otherwise paralyze key industries — is what matters. Unless Europe accelerates diversification, builds domestic capacity and institutionalizes risk management, the next supply crunch would hit just as hard, if not harder.

With the Critical Raw Materials Act, the EU has set ambitious targets to extract 10 percent, process 40 percent and recycle 25 percent of its consumption of these materials domestically. At the European Investment Bank, we are scaling up support for projects that strengthen the critical raw material chain — from exploration, extraction and refining to recycling and innovation — both within and outside the EU. We are committing about 2 billion euros (US$2.3 billion) per year to ensure that these materials are available to European industries reliably and over the long term.

As a bank, we offer loans, equity-type financing for high-risk projects, and technical advisory resources for project sponsors. Our recent support for a copper recycling facility in Germany, lithium production in Finland and a battery gigafactory in France shows what could be achieved when public and private investment pull in the same direction.

While Europe pursues these ambitious targets and collaborative investments, the US has opted for a more direct approach, with the US Department of Defense acquiring a significant share in MP Materials, which operates the country's only rare earth mine. Backed by public funding and long-term purchase agreements, this move, too, is designed to secure domestic supply chains and reduce reliance on imports from China.

US national security and industrial resilience are the main goals, and within this policy environment, major private-sector players like Apple are also committing to sourcing materials domestically. Nor is the US strategy limited to domestic action. Washington is also taking steps to secure access to rare earths and other critical materials globally, such as by acquiring stakes in Canadian mining companies. 

The EU cannot afford to remain a bystander. However, rather than competing in a subsidy race or relying on direct government ownership — which risks distorting markets and undermining the rules-based trading system that Europe still champions — the bloc should focus on building strategic alliances and partnerships. Resilience cannot be built in isolation.

With an eye toward securing alternatives to a single dominant supplier and strengthening its position in global supply chains, the EU has long been engaging with countries that value responsible resource development practices and fair competition. It has already established strategic partnerships with 14 countries — including Canada, Chile and Ukraine — each designed to foster cooperation on critical raw materials and support sustainable growth.

Building on this broader EU effort, the European Investment Bank is complementing these initiatives through its own actions. Australia — a mining powerhouse — is a key partner in this regard. Following my recent visit, we signed a declaration signaling our intent to deepen cooperation on critical raw materials, paving the way for future joint initiatives that promote sustainable growth. 

Reliability and predictability are Europe's strongest currencies when it comes to partnerships. These qualities underpin our alliances and can serve as the foundation for a coalition of like-minded countries that are committed to transparency and fair play. By sticking together, we can counteract market manipulation and ensure stable, reliable supplies.

In the meantime, we need buffers. Strategic stockpiling and joint purchasing, as proposed in the European Commission's ReSourceEU initiative, might not be silver bullets, but they do matter. Even if strategic reserves do not eliminate risk, they can cushion the impact of sudden supply shocks, and a common EU purchasing platform can strengthen bargaining power and reduce volatility. Bundling creates market power. Both ideas deserve more than discussion; they demand action.

Circularity offers another layer of resilience. We now have technologies that can recover up to 95 percent of materials from end-of-life batteries, but scaling up their use requires additional investment and regulatory clarity. At the same time, research into substitutes for rare earth magnets and cobalt-based chemistries should move from the margins to the mainstream.

Europe must act quickly. That means the engagement of not only EU institutions, but also member-state governments and industry, which can chip in with clear commitments, particularly through mechanisms such as offtake agreements and investments in all steps of the value chain. The European Investment Bank is, and would remain, a strong partner to all those taking up this challenge. 

If Europe is serious about strengthening competitiveness and reducing strategic dependencies, it must mobilize all the relevant public and private-sector players. Only through collective action can we amplify our market power and build resilience. Yes, this would require investment, but the price would be dwarfed by the cost of being unprepared for the next shock.

The Japan Sumo Association unanimously decided on Wednesday to promote Aonishiki from sekiwake to the second highest rank of ozeki.

Aonishiki, 21, is from Ukraine and now belongs to the Ajigawa stable. His birth name is Danylo Yavhusishyn.

The promotion was discussed at a meeting to decide the rankings of wrestlers competing in the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament, which will be held at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo from Jan. 11, and was approved during a subsequent board meeting.

“I'll strive diligently to live up to the name of ozeki and aim even higher,” Aonishiki said after the association's envoy came to a lodging used by the Ajigawa stable in Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, to deliver the news of his promotion.

Aonishiki is the first ozeki from Ukraine and the 14th foreign-born wrestler to achieve the rank. He arrived in Japan in the spring of 2022 following Russia's aggression against his homeland and made his debut at the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament in 2023.

At the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament this month, he achieved his first tournament victory.

His promotion to ozeki in just 14 tournaments is the fastest since the introduction of the six-tournament schedule in 1958, surpassing the previous record of 19 tournaments held by Kotooshu, excluding “tsukedashi” wrestlers who were promoted via a grade skipping system.

At 21 years and 8 months old, Aonishiki is the fourth youngest new ozeki ever, surpassing Asashoryu, who was 21 years and 9 months old. The New Year Grand Sumo Tournament will feature two yokozuna and two ozeki.

The Yomiuri Shimbun 

18:14 JST, November 26, 2025

Aonishiki's promotion from sekiwake to ozeki — the second highest rank in professional sumo — was announced Wednesday. He said, “I'll strive diligently to live up to the name of ozeki and aim even higher,”  at a ceremony in Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, where he was informed of the decision.

Beside the 21-year-old wrestler from Ukraine was his stablemaster Ajigawa, 47, a former sekiwake Aminishiki. Ajigawa has carefully trained Aonishiki for the past three years.

“[In my speech,] I wanted to express about my strong desire to aim for one more rank above ozeki [the highest rank of yokozuna]. I discussed with my stablemaster that a simple speech would suit me better,” Aonishiki said at a press conference. “I practiced the speech many, many times,” he said.

Aonishiki, whose real name is Danylo Yavhusishyn, joined the Ajigawa stable as a practice member in December 2022, eight months after arriving in Japan. Ajigawa had a policy against taking foreign-born wrestlers into his stable, but he accepted Aonishiki following an introduction from Koji Fukuda, a 74-year-old former sumo club coach at Hotoku Gakuen High School in Hyogo Prefecture. Ajigawa said he did so because he was impressed by Aonishiki's sincere dedication to sumo.

Ajigawa, a six-time winner of the Technique Prize, among other awards, carefully taught Aonishiki. He showed Aonishiki effective ways to deal with an opponent depending on their position as well as how to grab an opponent's mawashi belt.

They sometimes had drinks together and talked about sumo as well as personal matters.

On Sunday evening, Aonishiki brought a good news of winning the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament earlier that day to Ajigawa, and embraced his stablemaster. Aonishiki won the tournament on the final day of the event that ensured his promotion to ozeki,

“I was incredibly happy because I wanted to share my victory with my stablemaster the most. There is still a long way to go for me, but I was able to reward him a little,” Aonishiki said.

Ajigawa said, “Having come from a foreign land, he has been working so hard to understand the culture of sumo.” Watching his protege, who was promoted to ozeki only three years after joining the stable, Ajigawa added, “He will only get stronger.”

“Seeing a disciple going above [the sumo rank where I was] is a joy only a stablemaster can truly appreciate,” Ajigawa said at a press conference.

Aonishiki has won the Technique Prize in three consecutive tournaments, seemingly having inherited his master's techniques. His simple, humor-filled way of speaking also seems to resemble his master's.

“I want to continue striving for the highest rank,” Aonishiki said. His story with his stablemaster will likely have more chapters to come.

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

Unidentified drones struck the Russian city of Cheboksary in the Chuvashia Republic in the early hours of Nov. 26, with Ukraine's General Staff claiming successful hits on a factory producing electronics for Russian weapons.

According to the Telegram channel SHOT, the first blast was heard at around 2:40 a.m. local time. Residents also reported additional explosions on the outskirts of the city and in the airspace near the village of Lapsary, roughly 10 kilometers (six miles) away. Footage circulating online shows fire and thick smoke rising from one of the districts following the reported drone attack.

In the afternoon, Ukraine's General Staff claimed to have struck the VNIIR-Progress factory in the city, which manufacturers navigation equipment and other electronics for an array of Russian weapons, including Shahed-style strike drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, and glide bomb kits.  

According to the General Staff, the strikes led to a fire breaking out at the facility. The units or weapons involved in the deep strike operation were not disclosed.

Local authorities also acknowledged the incident. Oleg Nikolayev, the head of the Chuvashia Republic, confirmed that the region had been attacked by drones. Two people, including a teenager, were wounded in the attack and two residential buildings were damaged. 

The Kyiv Independent can't immediately verify the claims. 

Several Russian Telegram channels claimed that the strike hit the VNIIR-Progress plant in Cheboksary, located roughly 970 kilometers (603 miles) from the nearest parts of Ukraine's border. 

VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute involved in designing electronic warfare systems, including the Kometa antenna used to interfere with satellite, radio, and radar signals. The enterprise is currently subject to sanctions imposed by both the United States and the European Union.

The same plant was previously targeted on June 9, when a Ukrainian drone strike triggered large explosions and fires at the VNIIR-Progress and ABS Electro facilities. 

At the time, Ukraine's General Staff confirmed responsibility, saying the operation was part of efforts to degrade Russia's ability to manufacture components for attack drones, guided bombs, and other precision-strike systems.

Russian forces captured the villages of Promin in Donetsk Oblast and Vysoke in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian mapping group DeepState reported Nov. 26.

In mid-November, the RRC and the Movement of the First co-organized a first aid competition for children from across Russia and the occupied Ukrainian territories. 

Promin in Donetsk Oblast and Vysoke in Zapoirzhzhia Oblast were reported taken, the analytical and mapping group reported on Nov. 26. 

According to the NABU, Timur Mindich, a close Zelensky associate, committed his crimes by influencing Rustem Umerov, former defense minister and current secretary of the National Security and Defense Council.

While leaked reports of a U.S.-proposed peace plan have sparked international debates about the future of Ukraine`s occupied territories and the people who live there, Russia is forging ahead, entrenching its control on the ground by expanding illegal mobilization.

 Ukraine is facing its biggest wartime corruption scandal. The Kyiv Independent's Dominic Culverwell explains how Energoatom — Ukraine's nuclear energy operator — became a breeding ground for corruption during the war, how a $100 million kickback scheme in the nuclear energy sector reached the highest levels of power, and what this crisis means for President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country.





""The president will give me a lot of space and discretion to get to the deal,"" U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff told top Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov in a recorded phone call obtained by Bloomberg. 

VNIIR-Progress is a Russian state institute involved in designing electronic warfare systems, including the Kometa antenna used to interfere with satellite, radio, and radar signals.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Nov. 25 that there is no specific deadline for Ukraine to accept the initially drafted 28-point proposal, easing previous statements that implied he hoped for a Thanksgiving agreement. ""The deadline for me is when it's over,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One.

""The absolute condition for a good peace is a set of very robust security guarantees and not paper guarantees. Ukraine has had its share of promises that were shattered by successive Russian aggressions, and real rock-solid guarantees are a necessity,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said.



The arrests of NABU detectives in July were seen by critics as part of a crackdown on the bureau triggered by its investigations against Zelensky's top allies. 

""The original 28-Point Peace Plan, which was drafted by the United States, has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides, and there are only a few remaining points of disagreement,"" U.S. President Donald Trump said.

A new exhibition honors his legacy","https://kyivindependent.com/ukrainian-poet-vasyl-stus-died-in-a-soviet-labor-camp-new-exhibition-in-kyiv-honors-his-life/","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 10:04:19 GMT","

An exhibition dedicated to poet Vasyl Stus (1938-1985), one of the era's greatest Ukrainian dissidents, in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Nov. 13, 2025. (Anna Donets / The Kyiv Independent)

While the Soviet authorities promoted their vision of ideological ""universalism"" — a homogenized identity that suppressed national cultures — dissenting voices were silenced through arrests, intimidation, and even murder.

Yet amid this repression, courageous figures refused to surrender their cultural identity. Among them was the poet Vasyl Stus (1938-1985), one of the era's greatest Ukrainian dissidents.

The new exhibition ""As Long As We're Here, Everything Will Be Fine"" at Kyiv's Mystetskyi Arsenal cultural and art complex is open from Nov. 13 to Feb. 8 and celebrates Stus's legacy,

The exhibition showcases his life and work that echoes Ukraine's ongoing struggle for freedom in the face of continued Russian aggression.

As the exhibition materials note, Stus seemed to understand — perhaps more deeply than most — that the dissident's path often meant ""standing alone against the whole world.""

The poet spent years cycling in and out of forced labor camps and exile. Following his 1980 arrest on charges of ""anti-Soviet activity,"" he was assigned a young Viktor Medvedchuk by the state as his lawyer — against his wishes.

In the Soviet Union, defense lawyers were often tools of the totalitarian state apparatus rather than protectors of their clients' interests.

Medvechuk, who would go on to become a fugitive pro-Russian oligarch and godfather to Russian President Vladimir Putin's children, argued in court that Stus ""deserved"" punishment.

In 1985, the same year Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev announced an ""easing"" of restrictions across society, Stus died under questionable circumstances after launching a hunger strike in a forced labor camp for political prisoners in Russia's Perm region.


""Bearing the highest cost in human lives to deter the enemy, we often feel alone in holding back a force that threatens the entire democratic world.""
    

The title of Mystetskyi Arsenal's exhibition — taken from a line written in a letter by Stus to a friend — resonates not only with the plight of an anti-Soviet dissident but with the current struggles of Ukrainians living through Russia's ongoing full-scale war.

The decision by Mystetskyi Arsenal to stage the exhibition was inspired by those very parallels, according to the organizers.

""Bearing the highest cost in human lives to deter the enemy, we often feel alone in holding back a force that threatens the entire democratic world,"" Yulia Naidukh, the curatorial team's project manager, told the Kyiv Independent.

""Yet, the examples of those who suffered at the hands of the same evil half a century ago — fighting for the very cause we defend, and with even less support — can serve as a source of resilience and a remedy for despair.""

The team behind the exhibition devoted a year and a half to its preparation, collaborating with more than 15 institutions. This included vital materials from Kyiv's Sixtiers Museum, dedicated to the anti-Soviet dissident movement of Stus' time.

Stus scholars, his relatives and friends, private collectors, and other individuals were also involved in the behind-the-scenes work to bring the exhibition to life.

Dmytro Stus, the son of Vasyl Stus, told the Kyiv Independent that his overall impression of the exhibition was positive.

Speaking on his father's enduring popularity today, he said,  ""I've been working on (my father's) legacy for 35 years. During this time a new field — Stus Studies — has been created, and it is perhaps one of the largest bodies of work in Ukrainian culture.""

Despite the heavy subject matter, the process of preparing the exhibition came with pleasant surprises, according to Naidukh — like when they discovered previously unseen photos from Stus' reburial in Ukraine, after his body was repatriated from Russia.

""We were fortunate to meet a woman who, as a schoolgirl in 1989, had captured unique photographs alongside her father, a photojournalist, of the reburials of Stus and fellow dissidents) Yurii Lytvyn and Oleksa Tykhyi,"" she said.

As visitors progress through the exhibition, the atmosphere grows increasingly somber. This includes an installation that recreates a holding cell, with three concrete-framed displays that showcase artifacts such as the tiny, nearly illegible handwriting of Stus's poems later sewn into clothing by friends to be smuggled out of the Soviet Union.

Playing faintly from speakers above the holding cell is a recording of Ukrainian human rights activist Nadiya Svitlychna reading Stus' pivotal work ""Palimpsests"" — as well as the recording of a bird singing.

The most striking of the concrete-framed displays is the one left intentionally empty. Its label, ""Bird of the Soul,"" refers to the poetry collection Stus was working on before his death — a manuscript confiscated by Soviet authorities. To this day, its whereabouts remain unknown.

""Dmytro Stus, Vasyl's son, tried to locate it in the Russian archives but was unsuccessful,"" Naidukh said. ""We still don't know whether Stus' work survived or was destroyed forever.""

The exhibition ends with a photo of a smiling Stus waving goodbye — a reminder that despite all Ukrainians have lost to Russia, those who survive will always find a way to keep their memories alive.

Kate Tsurkan here, thanks for reading my latest article. Walking into this exhibition I immediately understood it was a matter of if, not when, I would cry. Vasyl Stus is one of my favorite Ukrainian writers not only for his brilliant poetry but for his strong moral conviction. If more people like him existed in this world, I think we'd be much better off.

This is Jared Goyette, reporting from Kyiv on a foggy November day. While news coverage and public discussion focus on the peace negotiations, the front lines continue to boil, as Russia's full-scale invasion enters its 1,372nd day.

The top story of the day so far:

Russian forces have completed the capture of two villages, Promin in Donetsk Oblast, and Vysoke in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Ukrainian analytical and mapping group DeepState reported on Nov. 26.

Both villages sit on two of the most active and contested sectors of the front line, and their loss reflects steady Russian advances ahead of the winter fighting season

Promin is located near the city of Myrnohrad, which remains under Ukrainian control despite its near-complete encirclement over the last month as Russian forces continue to overrun the neighboring city of Pokrovsk.

Meanwhile, Vysoke lies just northeast of the small city of Huliaipole, which — despite being one of the most stable parts of the front line for most of the full-scale war — is now threatened by Russia's brisk push into eastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast.

Updated at 6:09 p.m. Kyiv time

While leaked reports of a U.S.-proposed peace plan have sparked international debates about the future of Ukraine`s occupied territories and the people who live there, Russia is forging ahead, entrenching its control on the ground by expanding illegal mobilization.

On the ground, that translates into forcing civilians and prisoners of war (POWs) to join its military and systematically preparing children for future service, experts said at a Nov. 25 roundtable in Kyiv organized by The Reckoning Project, a global war crimes documentation initiative that was initially created in response to Russia's full.

Researchers with the initiative described how  Moscow has built a full-scale system of militarization in occupied areas — from indoctrination in schools and youth camps to the coercion of men and Ukrainian POWs into combat. The researchers argue that these practices may constitute war crimes and could form the basis for international criminal charges against both individuals and the Russian state.

""Since 2015, Russia has been systematically preparing Ukrainian society under occupation for participation in hostilities. This includes children as young as preschool age,"" said Roman Avramenko, executive director of The Reckoning Project.

Updated at 3:05 p.m. Kyiv time

Ukrainian officials are pushing back against Russian claims and social media rumors that Ukrainian troops near Huliaipole in Zaporizhzhia Oblast are encircled: front-line units remain supplied, and medical evacuation routes continue to function despite heavy fighting, the Southern Defense Forces said in a statement on Nov. 26.

The command accused Moscow of exaggerating its “so-called successes” and magnifying problems in Ukraine's ranks to sow panic.

The fighting remains heavy. Over the past day, Russian forces carried out more than 30 assaults, over 500 artillery strikes using more than 2,100 rounds, about a dozen airstrikes, 250 drone drops and nearly 2,000 kamikaze drone attacks in the Huliaipole sector, according to the statement. Ukrainian units are “holding the defense,” maintaining communications and logistics, the command added.

The update comes as Russian forces continue to press the front in Zaporizhzhia Oblast, where Ukrainian troops have pulled back from some positions amid intense fighting. 

In a previous Kyiv Independent anlysis of the Zaporizhzhia front on Nov. 12, we reported that, according to figures published by the highly trusted Ukrainian mapping and analytical organization Deep State, 69% of all Russian territorial gains in October were made in the area around Huliaipole and in eastern Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts, even though the area saw only 16% of Russia's total assault operations, based on General Staff data.

Updated at 2:30 pm Kyiv time

Drones struck the Russian city of Cheboksary in the Chuvashia Republic in the early hours of Nov. 26, with Ukraine's General Staff claiming successful hits on a factory producing electronics for Russian weapons.

According to the Telegram channel SHOT, the first blast was heard at around 2:40 a.m. local time. Residents also reported additional explosions on the outskirts of the city and in the airspace near the village of Lapsary, roughly 10 kilometers (six miles) away. Footage circulating online shows fire and thick smoke rising from one of the districts following the reported drone attack.

In the afternoon, Ukraine's General Staff claimed to have struck the VNIIR-Progress factory in the city, which manufacturers navigation equipment and other electronics for an array of Russian weapons, including Shahed-style strike drones, cruise and ballistic missiles, and glide bomb kits.

According to the General Staff, the strikes led to a fire breaking out at the facility. The units or weapons involved in the deep strike operation were not disclosed.

At least one person has been killed and 37 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local arthritis reported on Nov. 26.

Ukraine's Air Force said Russia attacked overnight with two Iskander-M ballistic missiles launched from Russia's Rostov Oblast and 90 attack drones of various types, including around 55 Shaheds. Ukrainian air defenses shot down or suppressed 72 of the drones, while missile and drone strikes were recorded at 10 locations, the Air Force said on Telegram.

In southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, 19 people were injured when Russian forces carried out 11 airstrikes on the city of Zaporizhzhia and struck other parts of the region over the past day, Zaporizhzhia Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.

In eastern Donetsk Oblast, nine civilians were wounded on Nov. 25, including seven people in Sloviansk and two in Kostiantynivka, Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. 

In southern Kherson Oblast, seven people, including a child, were injured over the past day as Russian forces hit at least four apartment blocks and 21 private houses in towns and villages across the region, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin said on his official Telegram channel

In a separate incident on Nov. 26, Russian forces attacked a house with a drone in the Korabelnyi district of Kherson city, wounding a 63-year-old man, the Kherson Oblast Military Administration and Kherson city authorities said on Telegram.  Doctors are treating him for a concussion and blast-related head injuries.

In Sumy Oblast, a 45-year-old woman was wounded in the Velykopysarivska community as Russia carried out about 70 attacks on 34 settlements in 13 communities over the past day, Sumy Governor Oleg Hryhorov said on Telegram.

In Kharkiv Oblast, a 51-year-old man who had been injured in the Nov. 23 mass drone attack on Kharkiv died in hospital overnight, increasing the death toll from that strike to five, Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram.

Syniehubov separately reported that Russian forces attacked eight settlements in the region over the past day, but no new casualties were recorded from those strikes.

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, regional authorities reported overnight drone and missile attacks on a postal facility, homes, and administrative buildings, but said there was no information on casualties as of the morning of Nov. 26

Russia has lost around 1,168,550 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 25.

The number includes 980 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day. 

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,372 (+4)  tanks, 23,625 (+1) armored fighting vehicles, 68,242 (+124) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,688 (+44) artillery systems, 1,549 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,252 (+2) air defense systems, 428 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 84,960 (+743) drones, 28 ships and boats, and one submarine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","Hong Kong fire engulfs multiple apartment blocks, killing 36","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-hong-kong-fire-apartments-wang-fuk-court-tai-po-district/","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:01:47 GMT","

Multiple high-rise apartment blocks at a housing estate in Hong Kong were engulfed in flames Wednesday, killing 36  people as the authorities struggled to bring the blaze under control. 

Late into the night, firefighters were still trying to extinguish the fire at Wang Fuk Court, after flames spread quickly across bamboo scaffolding and mesh cladding put up for renovations, jumping from building to building as residents raced to evacuate. 

At around 11 p.m., flames could still be seen raging in most of the windows of one of the 32-storey buildings, while the other towers continued to smoulder, a huge plume of smoke rising above them, visible even against the night sky. A smell like burning rubber pervaded the surrounding area, and the occasional crack and crash could be heard from the burning towers. 

As of early Thursday, the death toll had risen to 36, the city's Chief Executive John Lee said. At least 279 people were still unaccounted for, he added, with several dozen hospitalized.

Fire authorities said the majority of residents had evacuated, but they were still receiving emergency calls from people trapped inside well into the evening, and The Globe saw at least one person being stretchered to an ambulance late Wednesday night. 

A fleet of fire engines and ambulances filled the roads leading up to Wang Fuk Court, with emergency workers running back and forth from them. Above, hundreds of people had gathered on a footbridge, watching in stunned horror as the buildings continued to burn. At one point, firefighters had to scramble to a school across the river from the main blaze, after a small fire broke out there, but they were able to quickly put it out.

Part of a larger public housing estate, Wang Fuk Court is comprised of around 2,000 flats, housing an estimated 4,000 people. Police said many residents in neighbouring buildings had also evacuated out of an abundance of caution. 

Multiple people have died after a massive fire engulfed multiple high-rise towers of a residential complex in Hong Kong's northern Tai Po district on Wednesday, with thick grey smoke billowing out as emergency services battled to subdue the blaze.

Mr. Lee said he had convened a meeting of the city's emergency response team, adding temporary shelters had been arranged for residents displaced by the blaze. 

“The fire has resulted in multiple casualties, including the death of a firefighter in the line of duty,” Mr. Lee said in a statement. “I express my deepest sorrow and extend my sincere condolences to the families of the deceased and the injured.”

The firefighter was identified as 37-year-old Ho Wai-ho, who Hong Kong director of fire services Andy Yeung described as a “dedicated and gallant” comrade.

A “new town” developed in the 1970s and '80s to relieve pressure on Hong Kong's traditional population centres, Tai Po is located in the northern part of the territory, close to the border with China. 

The close-knit community created by Tai Po's relative geographic isolation and large amount of public housing was on show Wednesday, with the streets flooded with volunteers carrying and wheeling boxes of water, food and other supplies to the temporary shelters. 

Transporting donated meals from a nearby barbecue restaurant to a sports ground that was now housing around 150 displaced families, local Ryan Wong said he felt compelled to help. Like many Tai Po residents, he had friends who lived in Wong Fuk Court, but said they had evacuated. 

“A lot of elderly people live there though,” Mr. Wong added, “so we're really worried.” 

‘World's best bar' helps revive Hong Kong's storied but struggling nightlife

Wednesday's fire is Hong Kong's worst such disaster since 41 people died in a commercial building in the heart of Kowloon in November, 1996. That fire was later found to be caused by welding during internal renovations.

No cause of the Wong Fuk Court fire was yet known, though weather conditions in Hong Kong have been exceptionally dry in recent days, with the city's Observatory issuing a Red Fire Danger warning every day since Monday. 

While fires are rare in Hong Kong, Wednesday's blaze will renew calls to phase out the use of bamboo scaffolding, an iconic emblem of Hong Kong's development that has increasingly come to be seen as too dangerous. Following a smaller fire in March, the government said it would phase out its use. 

The Wong Fuk Court blaze was reminiscent of 2017's deadly Grenfell Tower fire in Britain. Speaking to CNN, Stephen Mackenzie, a UK-based independent fire and emergency planning consultant, warned the death toll from Wednesday's blaze could yet eclipse that disaster. 

“We just shouldn't see this. After Grenfell, after the extensive public inquiry, we should not see fire spread from a block, to a block, to a block, in an occupied premises,” he told the broadcaster. “This is tantamount to gross negligence, it should not happen. It flies in the face of the entire premise of fire and life safety legislation.”

Katie Taylor is the former CEO of Four Seasons Hotels and the first woman to chair the board of a Big Five bank.Sam Singh/The Globe and Mail

My first job was as a banquet waitress. We had to work as a team, and we worked in service of people. I'm a classic extrovert, so those kinds of roles were the ones I found easiest to do. They didn't deplete my energy.

I wasn't someone who went to law school because I wanted to be lawyer, but I ended up at Goodmans. I cycled through every department and hated them all. I ended up in corporate securities and loved the excitement of it.

When the market crashed in 1987, we went from working 18 to 20 hours a day to having nothing to do. Being a kid with no net to fall back on, my main objective was to stay employed. So I said to my boss, “What would you think if I went to the OSC and learned the other side of the Street?”

It was an unbelievably exciting time for the OSC, but then my mentor from Goodmans asked if I wanted to be No. 2 at Four Seasons. He said, “You'll have so much fun.” And I got to work with him again. People rarely quit and join companies. They quit and join their bosses.

It was one of the more fantastical career experiences: an iconic founder of an unbelievably successful global brand. I was never more than 50 paces from Issy's office. And I was general counsel, so almost everything ran through my office.

I had a seat at the table, which was mostly men. They were all, including Issy, interested in developing me as a more rounded, more successful leader. 

Like any young mother, it was hair-on-fire most of the time. I had an incredible support system, but there's no replacement for the mom. That's why I do a lot of talking about why there's no work-life balance; there's only work-life integration. You try to fit your lives together the best you can. 

We'd taken Four Seasons private in 2007, and by 2013, the new investors were looking to have a larger role in running the business. In the circumstances, my departure – though sudden – was not too surprising. 

I'd spent years on the road, sometimes 150 or more days a year. So never going to Pearson again seemed like a good thing. 

I went out with Phyllis Yaffe, who'd been CEO of Alliance Atlantis. I asked why she'd hung up the skates. And she said, “Because I had the extraordinary luck of working for the best company in the best industry with the best people and the best team. The chances of repeating that twice in one lifetime is close to zero, so I decided not to set myself up for disappointment.” I went home and told my husband, “I'm not being a CEO again.”

When I became the first woman chair at RBC, it was zero out of five at the Big Banks, then it was one out of five. Now it's two out of five. I call that progress. 

If you look at the composition of the largest companies in Canada, most have a very diverse slate of directors. Where things have not progressed at nearly the pace I expected is on the executive and executive pipeline side. 

Take more risk in your 20s. Pivot, pivot, pivot. Because once you're in your 30s, the cement has formed around your feet.

We're in a relationship deficit. People are spending less time together. Get out there and get connected. Over time, that's going to matter hugely.

New data from the UN shows the worrying scale of global femicides, with some 50,000 women and girls killed by a partner or family member in 2024 alone. UN Women says no real progress has been made on the deadly trend.

A woman or a girl is killed every 10 minutes around the world, new figures released by the United Nations on Monday showed.

The 2025 femicide report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and UN Women says that no real progress has been made when addressing such killings.

The UN said the release of the report marked the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.

During the course of 2024, the report found that around 83,000 women and girls were deliberately killed. Nearly 60% of them — or 50,000 — died at the hands of intimate partners or family members.

This equates to a woman or girl being killed by a partner or family member nearly every 10 minutes.

In comparison, the UN said 11% of male homicides were perpetrated by intimate partners or family members.

""The home remains a dangerous and sometimes lethal place for too many women and girls around the world,"" said John Brandolino, UNODC's acting executive director.

""The 2025 femicide brief provides a stark reminder of the need for better prevention strategies and criminal justice responses to femicide,"" Brandolino added.

The report also highlighted how technology had worsened some types of violence, like cyberstalking, coercive control, and image-based abuse. It was found to be a possible risk factor that escalated to the physical world and, in some cases, led to women and girls being killed.

""Femicides don't happen in isolation. They often sit on a continuum of violence that can start with controlling behavior, threats, and harassment — including online,"" said Sarah Hendriks, director of UN Women's policy division.

The UN said that women and girls were being subjected to extreme forms of violence in every part of the world.

The regional breakdown saw Africa with the highest rate of femicide in 2024 with 3 per 100,000 women and girls, followed by the Americas with 1.5, Oceania with 1.4, Asia with 0.7 and Europe with the lowest at 0.5.

The report called for ""urgent, coordinated prevention"" and specified six key areas, among them, strengthening legal frameworks, survivor-focused services and firearm restrictions.

German police have carried out raids across the country after bomb threats were called in against schools and other public spaces. Meanwhile, the German economy has seen little movement in the past three months.

Below, you can review a roundup of news from Germany on 25th November, 2025: 

The Hamburg Regional Court has ordered 10 activists from the climate action group Last Generation to pay a sum of over €400,000 (roughly $463,208) to an airline, over their 2023 protest which briefly blocked Hamburg Airport.

Four women and six men are involved in the incident, where they cut through a fence at the airport on July 13, 2023. Four of them then glued themselves near the runways.

Eurowings, a subsidy of German flag-carrier Lufthansa, filed the lawsuit.

The verdict was announced on Tuesday and can be appealed.

If the defendants block an airport again, they can be detained for up to six months.

Berlin will name the square in front of the state parliament after Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer, who died in May at the age of 103, according to the DPA news agency.

Friedländer, an honorary citizen of Berlin, will be commemorated at the entrance to the Berlin House of Representatives.

Parliament President Cornelia Seibeld and Governing Mayor Kai Wegner have scheduled a press conference for Wednesday morning to announce the naming, DPA reported. Also attending will be Stefanie Remlinger, the mayor of Berlin-Mitte, where the parliament building is located.

Federal Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil unveiled a special commemorative stamp honoring Friedländer on Tuesday, joined by representatives of the Jewish community and local students.

Friedländer, born in 1921 to a Jewish family, survived deportation to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. After liberation, she emigrated to the United States with her husband.

She returned to Berlin at age 88 and became a prominent eyewitness to the Holocaust, sharing her story in schools and public events. Her message — ""Be human"" — became her signature appeal. She was laid to rest at the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Weissensee.

Late passengers twice ran onto the tarmac at Cologne/Bonn Airport last week, federal police revealed on Tuesday.

Three British nationals heading back to the United Kingdom opened an emergency exit door on Saturday, setting off an alarm before being stopped by security staff.

The day before, two Romanian passengers broke the glass on an emergency switch to force open a door after missing boarding for their flight to Bucharest. The men, aged 28 and 47, ran onto the apron but were detained by an airport security employee until federal police arrived. Criminal proceedings for trespassing have been launched against them.

The three British travelers have not yet been charged. An airport spokesman said unauthorized use of emergency exits is strictly prohibited, adding that the airport is considering legal action.

None of the passengers involved were allowed to board their flights.

A police spokesman said the fact that the two breaches happened on consecutive days was ""undoubtedly striking.""

A court in Poland was incorrect in a decision not to recognize a marriage between two Polish citizens in Germany, the European Court of Justice has ruled.

The Polish court did not recognize the German marriage as Polish law prohibits same-sex unions.

Read more about the story here.

Cross country skier Victoria Carl, part of Germany's gold medal-winning team in the last Winter Olympics in Beijing, has given up on participating in February's Games in Italy after failing a doping test earlier in the year. 

It's still not clear exactly what sanction Carl will face, but with just three months left until the Olympics and after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rejected a proposed compromise between Carl and Germany's NADA anti-doping agency, the 30-year-old said she assumed she would at least miss that event and the upcoming winter season. 

""It is still difficult for me to accept that an oversight and a mistaken medical treatment is now leading to the collapse of my Olympic dream,"" Carl said. 

Carl failed a urine test in April of this year, with the case becoming public knowledge in the summer. 

She tested positive for clenbuterol, a medication used for respiratory problems like asthma that has regulatory approval in Europe but not in the US. It's a banned substance in sports because of perceived muscle-building and fat-burning qualities in higher doses. 

""I was sick, I had powerful coughing fits and took the medication on doctor's instructions. I made everything public, I was not aware that it contained a prohibited substance,"" Carl said. 

Carl won gold with compatriot Katharina Henning in 2022 in the team cross country skiing, and also was part of the four-woman relay team that took silver. 

German cross country ski coach Peter Schlickenrieder said it was ""obviously bitter"" when an athlete's goal for which they had ""worked tirelessly over decades"" fell apart in this way. He had already said last month that he feared the 2030 Olympics, by which point Carl would be 34 years old, would be a more realistic goal for her to compete again.

A court officer was killed while doing his work in Bexbach in the western state of Saarland early on Tuesday, the state Justice Ministry announced. 

The ministry did not immediately publish details of what happened, only saying that the 58-year-old man had been violently killed while on duty and pointing to ongoing investigations. 

The prosecution service in Saarbrücken also did not immediately comment further. 

Saarland's state premier, Anke Rehlinger, said she was deeply moved by ""this terrible news."" 

""As far as the details of the crime are concerned, everything necessary and required will be done to clarify the matter thoroughly and swiftly. Further information will be provided to you in due course,"" Rehlinger told reporters.

Saarland's Justice Minister Petra Berg described the man — who worked in a role akin to a bailiff or marshal, to use British and American terminology — as a ""highly valued colleague"" in the state's legal system.

The trial of seven alleged left-wing extremists, accused of aggravated assault and in some cases attempted murder committed in Germany and in Hungary, opened in the eastern German city of Dresden on Tuesday. 

They're accused of being part of a subset of the ""Antifa Ost"" extremist group, which was  recently designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US, that called itself the ""Hammerbande"" or ""Hammer Gang."" 

Six men and one woman, aged between 28 and 49, are in court, accused of membership in or support of a criminal group. 

Chief prosecutor Alexandra Geilhorn said while reading out the charges that they were ""methodical and organized"" in seeking out people they deemed to be right-wing extremists and attacking them. They often used hammers. In some cases, those attacked sustained severe injuries.

The prosecution alleges that the group was formed by late 2017 or early 2018 at the latest, and that members were involved in eight attacks in Germany between 2018 and 2023 and several more in Hungary in 2023.

The attacks in Hungary targeted participants in the far-right ""Day of Honor"" demonstration marking the failed February 1945 efforts of Nazi German and Hungarian troops to break the Soviet Red Army siege of Budapest in the latter stages of World War II.

According to the Federal Prosecutor's Office, in some cases the defendants had at least ""accepted"" without remorse that the death of those attacked was a possibility.

Supporters of the accused gathered both inside and outside the Dresden Upper District Court on Tuesday, with cries like ""Free all Antifas"" audible in the chamber.

Court dates for the trial are currently scheduled through April of 2027. It's the second large prosecution of alleged Hammerbande members in recent years. Lina E. and three co-defendants were convicted in 2023.

A man given a 9-year juvenile prison sentence last March for a 2022 homicide has been exonerated on appeal at the Traunstein District Court in Bavaria.

Presiding judge Heike Will spoke of an ""unexpectedly fast end to proceedings"" on Tuesday, ruling there was insufficient evidence to convict the defendant of killing a female medical student identified as Hanna.

This followed a psychologist declaring that the prosecution's star witness, an older inmate who had testified that the defendant, identified as Sebastian T., had admitted during a game of cards to killing Hanna, had not given credible testimony in the initial trial.

Germany's highest federal court for such matters had declared a mistrial and called for a renewed hearing in Bavaria in response to this development in September.

The prosecution also recommended the man's release, though it still believes that Hanna's death was homicide. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Sebastian T.'s innocence had again been demonstrated, after he had denied the murder at all stages of the trial.

The young woman Hanna's body was found in the River Prien on October 3, 2022, after attending a disco in Aschau in the Bavarian Alps known as the ""Eiskeller"" or ""Ice Cellar."" 

The defense argued accidental death was most likely, and that the wounds to her head and upper body were probably sustained as she was dragged several kilometers by the river's current.

The defendant, now aged 23, had already been released from custody prior to the retrial. He had been convicted in March 2024. The court in Traunstein ordered that he be compensated for the 31 months spent in prison. 

German authorities searched properties across four states as they investigated a case concerning hundreds of emails threatening bomb attacks against schools, train stations and other public spaces.

The raids in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the northern state of Lower Saxony, and the central states of Saxony-Anhalt and Hesse, targeted four individuals, including two juveniles, police and prosecutors said.

The suspects are accused of ""being responsible for hundreds of threatening emails with fake nationwide bomb threats against schools, central railway stations, shopping centers and other urban and public facilities.""

According to federal prosecutors, the aim of the emails was to ""disturb the public peace by threatening to commit criminal offenses... to trigger the greatest possible number of police operations and to create the greatest possible uncertainty among the population."" 

The German economy stagnated in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the previous three months, data from the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis) showed Tuesday.

The data was consistent with an initial estimate. 

""Economic activity was hampered in the third quarter by weak exports, while investments increased slightly,"" Destatis President Ruth Brand said in a statement.

The German economy, as well as the broader euro zone economy, has been struggling, with quarterly GDP figures having been sluggish, and the country having recorded contractions in both 2023 and 2024.

Experts say the US tariff shock and increased competition with China make things difficult for an export-oriented economy like Germany.

In the third quarter of this year, the European Union and the US signed a tariff agreement.

A German television show for children about life in the former East Germany clinched an International Emmy in New York on Monday evening.

The six-part series, which is partly animated, titled ""On Fritzi's Trail - What Was it like in the GDR"" won in the ""Kids: Factual & Entertainment"" category.

The German title is ""Auf Fritzis Spuren - Wie war das so in der DDR?"" and the show is about life in East Germany shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.

In his acceptance speech, writer and producer Ralf Kukula said he still remembered the final days of East Germany, saying: ""36 years later, I'm standing here and I'm thinking it is absolutely crazy.""

The TV show beat competitors from Brazil, UK and South Africa. The International Emmy is a US award that celebrates the best in global television.

 

There are many events in Berlin today, ranging from forums with discussions on the war in Ukraine and the situation in Syria to forums with a focus on the German economy.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and the Development Minister Reem Alabali-Radovan are at theBerlin Foreign Policy Forum this morning.

The UN rights chief Volker Turk is also set for a discussion at the forum, and DW is present, too. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is back from a business summit in Angola and is set to speak at a major annual conference this afternoon in Berlin.

The conference, called German Employers' Day, brings together discussions on trends in the economy.

Merz then has to leave quickly because he is set to join a ""Coalition of the Willing"" conference call that is scheduled for this afternoon. 

The German Federal Statistics Office confirmed that third-quarter gross domestic product remained unchanged compared with the previous quarter.

Plus, it's a busy day in Berlin, with many events, like the Berlin Foreign Policy Forum and German Employers' Day.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","How the EU seeks to counter China in Africa","https://www.dw.com/en/eu-african-union-summit-angola-critical-minerals-security-belt-and-road-global-gateway-initiative/a-74888365","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:07:50 GMT","

European and African leaders held talks in Angola on raw materials, security and the Global Gateway initiative. How can the EU compete with China on the continent?

Maria Magdalena and her four children live in a wooden hut in a small settlement on the sandy soil of the Ilha do Cabo peninsula in Angola. From here, she can see cargo ships waiting in endless lines to enter the harbor in the country's capital, Luanda.

Angola is rich in raw materials, but the vast majority of the population lives in poverty.

Magdalena also has a view of the city's skyline but is not following the key summit in the capital's government district on the other side of the bay. It is hard enough for her to organize her daily life.

""I urgently need work. Without work, I cannot feed my children,"" she said.

In Luanda, the African Union (AU) and the European Union (EU) held their seventh summit under the theme ""promoting peace and prosperity through effective multilateralism."" Together, they represent 82 countries with a population of almost 2 billion people.

Pressure has never been this high. ""As we all know, uncertainty prevails on the international stage. The established norms of international geopolitics are being challenged,"" Mahmoud Youssouf, the chair of the AU Commission, said ahead of the conference in a statement. 

Russia is fighting a war in Europe, US President Donald Trump levies radical tariffs and breaks the rules of the World Trade Organization. China pushes aggressively into global markets. Conflicts in Africa are intensifying: a brutal war rages in Sudan, and jihadist extremism spreads across the Sahel region.

In addition, parts of Africa suffer greatly from climate change. ""Droughts destroy livelihoods. It's a dangerous mix. And people take dangerous routes across the Atlantic and the Mediterranean,"" German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated at the summit.

Before rushing to the conference hall, Merz attended an informal last-minute meeting of EU leaders. Even in Luanda, there are discussions on how to proceed in Russia's war against Ukraine.

For Merz and the other heads of state and government, this amounts to politics in crisis mode, while Africa and Europe seek to close ranks. In the summit's final declaration, they insist on a world order ""based on international law and effective multilateralism.""

The European Union is Africa's largest trading partner and investor. According to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, one-third of all African exports go to Europe.

Many African countries have critical raw materials that Europe needs for its energy transition and industry: rare earths, copper, cobalt and lithium. However, there is much competition, and Africa wants to avoid unilateral dependencies.

""The world does not consist of just one or two countries. We work with everyone who is open to us,"" said Angola's President Joao Lourenco, the current chair of the AU. ""We are open to the world.""

""We don't want to leave the continent to others,"" warned Merz, referring to China primarily. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has been investing in Africa's bridges, ports and roads. Even the brand-new airport in Luanda was built and financed by China as a prestige project. 

""China helped rebuild Angola after the civil war in 2002 with loans and infrastructure projects,"" Vandre Spellmeier of the delegation of the German Industry and Commerce in Angola (AHK Angola), told DW.

In his view, it is ""not too late for the European Union."" Angola is now trying to free itself from the crushing debt it owes China.

""This future African and European cooperation should emphasize the exchange of knowledge and skills that contribute to transforming African local economies,"" Hermine Sam, Program Coordinator South at the German Marshall Fund, told DW.

Otherwise, the old spiral remains, she said. ""Raw materials leave cheaply and return expensively processed.""

Olaf Wientzek, head of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation's multinational development dialogue in Brussels, also sees this as leverage. ""Strengthening local processing capacities, that's where Europe can score points against China,"" he told DW.

European procedures are often stricter and slower, he admits. ""But Europe wants to give the economy more participation than China.""

The Global Gateway Initiative is often viewed as the EU's response to China. The investment program supports infrastructure projects with EU financing and private investors.

One of Global Gateway's prestigious projects is being built in Angola: the Lobito Corridor, a railway line connecting the raw-material regions of Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia with the Atlantic coast. Businesses are to be established along the route, ranging from agriculture to logistics.

The EU is proud of this showcase project. ""While we connect Africa to global markets, we are also supporting trade within your continent. I think this is the best way for African companies to scale up and prepare for global competition,"" von der Leyen said.

Germany's Merz supported her statement. ""The European single market is a great success story and the largest peace project Europe has ever seen. And it is precisely against this backdrop that Germany has supported the Pan-African Free Trade Area from the outset,"" he said.

Yet there is considerable criticism. ""In its conception, Global Gateway was not developed in consultation with African stakeholders and overlooked African priorities,"" Hermine Sam told DW. She said the EU is frequently criticized for ""making big speeches but delivering little, especially compared to China.""

Africa is a particularly young continent: 40% of its population is under 15 years old. They need education, jobs, and housing. This is in stark contrast to Europe, where only 16% are under 15.

""The young African generation, which is creative, dynamic, and rapidly growing, is one of the greatest assets for our shared future,"" European Council President Antonio Costa stated.

But what remains after two days of the EU-AU summit in Luanda, which the government declared a public holiday in view of the many international guests? Magdalena, the mother of four, says she avoids politics. She is frying food on a small charcoal fire. She, too, has hopes for the future.

""I'm young. I really need work urgently.""

Donald Trump arrived in office as the dealmaker-in-chief.

He has delighted in choosing unconventional figures to lead negotiations in the belief that a background in the nitty-gritty of New York real estate is more useful than a career in international relations wonkery.

It meant Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law, were not constrained by decades of bloody stalemate in Gaza. Instead they confounded critics by delivering a ceasefire in the territory, even if it has not completely silenced the guns nor found much progress yet towards a longer term peace.

But Mr Witkoff's lack of experience may now have been badly exposed in the leak of an extraordinary phone call with a senior Kremlin official.

Who leaked it and why will have to wait for another day. (Although there are obvious suspects in a Russian administration that appears content to delay and prevaricate its way through peace talks while its bombs and drones fall on Ukrainian targets.)

And it is worth remembering that diplomacy is always best carried out far from the gaze of the media, where currying favour with thuggish leaders or making ugly promises with negotiators is the price of progress.

Even with those caveats, Mr Witkoff's apparent coaching of Yuri Ushakov, Vladimir Putin's top foreign policy aide, on how to handle Mr Trump and the stop-start peace process is deeply embarrassing.

He offers advice for Putin's call with the US president (ladle on the praise) and goes on to suggest that the Russian president propose a similar deal for Ukraine as the one that ended fighting in Gaza.

“I told the president that you – that the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal,” Mr Witkoff said, according to a recording of the conversation reviewed and transcribed by Bloomberg.

“That's my belief. I told the president I believe that.”

Was he just saying that for the benefit of Mr Ushakov? A bit of diplomatic buttering up? Or does he really think the country that launched an illegal invasion of Ukraine has always wanted a peace deal?

Perhaps most damning of all, he says that it might be a good idea for Putin to talk with Mr Trump ahead of a forthcoming White House meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president.

At the time, the American president's stance on Putin had been hardening.

But after that phone call on Oct 16, Mr Trump announced he would soon be meeting the Russian president in Budapest, a meeting that never happened. He also cooled on the idea of sending Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine.

A second call obtained by Bloomberg goes on to show how the Russian side sees an opportunity for mischief, passing along their positions to the Americans without actually committing to anything.

We don't know whether Mr Trump's special presidential envoy for peace missions was just as flattering when he spoke with Ukrainian officials. Or whether he offered similar help, advising them on how to stay in his boss's good graces or how to stay a step ahead of the Russians.

But the leak of his call with Putin's adviser throws progress in peace talks into doubt once again, and illustrates the limits of Mr Witkoff's understanding of Russia and its leaders.

It hints at the idea that he is too close to Moscow, and fails to understand the threat from Putin.

That it could have been leaked by the Russians, the Ukrainians, any number of European allies, or rivals in his own administration, only shows that Mr Witkoff's style of thinking outside the box may be running out of time.

The Not With My Dollars campaign takes aim at Amazon, Whole Foods, Dell, Microsoft, Home Depot, Spotify, and Target.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

A Gen Z-led advocacy group fighting for working-class priorities on Tuesday announced a boycott campaign targeting major corporations “that enable, profit from, or directly collaborate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the broader racist policies of the Trump administration.”

Beyond the Ballot launched “Not With My Dollars: ICE Out of My Wallet” as President Donald Trump's violent crackdown on immigrants in diverse communities across the United States continues and just days before Black Friday kicks off the winter holiday shopping season.

“We cannot out-organize a fascist administration while simultaneously bankrolling the companies profiting from its cruelty,” said Victor Rivera, the organization's executive director, in a statement. “Every dollar spent at a complicit corporation is a dollar funding the abduction and disappearance of our neighbors. It's time to make corporate complicity unprofitable, for good.”

The group is taking aim at e-commerce behemoth Amazon and its grocery subsidiary, Whole Foods; tech giants Dell and Microsoft; Home Depot; streaming platform Spotify; and retail chain Target. The boycott webpage explains the reason each is listed, actions shoppers should take, and the campaign's demands. In some cases, it also offers alternative companies.

Target is under fire for its “broad range of cooperation with the Trump administration's racist policies.” The campaign is calling on the company to not only publicly commit to refusing collaboration with ICE but also immediately reinstate its scrapped diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.

Spotify is on the list for airing ICE recruitment ads — a decision that also recently prompted a boycott call from the group Indivisible.

The campaign site calls out Home Depot because it has “repeatedly allowed ICE agents to patrol and detain workers and customers in its parking lots and stores, usually without presenting judicial warrants or establishing probable cause,” and demands an end to those practices.

The group is urging Microsoft to end its “$19.4 million contract with ICE to provide artificial intelligence capabilities and processing data.” The Dell section highlights that it has provided $18.8 million to “support the office of ICE's chief information officer through the purchase of Microsoft enterprise software licenses,” and similarly calls for terminating that contract with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Amazon section states:

REASON: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the digital backbone of ICE's machinery, selling the cloud power that helps track, target, and tear families apart.

ACTION: Stop shopping on Amazon where possible; cancel Prime subscriptions if feasible; push universities, unions, nonprofits, and campaigns to move off AWS when and where feasible, and to issue statements condemning Amazon's role in corporate-sponsored mass deportations.

DEMAND: End all ICE/DHS immigration enforcement contracts and data hosting that enable deportations; adopt a binding human-rights policy banning support for immigration policing.

ALTERNATIVES: Bookshop.org and local bookstores; direct-from-brand purchasing; cooperatives; independent retailers.

The site also stresses that “every dollar spent at Whole Foods directly strengthens Amazon, whose AWS platform is the digital backbone of ICE's machinery, powering the tools used to track, target, and tear families apart.”

While the campaign is beginning just before Black Friday, boycott organizers aim to ensure it will “not disappear” after this week.

“Unlike other consumer boycotts, Not With My Dollars is designed for long-term pressure and escalation,” Beyond the Ballot said. “To be removed from the boycott list, each targeted corporation must fulfill the specific demands outlined for its company. Anything less is not accountability, just more corporate PR.”

“If you bankroll a violent, unaccountable agency that terrorizes our communities, you will not do it with our money,” the group added. “Across the country, poor and working-class migrant families are facing a wave of state-sponsored abductions, violence, and political policing under the fascist Trump administration. Corporations that choose to partner with, advertise on, bankroll, or provide critical infrastructure to ICE are not neutral; they are complicit.”

Twenty-seven states in the US ban gender-affirming treatments for trans youth, including hormone therapy.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

A newly published study reveals that a certain kind of gender-affirming care for transgender kids and young adults likely lowers rates of suicidality among those populations. 

The study, published in the Journal of Pediatrics, examined 432 patients between the ages of 12 and 20 years old who received treatment at an unnamed Midwestern academic medical center. Patients who were set to receive gender-affirming care filled out Ask Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ) surveys prior to receiving hormone therapy (HT) treatment, then repeated the questionnaire at future visits. 

Upon examining the results, the study found that suicidality among these patients “significantly declined from pretreatment to post-treatment,” and was “consistent across sex assigned at birth, age at start of therapy, and treatment duration.”

The study included all youth who initiated hormone treatment therapy during the years 2017 to 2024 at the medical center in question. The average follow-up to the surveys the patients took occurred around two years after their treatment began, with some patients providing feedback up to five years after they started. 

Suicidality scores among the patients who provided responses dropped by over 67 percent, the study discovered. What's more, of the hundreds of patients who started hormone therapy, only seven discontinued their treatment, with four saying they had a “shift in gender identity” (while still identifying as gender diverse), and one stopping out of concerns over “hair loss.” Two stopped for unknown reasons. 

The study concluded:

HT was associated with clinically meaningful reductions in suicidality over time, extending prior findings with a larger sample and longer follow-up. These study findings provide clinical evidence supporting the mental health benefits of timely access to HT in this population.

In response to the study, trans rights journalist Erin Reed wrote, “gender-affirming care saves lives.”

Such care “remains one of the most effective interventions available for transgender youth who need it,” Reed added. 

Despite multiple studies coming to the same conclusion — that gender-affirming care for trans youth is highly beneficial — 27 states across the country have banned the practice, usually by citing unfounded fears regarding potential regret, errant concerns about a supposed “social contagion,” or misinformation regarding the safety of treatment methods. 

The study comes as the Trump administration appears to be readying itself to attempt to ban youth-based gender-affirming care across the entirety of the U.S.

Last week, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) updated a questionable study it published in May that claimed such care caused children more harm than good.

The report did not include authorship when it was first released. The new version includes the authors' names, which critics have pointed out include a hodge-podge of anti-LGBTQ voices — including one “expert” who is the founder of a noted hate group. 

Meredithe McNamara, an adolescent medicine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine, described that report's authors as “engineers of a cottage industry that solely exists to dismantle health care for a vulnerable group of people.”

“Transgender identity is real, transgender people of all ages thrive when they have access to the care they need, and politics needs to get out of medicine,” McNamara added in her criticism of the HHS report.

Massachusetts is now one of only two states that don't use specialized courts to mandate forced psychiatric treatment.

On November 18, 2025, Massachusetts advocates gathered for hours at the State House as they have, year after year, to beat back yet another legislative proposal for involuntary outpatient commitment, or IOC. Involuntary outpatient commitment laws create a layer of specialized courts that use the so-called “Black Robe Effect,” which uses a judge's authority to compel people with diagnoses of “severe mental illness” to accept mental health and/or substance use intervention against their will — in the form of psychotropic medication, drug testing, and invasive and time-consuming requirements.

While the specifics vary state by state, there are consequences for noncompliance. If the person does not follow their court-ordered treatment plan, they could be snatched by the cops, transported to a locked psychiatric facility for evaluation, and subject to ongoing state surveillance. It's also not entirely clear where the offramp lies, as treatment orders can theoretically be renewed ad infinitum at a judge's discretion.

Starting in 1999 in New York, the conservative think tank Treatment Advocacy Center rebranded involuntary outpatient commitment and began using the language of “assisted outpatient treatment (AOT),” a euphemized term erasing any reference to coercion. Along with the Treatment Advocacy Center, a coalition of police, psychiatrists, social workers, and family caregivers have pushed the laws through in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Massachusetts and Connecticut remain the only holdouts. Fern Fairchild, director of Massachusetts' Wild Ivy Social Justice Network, part of the Wildflower Alliance, who has organized against forced treatment in both states, told Truthout that she attributes the lack of such laws in those two states, in large part, to “very strong survivors' movements” aligned with disability rights and legal advocates.

As Bowen Cho wrote in a 2024 report for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, entitled Equity for Whom? How Private Equity and the Punishment Bureaucracy Exploit Disabled People, “Carceral industries and their logics shapeshift and expand in response to public attention, often replacing one egregious system for another and calling it reform.”

Involuntary outpatient commitment is a perfect example of this shapeshifting. In Massachusetts, the law's framing has been “forcewashed” — in other words, the carceral logic of it has been obscured beneath a language of care. The 2017-2018 version, entitled “An act establishing court ordered mental health assisted outpatient treatment” was further euphemized in 2021-2022 to refer to “assisted outpatient therapy,” with no mention of court orders. H.1801/S.1115, the bills currently before the Massachusetts legislature, now refer simply to a “continuum of care for severe mental illness,” and use the language of “critical community mental health services,” without mentioning “assisted outpatient treatment.”

“The mainstream view of AOT is generally that this mechanism is a ‘less restrictive' alternative to inpatient hospitalization and means of connecting folks to care, who may be unhoused or ‘abandoned to the streets,'” Dr. Nev Jones, associate professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Pittsburgh, told Truthout via email. Jones is actively studying the implementation and impacts of AOT across multiple U.S. states.

The reality is often quite different from the hype. “Once on AOT orders, many individuals will remain unhoused if that's where they've started — very few states guarantee housing to individuals on AOT,” Jones wrote.

A “Systemically Racist” Law

Involuntary outpatient commitment has often been likened to probation, and as Fairchild testified, is “systemically racist.” Clinicians diagnose Black people with schizophrenia, psychosis spectrum disorders, and other “severe mental illnesses” that make them eligible for coercive programs like involuntary outpatient commitment in far greater numbers than their white counterparts. This injustice persists due to clinicians' documented racial bias and the white supremacist, colonial roots of the psychiatric profession itself.

Everywhere the involuntary outpatient commitment program has been implemented and studied, Black and Brown people are overrepresented. As legal scholar Victoria Rodríguez-Roldán wrote of the racially disparate outcomes of New York State's outpatient commitment law, “the conclusion that any overrepresentation of minorities in the AOT program is harmful is inescapable.”

Fairchild's testimony noted that involuntary outpatient commitment “would also likely impact other communities, such as trans people and immigrants who are also disproportionately diagnosed and are being targeted right now by the Trump administration.”

The 2025-2026 bill text further violates privacy and autonomy by redefining who can initiate a petition for court-ordered psychiatric intervention — expanding beyond the already massive net of spouses, parents and relatives, intimate partners, and legal guardians, to include “any responsible adult or individual partner in a substantive relationship.” Fairchild noted in her written testimony that this wide net could easily be misused “in furtherance of domestic abuse, giving these individuals another level of power to wield over victims.”

In the new bill, parole and probation officers are also granted the power to petition for court-ordered treatment. “The probation and parole systems are particularly punitive, regularly reincarcerating people for minor violations,” Fairchild testified. “Involving these systems and actors within them in IOC order petitions would likely result in even more psychiatric incarcerations resulting from violations of the conditions set forth in an IOC order.”

Eligibility criteria have also been expanded, broadening the justification for psychiatric force. This bill expands the definition of “gravely disabled,” a “vague term that could apply to anyone a mental health provider believes is not taking adequate care of themselves, including people who are unhoused,” according to written testimony by the Mental Health Legal Advisors Committee. Grave disability now includes people who “demonstrate psychosis” — and again, given the demonstrated racial bias in such assessments, this designation is deeply problematic.

Advocates noted yet another disturbing new criterion: “unlikely to voluntarily participate in outpatient treatment.” This allows the court to mandate treatment based on a prediction that people will not seek services on their own, and an assumption that they are incapable of making informed decisions. “The most common factor for this type of determination,” Fairchild wrote in her testimony, “Is that the person disagrees with the facility or provider's recommendations. This gives facilities more pathways to override a person's autonomy … where they disagree with their provider and do not consent to treatment.”

In most states, individuals facing an assisted outpatient treatment order have no right to a patient advocate and no right to a state-sponsored second opinion.

“Most people think AOT follows from a robust legal (court) process — like what many of us have seen in courtroom dramas,” Jones wrote. “Although this varies by state, there are places in which court hearings occur less than 10 percent of time, and/or otherwise amount to brief, six-to-ten minute ‘rubber stamping' opportunities. In most states, individuals facing an AOT order have no right to a patient advocate and no right to a state-sponsored second opinion (psychiatrist or other evaluator of their choosing). This is most definitely not what most of us have in mind when we think about ‘procedural due process.'”  

Often missing from the conversation are the voices of people currently or formerly on these treatment orders. As journalist Rob Wipond reported, a 2023 Treatment Advocacy Center satisfaction survey is deeply biased, with clinicians cherry-picking respondents. Michael Simonson's 2019 survey of 28 people impacted by treatment orders depicts a very different, mostly negative, picture of the experience.

As a researcher, Jones has spoken to many recipients of the treatment orders, as well as the judges and clinicians involved in implementing them. “Direct stories of what clients/service users are put through are deeply disturbing,” she wrote. “The level of neglect and abandonment of some on AOT orders can be gut-wrenching to hear.”

“While of course there are kind and thoughtful providers and staff,” she added, “Far too many individuals I've met invoke some of the worst, most harmful stereotypes and slurs I've ever come across. To see this level of prejudice normalized to this degree, is actually pretty terrifying. And it's only a short stone's throw … to Brian Kilmeade's public advocacy for ‘lethal injections,'” referring to the disturbing comments made by the Fox News host who called on the state to execute unhoused people. “We're not just talking about individual dehumanization, but dehumanization of an already ultra-marginalized group on a systems level.”

A Persistent Mischaracterization of the Problem

Pro-force advocates at the November 18, 2025, hearing, largely family caregivers, told horrific stories of trying to get timely and quality care for their adult children in Massachusetts' labyrinthine systems of punishment, confinement, and abandonment. They shared devastating testimony of their loved ones' encounters with police; of their children repeatedly rotating between psych wards, prisons, and the streets; and of loved ones who took their own lives.

At least two of the parents who testified noted that they already had access to every possible lever of state power, including Rogers guardianships, to compel their loved ones to follow prescribed treatment, yet they had failed to force their adult children to take medication.

Few ever bother to ask why individuals “go off their meds.” U.K. psychologist Dr. John Read, who has researched this question in-depth, has written in the past that respondents cite a lack of informed consent as well as an average of 11 adverse effects of antipsychotics and concerns with long-term health outcomes (well-founded, as these drugs can induce fatal cardiac events and metabolic disorders). Western biopsychiatry has produced dismal outcomes, including early mortality, for people with “severe mental illness” labels.

Family caregivers and medical authorities explain away any resistance to treatment using the controversial concept of “anosognosia,” a term inappropriately borrowed from neurology and often used interchangeably with “lack of insight,” to describe people who reject their diagnosis and medication or other treatments. While people can and do enter into various states, or say and do things that get labeled by systems and society as “lack of insight,” applying force and coercion in such circumstances only serves to increase mistrust and drive individuals further away from care, as many individuals testified at the hearing.

There are many paths beyond the extremes of force and abandonment to support people who would otherwise be eligible for coercive programs like involuntary outpatient commitment. Abolitionist organizers have long called for anti-carceral community crisis supports and providing the kind of care that people want, while ensuring that everyone's needs for food, shelter, meaning, and human connection are met. Permanent supportive housing programs for disabled people, like Housing First, have long been a target of the right, and are on Trump's chopping block.

Liberatory community supports already exist in Massachusetts, like Wildflower Alliance's peer respites, a nonclinical, anti-carceral alternative to emergency rooms and locked facilities. A bill for expanding their availability in the state, including respites for BIPOC and LGBTQ+ people, is also currently before the legislature. Enduring Connections, a new program, also proposes to serve as an alternative to forced intervention, centering consistent, patient outreach led by peer workers. Psychiatric advance directives, health care proxies, self-directed care, and supported decision-making all allow people to exercise their legal capacity. There is no shortage of ideas, just a lack of political will to implement them.

“I wonder what's possible if we stopped putting so much energy into going back and forth over this year after year, and truly focused on innovative, trust-building community supports,” testified Sera Davidow, co-founder of the newly formed Wildflower Roots and a longtime activist who has written and spoken extensively on involuntary outpatient commitment. “I hope we get to find out.”

 America Has the Most to Lose From Restarting Nuclear Testing

 Siegfried Hecker

Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump rekindled a decades-old debate about nuclear testing. “Because of other countries testing programs,” he wrote on social media, “I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis.”

The United States has not tested a nuclear weapon since September 23, 1992. Energy Secretary Chris Wright quickly tried to walk back Trump's post, explaining on Fox News that the president had meant testing nuclear delivery systems, not explosives. But Trump doubled down on his original meaning, telling 60 Minutes that he ordered resumption of nuclear testing in response to alleged secret underground nuclear detonations by China and Russia. “They test way underground where people don't know what's happening with the test,” he said.

Intelligence officials in both the first Trump and Biden administrations questioned whether U.S. adversaries, especially China and Russia, are testing nuclear weapons clandestinely. Both the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 and Trump's former national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, have called for resuming testing to ensure the United States' aging nuclear arsenal is safe, effective, and reliable. The United States has roughly 3,700 nuclear weapons, of which about 1,770 are believed to be deployed militarily—but all these weapons were produced and tested before the United States conducted its last test in 1992.

I am deeply familiar with this debate. When I first arrived at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in New Mexico as a summer graduate student in 1965, the United States had conducted more than 400 nuclear tests, about half in the atmosphere and the rest underground. Its nuclear arsenal consisted of some 30,000 weapons. I served as director of the laboratory from 1986 through 1997 during the collapse of the Soviet Union, which resulted in drastic reductions of Russian and American nuclear arsenals, a nuclear testing moratorium in 1992, and a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty in 1996.

Now, some 33 years after the last American nuclear test, the aging nuclear arsenal presents increasing challenges to maintain its safety, effectiveness, and reliability. But a return to testing at this time would likely benefit U.S. adversaries more than it would the United States. Worse still, it might rekindle an even greater and broader arms race than in the first few decades of the Cold War.

Nuclear testing was deemed essential in the 1950s as the Soviet Union and the United States raced toward hydrogen bombs and missile-deliverable nuclear weapons. By the late 1950s, atmospheric explosions had inflicted a heavy health and environmental toll on the world with radioactive fallout. The consequences were even more dramatic in the northern Marshall Islands, where the United States was conducting most of its tests. Global public opposition led to a testing moratorium from 1958 to 1961 by the three nuclear weapons states at that time: the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

During the moratorium, scientists at the Los Alamos lab using computer models discovered potential major safety concerns. They found that some of the nuclear weapons were not “one-point safe.” That is, an accident rather than intentional arming might trigger a nuclear explosion. They devised an ingenious scheme of very low-yield tests to find out. President Dwight Eisenhower was informed because of the sensitivity of potential abrogation of the test moratorium, and he authorized what were called “hydronuclear experiments” to be conducted unannounced, underground at Los Alamos. The nuclear yields from these experiments were typically much less than that generated by one pound of TNT, not tons or kilotons.

Thirty-five such experiments were conducted at Los Alamos and a smaller number at the Nevada Test Site by the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. The experiments ended up being critical to making safety adjustments to Los Alamos systems. In 1966, for instance, a B-52 bomber carrying nuclear weapons crashed over Palomares, Spain. Had those weapons not been modified because of the hydronuclear program, the crash would likely have resulted in a significant nuclear explosion instead of setting off only the chemical explosives, which caused plutonium dispersal along the beaches.

Nuclear tests came roaring back in September 1961, when the Soviets shocked the world and abrogated the first testing moratorium. The United States was quick to respond—with ten tests later that year and with a mind-boggling 98 tests in 1962, with nearly half in the atmosphere. As concerns about nuclear fallout intensified, however, and public pressure again mounted, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, U.S. President John F. Kennedy, and British Prime Minister Harold McMillan agreed to limit nuclear testing to underground explosions in the Limited Test Ban Treaty signed in 1963. The last atmospheric tests by the three were in 1962. France and China, which joined the nuclear club around that time, conducted their last atmospheric tests in 1974 and 1980, respectively.

Despite the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Soviet Union and the United States were still in an intense arms race. The Soviets were playing catch-up, adding more than 10,000 weapons every ten years (finally topping out at 41,000 by the end of the 1980s). The United States' arsenal had peaked at 31,000 in 1967 and was slowly decreasing, but at the same time, the military was substantially increasing missile accuracy and survivability. The Cold War lingered on and nuclear testing, now underground, was still essential to both. In the ten years following the new treaty, the United States conducted nearly 400 underground tests and the Soviet Union about 170. Public opposition was muted because there were essentially no visible signatures of testing and the detrimental effects were dramatically less.

Most nonnuclear weapons states, however, still called for a complete test ban. The Soviets and Americans could only agree on limiting the size of underground tests to less than 150 kilotons with the Threshold Test Ban Treaty signed in 1974. The 150-kiloton limit was seen as a balanced compromise between politically demonstrating some nuclear restraint while maintaining the ability to modernize nuclear arsenals. It was initially viewed as being verifiable, yet it took 16 years for the two countries to ratify the TTBT because each side suspected the other of cheating. In the meantime, the two countries conducted another roughly 300 nuclear tests each.

The wheels were finally set in motion to ratify the TTBT once Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and U.S. President Ronald Reagan met in their historic October 1986 summit in Reykjavik. Although the two men fell short of their goal—total elimination of nuclear weapons—the summit led to weapons scientists being asked to develop adequate verification techniques so that each side could get the assurances it needed to ratify the treaty.

To provide this assurance, we hosted Soviet scientists at the Nevada Test Site for months. The Soviet scientists made onsite measurements during the detonation of one of our nuclear devices in August 1988. Nongovernmental U.S. scientists, meanwhile, measured seismic signals remotely to compare. The sequence was then reversed when our nuclear scientists made onsite measurements of a Soviet device detonated at Semipalatinsk Test Site one month later. These measurements—and adroit negotiations—led to strong support for the treaty from both governments. In the U.S. Senate, it passed by a remarkable 98 to 0 vote in 1990.

With the demise of the Soviet Union in December 1991, advocates in the United States pressed for a comprehensive test ban. The bipartisan Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell amendment to the 1993 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act allowed for a maximum of 15 nuclear tests to be conducted over the next four years before the United States would sign a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) with other nuclear-armed countries. President George H. W. Bush signed the act reluctantly in October 1992; although he believed nuclear testing was important for national security, the amendment was cleverly attached to a spending bill that he greatly favored.

Upon assuming office just three months later, President Bill Clinton made a comprehensive nuclear test ban a top priority. There was a compelling logic to allow Los Alamos and other Department of Energy weapons laboratories to conduct an additional last few tests to prepare for a world in which no tests would be allowed, but Clinton chose to stop testing immediately to demonstrate his commitment to a comprehensive test ban.

During the next few years, Clinton administration officials led the laboratories and the military in intense discussions about the advisability of such a drastic change to the country's nuclear stockpile preparedness. For example, in June 1995, the commander of the Strategic Command, who had responsibility for the United States' nuclear forces, brought the lab leaders and officials from the Departments of Energy and Defense to Omaha for a “Stockpile Confidence Conference.” The labs explained what could be accomplished with testing limits of ten kilotons, one kiloton, and less.

Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary made it clear that kiloton yields were not in the cards. Based on the Los Alamos experience of the value of very low-test limits during the 1958–61 test moratorium, I made the case for the importance of retaining the right to do such hydronuclear experiments—that is, yield limits of pounds or less. Although the technical specialists differed on the value of such experiments, it did not really matter: for O'Leary and Clinton, there was a political imperative to get to zero.



Before Clinton made his final decision on the treaty, he instructed the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, to ask the weapons lab directors if they would support a zero-yield test ban treaty. I remember how, in July 1995, Shalikashvili looked me directly in the eyes in his Pentagon office and asked if he would have to tell Clinton that testing was needed to keep our nuclear weapons safe and reliable. I told him that the nuclear stockpile was safe and reliable—but he would need to ask that question again in the coming years.

As a result of that meeting, the three lab directors were required to certify the nuclear stockpile annually in writing to the secretaries of defense and energy, who would inform the president, together with a letter by the commander of U.S. Strategic Command. Clinton announced a zero-yield test ban on August 11, 1995. The laboratories were thus limited to subcritical experiments, which would not generate a sustained nuclear reaction. Hydronuclear experiments would not be allowed.

This represented a dramatic change for the laboratories and significant risk for the nation's nuclear arsenal preparedness. The Clinton administration addressed concerns expressed by the laboratory directors and the military by issuing six safeguards that defined the conditions under which the United States would enter into the CTBT. At the top was “the conduct of a science-based stockpile stewardship program to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the active stockpile.” Victor Reis, Department of Energy assistant secretary for defense programs, led this effort, and the goal was for the laboratories to develop a better understanding of the materials used and the processes involved during the entire life cycle of a nuclear weapon—up to and including detonation—in the absence of nuclear testing.

Somewhat paradoxically, with nuclear testing we were able to produce a reliable stockpile without fully understanding the science. In other words, nuclear tests compensated for the lack of understanding the complex scientific fundamentals of nuclear explosions. Gaining such understanding, it was hoped, would allow the labs and the military to keep the nuclear stockpile safe, secure, and reliable without nuclear testing.

The safeguards also included maintenance of nuclear laboratories, nuclear test readiness, programs to improve treaty monitoring capabilities and operations, and commitments in the areas of intelligence gathering and analysis. The final safeguard specified the circumstances under which the president would be prepared, in consultation with Congress, to conduct the necessary testing if the safety or reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified.

On September 24, 1996, the United States joined 70 other countries, including China, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, in signing the CTBT. As Clinton stated at the time, “This treaty is the longest-sought, hardest-fought prize in the history of arms control. Its message is unmistakable: the era of nuclear explosive testing is over.”

I was not as enthusiastic as the president about the CTBT. I viewed moving from the testing to the no-test era as an enormous challenge that required steadfast government commitment and the ability to continue to attract the best and the brightest to U.S. laboratories. Moreover, by bypassing the final tests that had been laid out in 1992, the United States missed the chance to examine concerns about age degradation of its weapons. China and France, by contrast, each conducted at least six nuclear tests before signing the CTBT. Consequently, both were better prepared for a test ban than the United States was. I was encouraged, however, by Reis's valiant effort to develop a well-funded Stockpile Stewardship Management Program (SSMP). It was a chance to get the science right to help alleviate the loss of nuclear testing.

The Clinton administration faced substantial hurdles to ratify the CTBT. When Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, who was vehemently opposed to ratifying the CTBT, asked me and the other lab directors if the program would give us the same confidence as was achieved by nuclear testing, I replied: “I believe that the SSMP as currently configured and fully funded provides the best approach to keeping the confidence level in our nuclear stockpile as high as possible for the foreseeable future. . . . A robust nuclear testing program would undoubtedly increase our confidence. However, our long-term confidence in the stockpile would suffer if we substituted a program consisting of an occasional nuclear test for a robust stewardship program.”

In his reply to Kyl, Bruce Tater, the director of the Lawrence Livermore lab, also emphasized that a strong stockpile stewardship program is “necessary to underwrite confidence” in the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile in an era without nuclear explosive testing.

That is where I believe we still stand today. Although the Senate failed by a large margin to ratify the CTBT in 1999, the United States has been committed to a voluntary testing moratorium and has not tested weapons at any yield. The stewardship program, meanwhile, has been funded generously. The laboratories have continued to attract outstanding scientists and engineers. And with new facilities, innovative nonnuclear experiments, and greatly improved analytical and computational tools, the United States has gained a better understanding of the materials and processes in nuclear weapons.

Nuclear testing provided a robust shortcut. With the stockpile stewardship program, the United States has greatly increased its knowledge, leading to an improved understanding but not necessarily improved confidence. Nevertheless, the directors of the laboratories have continued to certify the stockpile every year since I signed the first two letters for the Los Alamos lab in 1996 and 1997.

The most problematic concern in the stockpile today is the plutonium present in the cores, or pits, of the triggers of modern, two-stage thermonuclear weapons. Plutonium is used in nuclear weapons because of its nuclear characteristics, but its electronic structure makes it the most complex element in the periodic table and an engineering nightmare.

Although numerous materials in weapons present significant physics and engineering challenges, most can be addressed with nonnuclear tests. For plutonium, the United States has historically relied on nuclear testing to compensate for a lack of fundamental understanding. In the past three decades without testing, the United States has resorted to extending the lifetimes of existing pits or has tried to remanufacture them to previous specifications. Both have turned out to be monumental challenges.

Extending the life of existing pits with confidence is difficult because of how plutonium degrades. Plutonium ages not only from the outside in (like the oxidation and rusting of many metals) but also from the inside out. It radioactively decays by alpha-particle emission, and the result is that it transmutes into other elements such as americium, uranium, and neptunium, and it also generates helium during the decay. The helium atoms are stored in the plutonium metal structure, with some significant fraction forming microscopic bubbles. Moreover, the alpha decay of plutonium sends energetic uranium atoms crashing through the plutonium metal, greatly disrupting the regularity of plutonium's crystal structure, changing its properties.



These challenges received little scientific attention during the testing days, and few aged nuclear devices were tested because the weapon systems were regularly replaced with new designs and, hence, new plutonium pits. The aging characteristics are now under intense study at the weapons labs, but without testing, the implosion characteristics are difficult to assess and the lifetimes are uncertain.

Until 1989, new plutonium pits were produced in the Rocky Flats nuclear facility near Denver, Colorado. But that facility shut down permanently because of alleged environmental violations, and every attempt to provide the nation with an adequate pit production facility since has run into political opposition or major time delays and cost overruns. Construction of a new pit production facility is now underway at the Savannah River nuclear site in South Carolina. The plutonium R & D facility at Los Alamos, meanwhile, was reconfigured to make the very few new pits that have been produced since 1989.

A fundamental challenge is that the United States does not know what level of pit manufacturing is necessary to maintain its nuclear deterrent because scientists do not know what the acceptable lifetimes are for existing plutonium pits that need to be replaced or if the U.S. government may choose to build different weapons to maintain its deterrent. In any case, the United States needs a fully functioning, resilient nuclear weapons production complex, especially for plutonium pit production in addition to a robust stewardship program.

Whereas resumption of full-scale nuclear testing would allow the United States to answer some pressing questions about the fitness of its stockpile, it would provide even greater benefit to China and Russia. When Trump posted on social media that China and Russia were already testing nuclear weapons, it is likely he was referring to hydronuclear experiments with ultralow yields, which are not detectable without an onsite presence. (If China or Russia were doing nuclear tests in the multikiloton range, it would almost certainly be detected by the elaborate international test-monitoring system established by the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization.)

Neither China nor Russia likely sees these experiments as violating the CTBT. Russia ratified the CTBT in 2000 but revoked ratification in November 2023. China has signed the treaty but is believed to be waiting for the United States to ratify it first. But like the United States, China and Russia claim compliance with the treaty in line with the international legal principle that once a country signs a treaty (even if it fails to ratify it) it is not supposed to defeat the “object and purpose” of the treaty.

Russia and China, however, likely interpret the Clinton administration's insistence on a zero-yield treaty differently than the United States has. This is because zero-yield has no technical basis since plutonium fissions by itself. In fact, the treaty language accepted by the UN General Assembly on September 10, 1996, makes no mention of zero-yield. It only states, “Each State Party undertakes not to carry out any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion.” Although the treaty negotiating records show that Russian and Chinese officials agreed to zero-yield, China was not interested in hydronuclear experiments at the time because it did not have the technical sophistication to benefit from them. (It certainly does now.) My Russian counterparts at the time, meanwhile, complained that zero-yield made no sense and is unverifiable. They did not consider hydronuclear experiments disallowed. After all, the United States and the Soviet Union justified hydronuclear experiments during the 1958–61 moratorium because they were not considered to be “nuclear explosions.”

The question of whether China and Russia are conducting these experiments while the United States is not will continue to be contentious until the zero-yield issue is fully resolved. Hydronuclear experiments should either be approved by the five established nuclear powers, making it possible for the United States to conduct them, or be specifically disallowed with adequate provisions for verification.

Resumption of full-scale nuclear testing, meanwhile, would allow the United States to answer some pressing questions about aging and remanufactured plutonium pits. But it would help China and Russia even more. Russian President Vladimir Putin, for instance, has been brandishing new, exotic weapons systems, such as a nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed cruise missile and the huge Poseidon nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed torpedo. Testing would likely give Russia more confidence in these systems.



China, however, would likely learn the most. Nuclear testing would augment what it learned from the few tests it was able to conduct in the 1990s on the weapon systems that make up its arsenal today. It would also help in fielding the greatly expanded nuclear arsenal that it is developing now. With the extensive activities observed at the Chinese and Russian nuclear test sites in recent years, it is also likely that both countries could resume full-scale nuclear testing much more quickly than could the United States. A resumption of full-scale testing by any of the three could also allow India, North Korea, and Pakistan to overcome political barriers to resume testing.

The United States has the richest test history. It has conducted 1,054 nuclear tests (24 of them with the United Kingdom). Russia has conducted 715; France, 210; the United Kingdom, 45; China, 45; India, 6; Pakistan, 6; North Korea, 6. What the United States does not have, however, is a nuclear weapons production complex, especially for plutonium pit production. That doesn't require nuclear testing. It requires the national will to make it happen. The last 30 years give me little confidence the United States can do so.

My greatest concern about resuming full-scale nuclear testing is that it will fuel another dangerous arms race at a time when global tensions among the great powers are high. Engaging in another arms race is contrary to Trump's comment that “it would be great if we could all denuclearize, because the power of nuclear weapons is crazy.”

Instead of suggesting an immediate return to nuclear testing, then, Trump should focus on returning to arms control measures to ensure strategic stability with Russia and with China. Hopefully, these measures would lead to a reduction in U.S. and Russian nuclear forces and reduce incentives for China to increase its arsenal. For nuclear testing, he should help erect the highest possible barriers for any country to test by leading an effort to ratify the CTBT. To settle the question of evasion of low-yield tests or hydronuclear experiments, the president and his counterparts in Beijing and Moscow would need to show the political will to agree on a verifiable low-yield limit. That will almost surely require onsite inspections, which were demonstrated to be possible in 1988.

The bottom line is that even though the United States could derive important benefits from resumed nuclear testing, it would lose more than it stands to gain.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

BRIAN FINUCANE is Senior Adviser in the U.S. Program at the International Crisis Group and a Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Reiss Center on Law and Security at NYU School of Law. During the Obama administration and the first Trump administration, he served as an Attorney Adviser in the Office of the Legal Adviser at the U.S. State Department.

 The Real Costs of Washington's Use of Force 

 Brian Finucane

Since September, the Trump administration has conducted over 20 lethal strikes on vessels in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, alleging that the boats were carrying drugs from South America. The administration is attempting to cloak these maritime strikes in the guise of counterterrorism efforts, labeling the victims as narcoterrorists and equating the drug cartels to supposed terrorist organizations. And many Americans, who may be inured to lethal drone strikes and targeted killings after two decades of U.S. government action against Islamic militants, might simply regard the Trump administration's boat attacks as more of the same.

In reality, however, they are a new and dangerous development in the use of force. Beyond the human toll—more than 80 individuals have been killed without due process over three months—and the risk that the strikes are a prelude to a direct U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, they signal a broader threat to security at home and abroad. The administration, by asserting its prerogative to use military force—not only without congressional authorization but also seemingly outside the law altogether—is tearing down the legal guardrails around the will of the U.S. president.

These attacks endanger the legal order both domestically and internationally. They suggest that the U.S. executive holds a license to kill—one that could potentially be wielded within U.S. borders. And internationally, this killing campaign damages the legal barriers that the United States itself helped build in order to restrain conflict and deadly violence. The United States' turn against the law may well embolden other states to imitate it, possibly even by conducting their own extrajudicial killings. As Trump wields deadly force without constraints, he offers a model for lethal, lawless action, thereby posing a threat to international security that extends well beyond the Western Hemisphere.

The Trump administration has repeatedly attempted to shoehorn its killing spree at sea into the framework of the U.S. war on terror, deploying terms such as narcoterrorists and “designated terrorist organizations” to characterize the individuals and entities it is targeting. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has gone as far as to refer to these DTOs as the “Al Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere.” But as a legal matter, the maritime strikes are utterly distinct from the United States' prior military campaigns against Islamic militants. On 9/11, the United States suffered an armed attack on its soil, which under international law gave it a right to self-defense. In response, in a resolution passed on September 12, 2001, the UN Security Council recognized that right. The United States has endured no similar attack to prompt this year's maritime strikes, and neither the UN Security Council nor the broader international community has recognized the United States' need to use lethal military force in response to drug trafficking. Indeed, in a 2023 congressional hearing, Richard Visek, then the top lawyer for the U.S. Department of State, noted that the State Department has never considered drug trafficking to constitute an armed attack. But the current Trump administration has simply asserted that, according to the president's determination, there has been an armed attack against the United States. The administration has not publicly offered any analysis to substantiate that conclusion.

And unlike after 9/11, Congress has not authorized the use of military force. Within a week of the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which empowered the president to “use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks.” Because the perpetrators' identities were not fully known in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, that joint resolution delegated authority to the president to determine their identities. But crucially, it granted the executive branch only the freedom to pursue military action to “prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States” by those responsible for the 9/11 attacks.

Multiple U.S. presidents stretched and abused the 2001 AUMF to pursue new adversaries, including entities such as al-Shabab, an Islamic militant group in Somalia, which did not exist in September 2001 and which posed little direct threat to the United States. But the Trump administration has gone further, conducting its maritime bombing campaign entirely unilaterally and without seeking or referring to any congressional authorization for justification, including the AUMF. Instead, it has invoked the president's authority as commander in chief of the U.S. military under Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution. The administration's full legal rationale for using military force without a congressional authorization has not been made public. But according to The New York Times and other sources, an undisclosed Department of Justice opinion composed over the summer interprets this supposed Article 2 authority as permitting the president to use force against 24 DTOs—the narcoterrorists it claims to be striking. But the administration has also not publicly named the specific DTOs on the list.

Further, unlike during the post-9/11 military operations against al-Qaeda and its affiliates (and later the Islamic State, or ISIS), the United States is not currently in an armed conflict with drug cartels. Under international law, including as it has previously been applied by the U.S. government, for a state to engage in an armed conflict with a nonstate actor, that actor must possess military-type hierarchy, organization, and capabilities—in other words, it must be an “organized armed group.” The unreleased Department of Justice opinion, according to reporting by The New York Times, concluded that the United States was engaged in a “non-international armed conflict” based on the White House's own factual assertions. But the administration has not publicly explained how any of the unspecified DTOs it is targeting qualify as organized armed groups.

The DTO label used in the Justice Department opinion appears to differ from the “foreign terrorist organization” designation, one with an established meaning in U.S. law and that the Trump administration applied to a number of gangs and drug cartels earlier this year. But if the groups on the DTO list are similar or the same as the FTOs it has already called attention to, then the legal conclusion that the United States is somehow in an armed conflict with these entities appears unfounded. Some of the groups to which the administration has referred in public remarks and social media posts, such as the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, lack the hierarchy and organization needed to constitute an organized armed group with which the United States could fight an armed conflict. Moreover, the administration generally has not asserted that it is attacking the unnamed DTOs themselves. Instead, in reports to Congress and in social media posts, it refers loosely to striking vessels somehow “affiliated” with or operated by these organizations. According to reporting by the Associated Press and other outlets, as well as personal communications I have had with International Crisis Group analysts living in the region, it is unlikely that cartel members have actually been aboard many of the targeted vessels.

To many legal experts, Trump's boat strikes are patently unlawful. A range of former U.S. government lawyers, both civilian and military, who have advised on the use of force have publicly characterized the strikes as unlawful killings under both domestic and international law. The call may also be coming from inside the house. According to NBC News, the top lawyer at the U.S. Southern Command, the combatant command responsible for the region in which the strikes are occurring, warned in August that the maritime attacks could amount to extrajudicial killings and therefore result in legal exposure for the U.S. military personnel involved. In addition, Admiral Alvin Holsey, the officer in charge of U.S. Southern Command, announced after the bombing campaign began that he was leaving the position, a decision linked by The New York Times to Holsey having “raised concerns about the mission.”

International experts—including scholars, UN special rapporteurs, and the UN human rights chief—have also denounced the attacks as illegal, with some labeling the strikes as extrajudicial killings. A former chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Court even characterized the strikes as a crime against humanity—a grave offense involving widespread or systematic attacks on civilians. Close U.S. allies and partners also view the strikes as illegal. The French foreign minister, for instance, announced ahead of the recent G-7 foreign ministers' meeting that U.S. military operations in the Caribbean “violate international law.” And according to reporting in CNN in early November, the United Kingdom has restricted intelligence sharing with the United States because it regards the maritime strikes as unlawful and seeks to avoid complicity, a decision of particular significance given the historically close military and intelligence relationship between the two countries.

Such retreating steps by the United States' closest friends should raise red flags. During previous administrations, representing both parties, the U.S. government has engaged in legal diplomacy with its allies, conducting regular interagency legal discussions on issues related to counterterrorism. Through such diplomacy, the United States has explained its legal rationale for using force, including for targeted killings, and sought to convince allies and partners—particularly those who cooperated in military operations against al-Qaeda and ISIS—that such actions were lawful. American allies are therefore well aware of the United States' long-standing positions with respect to lethal counterterrorism action. Even if they have not always agreed with the U.S. interpretation of international law, those allies are well positioned to judge just how much of an aberration these strikes are compared with the United States' past legal positions.

The strikes provide an alarming indicator of how the current U.S. government is approaching legal constraints, including those guiding matters of life and death. On their face, premeditated killings of this nature, without legal justification, constitute serious federal crimes, including murder on the high seas, conspiracy to commit murder outside the United States, and murder as an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discredited the potential justification of self-defense when he acknowledged after the first strike in September that the U.S. government could interdict vessels—intercept and search them—rather than strike them. But he said that the U.S. president deliberately chose to blow up the vessels in order to send a message. Although the administration's official legal position is that the United States has supposedly suffered an “armed attack” and is engaged in “non-international armed conflicts,” it is telling that senior administration officials do not use those terms when discussing the strikes. In fact, Trump himself simply refers to “killings.” And the president appears to find some delight in the transgressive nature of the operations, publicly joking at an October press conference that they were instilling fear in fishermen. Whatever questionable attempts the administration is making to provide legal justification for these premeditated killings, in reality the Justice Department opinion cited in The New York Times serves as a permission slip for broad executive action, allowing the president to act on his whims no matter how violent or lawless.

An alternate factual and legal reality is taking shape within the U.S. executive branch—one in which otherwise illegal killings are not only permissible but obligatory because the president has ordered them. The bombing of these boats reveals that top officials in the U.S. government now believe that the law must be bent to the president's will, not the other way around. Having established that the executive branch's lawyers will bless such strikes and that the U.S. military will execute them, the administration is paving the way for further unconstrained military action. Given the number of countries that Trump has mused about attacking, the list of foreign targets is concerningly long. And ominously, in public statements the administration has applied the same “terrorist” label it uses for the victims of its boat strikes to immigrants and domestic political opponents, raising the prospect that Trump could use his supposed license to kill within U.S. borders.

As troubling as the possibility of lethal domestic military action is, the U.S. strikes also risk degrading security globally. In the wake of World War II, the United States led the way in creating and maintaining the legal architecture intended to restrain deadly violence—an architecture that includes the UN Charter's prohibition on the use of force, the Geneva Conventions and other customary laws of war that protect victims of armed conflict, and human rights treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture. The United States also played a central role in establishing international courts to enforce these rules, including to hold perpetrators of atrocities accountable at Nuremberg in the 1940s and, in the 1990s, in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Certainly, the United States has not always been a reliable pillar of this international order; its notable violations include the Iraq war, the George W. Bush administration's torture program during the “war on terror,” the unwillingness to enforce legal restrictions on military support to Israel amid the recent carnage in Gaza, and the current president's shifting threats to unlawfully attack countries from Denmark to Nigeria. But rather than acting as a hypocrite, as it sometimes has in the past, the U.S. government has graduated to behaving as a shameless scofflaw.

That risks emboldening other countries that, in the past, might have hesitated to commit such blatant abrogations of international law to follow in the United States' footsteps, taking their own military actions to serve domestic or foreign policy agendas. The unchecked use of force by the U.S. executive may diminish the inhibitions of other leaders with their own lethal designs. Indeed, Trump's own actions may have been inspired by other foreign leaders' killings. During his first term, Trump praised China's executions of drug dealers and applauded President Rodrigo Duterte's violent counternarcotics campaign in the Philippines, which may have killed thousands. It is not hard to imagine other leaders taking inspiration from the administration's lethal escapades, particularly if those responsible for the slayings at sea face no repercussions.

Beyond the danger of direct inspiration, these strikes erode the broader frameworks built to check deadly violence. The Trump administration may intend for these premeditated killings to send a message to drug traffickers, but the message sent to other countries is that the United States is willing to brazenly flout the legal restraints on the use of lethal force. If the world's most powerful country is seen to be disregarding both international law and its own domestic statutes, it risks further undermining the very legal order it built and encouraging transgressive behavior by others. The impetus to imitate the United States' rule-breaking may arise not only in illiberal states but also potentially among other Western democracies. The norms, international reputational concerns, and fear of sanctions which encourage compliance with international law are likely to be degraded when the world's superpower behaves lawlessly. By redefining what constitutes an “armed attack” that entitles a country to use force in the name of self-defense, the Trump administration risks creating a dangerous loophole in the prohibition on the use of force—what has previously functioned as a ban on war. In reframing crime as an act of war and alleged criminals as terrorists in order to justify premeditated killings, the U.S. government is providing a template for other countries to execute politically disfavored individuals without due process. This is a recipe for violence.

Even if the Trump administration winds down its maritime bombing campaign, the strikes may serve as proof of concept for how a president's lethal desires can be translated into action, regardless of the law. Trump continues to contemplate moving from strikes at sea to strikes on land, including recent commentary about ground-based military action not only in Venezuela but also in Colombia and Mexico. If any guardrails remain to prevent the president from making good on such unlawful military musings, they are unlikely to be the lawyers within the executive branch.

Some in Congress, and in the American public, may be willing to excuse the killings of purported drug smugglers. But they should not be so blasé about the lethal use of force without any serious legal justification. The barrier between these strikes and premeditated, extrajudicial killings elsewhere is weak, bordering on nonexistent. And without stronger pushback from the legislative branch, the White House may wield this lethal prerogative against other targets.

There have already been bipartisan efforts in Congress to halt the administration's killing spree, including a resolution that would have required congressional authorization for any further military action. But the legislation did not pass the Senate, and it does not appear to have deterred the White House. More lawmakers, and the citizenry more broadly, need to recognize the stakes and rein in the president's supposed lethal prerogative, including by advancing further legislation that signals strong political opposition to the administration's actions.

A continued failure to check the U.S. executive's lethal military action not only risks additional premeditated killings by this administration but also may well inspire other leaders around the world to kill outside the law. The United States' transition from a law builder and sustainer, however flawed and hypocritical, to international scofflaw is more dangerous than many observers may think. Although the international legal order designed to prevent conflict and restrain violence has been far from fully effective, further undermining it invites even greater global bloodshed.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump brushes off concerns about Witkoff's interactions with Russians as leaked transcript roils Washington","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/politics/trump-witkoff-russian-call","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 13:43:01 GMT","


            President Donald Trump brushed off concerns about his special envoy Steve Witkoff's engagements with the Kremlin after a new phone call transcript provided rare insight into how the president's top negotiator advised his Russian counterpart.
    


            In the October 14 audio recording reviewed and transcribed by Bloomberg, Witkoff counsels top Russian foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov on how Russian President Vladimir Putin should approach a call with Trump. The transcript offers key new insight about the behind-the-scenes talks that produced a 28-point peace plan that has been the subject of intense discussions between the Trump administration, Russia and Ukraine in recent days.
    


            “He's gotta sell this to Ukraine, he's gotta sell Ukraine to Russia. That's what a deal maker does,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Tuesday evening when asked about the reported transcript of the call.
    


            “I haven't heard it, but I heard it was standard negotiation. And I would imagine he's saying the same thing to Ukraine, because each party has to give and take,” the president added.
    


            The transcript generated concern among some GOP Russia hawks on Capitol Hill who asserted that Witkoff was too much under Russia's spell. Rep. Don Bacon called for him to be fired.
    


            “For those who oppose the Russian invasion and want to see Ukraine prevail as a sovereign & democratic country, it is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians. He cannot be trusted to lead these negotiations. Would a Russian paid agent do less than he?” Bacon wrote on X.
    


            Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick called it “a major problem. And one of the many reasons why these ridiculous side shows and secret meetings need to stop.”
    


            Trump, when asked if he was worried Witkoff was too “pro-Russian,” said the war could “go on for years,” adding, “Russia's got a lot more people – got a lot more soldiers. So I think if Ukraine can make a deal, it's a good thing.”
    


            Ushakov, meanwhile, expressed frustration about the leak.
    


            “Some of these leaks are fake. Others I would prefer not to comment on at all, as, for example, my conversations with Witkoff are confidential. No one should disclose them. No one!” he said in comments reported by Russian state media.
    


            Brett McGurk, a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under multiple presidents, said as a former negotiator his first thought was the call may have been leaked by a foreign intelligence service. He also told CNN's John Berman on Tuesday that it's unclear if it's the full transcript.
    


            McGurk added that it seemed like negotiators should regroup: “I just see this going sideways if not backwards.”
    


            According to Bloomberg's transcript of the call, Witkoff advised Ushakov to encourage his boss to congratulate Trump on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas when the two leaders spoke. That was indeed communicated two days later.
    


            “President Putin congratulated me and the United States on the Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East, something that, he said, has been dreamed of for centuries. I actually believe that the Success in the Middle East will help in our negotiation in attaining an end to the War with Russia/Ukraine,” Trump said in a social media post after the two leaders spoke in October.
    


            Witkoff, notably, encouraged Ushakov in the call to have the leaders speak before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky held talks with Trump at the White House.
    


            Trump's call with Putin took place on October 16 and the two-and-a-half-hour conversation appeared to shift the US president's tone toward Russia after weeks of frustration with a lack of progress toward ending the war.
    


            The next day, Trump hosted Zelensky at the White House for a working lunch that turned tense when Trump insisted Ukraine make territorial concessions to Russia to end the war, according to European officials briefed on the meeting at the time.
    


            Trump, who would later endorse a freeze in current battle lines as part of a peace settlement, grew frustrated and raised his voice multiple times, the officials said.
    


            Witkoff also floated the idea of putting together a “20-point peace proposal” during his call with Ushakov similar to his efforts in Gaza. That eventually led to a 28-point peace proposal that included many concessions to Russia, including Kyiv ceding territory, giving up ambitions to join NATO and limiting the size of its army.
    


            After high-level diplomatic talks between the US and Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland, and between the US and Russia in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, the contours of that plan have shifted.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday described the plan as a “living, breathing document.”
    


            Witkoff is now expected to travel to Moscow for additional negotiations as soon as next week, according to Trump, who told reporters that the envoy could also be joined by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
    


Army Secretary Dan Driscoll is also expected to travel to Kyiv later this week for peace talks.
    


            Trump suggested he would be open to meeting with Zelensky and Putin, but not until the deal is final or in final stages.
    


            Asked if that meant his Thanksgiving deadline was flexible, he said, “I don't have a deadline – I just – you know what the deadline for me is? When it's over.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Hegseth focuses on potential punishments for Sen. Kelly in confrontation over ‘illegal orders' video","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/26/politics/hegseth-kelly-unlawful-orders-video","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 09:00:58 GMT","


            Publicly, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been highly critical of the six Democratic lawmakers who released a video last week urging military service members to disobey illegal orders, calling the lawmakers the “Seditious Six” and categorizing their message as “despicable, reckless, and false.”
    


            That criticism has particularly focused on Sen. Mark Kelly, the member of the group who had the longest tenure in the military and who achieved the highest rank of captain in the Navy.
    


            Hegseth has attacked Kelly by name, unlike the other lawmakers. He mocked Kelly for a picture of him in uniform — “you can't even display your uniform correctly” — and wrote that Kelly's “conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.”
    


            Behind closed doors, Hegseth is weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ones that range from reducing the retired US Navy captain's rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            In Kelly, Hegseth sees a critic worth making an example of, and he could technically use the military justice system to do so, the source said. Unlike the other five Democrats who appeared in the video, Kelly is a military retiree — meaning he served long enough to receive a pension, and thus, is still beholden to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ, including its restrictions on free speech, legal experts told CNN.
    


            Kelly could be recalled to active service and court-martialed because of that status, but doing so over his role in the video would be extraordinary, legal experts said. That's because not only has the UCMJ mainly been used in recent years to prosecute former service members who commit crimes overseas outside of US civil jurisdiction, but also because Kelly is a US senator.
    


            Prosecuting him would raise unprecedented separation-of-powers issues, with the executive branch going after someone in the legislative branch, said Rachel E. VanLandingham, a national security law expert and former active-duty judge advocate in the US Air Force.
    


            It would also be an uphill battle for the administration, VanLandingham and other legal experts said, in large part because Hegseth's public statements deriding Kelly's video appear to be a clear-cut case of “unlawful command influence,” in which a superior commander implies or dictates a predetermined outcome for a military trial and thus makes a fair hearing impossible.
    


            Because everyone at the Defense Department works for Hegseth, VanLandingham noted, it's hard to see who could fairly convene a court to hear his case.
    


            “Hegseth has completely tainted this process,” she said.
    


            A coalition of former and retired military judge advocates has also issued a rare joint statement warning that the Pentagon's effort to recall Kelly for UCMJ prosecution is partisan in nature, legally baseless and compromised by unlawful command influence.
    


            “We are confident the unlawful influence reflected in the press reports will ultimately disqualify all convening authorities except possibly the president himself from actually referring a case for court martial,” the statement said.
    


            In his various public messages, Hegseth has suggested Kelly's comments violated several statutes of the UCMJ, which lays out legal requirements for those in the military, but they don't seem to cohere to a single theory of the case, legal experts said.
    


            In the video that triggered the Trump administration's calls for consequences, lawmakers said that “threats to our Constitution” are coming “from right here at home,” and repeatedly urged the military and intelligence community to “refuse illegal orders.”
    


            Although the video didn't reference what orders service members might be receiving that would potentially be illegal, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns repeatedly about the legality of US military strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and the US military's deployment to cities over the protest of governors.
    


            The administration has argued that by emphasizing service members' duty to disobey unlawful orders, Kelly and the other lawmakers were inciting troops to disobey lawful orders. President Donald Trump has called the video “seditious behavior at the highest level.”
    


            Kelly's involvement in the video is under “review” by the Pentagon, rather than subject to a formal investigation, meaning military police are not involved, the source familiar with Hegseth's thinking said.
    


            At this stage, it remains unclear whether Kelly will ultimately face a recall and court-martial or a lesser administrative penalty. It's also not clear what, exactly, Kelly might be charged with if he were to be charged.
    


            “There are many options,” the source told CNN.
    


            In the short term, Hegseth is deferring to his Navy secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in, for advice — giving him a deadline of December 10 to provide his recommendations.
    


            “I am referring this, and any other related matters, for your review, consideration and disposition as you see fit,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to the Navy secretary, dated November 25.
    


            Hegseth has hinted at one option he is considering in response — to administratively reduce Kelly's rank — referring to him in a social media post as a “retired Navy Commander,” which is below the senator's rank of captain.
    


            Because Kelly was a senior officer who retired from the Navy, he is required to remain available for recall to the military by law. The other five lawmakers in the video, Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, are not eligible for recall to a military service.
    


            That gives Hegseth options for action against Kelly that he doesn't have for the others, though the FBI is also seeking interviews with the lawmakers.
    


            While retired service members have been called back to face military law before, it has generally been for violent crimes. It's unclear what crime Kelly could be charged with.
    


            In its response, the administration has pointed to a number of legal provisions. A Pentagon statement referenced a World War II-era federal law prohibiting actions intending to interfere with the discipline or loyalty of the military, which the military could theoretically charge through a backdoor provision that allows it to charge federal crimes not explicitly laid out by the UCMJ.
    


            But that law has not been used in the modern era and is widely viewed as a dead letter after a series of postwar Supreme Court decisions reinforcing free-speech protections, VanLandingham said.
    


            Other legal terms of art referenced by Hegseth in response to Kelly and the other lawmakers seem to match with provisions in the UCMJ criminalizing behavior against good order and discipline or which bring “discredit” upon the armed services.
    


            If Kelly is recalled for prosecution under the UCMJ, his case will be handled by officers in the Judge Advocate General corps.
    


            Hegseth has significantly changed the role and responsibilities of those military lawyers and fired some who ran afoul of the policies he is trying to implement, moves sources previously told CNN were viewed inside the Pentagon as the first warning shots by an administration intent on pushing the boundaries of the law.
    


            But using the Uniform Code of Military Justice to punish a sitting senator and retired Navy captain for something that, for private citizens, is protected as free speech, would mark a significant escalation by Hegseth.
    


            GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski and John Curtis defended their Democratic colleague after the Pentagon's announcement.
    


            Murkowski noted in a post on X that Kelly had served the country “valiantly,” and “to accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong.”
    


            “The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation,” she added.
    


            Curtis, a first-term senator from Utah, didn't directly reference the investigations into Kelly, but said on Tuesday evening he has “respect” for the Arizona Democrat and values his “friendship.”
    


            “I know him as someone whose career has been defined by service. His record as a combat naval aviator and NASA astronaut reflects his example of the discipline and dedication that are important for success,” Curtis wrote on X.
    


            Court-martialing Kelly is technically a viable option for Hegseth because three appellate courts have upheld that it's constitutional to court-martial retired service members, though there have been long-standing arguments from some legal scholars that this should not be the case.
    


            Among other things, the UCMJ places stiff limitations on free speech that some legal analysts believe are unconstitutional for people who are in every other way living as civilians. It could in theory allow the government to court-martial a Korean War veteran for saying something critical about the sitting president, for example.
    


            There are other problems, beyond the potential issue of Unlawful Command Influence, said Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center and a CNN legal analyst.
    


            “Prosecuting [Kelly] for saying something that is literally true is going to raise the mother of all First Amendment objections,” he said. Separately, Kelly enjoys additional protections on his speech as a member of the Senate under what's known as the “speech and debate clause” of the Constitution. That defense is a bit less clear-cut, Vladeck noted — Kelly didn't make his remarks on the Senate floor — and the lower courts have offered different interpretations of the limits of those protections.
    


            “UCI is the cleanest shot here,” Vladeck said. “The First Amendment is the second cleanest. Speech and debate is the most obvious but the trickiest.”
    


            For his part, Kelly has been defiant in response to Hegseth's threats, posting that he will not be intimidated or “silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”

            International tourists visiting popular national parks in the US next year will be required to pay additional fees and raised rates on annual passes, the US Department of the Interior announced Tuesday.
    


            In a statement hailing a new “resident-focused fee structure that puts American families first,” the department said as of January 1, 2026, the annual pass will cost non-US residents $250 to obtain, more than triple the standard $80 which US residents will continue to pay.
    


            Foreign tourists who don't purchase the pass will pay a $100-per-person fee, in addition to the standard entrance fee, to enter 11 of the most visited national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountain, Yellowstone and Yosemite, the statement said. The department co-manages the America the Beautiful Pass series and controls more than 70 percent of all federal public lands.
    


            “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in the statement.
    


The 15 least visited US national parks



            The rationale offered behind the new prices was summarized in a White House social media post stating: “AMERICANS OFFERED AFFORDABLE PRICES WHILE FOREIGNERS PAY MUCH MORE.”
    


            This announced price hike comes amid a decline in international tourism to the US, fueled by changes to tariff policies and crackdowns on immigration. Yellowstone has reported a decrease in international visitation, down from approximately 30% in 2018 to 14.8% in 2024.
    


            The price increase also comes on the heels of the longest government shutdown in US history, which saw an already-depleted National Park Service struggle to upkeep some of nation's parks due to limited staffing and fewer resources.
    


            According to a recent estimate by the National Parks Conservation Association, parks lost roughly $41 million in uncollected entrance and recreation fees during the government shutdown.
    


            The Interior Department's statement also highlighted “resident-only patriotic fee-free days” for next year which includes Memorial Day, Fourth of July Independence Day weekend and June 14, “Flag Day/President Trump's birthday.” The launch of an upgraded booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks was also announced, described as “the most significant modernization of national park access in decades.”
    


            Other countries, including Egypt, Thailand and Cambodia, also charge higher entry fees for international tourists to visit national parks and attractions.

A judge on Wednesday dismissed the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others after the prosecutor who recently took over the case said he would not pursue the charges.

The case's abandonment ends the last effort to punish the president for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

Pete Skandalakis, the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, took over the case earlier this month from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who was removed over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she chose to lead the case.

Willis' 2023 indictment against Trump and 18 others alleged a wide-ranging conspiracy to illegally overturn Trump's loss to Joe Biden in Georgia. 

It was unlikely that legal action against Trump could have moved forward while he is president. But other defendants, including former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, still faced charges.

A coalition of current, former and retired employees at the National Park Service is denouncing a plan by the Trump administration to charge international tourists an extra $100 to enter some of the most popular U.S. parks, on top of the normal entrance fee. Fees for an annual park pass will also jump to $250 for international visitors.

“In a year where national park staff have already been cut by nearly 25%, we worry this will be yet another burden for already overworked employees,'' said Emily Thompson, executive director of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks.

Parks attract millions of international visitors every year who are “an important economic driver for our parks,” Thompson added.

“National parks should be available and accessible to all, or America's best idea will become America's greatest shakedown,'' she said.

Although a series of cases once threatened to imperil Trump's political career and personal liberty, the abandonment of the Georgia case is the latest reflection of how he has emerged mostly unscathed.

Former Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith, who had charged Trump with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election and hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, dropped both cases after Trump won the White House last year. He cited longstanding Justice Department policy against the indictment of a sitting president.

And though Trump was convicted of felony charges in New York in connection with hush money payments during the 2016 election, he was sentenced in January to an unconditional discharge, leaving his conviction intact but sparing him any punishment.

“The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over,” attorney Steve Sadow said. “This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.”

The nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia was tasked with replacing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis from the case after she was disqualified over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she'd chosen to lead the case.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee set a Nov. 14 deadline for the appointment of a new prosecutor, so Pete Skandalakis, executive director for the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia chose to appoint himself rather than allowing the case to be dismissed.

“Several prosecutors were contacted and, while all were respectful and professional, each declined the appointment,” Skandalakis said in an emailed statement.

The prosecutor who recently took over the Georgia election interference case against Trump and others said in a court filing Wednesday that he has decided not to pursue the case further.

Pete Skandalakis, the executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, took over the case earlier this month from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who was removed over an “appearance of impropriety” created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she chose to lead the case.

It was unlikely that legal action against Trump could have moved forward while he is president. But 14 other defendants still faced charges, including former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.

A senior Kremlin official confirmed Wednesday that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to visit Moscow next week as efforts pick up speed to find a consensus on ending the nearly four-year war between Russia and Ukraine.

But Yuri Ushakov, Putin's foreign affairs adviser, insisted that Kremlin officials haven't officially received the initial U.S. peace proposal, although they have acknowledged that they have seen a copy obtained through back channels. Representatives of the United States, Russia and Ukraine held talks earlier this week in the United Arab Emirates.

“Contact is ongoing, including via telephone, but no one has yet sat down at a roundtable and discussed this point by point. That hasn't happened,” Ushakov told Russian state media.

Trump's chief interlocutor with the Russian government last month advised a senior aide to Vladimir Putin on how the Russian leader should go about pitching the U.S. president on a Ukraine peace plan. 

That's according to a transcript of the Oct. 14 call published Tuesday by Bloomberg News. The news agency said it reviewed a recording of the call. 

It said Trump envoy Steve Witkoff advised Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov that Putin should call the U.S. leader to congratulate him and praise Trump for the Gaza peace deal. Trump described Witkoff's approach as “standard” in negotiations.

Trump brought insults and grievances to the traditional Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony at the White House.

On Tuesday, he joked about sending the turkeys to a prison in El Salvador and suggested naming them after Democratic stalwarts Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. Trump also claimed that last year's turkey pardons by President Joe Biden were invalid.

Trump eventually got around to the business at hand, which was pardoning the turkeys Gobble and Waddle. 

Trump used part of his ceremonial remarks to insist that the price of Thanksgiving meals was dropping under his leadership, although his numbers are misleading. Some research indicates that holiday dinners could cost more this year, a reminder of persistent frustration with inflation.

Watch live from the scene as a fire spreads across seven high-rise apartment buildings in a Hong Kong housing complex, killing 13 people and leaving others trapped, according to the city's fire services.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's deadliest fire in years blazed late into the night on Wednesday as the city's leader confirmed at least 36 people, including a firefighter, had died and another 279 people were reported missing.

Hundreds of residents were evacuated as the blaze spread across seven high-rise apartment buildings in a housing complex in Tai Po district, a suburb in the New Territories. At least 29 others remained hospitalized.

“Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate the cause of the fire,” John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, said.

He said the fire was “coming under control” shortly past midnight.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday expressed condolences to the firefighter who died and extended sympathies to the families of the victims, according to state broadcaster CCTV. He also urged efforts to minimize casualties and losses.

The housing complex consisted of eight buildings with almost 2,000 apartments housing about 4,800 residents, including many elderly people. The housing complex was built in the 1980s and has recently been undergoing a major renovation.

Fire chiefs said high temperatures at the scene made it difficult for crews to mount rescue operations. It was not immediately known how the fire started, but officials said the fire started at the external scaffolding of one of the buildings, a 32-storey tower, and later spread to inside the building and then to nearby buildings, likely aided by windy conditions. 




A column of flames and thick smoke rose as the blaze spread quickly on bamboo scaffolding and construction netting that had been set up around the exterior of the buildings. About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters.

Multiple buildings close to each other were set ablaze, with bright flames and smoke shooting out of windows as night fell. Authorities said that hundreds of firefighters, police officers and paramedics were deployed. Firefighters aimed water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks.

The blaze, which started mid-afternoon, was upgraded a level 5 alarm — the highest level of severity — as night fell. Authorities said that conditions remained very challenging for firefighters. 

“Debris and scaffolding of the affected buildings (is) falling down,” said Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of Fire Service operations. “The temperature inside the buildings concerned is very high. It's difficult for us to enter the building and go upstairs to conduct firefighting and rescue operations.”

The fire department said that it received “numerous” calls requesting assistance. It said some residents remained trapped as of Wednesday night.

Firefighters deployed more than 140 fire trucks and more than 60 ambulances to the scene.

The dead included a 37-year-old firefighter, while another received treatment for heat exhaustion, Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said.

District officials in Tai Po have opened temporary shelters for people left homeless by the fire.




“I've given up thinking about my property,” a resident who only provided her surname, Wu, told local TV station TVB. “Watching it burn like that was really frustrating.”

Tai Po is a suburban area in the New Territories, in the northern part of Hong Kong and near the border with the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.

Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though the government said earlier this year that it would start phasing it out for public projects because of safety concerns.

The fire is the deadliest in Hong Kong in years. In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a level 5 fire that lasted for around 20 hours.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel handed over the bodies of 15 Palestinians on Wednesday, a day after Hamas returned the remains of an Israeli hostage. This is the latest exchange as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire reached last month, whose first phase is winding down even as violence continues in Palestinian territories.

The remains of two hostages, one Israeli and a Thai national who were abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that ignited the war, are still to be returned. 

Hamas said it's committed to handing them over even though the recovery is made difficult by widespread destruction in Gaza, while Israel has accused the militants of stalling after the last living hostages were released on Oct. 13 during the most urgent phase of the ceasefire.

Turkish, Qatari and Egyptian mediators met in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire.

That is expected to include deploying an armed International Stabilization Force, tasked with ensuring the disarmament of Hamas, a key demand of Israel, and developing an international body to govern Gaza and oversee reconstruction.

But major questions hang over nearly every part of the plan and the time frame for implementation of the fragile ceasefire that has held despite accusations of violations by both sides.

Separately, Israel's military said Wednesday that it conducted airstrikes and a “broad counterterrorism operation” in the northern part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It said the operation followed the killing of “three terrorists who took part in terror attacks against IDF soldiers and Israeli civilians.”

According to the ceasefire, Israel has agreed to return 15 Palestinian bodies for each hostage recovered. So far, 345 bodies have been returned, said the Gaza Health Ministry. It is unclear if they were people killed in Israel during the Oct. 7 attack, Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody or bodies taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war.

Meanwhile, Israel mourned the latest hostage to be returned by the Palestinian militants, Dror Or. Israel's military said Or and his wife, Yonat Or, were killed by militants who overran their community of Kibbutz Be'eri on Oct. 7, 2023.

Before they were killed, the couple evacuated two of their children, Alma and Noam, from their burning house through a window, said the Hostages Families Forum. The children were abducted by the militants and released in a hostage deal in November 2023.

The forum remembered Or as a devoted father and talented cheesemaker who spent years working at the Be'eri dairy, eventually managing it.

In total, Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people across southern Israel and abducted 251 to Gaza in their attack.

Israeli troops opened fire Wednesday on a group of people in central Gaza, killing a Palestinian man and wounding at least two others, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the casualties.

Israel's military said it did not have enough information about the incident to comment.

Also Wednesday, the military said its troops targeted a group of six militants in the southern city of Rafah, killing one. The military statement said that the militants had “most likely emerged from the underground terror infrastructure in the area.” Troops then searched a nearby building, killing three more and apprehending two, it said. 

Later on Wednesday, the military said troops had killed two “terrorists” – one a member of Islamic Jihad – who had approached the IDF in two separate incidents in southern Gaza.

The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 69,775 Palestinians have been killed — 345 Palestinians since the ceasefire — and 170,863 injured in Israel's offensive in Gaza. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures, but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts.

An Israeli military operation took place on Wednesday in the governorate of Tubas in the West Bank.

Gov. Ahmad Al-Asaad said the operation involved Apache helicopters and military vehicles, saying Tubas was essentially “cut off” by Israeli troops.

“This military operation is a prelude to annexation, and since the early hours of the morning, we have activated the central emergency committee to respond to the citizens' distress call in the Tubas Governorate,” he said.

The IDF said its operation — which included the Air Force striking “to isolate and contain the area” — was a response to “attempts to establish terrorist strongholds and construction of terror infrastructures in the area.”

Last week, Israel's prime minister met with top security officials to discuss a rising tide of Israeli settler violence in the West Bank, which Israel captured alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war and Palestinians see as central to a future state. 

A few days earlier, Palestinian attackers stabbed an Israeli to death and wounded three more before being shot down by troops in the latest violence to rock the occupied territory.

Officials have warned that the unrest could spill over and undermine the fragile truce in Gaza.

Turkey's intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin met in Cairo on Tuesday with Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypt's intelligence chief Hasan Reshat to discuss advancing to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, a Turkish security official said. 




The talks also centered on intensifying joint efforts with the United States to strengthen the truce, according to the official who requested anonymity in line with Turkish regulations. 

Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation with a long experience in U.N. peacekeeping missions, is among the countries the U.S. has discussed the ISF plan with, in addition to Azerbaijan, Egypt and Qatar.

On Tuesday, Gen. Agus Subianto, Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces, said they're “in the selection phase for the peacekeeping force.”

On Thursday, Pope Leo XIV is expected to take his first foreign trip, traveling first to various sites in Turkey and then to Beirut, Lebanon. Israel struck Lebanon's capital on Sunday, killing Hezbollah's chief of staff Haytham Tabtabai and warning the Iran-backed militant group not to rearm and rebuild.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic lawmakers who appeared in a social media video urging U.S. troops to defy “illegal orders” say the FBI has contacted them to begin scheduling interviews, signaling a possible inquiry into the matter.

It would mark the second investigation tied to the video, coming a day after the Pentagon said it was reviewing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over potential violations of military law. The FBI and Pentagon actions come after President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition and said it is “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post.

Together, the inquiries mark an extraordinary escalation for federal law enforcement and military institutions that traditionally steer clear of partisan clashes. They also underscore the administration's willingness to push legal limits against its critics, even when they are sitting members of Congress. Lawmakers in the video urge troops to reject any illegal orders from their superiors, something they are already duty-bound to do.

“President Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass Members of Congress,” a group of four Democratic House members said in a statement Tuesday. “Yesterday, the FBI contacted the House and Senate Sergeants at Arms requesting interviews.”

Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, one of the six Democratic lawmakers in the video, told reporters Tuesday that “last night the counterterrorism division at the FBI sent a note to the members of Congress, saying they are opening what appears to be an inquiry against the six of us.” Slotkin called it a “scare tactic by” Trump.

“Whether you agree with the video or don't agree with the video, the question to me is: is this the appropriate response for a president of the United States to go after and seek to weaponize the federal government against those he disagrees with?” said Slotkin.

The group of four Democratic House members said in their statement that “no amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution.”

All six of the Democratic lawmakers in the video have served in the military or intelligence community. 

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska criticized both inquiries on social media, saying that accusing the lawmakers “of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong.”

“The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation,” wrote Murkowski.

The FBI went through the top security officials for the House and Senate to request interviews with each of the six lawmakers. The lawmakers said they had no further information and the FBI has not made clear on what basis they were seeking the interviews.

The FBI declined to comment Tuesday, but Director Kash Patel, in an interview with journalist Catherine Herridge, described it as an “ongoing matter” in explaining why he could not discuss details.

Asked for his reaction to the video, Patel said, “What goes through my head is the same thing that goes through my head in any case: is there a lawful predicate to open up an inquiry and investigation, or is there not? And that decision will be made by the career agents and analysts here at the FBI.”

In the video, lawmakers said they needed troops to “stand up for our laws … our Constitution.” Kelly, who was a fighter pilot before becoming an astronaut and then retiring at the rank of captain, told troops that “you can refuse illegal orders.”

After the Pentagon announced the investigation into Kelly on Monday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth referred it to the Navy on Tuesday and requested a briefing by Dec. 10.

The lawmakers didn't mention specific circumstances in the video. But at an event Tuesday in Michigan, Slotkin pointed to the Trump administration ordering the military to blow up small boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean accused of ferrying drugs and continued attempts at deploying National Guard troops into U.S. cities despite some legal setbacks. 

“It wasn't that there was any one incident, it was the sheer number of people coming to us and saying, ‘I'm worried. I am being sent to Washington or I'm being sent to LA or Chicago, North Carolina now, and I'm concerned I'm going to be asked to do something that I don't know if I should do,'” said Slotkin. “So that's where it came from.”

Troops, especially uniformed commanders, do have specific obligations to reject orders that are unlawful, if they make that determination.

Broad legal precedence also holds that just following orders — colloquially known as the “Nuremberg defense,” as it was used unsuccessfully by senior Nazi officials to justify their actions under Adolf Hitler — doesn't absolve troops.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Park Service said Tuesday it is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. parks each year an extra $100 to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.

The announcement declaring “America-first entry fee policies” comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time.

The fee change will impact 11 national parks, including the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service “continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!”

A White House post on X laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, “AMERICANS FIRST.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.




“There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation – all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,” Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email.

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.

The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.

The “resident-only patriotic fee-free days” next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that “everyone, no matter their zip code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.”

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico unveiled plans Wednesday to build what it claims will be Latin America's most powerful supercomputer — a project the government says will help the country capitalize on the rapidly evolving uses of artificial intelligence and exponentially expand the country's computing capacity.

Dubbed “Coatlicue” for the Mexica goddess considered the earth mother, the supercomputer would be seven times more powerful than the region's current leader in Brazil, José Merino, head of the Telecommunications and Digital Transformation Agency.

President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her morning news briefing that the location for the project had not been decided yet, but construction will begin next year.

“We're very excited,” said Sheinbaum, an academic and climate scientist. “It is going to allow Mexico to fully get in on the use of artificial intelligence and the processing of data that today we don't have the capacity to do.”

Merino said that Mexico's most powerful supercomputer operates at 2.3 petaflops — a unit to measure computing speed, meaning it can perform one quadrillion operations per second. Coatlicue would have a capacity of 314 petaflops.

Paul Skenes is getting rewarded for his historic performance.

In just his second season in the big leagues, the Pittsburgh Pirates flamethrower led the majors with a 1.97 ERA while striking out 216 batters en route to a unanimous National League Cy Young Award victory.

Skenes, who is not even eligible for arbitration yet, will receive a record $3.4 million from the pre-arbitration bonus pool that was created in 2022.

The $50 million pool was implemented in the newest collective bargaining agreement to reward top players who aren't yet arbitration eligible (no more than three years of MLB service). The previous high was Bobby Witt Jr.'s $3.1 million for the 2024 season, which came after signing a $288.7 million, 11-year deal with the Kansas City Royals before the year started.

Skenes received $2.5 million alone for winning the Cy Young Award. He made more than $2 million last year for his unanimous Rookie of the Year performance despite not making his MLB debut until May 11.

Skenes is under team control for the rest of this decade, but given the Pirates' history of not paying big-time players, his name has already been circulating in the rumor mill.

RED SOX ADD SONNY GRAY TO ROTATION IN TRADE, WHILE CARDINALS PICK UP PAIR OF YOUNG PITCHERS

Skenes was linked to the New York Yankees in a report from NJ Advance Media. A former Pirates teammate of Skenes reportedly told the outlet the pitcher was ""hoping for a trade"" before he becomes a free agent in 2029. Skenes, however, dismissed the notion.

More MLB records could be well on the way for Skenes, who is set to reach free agency at age 28. The largest deal ever given to a pitcher, both in dollars and years, is Yoshinobu Yamamoto's $325 million over 12 years with the Los Angeles Dodgers. At age 25, he received that deal before even throwing an MLB pitch, having won three consecutive MVP awards in Japan.

The largest contract ever given out by the Pirates is the $106.8 million deal they gave to Bryan Reynolds ahead of the 2023 season. Ke'Bryan Hayes is second at $70 million, and before that, it was the $60 million given to Jason Kendall in 2000.

Julian Edelman joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Shedeur Sanders' first start in the NFL, the Kansas City Chiefs, and Drake Maye's MVP-like season with the New England Patriots. 

Ed Kelce has a message for Travis Kelce's critics. 

Kelce, 74, took to social media to praise his youngest son's play this season. 

""If anyone questions how good Travis is playing; through Week 10 he leads all tight ends in total yardage,"" Kelce posted on Instagram.

The Kansas City Chiefs tight end was the NFL league leader among tight ends in total yards through Week 10, but fell to second after Week 12. Arizona Cardinals tight end Trey McBride leads all tight ends in both receptions (80) and yards (797). 

Kelce is second in the NFL among tight ends with 674 yards, with the Indianapolis Colts' rookie Tyler Warren just behind him with 662 yards. The 36-year-old has been resurgent for the Chiefs this season, as he has 54 catches and four touchdowns in addition to his 674 yards.

The 10-time Pro Bowler already has more touchdowns than he did last season and, despite his diminished athleticism, has been a reliable target for Patrick Mahomes.

The four-time All-Pro quickly quashed any retirement rumors last season, as shortly after the team's crushing Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, he announced his return. Last week, Kelce said he would let the Chiefs know his intentions to play in 2026 before NFL free agency begins in March 2026 to give the team ample time to plan their offseason. 

Kelce had four catches for 43 yards in the Chiefs' 23-20 win over the Colts on Sunday. The Chiefs improved to 6-5 with the win but remain outside the playoff picture.

Chefs John McLemore and John McLemore II join 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to show how to deep-fry, smoke, or spatchcock grill a Thanksgiving turkey, plus brining tips and sides from their 'Gather & Grill' cookbook.

Thanksgiving is a time of indulgence — so if you're looking to feel fuller with less food, what are your options for packing your meal with protein?

Thanksgiving food doesn't need to throw off your weight-loss progress — or taste any less delicious — according to Stephen Campolo, a fitness trainer and weight-loss expert based in Naples, Florida. 

""The single best move you can make is simple: Start with protein and get full on turkey and ham first,"" Campolo told Fox News Digital. 

THANKSGIVING COSTS BY THE NUMBERS REVEAL WHAT'S CHEAPER, WHAT'S STILL PRICEY

""Skip the bread basket and load your plate with at least 6 to 8 ounces of lean turkey, plus a solid portion of ham,"" he added. 

People should eat their protein ""slowly and completely before even glancing at the sides,"" he also recommended.

""High-quality protein triggers satiety faster than any carb on the table,"" Campolo said. 

PUMPKIN OR APPLE? AMERICA'S FIERCEST THANKSGIVING DESSERT DEBATE HEATS UP

""Once your stomach registers 'enough,' those mashed potatoes, stuffing and rolls lose their power. You'll naturally take smaller portions — or skip them altogether — and still feel completely satisfied.""

A serving of lean turkey or ham may help reduce the urge to pile on heavy sides. (iStock)

But if you're abstaining from meat, a filling Thanksgiving meal doesn't need to be all ham and turkey.

Plant-based proteins, such as lentils, can also enhance Thanksgiving meals, said Becky Geisel, owner of Bex Kitchen & Catering in New Jersey.

""At Bex, we love incorporating lentils into sides like our popular lentil and cauliflower salad or lentil and butternut squash salad,"" Geisel told Fox News Digital. 

""Chickpeas, quinoa and nuts such as almonds, pecans and peanuts also pack in protein and add satisfying texture. Seeds, especially pumpkin and chia, are easy to sprinkle into salads or roasted vegetable dishes for an extra boost of protein.""

""Another tasty and easy way to up your protein game is by using your turkey's bone broth as the base for your gravy,"" said one expert. (iStock)

The chef also emphasized greens such as broccoli, spinach and Brussels sprouts.

""As a chef who focuses on whole foods and nutrition, I always remind people that Thanksgiving can be both indulgent and balanced,"" Geisel said.

""It's all about creating dishes that nourish your body while celebrating flavor and tradition.""

Danielle Vauthy, a Washington-based professional chef at Hungryroot, also recommended combining protein with greens.

Lentils, chickpeas and nuts can make plant-based meals more filling, a chef told Fox News Digital. (iStock)

""I love adding more protein to Thanksgiving with a simple yet refreshing protein-packed salad,"" Vauthy said. 

""It's easily made using cooked or canned chickpeas, shaved Brussels sprouts and fennel tossed in a light vinaigrette,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It's crisp, colorful and a great balance to heavier dishes.""

She also suggested starting the meal with protein.

A Florida sailor stationed in Hawaii died after heroically rescuing two children in Waiapua‘a Bay.

Master-at-Arms 1st Class Jeffrey Diaz, 47, of Florida, died Saturday, according to a news release from the Kaua‘i Police Department (KPD).

Diaz, who was stationed at the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Barking Sands, jumped into the water to rescue two children who were struggling in the high surf, according to the release. 

While the children made it back to shore safely, police said Diaz encountered trouble in the water.

In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America. Published daily by senior writers and experts, these in-depth pieces go beyond the headlines to give readers the full picture. You can find our full list of In Focus pieces here.

Over the last decade, academic biology has been under full-scale ideological assault by activists pursuing the narrow political goal of convincing the public that the biology of sex has undergone a revolution. Whereas biologists traditionally viewed the reproductive categories of male and female as a strict binary, these activists and ideologically captured scientists now claim that modern biology has abandoned this overly “simplistic” view in favor of a more complex model involving myriad traits that fall on a continuum. According to this narrative, the traditional binary model was not merely wrong — it was a product of bigotry that actively oppressed intersex and transgender communities.

At least, that's the story they want you to believe.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE EMBODIES THE INANITY OF POPULISM

But no scientific revolution ever occurred. No new data have overturned our universal understanding of males and females as evolved reproductive strategies rooted in the type of gamete, sperm or ova, an organism's reproductive system has the biological function to produce. Instead, the assertion that sex is a “spectrum” gained traction because activists successfully attached moral valence to what should remain an amoral empirical matter. Scientists and the public were suddenly confronted with a false binary: Are you a good person who accepts the modern science of the sex spectrum, or are you a hateful transphobe clinging to outdated junk science?

This framing has done tremendous damage, both to the careers of biologists such as myself who publicly object to this pseudoscientific ideological takeover on scientific grounds and to the public's grasp of basic, universal biological concepts fundamental to our species.

When President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, a top priority was to purge this sex pseudoscience from the federal government. On Inauguration Day, he signed an executive order titled “Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” The order affirmed that the terms ‘man' and ‘boy,' as well as ‘woman' and ‘girl,' refer to the adult and juvenile forms of human males and females, respectively. It further defined ‘male' and ‘female' in objective biological terms, specifically according to whether a person's reproductive system has the function to produce either the small or large “reproductive cell,” sperm or ova.

The order also explicitly identified “gender ideology” as the force behind efforts to abolish sex-based legal protections by replacing “the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity.” Under this redefinition, men and women can self-identify as the opposite sex, and institutions are expected to treat such declarations as authoritative in all contexts.

On Feb. 19, one month after Trump's order, the Department of Health and Human Services followed up on Trump's order with a detailed set of technical definitions for sex-related terms to guide federal agencies, external partners, and the public in implementing the order correctly.

The Left's response to Trump's order and the HHS guidance has been to flood the zone with essays and peer-reviewed articles declaring these documents and the binary notion of sex itself unscientific, bigoted, and harmful. Many of these attempts are not worth responding to. But an article published last week in the San Francisco Chronicle is worth highlighting because it marks a notable shift in the public and scientific debate over sex and gender.

The article, titled “We're scientists who study sex and gender. Here's what Trump gets wrong about trans people,” is written by renowned evolutionary biologist Joan Roughgarden and psychologist Jaimie Veale. They present their piece as an expert rebuttal to Trump's executive order.

As an evolutionary biologist myself and a member of the small team of biologists and philosophers tasked with formulating the HHS definitions of “sex,” “male,” and “female,” I want to respond to this latest attempt to shift the debate and redefine biological reality in service of an ideological agenda.

Roughgarden and Veale's first move is to try to root transgenderism in biology by claiming that “transgender people are a natural part of the human species” who have existed “across cultures and through time.” This statement is misleading. It relies on yet another definitional sleight of hand in which activists expand the definition of transgender into “an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression, or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.” But no reasonable person, let alone any biologist, denies that masculine girls and women, or feminine boys and men, are natural parts of human variation. Of course they are. And it must be pointed out that gay and lesbian people are considered transgender according to this expansive definition, as being attracted to the same sex is a behavior that “does not conform to that typically associated” with one's sex.

Calling such people “transgender,” a label that implies a pathological misalignment between one's brain and body, is both regressive and harmful. It is regressive because it effectively reclassifies masculine girls as boys and feminine boys as girls. And it's harmful because activists have constructed a “gender-affirming” medical pathway — puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries — designed to “correct” this perceived misalignment. This pathway permanently alters healthy bodies and can render people sterile and medically dependent for life.

Roughgarden and Veale defend this medical pathway and cite seven major medical associations that “support transgender people and their right to appropriate care.” But statements from medical associations are not a substitute for evidence. And as revealed in the highest-quality systematic reviews conducted to date by multiple countries, there is no clear evidence of benefit and a growing list of known harms and possible risks. It is therefore grossly irresponsible for the authors to characterize these interventions as “appropriate care” when the available evidence provides no basis for such a claim.

Roughgarden and Veale then pivot to the central aim of their essay, which is to set the record straight on the biology of sex and gender. Here, we witness an attempt to redefine the debate landscape in real-time.

They begin with an apparent concession to sex realists such as myself. While medical practice might rely on “practical but inconsistent markers to define sex, such as genitals, chromosomes and hormones,” they argue that these traits only “statistically correlate with human sex, but do not define it.” They go on to accept the universal, binary definition of the sexes: “males make small gametes (sperm), females make large gametes (eggs).”

But immediately after this concession, Roughgarden and Veale unveil a new framework entirely. They claim that although an individual's sex is defined in terms of gamete production, “gender” refers to “all the anatomical and behavioral traits that correlate with sex taken together.” “Beyond gamete size,” they write, “everything else — including secondary sex characteristics, body size, shape, color, behavior and social roles — is gender.”

Everything beyond gametes is now gender?

It is difficult to overstate how radical a departure this is from the activists' prior rhetoric. Until recently, activists insisted that sex encompassed a wide array of biological traits, such as chromosomes, hormones, genitalia, and secondary sex characteristics, while gender referred to a deeply rooted internal sense of identity that related to culturally defined social roles, behaviors, and forms of expression. But now, suddenly, we are told that “gender” includes sex chromosomes, height, body size, shape, and behavior?

In biology, all of these traits fall under the well-established concept of sexual dimorphism, which refers to physical, physiological, and behavioral differences between males and females that often evolve due to divergent selection pressures. Think of the elaborate plumage of male peacocks and birds of paradise, the antlers and combat behavior of male deer competing for mates, or the characteristic hormone profiles of male and female mammals. According to Roughgarden and Veale, all of this is now “gender.”

This reclassification is both incoherent and unnecessary. We already have precise biological terms to describe these differences. Which raises the question: Why are they doing this? I believe there are two main reasons.

First, I believe they are moving in this direction because activists are losing the debate over the biology of sex. The gamete-based definition of sex is a fundamental, universal, and powerfully predictive concept in biology, so well established and so indispensable that denying it is futile. Entire fields of evolutionary biology collapse into incoherence once the gamete-based definition is abandoned. Sexual selection, parental investment theory, and the very evolution of the sexes become totally nonsensical without it. The prior activist framework for “sex” as a socially constructed, multivariate spectrum of traits simply cannot support modern biology. The centrality of gametes in the biology of sex can perhaps be suppressed temporarily during the peak of a moral panic, but it cannot be ignored forever.

Second, and more ideologically, this strategic concession on sex, paired with a sweeping redefinition of gender, allows activists to appear reasonable on the biology while preserving their justification for medically transitioning minors and adults. That justification depends on the claim that a fundamental misalignment between a person's brain and body can occur during development. To get there, Roughgarden and Veale invoke the developmental biology of sexual differentiation to argue that “trans and other gender diverse people” arise from the following process:

“From conception to birth, the human body and brain develop in a shifting hormonal environment. In mammals, genital structures develop early in fetal life, whereas the brain and many other anatomical structures, as well as behavioral traits, develop later. If hormone levels vary during these stages, the brain and the rest of the body can develop along different developmental paths, which can result in trans and gender diverse people. This is a natural and expected variation in how human development unfolds.”

Once again, presenting this as the developmental mechanism underpinning transgender identity lacks a scientific justification. It is purely ideological. Yes, the hormonal environment during fetal development can influence sex-typical behavior. For instance, female fetuses exposed to elevated levels of testosterone and other androgens are more likely to be same-sex attracted and show behavioral profiles more commonly associated with males. This is well established and widely accepted among biologists. But framing these effects as the proximate cause of “transgenderism,” rather than as contributors to natural variations in sex nonconformity or sexual orientation, is scientifically baseless.

Studies purporting to show that the brains of trans-identified people resemble those of the sex they identify with rather than their biological sex are plagued by the failure to control for sexual orientation. This matters because the majority of trans-identified people are same-sex attracted. When sexual orientation is properly controlled for, the alleged “cross-sex shift” in brain structure disappears. In other words, these “transgender brain” studies are simply rediscovering well-known cross-sex patterns in certain brain regions associated with same-sex attraction. They are not demonstrating a distinct neurobiological basis or mechanism for transgender identity.

When viewed without an ideological filter, the enterprise of “gender-affirming care” is best understood as an inverted form of gay conversion therapy, one in which the healthy bodies of ordinary gender-nonconforming people are altered to “match” their minds, rather than the traditional and rightly condemned approach of attempting to alter people's minds to “match” their bodies.

Because of this, we must resist this attempted reframing of the entire debate. Yes, sex is binary and rooted in whether a person's reproductive anatomy has the biological function to produce either sperm or ova. But no, everything else is not “gender.” And no, sex nonconformity or homosexuality does not make a person “transgender.” These are ordinary, natural variations within each sex, and such people are best left alone to grow up healthy and whole.

HOW INSURANCE MANDATES AND POLICY INCENTIVES DRIVE AUTISM DIAGNOSES

Roughgarden and Veale end their essay with an appeal to Christians, invoking the Golden Rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” But countless happy, well-adjusted gay and lesbian adults recognize that, had they grown up today, they would have been prime targets for activists such as Roughgarden and Veale, who would have placed them under the transgender umbrella and medicalized their adolescent distress. They are grateful this didn't happen to them, and they wish the same protection for the sex-nonconforming children of today.

And certainly, the growing number of detransitioners, young people who were permanently harmed by “gender-affirming care,” wish that modern gender ideologues had not done unto them what was done to them.

The Brazilian mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt‘s 11-year-old nephew has been arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for overstaying her visa by decades.

Bruna Caroline Ferreria was formerly engaged to Michael Leavitt, the press secretary's brother. The pair has joint custody over their son, CNN reported.

Ferreria has lived in the United States illegally since overstaying her visa in June 1999, and her attorney said she is a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. She was unable to renew her status during President Donald Trump's first term, the attorney added.

Ferreria is the mother of Leavitt's nephew, and they have not spoken in many years, a source familiar with the situation told the Washington Examiner. The child has lived full-time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born and has never lived with his mother, they added.

She was arrested while driving to pick up her son in New Hampshire, CNN reported. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson referred to her as a “criminal illegal alien from Brazil” and confirmed her arrest. The spokesperson also noted Ferreria has a prior arrest for battery.

Ferreira's attorney, Todd Pomerleau, said she is a good mother and that he is fighting to get her out of custody.

“I'm just trying to fight to get her out of jail,” Pomerleau said. “She should not be sitting in a jail hours away from her family and from her child's life. She's a great mom, and from what I heard, I think he's been a pretty good dad.”

The DHS spokesperson said Ferreira is being detained in Louisiana and is undergoing removal proceedings.

“She entered the U.S. on a B2 tourist visa that required her to depart the U.S. by June 6, 1999,” the spokesperson said. “She is currently at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center and is in removal proceedings. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.”

Michael Leavitt told WMUR that he wants the best for his son, and his biggest concern is his son's safety and well-being following the arrest.

A GoFundMe has been started for Ferreira by her sister, Graziela Dos Santos Rodrigues, for legal fees and expenses. More than $16,500 has been raised so far. Rodrigues said Ferreira was brought to the U.S. as a child in December 1998.

“My family is going through one of the most difficult moments of our lives, and we're reaching out with a humble plea for help,” Rodrigues wrote. “My sister, Bruna, was recently detained by immigration and is now fighting to stay in the country she has called home for nearly her entire life.”

“Since then, she has done everything in her power to build a stable, honest life here,” she added. “She has maintained her legal status through DACA, followed every requirement, and has always strived to do the right thing.”

Rodrigues said Ferreira's absence has been “especially painful” for her son, “who needs his mother and hopes every single day that she'll be home in time for the holidays.”

LEAVITT DOES DAMAGE CONTROL AFTER ‘FRUSTRATED' TRUMP LASHES OUT AT REPORTER AND CALLS FOR EXECUTING DEMOCRATS

Trump attempted to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program during his first term but was rebuffed by the court for not taking the proper steps to do so. DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin recently told the Associated Press that those under DACA “are not automatically protected from deportations,” and added that “DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) is continuing to speak out about his controversial remarks that drew the ire of President Donald Trump. 

The senator appeared on Tuesday's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! to discuss the fallout of a video Kelly made last week with five other members of Congress, encouraging military members and intelligence community personnel to reject “illegal orders.” Kelly, along with Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), Rep. Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-PA), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), all emphasized that troops and intelligence community members “must refuse illegal orders.” 

“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law,” Slotkin said in the video. “Don't give up the ship,” the Democrats all said as the video concluded. Trump responded to the video by accusing the Democrats of sedition and treason.  

“The threats to our Constitution aren't just coming from abroad, but from right here at home,” the six congressional representatives said in the video. “Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders. No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.”

Kelly expressed shock and dismay that Trump would have a problem with their statement.

“Well, it's kind of shocking that the president, you know, we said something, which is basically ‘follow the law,' and the president of the United States says ‘kill them,'” Kelly told Kimmel. “Hang them, execute them, try them for sedition. I served 25 years in the United States Navy, you know. 

“I've almost gotten killed for this country, multiple times, almost shot down over Iraq and Kuwait, had a missile blow up next to my airplane,” Kelly said. “I got on a rocket ship four times, millions of pounds of rocket fuel, for this nation. And then, I wake up one day, and I got the president of the United States threatening me with my life, that I'm going to be hanged?” 

“The president, when he says these things, there are consequences,” Kelly told Kimmel. “And by the way, isn't this the guy two months ago that said ‘we've got to stop this political violence issue? He didn't even make it to Thanksgiving.”

“You can't keep track of this guy and what he says,” Kelly said, without addressing Trump by name or title. “I'll tell you this, though: I'm not backing down. We've said something very simple — members of the military need to follow the law. We wanted to say we have their backs.”

“His response: kill them,” Kelly said.

The conversation then turned to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who, on Tuesday, announced that he would open an investigation into Kelly's conduct. Kimmel mentioned it during the interview with Kelly. The senator would go on to blast Hegseth, saying he is unqualified for the job. 

“And then you have Pete Hegseth, who runs the Department of War, is going to open an investigation into you, I assume, into your colleagues,” Kimmel said. “You will have to be interviewed by the FBI, and they're trying to find what, exactly? I mean, what even is sedition?”

“Well, this is the investigation because of what Donald Trump said, from what I can tell,” Kelly said.

“And I don't know Pete Hegseth well. I sat on the committee that ultimately had to confirm him, so I know a little bit about his background. He's totally unqualified,” Kelly added, without answering the question Kimmel asked him. 

Kelly continued to bash Hegseth instead of answering Kimmel's question about the announced FBI investigation or what sedition is. 

“Nothing against journalists, they play a very important role in our society,” Kelly said. “But he's not qualified for this job. And from what I can tell, and talking to some of my Republican colleagues, I mean, he just wants to please the president.” 

MARK KELLY STRIKES DEFIANT TONE IN THE FACE OF PENTAGON INVESTIGATION: ‘HE'S NOT GOING TO SILENCE US'

“And this is what he can do this week, he can go after me, under the Uniform Code of military justice, which is the law in the military,” Kelly added, while still not answering Kimmel's question about sedition. “Which is kind of wild, because we recited something in the Uniform Code of military justice, and he's going to prosecute me, under the Uniform Code of military justice, for reciting the Uniform Code of military justice.”

“It is so ridiculous, it's almost like you can't make this s*** up,” Kelly said. ","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The pursuit of Mark Kelly in the military-justice system sends a clear message to service members and veterans.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Mark Kelly thought he was merely stating the obvious. Earlier this month, the Arizona senator joined five other congressional Democrats to film a message addressed to members of the military. “You can refuse illegal orders. You must refuse illegal orders,” they said.

An ordinary president, Kelly told us on Tuesday afternoon, would have responded to the video by affirming that troops should of course follow lawful orders. “But not this guy,” he added. “We basically said, ‘Follow the law.' And he said, ‘Kill them.'”

The video to service members was the second Kelly had recently released. The former Navy pilot and astronaut took to social media with a group of fellow Democrats last month to urge the public to peacefully resist President Donald Trump's placement of troops in U.S. cities and to “step up for the country we all love.” Like so much else that members of Congress push online to connect with voters or stump for campaign funds, their video ahead of nationwide “No Kings” protests in October generated little national buzz.

Earlier this month, the group filmed its second message, amid U.S. strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, a campaign of questionable legal validity. Like the first, the video message was intended as a “digital play” to generate views and support, according to two Democratic Senate staffers with knowledge of the matter. “It was supposed to be nothing more than that,” one of the aides told us.

In the week since, it has become very much more than that. President Trump suggested trying and executing the lawmakers for sedition. A wave of violent threats against them followed. Then Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth launched a review of what he termed “serious allegations of misconduct” into Kelly, who retired as a Naval captain in 2011. Kelly now faces the possibility of being recalled to active duty to be court-martialed for his statements. If convicted, he could be dismissed from the service, lose his pension, and possibly be imprisoned. (Kelly is the only lawmaker in the video who reached 20 years in the service, therefore making him an official military retiree eligible for recall.)

If the first 10 months of the second Trump administration showed how willing the president and his Cabinet were to use the criminal-justice system against their perceived enemies, the pursuit of Kelly extends that retribution campaign to the machinery of military justice in a potentially destructive way.

Experts in military law say Hegseth's gambit is unlikely to stand up in court, because Kelly's apparent transgression consisted of restating service members' oft-cited responsibility to act within the law, as defined by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, the services' equivalent of the U.S. criminal code.

But even if the pursuit of Kelly—who flew combat missions in the Gulf War and was later sent into space by NASA before becoming a U.S. senator—ultimately fails, the move sends a clear warning to other officers and military retirees who might want to speak up.

Before recording the two videos, the group, spearheaded by Elissa Slotkin, a Michigan senator and former CIA officer, had discussed what they could do to publicly push back as Trump pulled the military into new and, from their perspective, troubling missions, Kelly told us. The group also included Representatives Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chrissy Houlahan and Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania. Some of the lawmakers sat on committees with oversight of the military; they all wanted service members to know “that we have their backs,” Kelly said.

The first suggestion that the latest video had found an audience—albeit a hostile one—was a Fox News appearance the following day by Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff. He said the lawmakers' remarks amounted to an “insurrection” and a “general call for revolt.”

“There is nothing graver that you could possibly say as a United States senator than encouraging, urging, directing members of the armed forces of the United States, or the clandestine services of the United States, to defy their president, defy their chain of command,” Miller said.

By the next morning, the president, on Truth Social, blasted what he called “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL” and reposted suggestions that the lawmakers be hanged. “Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,” Trump wrote. “An example MUST BE SET.”

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Trump was threatening the Democrats with execution. But she called their statements “very, very dangerous” and perhaps illegal.

In his first term, Trump had considered recalling both retired Army General Stanley McChrystal and retired Admiral William H. McRaven to active duty so they could be court-martialed for perceived disloyalty, according to a 2022 memoir, A Sacred Oath, by former Defense Secretary Mark Esper. Esper wrote that he and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley talked Trump out of it.

Hegseth had a different response. He initially posted a relatively muted message on his personal X account that said the video signified a case of “Stage 4 TDS,” or Trump Derangement Syndrome. But the following evening, he amplified a White House social-media post that stamped the word seditious over the lawmakers' images in the video. And on Monday, he decried the “seditious six,” labeling their circumvention of Trump's command authority “despicable, reckless, and false.”

Earlier today, the Pentagon posted a memo in which Hegseth ordered the Navy to review Kelly's “potentially unlawful comments.”

Hegseth argued that by citing his rank and Navy service in the video, Kelly was attempting to issue a pseudo-order to the troops. “Kelly's conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately,” Hegseth wrote.

Kelly's office also has been notified of an FBI request to speak to the senator about the video, according to an aide. Other lawmakers involved received the same request, though where the FBI's interest lies remains unclear. Kelly has not spoken to federal authorities. But in interviews and on social media, he has said he would not be intimidated or “silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”

Hegseth has clashed with Kelly before, as he has with most Democrats on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. During Hegseth's confirmation process, in which the nominee forcefully denied allegations of sexual assault and alcohol abuse, Kelly questioned whether Hegseth had adequate experience for the job. Kelly retired at a higher rank than Hegseth, who was a major in the Army National Guard.

The statements by Trump and Hegseth appear to have unleashed a deluge of intimidation, including a bomb threat against Crow's Colorado office and hundreds of threats to Slotkin. Slotkin, who made multiple deployments with the CIA in Iraq, typically reports one or two higher-level threats to Capitol Police each month. Since Trump's threats, her office has reported more than 80, according to a Senate aide. The Michigan senator also began receiving Capitol Police protection after Trump's posts.

Threats against Kelly increased, too. He and his aides declined to elaborate, a stance Kelly and those close to him have taken in the years since his wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, was shot in the head during a 2011 attempted assassination that left six dead and her and 12 others wounded. In recent years, Kelly was among the lawmakers who were spending more campaign funds on security-related expenses than nearly anyone else in Congress, according to an analysis by The Arizona Republic.

(In Arizona, Kelly is sometimes accompanied by security, although he relishes flying his small plane alone to far-flung events in the sprawling desert.)

“I'm not backing down. I'm not shutting up,” Kelly told us. “If somebody in my situation was to do that, what is the message that sends to not only service members but government employees? How about to just U.S. citizens about what our First Amendment rights are?”

Arizona's other senator, Democrat Ruben Gallego, a Marine Corps veteran, said that Trump was weaponizing the military against one of its own. “He's trying to distract also from his problems right now,” Gallego told us, citing tensions within the GOP, economic troubles, and the furor over the Epstein files.

Numerous Republican veterans in Congress joined the administration in condemning the Democrats' video. But Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska praised Kelly's military and NASA service on X. “To accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong,” she wrote. “The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation.”

Hegseth would have a difficult task crafting a viable case against Kelly, even if the Navy decides to recall him, according to experts in military justice. Before reaching a military court, the case against him would have to clear various pretrial hurdles.

Hegseth appeared to be making a case on social media to charge Kelly under Article 133 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, commonly known as “conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman,” and Article 134, a wide-ranging statute that addresses conduct that harms good order and discipline or brings discredit to the unit. But for that “you need actual evidence—Hegseth saying it is so is not enough,” Eric Carpenter, a professor of military law at Florida International University and a former Army lawyer, told us.

The Uniform Code of Military Justice also has provisions outlawing mutiny, sedition, and other crimes. But Carpenter explained that telling troops to follow the law shouldn't constitute any kind of offense. “While I was on active duty, I regularly briefed soldiers on this framework,” he added. “I wasn't committing a crime, and neither was Senator or Captain Kelly.”

Imagine we had cheap and abundant energy. Some radical ideas are actually within our reach.

What could you do with energy that's cheap, clean, and near unlimited?

You could live in a home built to your precise needs that stays cozy and cool all year long. You could swim in a heated pool filled with ultra-pure recycled water. You could grill a steak grown in a factory, from cell on up, marbled, textured, and flavored to perfection. You could visit a nature preserve on land reclaimed from mines and farms, teeming with once-endangered animal life. You could get whisked comfortably and quietly anywhere by robots, whether down the street or the other side of the world. You could plan every weekend outing for the next month, counting on reliable, far-reaching weather forecasts. And all of your garbage would break down into its constituent elements, destined to be reassembled into new shoes, cars, and refrigerators.

This is all speculation, but the pace of improvement in clean energy and the scale of its deployment put these ideas within the realm of possibility.

Energy shapes the limits of what a society can build, sustain, and imagine, and the more of it we have at our disposal, the further we can push those boundaries. What we would decide to do with vastly more energy has huge implications for our politics, our economy, our environment, and our prosperity.

This year, the world is poised to spend $2.2 trillion on clean energy — power from the wind, the sun, the water, and splitting atoms. It also includes upgrades to the power grid, new forms of energy storage, and increased efficiency.

This investment has mostly been trumpeted as a way to help limit climate change. Humanity's collective deployment of clean energy and increasing efficiency so far has already helped take some of the worst-case scenarios off the table.

However, climate change is a low political priority now. A more compelling case for clean energy is that it's often the best way to get cheap energy, and to get a lot of it. The deployment of wind and solar power around the world continues to defy expectations, while the growth trajectory of energy storage is following close behind. This suite of technologies is taking off around the world — not because of a carbon tax or even environmental concerns, but because clean energy is simply better at meeting the needs of a moment when energy appetites are growing.

Suppose we alter the framing and approach solving climate change not as a task merely of curbing emissions, but of increasing access and lowering costs of better ways to power the world even further. It's an approach that leads with prosperity and quality of life, while creating a more stable climate in the process.

If we make it a priority to get more clean energy, that raises the interesting — and fun — question of what we should do with it. After all, we're not collecting energy for the sake of energy but to do stuff.

Cheap, clean, plentiful energy doesn't just help people save money on their power bills; it unlocks new industries, makes thorny political problems moot, and helps repair the planet. These use cases are important motivations for why the transition to clean energy needs to happen and how it can bring about a better world for all of us. It's why we're doing this at all.

We can exchange heat and electrons for just about anything on Earth. How much energy a person uses is an effective proxy for how well off they are — how much food they can eat, how comfortable they are at home, how educated they are. We can see this play out in the cost and quality of lighting, which, in the UK alone, dropped 99.9 percent since 1700, tracing how economies grew as people shifted from campfires, to kerosene lamps, to LED bulbs, and beyond.

The global energy landscape is changing rapidly. Fossil fuels are still the dominant ways we heat, power, and get around the world, but renewable energy capacity is rocketing upward.

“Energy is prosperity,” said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy, a high-tech clean energy funding firm founded by Bill Gates in 2015. “Energy is the capacity to do work. Energy is the capacity to build things, to make things, to move things.”

The potential of near-unlimited energy has been tantalizing researchers for decades, since the last big energy revolution, the dawn of the nuclear age.

“It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter, will know of great periodic regional famines in the world only as matters of history, will travel effortlessly over the seas and under them and through the air with a minimum of danger and at great speeds, and will experience a lifespan far longer than ours, as disease yields and man comes to understand what causes him to age,” said Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, in 1954. “This is the forecast for an age of peace.”

Nuclear power didn't make this dream come true. It did provide huge amounts of electricity, but its construction and operating costs rose as other energy sources got cheaper. Meanwhile, environmental activists and some policymakers shifted their energy strategy to conservation rather than expanding the pool of power. Yet, the prospect of producing energy in such vast quantities that its cost is a minor concern is still one that lures scientists, engineers, and investors. And the recent technology trends do give some observers hope that this dream is within reach.

“Long-term, I think there's good reason to think that at least lots of places in the world will have much less expensive and more stable energy, especially once they've made the investment in the next generation infrastructure,” said Daniel Vermeer, a researcher at Duke University studying the future of energy. “And I think that's going to happen in a lot of places.”

How much more energy? “I think we're looking at double the electricity production,” Vermeer said.

So, in the best tradition of economic thought experiments, let's assume a can opener. What do we open first?

If we vastly increase our energy supply from current levels, food and water are where we can get the most bang for the British Thermal Unit (BTU). “It's so fundamental to human prosperity,” Vermeer said. “It's also where people will see benefits the fastest.”

We already spend a huge amount of our energy to produce food, and agriculture accounts for one-third of humanity's greenhouse gas output. The fertilizer used to grow crops alone accounts for 5 percent of the world's greenhouse gases — more than aviation and shipping combined — and most fertilizers rely on natural gas as a feedstock. If we had the power and materials to produce more zero-emissions fertilizer, farmers could extract greater yields from the same amount of land. And decarbonizing the supply chain with electric tractors and trucks to bring food to markets would further increase efficiency. Getting the most out of our existing farms will be essential to feeding the world's growing population. Otherwise, expanding farms will continue to devour forests and wildlands.

The next generation of farming techniques could create similar yields on even smaller plots of land, allowing food to be produced year round, nearer to major population centers or even within them. One approach is vertical farming, where crops are grown vertically in controlled indoor environments instead of horizontally across fields. Many vertical farming techniques are already being used today. But with more cheap energy to run pumps, lights, and fans, we can scale this up further.

Water is essential to all life as we know it, and we haven't been doing a great job of judiciously using it. In recent years, some major cities have been teetering on the brink of running out of water. And with average temperatures rising, many regions are poised to see more severe droughts.

However, two-thirds of the world is covered in water, and widespread desalination would allow the world to tap into that vast, currently undrinkable supply. The main techniques for desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis, and right now, both require a lot of energy. But, if there's a lot of cheap power on tap, then desalination could be a primary source of water for some communities, allowing freshwater rivers and aquifers to recharge. It would also resolve many of the political conflicts around water.

Unlimited energy could allow us to bioengineer our food sources from individual nutrients to maximize nourishment. Precision fermentation, or electro-food, is an emerging technology that uses specially designed microorganisms like yeast or bacteria to make proteins, fats, or nutrients like those found in animal products. Instead of raising cows or chickens, you could “brew” milk, eggs, or meat ingredients in fermentation tanks — just like the process of making beer.

Cheap, clean electricity can power these breweries as they use captured carbon and hydrogen as ingredients. Companies are already selling animal-free dairy and egg proteins made this way. As renewable power becomes abundant, precision fermentation could scale up, feeding growing populations with a fraction of the land, water, and emissions of traditional agriculture

Now, let's take precision fermentation even further. Cultivating cells into whole steaks is starting to become possible, but it's an expensive and involved process. If this could truly get off the ground, it would have huge knock-on benefits for the environment. Raising livestock right now draws a huge toll in terms of land use, energy and water consumption, and waste production, not to mention the immense ethical problems embedded in raising and killing animals for food. If we can turn energy into meat that replaces conventional livestock, that would solve so many environmental issues all at once. But, convincing people to eat it remains a barrier. Already, there are seven states that have banned lab-grown meat. “Laboratory agriculture and producing things without animals is possible from a technical perspective, but we have to get a lot more sophisticated about how people make those decisions,” Toone said.

Whether or not you're bullish on AI, it's clear that more of our jobs and lives hinge on access to computing power and storage. Right now, data centers are a big part of the story of growing electricity demand, and speculation about their future energy needs is already starting to drive up electricity prices for ordinary people.

But with fewer energy constraints, more computing tools could become available to more people, and these resources can then be used to resolve some of our biggest energy and environmental challenges. It may also be a necessary investment for the US to retain a competitive edge. “I, for one, have become completely convinced that it's necessary to win at AI for national security,” said Neil Chatterjee, a former commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “How do we generate the power to win the AI race while keeping electricity affordable and not backsliding? There's no simple solution, but I'm confident we can get there.”

How can we mitigate their worst effects?

Utilities can require tech firms to pay a deposit to for their future power needs so they don't over-inflate their needs. Data centers can also face mandates to bring their own generation and energy storage, which could also support the broader grid.

Operators of these facilities can shift energy-intensive tasks to low-demand periods, though this flexibility may be limited. Their size incentivizes efficient electricity use, and computing will likely grow more energy-efficient over time as the technology improves.

AI can further accelerate the clean-energy transition by streamlining permitting applications for wind and solar projects, improving materials design, enhancing weather forecasting, and strengthening models of energy demand.

With food and water sorted, we can then start to chip away at the root cause of climate change: the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels that are heating up the planet. Halting climate change thus means stopping these emissions entirely. And in the increasingly likely scenario where we overshoot our goal of limiting global average temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, it also means deliberately pulling carbon back out from the environment. It's not enough to simply produce more energy; the world needs negative greenhouse gas emissions.

Humanity currently spews more than 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. So, to move the needle, we need to think about carbon management solutions that can work on this scale.

There are a few ways to do this. One is capturing carbon dioxide at the source. At conventional coal and natural gas-fired power plants, carbon capture systems currently impose a large parasitic load, around a quarter of the generator's power output. That makes it hard to build a business case for carbon capture at fossil fuel power plants. But other industrial processes, like steel production, also emit carbon dioxide, and point-source capture can decarbonize this and other processes that don't currently have an easy zero-emissions alternative.

We can also capture carbon dioxide straight from the air. There are already companies developing machines that can filter carbon from the atmosphere. Some businesses are also working on ways to pull carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater. The challenge is that it requires a lot of energy to move the amount of air and water needed to draw out significant amounts of carbon, which in turn raises the cost.

“Two things have to happen: One is that we have to continue to work to bring down the cost of air capture,” Toone said. Currently, it costs around $500 per ton to pull carbon dioxide out of the air. The goal is to get it down to $100 per ton or less. “Then societies have to become affluent enough that they're willing to do it and recognize the dangers caused by climate change,” Toone added.

Another approach is enhanced weathering, which speeds up natural processes where rocks like limestone react with carbon dioxide in rainwater, forming a chemical bond that permanently locks it away.

If you don't lock away carbon dioxide, you can put it to work. It's an important raw ingredient for chemicals and materials. You can use it to make fuels reconstituted from the air, polymers, enzymes, concrete, as well as make your drinks bubbly. This has the potential to become a trillion-dollar industry.

Waste is a mounting problem, and many synthetic materials like plastics have no natural mechanisms that break them down, making them a problem that can last for generations. Recycling plastic materials has largely failed to live up to the promise, and the bulk of plastic waste ends up in landfills. To meaningfully reuse and reconstitute polymers, the process needs to be competitive with producing virgin materials, which means the energy you use for recycling has to be dirt cheap. When we get there, we may be able to close the loop, making, unmaking, and remaking everything we need with minimal extraction from the Earth.

The next place to look is transportation. Cheap fossil fuels have shrunk the world, allowing people to cross continents and oceans in hours rather than months. How we get around is now the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Four-wheeled vehicles already have a glide path to zero emissions with electrification. The tougher challenges are going to be electrifying or decarbonizing bigger vehicles like ships and airplanes.

Container ships are the gargantuan worker ants of the global economy, transporting just about every tangible good around the world. Right now, most container ships burn some of the cheapest and dirtiest fuels imaginable, but with abundant clean energy, they could draw on cleaner sources of power. These ships may be too big to run on batteries, but with much cheaper, clean electricity, shipping companies can generate hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, or synthetic versions of conventional fuels, moving cargo without the carbon footprint.

Climate-friendly flying is still trying to get off the ground. Right now, there aren't any batteries that come anywhere close to the energy density of fossil fuels. Some airlines are deploying electric aircraft on shorter routes. However, without a breakthrough, long-haul flights will need to run on synthetic zero-emissions fuels, which demand vast quantities of low-cost energy. Or, they'll need a mechanism like direct air capture to offset their emissions.

With even more energy, we can begin thinking about commercializing promising innovations that exist only in labs or are still on the drawing board. Many of these ideas sound far-fetched, but abundant clean energy moves them into the realm of possibility.

Materials built molecule-first Imagine designing stuff the way you'd build a playlist: starting from tiny pieces and crafting exactly what you need. Shoes that bounce just right. Home insulation that actually understands seasons. Skin grafts that heal without scars. We already 3D print things, but scaling it is pricey and slow. Smarter, custom materials could make industrial printing faster, cleaner, and way less wasteful.

Space that's closer — and cleaner Getting to orbit still takes a ton of energy, and today's rocket fuels leave a pretty heavy carbon footprint. Pulling carbon dioxide out of the air could help offset launches, and cleaner electricity can make low-carbon fuels from the start. The result: space access that's not just cheaper, but easier on the planet.

Solar power that never sleeps Above the atmosphere, sunlight doesn't quit. Space-based solar collectors could soak up that uninterrupted energy and beam it back to Earth via microwaves. No clouds, no sunsets — just steady power when we need it.

Become a spacefaring civilization And instead of dragging every nut and bolt off Earth, we could mine asteroids for the raw materials already floating out there. That opens the door to building more in space — moon bases, deep-space missions, the whole sci-fi starter kit — without the crushing cost of launching every ounce from Earth.

Even if we could realize all of the exciting potential of this clean energy-powered future, some new problems could emerge if we're not careful.

First, there will be a big dislocation in the job market. There are almost 2 million people in the US working in coal, oil, and gas sectors — mining, building, transporting, and combusting these fuels. They will need new jobs or a soft landing pad that will help them move or retire. “We're potentially seeing huge shifts in governance and unionization around the world,” said Adam Cowart, who is on the faculty of foresight at the University of Houston.

Additionally, “abundant” does not necessarily mean “equal” when it comes to energy. In the year 2025, there are still 685 million people in the world who don't have access to electricity, and there's no guarantee that increasing the global supply of energy will benefit them without concerted policies to match.

Having more energy could also end up indulging people's worst impulses. Already, we've seen across much of the world that as fuels and electricity get cheaper, people end up driving bigger cars over longer distances, running their thermostats less efficiently, and eating more meat.

Valerie Thomas, professor of industrial engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, noted that our recent history shows that we have not used the energy we already have in a judicious way. “If we look back in history just a little bit, what do we do? We use it up on things maybe we don't even understand, like bigger houses with more air conditioning, or we would commute even longer distances,” Thomas said. It will take concerted effort to make sure new energy doesn't just go to frivolous uses.

And in her work looking at some of the poorest populations in the world, Thomas said she found that the key limits to prosperity are often things like local corruption, a lack of prenatal care, not enough vaccines, political instability, and bad economic policies. “What tends to be the barrier to the good life? I don't think it's energy,” Thomas said. That said, the world's poorest stand to gain the most from the transition to clean energy, not just for having more useful power in their lives but breathing in less pollution and having more economic autonomy.

The post-energy abundance world is not one where every problem is solved, but it's one with greater prosperity, improved human welfare, and generally a more stable climate. It will raise its own challenges, so there's no scenario where we can take it for granted.

The fossil fuel era, and much of human history, was governed by constraints. The age of clean energy is poised to be one that's more limited by imagination and choices, and the remaining solutions will be much more fun to implement.

What happens when you tell a generation they're special?

Gen Z is accused of a lot of things.

We're soft, too woke, and emotional snowflakes. We can't order drinks at the bar, we're not partying, and we can't make small talk. So it's no wonder why I tend to find myself standing in as my generation's lead defense attorney at the dinner table with family, particularly during this season of giving.

But what if there's some truth to all this? Could Gen Z's ethical codes and moral values really be diverging from previous generations? And what does it mean for society if it turns out that young people really are more individualistic and — gasp — maybe even “coddled”?

To answer these questions — and determine if it should matter that Gen Z doesn't want to drink or have tough conversations — I spoke with Daniel A. Cox, the director of the American Enterprise Institute's Survey Center on American Life, where he focuses his research on Gen Z and American families.

“Whether you're talking about educational institutions, political institutions, or religious institutions,” he told me, “we need people to come into these places and not think that they're the most important person in the room.” Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

You have a new report out that dives into the moral and ethical views that young Americans hold today. What's the upshot?

There's an individualistic orientation cutting across so many domains of life: education, religious life, family life, and views on marriage, and Americans seem to be judging everything in life by how well they meet our individual needs. Institutions and relationships only have purpose in helping us meet our own goals. That's been a fundamental shift. Now you're seeing it in basically every aspect of American life, and it's particularly dramatic for young people.

Young people want personal flexibility. And it has percolated around in various sorts of cultural trends that you may have seen or heard of, like the idea of going “no contact” with friends, parents, siblings, or partners and separating yourself from “toxic” people. The idea is that if these relationships are not serving your immediate needs well, the correct approach is to end them, instead of seeing that there is value in messy relationships and tending to them.

Wait, so we're essentially raising a generation of coddled narcissists and yappers who think they're main characters? (Kids these days!)

That might not be how I would characterize it, but there is a fundamental truth in that when you tell young people and kids that they're the most important thing, that they can be everything, that we kind of inculcate these values of personal achievement and betterment and improving yourself and knowing yourself — it's so much focused on these individual metrics as opposed to broader social needs.

And your research backed this up?

Yes. This generation has grown up understanding that their needs are different and need to take priority over anything else. It's the Lake Wobegon question. We asked people to what extent their parents thought that they were average or not when they were growing up.

For older Americans, most of them said that they thought their parents viewed them as average. But the youngest generation rejects this view. They're far more likely to think they are special, above average. Part of what's going on there is that parents today are investing so many more resources in their kids. They have smaller families. And so young people as children are getting so much more parental attention and resources. It's not as if this generation came out of the womb more narcissistic — it's that they are being raised in homes where their needs are often put above those of the family more broadly. And so that really shifts both the function of family life, [and] how individual members see themselves in it.

But how does that result in changing morals? What specifically are young people valuing differently?

It creates an imperative for self-help and self-improvement: that there is so much happening out there, that it's a really tough world, and that I need an edge, I need to put all my resources, all my focus, into improving myself.

You see this in the dating context: whether they're manosphere-adjacent types or not, but influential voices arguing for healthy eating, working out, focusing on yourself. All these things are about sort of self-improvement for the point of dating, but none of them focus on building out a more robust social network, helping your friends, seeing what you can do to be of service to your community. And those things are actually really important for well-being.

Young people are also focused on a concept of cultural curation, that we want to curate our own experiences and our own ways of being. And that leads to there being no “right” way to be, so you can be anything, as opposed to sort of traditionally when we said, “No, there are institutions that will guide you and help form your conscience and help you live a good life.”

How does that affect young people's views of sex, gender, and socializing?

What's really interesting is to compare millennials and Gen Z. For millennials, there was a growing openness to different ways of living, different sexual identities, and when you think about sexual ethics, it was a sort of stark change from the baby boomer generation. Premarital sex, sex between people of the same gender, were all more acceptable for millennials. Some people thought that this would just continue with Gen Z, that we are seeing this long time trend towards growing acceptability of a variety of different personal behaviors, a variety of different sexual behaviors.

But there's a problem when you don't have any limits like that. Some of the most hedonistic, self-serving, and destructive behavior that ought probably to be judged as inappropriate or harmful gets caught up in the same ethos of, well, we need to be accepting of people who make different decisions. And so part of what Gen Z's wrestling with now is where to draw some of those lines.

The desire for “traditional” lifestyles or living is really a reflection of this: wanting to draw some firmer lines about what's right and what's wrong. The difference is that a lot of this negotiating is happening online, since institutions are playing a far smaller role in laying out acceptable versus unacceptable behavior.

So you see a lot of young people who are wrestling with questions of morality and ethics in places like Reddit — the “Am I the Asshole?” subreddit, for example. Young people are essentially crowdsourcing morals. But there's a tension there: The idea that we just all want to live completely unconstrained lives of personal freedom is running into young people seeing there are real downsides to it.

In what other areas is Gen Z different?

One aspect is free expression and free speech. We found that young women are most likely to say that you should feel free to express yourself, even if it makes other people around you uncomfortable. Again, it's this idea that my individual needs trump any kind of social consequence.

There's also a decline in drinking among Gen Z and the youngest adults. We've been aware of that trend for some time, but it turns out there's a moral dimension to this. So many young men view drinking alcohol as morally wrong. We found some 27 percent of young men ages 18 to 29 held that view, compared to 14 percent of seniors (65+).

It might be tied up with the more health-conscious sort of lifestyle and experiences of young people. They view that there are businesses out there whose sole purpose is to sell products that aren't good for you. But it's also tied to the fact that alcohol has historically been a social lubricant, and this generation is also socializing less and differently than previous generations.

It might also be that drinking alcohol is viewed as less of a social activity at all among this generation. When I was growing up, going drinking meant always hanging out with your friends. It wasn't an activity you did by yourself, even if you were at a pre-party or whatever you were doing. It was at its heart something that was communal. That may not be how Gen Z is understanding it. They don't necessarily see the social benefits of drinking and alcohol consumption.

So I hear that often from Zoomers who are younger than me, but then I hear the rebuttal that this trend is tied to economic anxiety: it's too expensive to go out, it's too expensive to buy drinks, etc. But it seems there's a moral dimension underlying it.

I get frustrated a little bit about some of the national discourse around this stuff because we, especially, but not just pollsters and social scientists, like to think that every generation is sort of having novel experiences: that whether it's due to technology or changes in culture or society, that this new generation has things entirely different. But most generations of young people who, when they got their first job, were financially strapped, or were eking it by, have socialized like this. So I don't think it's a strong argument to sort of say, “Well, we can't go out because it's too expensive.” What is actually happening is people don't want to go out because there's this sort of pronounced feeling of risk aversion.

I've heard a lot about a so-called rise in religious belief, in prayer, in spirituality among young people. It was one of the big claims the right was making over the last year, to show a cultural swing. You've also done some research and thinking on this, and you're critical — is it more about making an aesthetic out of religion?

Yes, and like an identity marker. And again, I don't want to in any way diminish the meaning of these activities. So if you download a prayer app on your phone, or a meditation app, these may be things that are important to you and your well-being, but they are in every sense individual.

Most people are not doing these activities in group settings. They're not going out and thinking about how they can be of service to their community or other members of their church or place of worship. They're not necessarily volunteering or wanting to engage in educative activities. It's in service of their own well-being or personal growth.

And so that is their defining feature. And it's kind of an outgrowth, the newest iteration, of self-help culture of the '90s. And it becomes very difficult, once you have ingrained that this is how things should be, to change your view of how prayer and religion should work.

Did you find any ways to prove this difference?

We asked a question in the survey; we asked about prayer. Not just frequency of prayer — we know young people pray less than older folks — but we asked, among those who do pray, “Are you praying for yourself? Are you praying for someone else?” And one of the biggest generation gaps that we see in this survey was when it came to people praying for others. Only 46 percent of young women who prayed said that they prayed on behalf of someone else compared to 72 percent of senior women. And that's just a huge gap. We do see gaps among younger and older men, but we see huge gaps among women.

But aren't older people more likely to have more and deeper bonds and relationships, and want to pray for other people?

I think it's partly cultural. If you were raised in a church, you sort of realize and understand that you go in there, you're not the most important person there. The experience is to be outward-focused, to focus on the needs of, and the commitment you have to, the faith, to your religious leaders, to God, depending on your faith. In the case of prayer, you can certainly pray for a family member, an aunt and uncle, a grandparent, you don't need to be married, you don't need to have kids. But I think you do need to have the experiences of learning and seeing this modeled in ways that make sense.

So how does this all translate to young people's politics, political identities, their views of life going forward?

It explains why so many young people want to call themselves independents and are distrustful of political parties. The rise of individualism and the decline in institutional trust are the engines of populism. It really becomes difficult to govern when people are so mistrusting. It gets really difficult to assemble coalitions. You have this experience of either political party, once they attain power, it becomes very difficult to keep it, because people are just always dissatisfied and always distrustful.

And you see it in views of political parties: The group that is most likely to say that they have an unfavorable opinion of both political parties is young men. So you have this political disaffection that becomes a hallmark of the politics of young people, again, especially young men, because they're growing up in a time of political polarization, deep distrust, and individualism.

Pope Leo's politics are more complicated than simply “anti-Trump.”

For the first time in history, the pope is an American — from Chicago, no less. And like many Americans, Pope Leo XIV seems to love a good yap. Whether it concerns President Donald Trump's immigration policies or the use of artificial intelligence in popular entertainment, Leo has not been shy about expressing his views (he recently said he uses a different starting word every day when playing the New York Times's Wordle game.)

An American pope speaking about American issues, and in a manner that at least seems to be an implicit criticism of the American president, would be big news in any era. But this is an interesting moment. Right-leaning “tradcath” converts to Catholicism are increasingly influential, and along with some voices in tech and on the right, are getting more angry about what they see as the Vatican's turn to “wokeness” — so much so that the JD Vance ally and venture capitalist Peter Thiel recently warned the vice president, a Catholic convert, against remaining too loyal or close to a “woke American pope” while musing about the Antichrist.

Given all this, I thought there would be particular value in speaking with someone who covers not only the pope and the Vatican full-time, but also Catholics in American politics.

Catholic social teaching is the collection of traditions, principles, and beliefs, based in the Bible, natural law, and papal writings, that outline how people should be treated and how societies should be organized. Usually, these principles are condensed into seven themes:

So I reached out to Michael Sean Winters, a longtime columnist for the National Catholic Reporter, to discuss all things Pope Leo and to get a better sense of whether there really is tension between the freshman pontiff and the US president (and that president's supporters), learn more about why Pope Leo seems so focused on immigration, and get a better sense of why Leo also seems deeply worried about the role AI will play in the future. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length.

I've noticed lately that people on both sides of the political divide are interpreting Pope Leo's comments as unusually political or unusually focused on domestic concerns in the US. Some people go so far as to suggest he's pushing back on the Trump administration. Are they onto something?

I would frame it differently. It's not uncommon for popes to speak about ethics that have political consequences. But what's quite different here is that he can speak and answer in Midwestern English. We are hearing directly from the pope, not through an interpreter or based on a translation.

With Francis, we heard an interpreter saying what he had said in Spanish or Italian and translating it into English. With Leo, when he speaks in English, it lands differently. It breaks through secular media differently and it's becoming a different kind of challenge for conservative Catholics who used to say, “Oh, well, poor Pope Francis, the benighted Argentine, he doesn't understand the United States.” That dog doesn't hunt. So it's not so much that this pope is saying more, it's that it's landing in the American church and the wider American culture differently from previous popes.

There's one other thing, too: Popes don't usually talk to the press with any regularity. They have those press conferences on the airplane when they're going on a trip, and that's about it. Leo has gotten into the habit of taking a few questions every Tuesday when he's leaving Castel Gandolfo [the papal palace] after his day off, and so that's the other just kind of practical thing, that it's breaking through for that reason.

Now, how much of Pope-Leo-as-anti-MAGA is real versus liberal wish-casting?

I wouldn't frame it that way. It's not a pastor's job to pick sides in political fights. There are people in the pews who are baptized Catholics who belong to MAGA. Certainly as a Catholic, we believe our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ can come to birth in the heart of a conservative or a liberal or anyone.

And I say to liberals: If you had an aggressively pro-choice Democratic Catholic president, the questions would be about that, and you would be getting responses to that from the pope. The Church does not fit neatly into any political party in any country, in any century — because it's a church. We're always looking beyond the horizon of human knowledge and human experience. We deal with different frames of reference. Whenever you're reducing a religious posture in any faith to a kind of political program, you're missing something.

That said, do I think Leo is anti-MAGA — at least to the degree that MAGA falls far short of the truths that Catholic social teaching puts forward for the organization of society? Yes. By that standard, every pope is going to be anti-MAGA — in the same way that every pope is going to be opposed to war.

Relatedly, is this a fight between the Vatican and MAGA Catholics, or is this more a case of MAGA Catholics throwing rocks at the papal throne? In other words, how much — if at all — do you think the pope cares about these people's criticisms?

So I was at the US bishops' conference meeting reporting on it for the National Catholic Reporter, and what was very clear is there was a group of conservative bishops in the United States who for a variety of reasons were not enthusiastic about Pope Francis. And they thought, “Well, no pope is pope forever. Francis is in his 80s.” There was this idea that Francis was like bad weather; he was inevitably going to pass. It reminds me of an old Italian saying: “There's nothing deader than a dead pope.”

You did have some conservative Catholic bishops thinking along the lines of: “Thank God the cardinals are going to get together this time and elect someone completely different [than Francis].” And of course there were a couple candidates who would've fulfilled that wish. But Cardinal Prevost — who would ultimately become Pope Leo — was not one of those candidates. He was the candidate of continuity with Francis. And he won.

So now these conservative bishops have to reckon with the fact that they not only cannot say about Leo: “Oh, he's an Argentine who doesn't understand our culture,” the way they did about Francis — but, also, that Leo is not an 88-year-old Argentine. He's a “young” 70-year-old American. He's their last pope.

How do you think they're handling that?

They are trying to recalibrate, and I hope some of them will look in the mirror and realize that they're the ones that have to recalibrate. I would have said this to liberal Catholics frustrated with Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, too.

Let's get into some details about what he's actually said that's garnered attention. Earlier this year, he said: “Someone who says ‘I am against abortion but I am in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants who are in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.” That got a lot of attention. But was it actually a departure from what you'd expect a pope to say?

No. For almost a hundred years, the Church has been consistent about immigration. The first real magisterial teaching that we get from popes on the issue of migration and refugees is from Pius XII — who was no liberal. He was the pope during World War II, when you had a refugee crisis. You get the start of Catholic social teaching, which always starts with the dignity of the human person. We believe what it says in Genesis, that man was created in the image and likeness of God, and is the only creature that God created for his own sake.

That's the starting point for all policies. Even somebody who is your enemy, you have to recognize their human dignity. What is interesting and why some of Leo's stuff is really breaking through is, if you watch Fox News, they don't use the word immigrant without preceding it with the adjective “criminal.” They don't talk about “migrants”; they talk about “criminal migrants.”

And what's become very, very clear is that these [people] aren't criminals. They may have overstayed their visa, but that's like getting a parking ticket. The penalty should not be deportation.

Leo also recently endorsed a statement by the US bishops, in which they say they “are disturbed when we see among our people a climate of fear and anxiety around questions of profiling and immigration enforcement,” and that they are “saddened” by the “vilification of immigrants.” Should this statement be understood as an unusually direct attack on a president's policies?

“Indiscriminate mass deportation” is the phrase they said. Yes, absolutely; it's an attack.

But this gets to one of my objections: When it's a Democratic president, or politician, they will name the president by name. They will name the administration. For eight years, they criticized Obama — by name.

This statement, meanwhile, never mentions Trump explicitly.

Right. They will not do that with Trump. I suspect part of that is that Trump is considered so thin-skinned. They probably think: Why antagonize him? But the obligation is on them to be consistent.

What do you make of defenders of the administration who argue that the Church is just mad about losing government grants and funding?

The idea that there's any kind of financially related payback here is wrong.

The reason the Church cares about this isn't because of some financial benefit. It's because the Catholic Church has been involved in helping migrants in this country throughout its entire life; it's because the Church is a church of migrants.

Apart from the colonial English Catholics, most of whom were quite wealthy in Maryland before the Revolution, if you want to find the roots of American Catholicism, they're in Kilkenny, they're in Regensburg, they're in Sicily. And now you would add Guadalajara or Celaya.

I wanted to switch gears for a moment and ask you about Leo's love of cinema. Leo recently delivered a speech about Hollywood and AI that Vulture's Bilge Ebiri described as “one of the most remarkable speeches I've ever heard coming from someone not directly involved in the movie industry.” Why do you think Leo is focused on this issue? 

The AI thing really is on his radar screen. And I think in explaining his choice of a name, he said, Leo XIII had to deal with the Industrial Revolution. I'm choosing the name Leo because we have to deal with this informational and technological revolution and the implications for how they'll affect what it means to be a human person.

Is he a full-on opponent of AI?

No, he's not outright opposed to AI.

He has two concerns. One, AI is like any tool that can be used well or for ill: nuclear power can be used to make a bomb or it can be used to produce clean energy.

But with AI, the problem is not just the possibility of it being used badly. It's also the question of: How does this specific technology affect our own definition of what it means to be human? How does it affect the way we view ourselves? I think that AI raises these almost anthropological questions in a way that no other organization, other than the Church, is really asking anymore.

And, to return to the context of Hollywood in particular, when Leo talks about the “below-the-line” workers — all the people who contribute to a film or a production but aren't actors or the director; makeup, props, set design, etc. — is that his way of trying to think about how this new technological revolution is going to impact workers?

Oh absolutely. And again, that's where you can invoke his predecessor and namesake, Leo XIII.

You know, I like to tell people that the first real modern iteration of Catholic social teaching — which came about because of the need to respond to the crisis of the Industrial Revolution — was Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum.

Some people have criticized the encyclical as “socialist.” But it's not. In fact, the encyclical actually condemns socialism. But it also does say that workers are entitled to a living wage, and a living wage is defined as: You shouldn't have to have two jobs to feed your family and save a modest amount. That's it. Whatever social contract you have is up to your society; but no social contract is just if it requires workers to hold two jobs just to get by and save a little.

With support from the European Union, women like Reshma are defining their own futures, proving they can lead, create, and rise on their own terms. 

In Bangladesh, women's participation in the workforce is low, and only 7.2% of small businesses in the country are owned by women.*

For generations, girls have been discriminated against just because they are girls. Too often, they are married off before finishing school, become mothers before they reach adulthood, and spend their lives being dependent on their husbands.

Reshma's story began like this. But she managed to change its course. She decided to start her own business by producing apple cider vinegar on her own. As demand grew, she sought support to help expand her business.Through a training program funded by the European Union, Reshma equipped herself with the entrepreneurship skills she needed to succeed and grow her business from the ground up.

“That training worked in my life like magic,” Reshma says. “I was very inspired.” She began hiring women from her own village and today, she's not just supporting her family, she's also helping to create opportunities for other women in her community.

Studies show women reinvest up to 90% of their income into their families **, improving access to education and healthcare, causing education rates to rise, and families to thrive. In a country like Bangladesh, the ripple effects of this can have a huge impact.

That's why the European Union is investing in women like Reshma so they can lead, create and rise on their own terms. There are many women like her, full of potential and determination. Armed with the right skills, they too are transforming their lives, supporting their families, and driving change in their communities, just as Reshma has done. Reshma's story is not unique, but it is proof that investing in women is smart economics. Because when women lead, entire communities can succeed.

Ok, this is getting serious. We need to have a chat about Alphabet.

The Google parent has stormed the gates of the AI trade and is, for now at least, the hottest company in the sector.

Here's what's happened in just the past two weeks:

So if it feels like things escalated quickly, that's because they very much did. But it can be argued that the seeds of the company's market-crushing dominance were planted a couple of months ago.

I'm referring to Alphabet's landmark legal victory in early September, which saw the company avoid having to sell off its Google Chrome web browser. It was important at the time, but with the benefit of hindsight, the removal of that regulatory overhang looks like even more of a crucial inflection point. Just look at the stock chart, which shows a 53% spike since then.

It's notable that Berkshire Hathaway — which has been historically allergic to high-flying tech stocks — bought in when it did. They haven't explained the rationale behind their stake, nor do we know exactly when in the third quarter it was built. But a core tenet of Warren Buffett's investing philosophy has always been to find companies with big competitive moats. What better option than the tech giant that just won its antitrust case?

Going beyond Berkshire, it's possible that — on the heels of its legal win — Alphabet is simply getting more aggressive with its AI ambitions, rather than playing things more conservative to avoid attracting unwanted attention.

It also has OpenAI paving the way for new technology rollouts with its ""move fast and break things"" approach. Alphabet has the luxury of being able to monitor developments at OpenAI, and wait to assess the level of blowback before introducing their competing version. Don't underestimate how much completed AI tech Alphabet has up its sleeve.

Looking forward, the company seems especially well-positioned within the AI trade. They're a formidable rival to Nvidia on the chipmaking front, but they also have a top-tier chatbot in Gemini 3.

So settle in and get familiar with the market-beating force that is Alphabet, your AI stock of the moment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'Big Short' investor Michael Burry says Nvidia's memo was 'disappointing' — and he's betting against it and Palantir","https://www.businessinsider.com/big-short-michael-burry-substack-nvidia-memo-depreciation-ai-bubble-2025-11","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 11:19:00 GMT","

Michael Burry has doubled down on his critique of Nvidia and other AI giants, and revealed he's betting against both it and Palantir.

In a Tuesday post on his new Substack, the investor of ""The Big Short"" fame called out Nvidia's recent memo to Wall Street analysts, saying it was responding to claims he didn't make.

Burry, in a post titled ""Unicorns and Cockroaches: Blessed Fraud,"" wrote that he couldn't believe Nvidia's responses had come from the world's most valuable public company. He said the document contained ""one straw man after another"" and the memo ""almost reads like a hoax.""

The market veteran, who recently closed his hedge fund to outside cash and turned his focus to writing, said he'd never suggested Nvidia was dragging out the depreciation of its property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), as it's primarily a chip designer with minimal capital expenditures, not a manufacturer.

""No one cares about Nvidia's own depreciation,"" he said. ""One straw man burnt.""

Burry also dismissed Nvidia's argument that its older-generation chips are still being used, saying his concern is that newer chips could become functionally obsolete between 2026 and 2028.

""I am looking forward because I see problems that are relevant to investors today,"" he wrote. ""A second straw man burnt.""

Burry added that Nvidia's rebuttal to him was ""disingenuous on the face, and disappointing.""

He disclosed in his latest post that he's placed wagers against the chipmaker and another AI darling: ""I continue to own puts on Palantir and Nvidia, both of which will be discussed at another time.""

Nvidia and Palantir didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on Burry's latest post.

One of Burry's chief concerns is AI companies' depreciation accounting, or how quickly they're projecting their assets will decline in value and how much they'll be worth at the end of their useful life.

Companies can increase their short-term profits and the stated value of their assets by spreading those costs over five or six years, rather than three. But that could pave the way for hefty writedowns in the future, Burry wrote on Substack.

He also highlighted a recent interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in which Nadella said he had slowed the company's data center buildout earlier this year because he was wary of overbuilding infrastructure to serve one generation of AI chips, as the next generation will have different power and cooling requirements.

""The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes, as they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in graphics chips with accelerating planned obsolescence,"" Burry wrote.

He hinted that between the memo and wider market reaction, his depreciation comments have sparked a bigger reaction than he anticipated: ""I have been drawn into something much bigger than me.""

Nvidia shares have slumped 14% from their November 3 high, as investors have grown more concerned that AI companies are overspending and overvalued.

Burry shot to fame after his massive bet against the US housing bubble was immortalized in the book and movie ""The Big Short."" Known for his dire warnings about crashes and recessions, he returned to X after a two-year break in late October, making the case that AI stocks are in a bubble.

Burry's Scion Asset Management previously revealed on November 3, the same day as Palantir's third-quarter earnings, that it held bearish put options on both companies at the end of September.

Palantir CEO Alex Karp called the bets ""batshit crazy"" in a televised interview the next day, prompting Burry to post on X that he wasn't surprised Karp ""couldn't crack a simple 13F.""

In a subsequent X post, Burry said the Palantir puts were ""done last month"" and he was ""on to much better things"" ahead of his Substack's launch.

The earlier positions had a combined notional value of $1.1 billion, but Burry wrote in his latest Substack post that they only cost him around $10 million each.

Burry hasn't shared the thinking behind his Palantir wagers. Shares of the AI-powered data analysis company hit a high ahead of its earnings but have since fallen 20%. They've still risen 26-fold since the start of 2023, valuing Palantir at around $390 billion — nearly 90 times its projected $4.4 billion of revenue this year.

Crypto:

Bitcoin's latest downturn is exposing a fundamental shift as the dramatic price swings that once drew in retail risk-takers have softened, reflecting Wall Street's growing influence on crypto's market plumbing.

Despite the retreat of as much as 36% since the record high reached in early October, implied volatility has remained contained, a shift that reflects how the institutionalization of the token is reshaping risk transmission. Early in its history, Bitcoin's value was primarily driven by speculation from traders seeking to profit from its frequent large price swings.

A judge in Georgia on Wednesday dismissed the historic racketeering case brought against President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn his loss in the state's 2020 election.

The ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who ordered the case ""dismissed in its entirety,"" draws to a close the final criminal case against Trump that remained unresolved after he won back the White House in 2024.

McAfee's ruling came shortly after state prosecutor Peter Skandalakis moved to drop the case against Trump and his remaining co-defendants ""to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.""

""In my professional judgment, the citizens of Georgia are not served by pursuing this case in full for another five to ten years,"" Skandalakis wrote in a court filing.

Steve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the case, said in a statement to CNBC, ""The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified [Fulton County District Attorney] Fani Willis is finally over.""

""This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare,"" Sadow said.

The case brought by Willis initially charged Trump with 13 criminal counts, including the serious charge of violating Georgia's powerful anti-racketeering law.

The indictment, returned by a grand jury in August 2023, alleged that Trump and numerous co-defendants — including his former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — illegally tried to reverse Joe Biden's victory in the state's 2020 presidential contest.

Those efforts included pressuring Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find Trump enough votes for him to overcome his margin of loss to Biden.

The case was once seen as one of the biggest threats to the GOP leader, who was already grappling with a torrent of other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits. At least four of Trump's 18 co-defendants pleaded guilty within two months of the indictment being filed.

It also produced one of the most striking images in recent U.S. political history: a mugshot of the president, who was forced to travel to Fulton County jail to be booked on the state charges.

But the case ran into major problems long before Trump's reelection in 2024 effectively put it on ice.

In September 2024, McAfee tossed out two of the criminal counts against Trump and some of his co-defendants, though he kept the top charges intact.

By that time, the embattled DA Willis was already facing intensifying scrutiny over her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, one of the top prosecutors in the criminal case. She defended herself in dramatic courtroom testimony against the allegations of impropriety, but was ultimately disqualified from the case in December 2024.

The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis' appeal. The case was eventually handed to Skandalakis on Nov. 14, less than two weeks before he asked McAfee to dismiss it.

""This entire case, from the initiation of the District Attorney's investigation in 2021 to the present, is without precedent,"" Skandalakis wrote in the 23-page request for McAfee to drop the case.

""Never before, and hopefully never again, will our country face circumstances such as these,"" he wrote in the motion for what is known as a ""nolle prosequi.""

He noted that the prospect of bringing the case against Trump to trial would take years, as there is ""no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear"" in court and it would be ""impossible"" to quickly proceed after he leaves office in 2029.

Skandalakis also foreclosed on the possibility of severing Trump from the remaining defendants and conducting separate trials, writing that it would be ""both illogical and unduly burdensome and costly for the State and for Fulton County.""

""Some may argue that cases against the campaign attorneys and advisors should proceed even if President Trump is removed from the indictment,"" Skandalakis wrote. ""However, I am extremely reluctant to criminalize the act of attorneys providing flawed legal advice to the President of the United States under these circumstances.""

The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia also lacks the resources to conduct multiple trials, according to Skandalakis. ""Continuing this litigation under these circumstances would neither serve the citizens of Georgia nor fulfill our statutory obligations.""

Despite asking for the case to be closed, Skandalakis suggested that the efforts by Trump and his allies to to overturn the 2020 election, in Georgia and elsewhere, were serious.

""As I have previously stated, contesting an election is not unlawful,"" he wrote. ""However, the strategy conceived in Washington, D.C. to contest the 2020 Presidential Election quickly shifted from a legitimate legal effort into a campaign that ultimately culminated in an attack on the Capitol, undertaken to prevent the Vice President from carrying out his ministerial duty of counting the electoral votes.""

Skandalakis said he believed the case would be ""best pursued at the federal level."" 

But he acknowledged that former special counsel Jack Smith, who had pursued federal election interference charges against Trump, was forced to drop his case after the Supreme Court strengthened immunity powers for former presidents, and after Trump won reelection.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday released a study that found that artificial intelligence can already replace 11.7% of the U.S. labor market, or as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, health care and professional services.

The study was conducted using a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which was created by MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The index simulates how 151 million U.S. workers interact across the country and how they are affected by AI and corresponding policy. 

The Iceberg Index, which was announced earlier this year, offers a forward-looking view of how AI may reshape the labor market, not just in coastal tech hubs but across every state in the country. For lawmakers preparing billion-dollar reskilling and training investments, the index offers a detailed map of where disruption is forming down to the zip code.

""Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the U.S. labor market,"" said Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research. ORNL is a Department of Energy research center in eastern Tennessee, home to the Frontier supercomputer, which powers many large-scale modeling efforts.

The index runs population-level experiments, revealing how AI reshapes tasks, skills and labor flows long before those changes show up in the real economy, Balaprakash said. 

The index treats the 151 million workers as individual agents, each tagged with skills, tasks, occupation and location. It maps more than 32,000 skills across 923 occupations in 3,000 counties, then measures where current AI systems can already perform those skills.

What the researchers found is that the visible tip of the iceberg — the layoffs and role shifts in tech, computing and information technology — represents just 2.2% of total wage exposure, or about $211 billion. Beneath the surface lies the total exposure, the $1.2 trillion in wages, and that includes routine functions in human resources, logistics, finance, and office administration. Those are areas sometimes overlooked in automation forecasts.

The index is not a prediction engine about exactly when or where jobs will be lost, the researchers said. Instead, it's meant to give a skills-centered snapshot of what today's AI systems can already do, and give policymakers a structured way to explore what-if scenarios before they commit real money and legislation.

The researchers partnered with state governments to run proactive simulations. Tennessee, North Carolina and Utah helped validate the model using their own labor data and have begun building policy scenarios using the platform.

Tennessee moved first, citing the Iceberg Index in its official AI Workforce Action Plan released this month. Utah state leaders are preparing to release a similar report based on Iceberg's modeling. 

North Carolina state Sen. DeAndrea Salvador, who has worked closely with MIT on the project, said what drew her to the research is how it surfaces effects that traditional tools miss. She added that one of the most useful features is the ability to drill down to local detail. 

""One of the things that you can go down to is county-specific data to essentially say, within a certain census block, here are the skills that is currently happening now and then matching those skills with what are the likelihood of them being automated or augmented, and what could that mean in terms of the shifts in the state's GDP in that area, but also in employment,"" she said. 

Salvador said that kind of simulation work is especially valuable as states stand up overlapping AI task forces and working groups.

The Iceberg Index also challenges a common assumption about AI risk — that it will stay confined to tech roles in coastal hubs. The index's simulations show exposed occupations spread across all 50 states, including inland and rural regions that are often left out of the AI conversation.

To address that gap, the Iceberg team has built an interactive simulation environment that allows states to experiment with different policy levers — from shifting workforce dollars and tweaking training programs to exploring how changes in technology adoption might affect local employment and gross domestic product. 

""Project Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize training and infrastructure investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation,"" the report says. 

Balaprakash, who also serves on the Tennessee Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council, shared state-specific findings with the governor's team and the state's AI director. He said many of Tennessee's core sectors — health care, nuclear energy, manufacturing and transportation — still depend heavily on physical work, which offers some insulation from purely digital automation. The question, he said, is how to use new technologies such as robotics and AI assistants to strengthen those industries rather than hollow them out.

For now, the team is positioning Iceberg not as a finished product but as a sandbox that states can use to prepare for AI's impact on their workforces. 

""It is really aimed towards getting in and starting to try out different scenarios,"" Salvador said.

In this article

Black Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.

AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  

""Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,"" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.

The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. 

Consulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.

And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a ""K-shaped"" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.

A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.

Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more ""intentional and value-driven"" in their holiday shopping this year. 

That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. 

Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. 

""I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,"" Rutherford said. 

The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. 

And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. 

""AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,"" Rutherford said. ""I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.""

All eyes are now on Russia's response to a fledgling peace plan to end the war in Ukraine after Kyiv appeared willing to move forward with a U.S.-backed framework.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow next week to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters Wednesday that ""the content [of the U.S. plan] will be discussed,"" at the meeting, and claimed Russian officials had not discussed a U.S.-backed plan when talks were held with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. 

""We, the Russian side, have not yet discussed any documents with anyone specifically ... We've agreed to a meeting with Mr. Witkoff. I hope he won't be alone. Other representatives of the U.S. team working on the Ukrainian dossier will be there,"" he said in comments translated by NBC News and reported by state news agency TASS. 

Ushakov said Russia had not yet officially received the U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine but had seen an unofficial version. 

Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while ""several of its points require serious analysis.""

Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said ""there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,"" in comments reported by Reuters on Wednesday.

Earlier today, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.

""Wait. It's too early to say that,"" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. 

CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.

Multiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.

Reports from ABC News and CBS News both cited an unnamed U.S. official who said that the Ukrainians ""have agreed"" to the deal, while noting that some points still need to be ironed out. It was not clear if the same U.S. official was quoted in both stories.

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.

President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, ""I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.""

In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, ""there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.""

Trump's post came several days after U.S. officials met with a Ukrainian delegation in Geneva last weekend for talks that resulted in significant revisions to Washington's initially proffered 28-point peace plan.

That plan — which was widely seen as being highly favorable to Russia, the invading force — ""has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides,"" Trump acknowledged in Tuesday's post.

""Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,"" Ukraine National Security Secretary Rustem Umerov said in an X post.

It's far from certain the Russia will assent to the revised peace plan, which has reportedly been narrowed to 19 points.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said any agreement must reflect the understandings reached by Trump and Putin during their August summit in Alaska.

On Tuesday, officials from Kyiv and Moscow reportedly met with Driscoll in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.

The Kremlin was tight-lipped about the discussions taking place there, with Dmitry Peskov telling reporters Tuesday that ""we still have nothing to say"" and that the Kremlin was ""monitoring media reports.""

""We understand that negotiations between the Americans and the Ukrainians are ongoing. We understand that some adjustments are being made to the text that was published; we understand that the text that we unofficially received earlier has already undergone changes, but at some point, the time will probably come when we will also establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information,"" Peskov said. ""For now, we have no new information.""

The initial, 28-point plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial terms, such as Ukraine making territorial concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region that is partially occupied by Russian forces.

The original deal also demanded that Ukraine reduce its army by 50%, along with other proposals that crossed Ukraine's ""red lines.""

Trump had pushed Ukraine to accept that deal by the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Nov. 27, prompting Zelenskyy to declare on Friday that Ukraine faced the difficult choice between ""losing its dignity or losing a key partner,"" referring to the U.S.

That deadline appears to have been scrapped. It was unclear how many of the original deal's points remained in the latest version of a potential peace agreement.

At this point, shopping on Black Friday is every bit a Thanksgiving tradition as turkey dinners and pumpkin pie. 

But certain discounts you see online may not be as good a deal as advertised. In fact, 36% of items on sale for Black Friday offer no savings compared with how they were priced between Oct. 27 and Nov. 17, according to new data from WalletHub. 

""There's some trickery happening,"" says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. ""Retailers are constantly fluctuating prices. So they may repackage something and say it's on sale for Black Friday when, in reality, it was the same discount a few weeks ago.""

That's not to say that there aren't legitimate savings to be had. For items that are on sale, the average markdown is about 24%, according to WalletHub's data. You'll just have to do a little digging to make sure that you're making the most of the discounts you see. 

""The consumer has to be proactive,"" says Chip Lupo, a writer and analyst at WalletHub. ""Because retailers do more or less rely on people rushing in at the last minute and taking advantage of anything that appears to be a sale."" 

Ideally, says Woroch, you'd begin researching items that you're considering buying long before an anticipated sale while keeping an eye on the price. 

But if you come across an enticing discount while shopping Black Friday sales, ""it's definitely not too late"" to do some research to make sure you're getting a good deal, Woroch says. 

Using online price tracking tools is a good place to start, Woroch says. She recommends CamelCamelCamel, which compares current prices for items listed on Amazon with their historical high, low and average cost. 

""Even if you're trying to figure out a price at another retailer, that's a good benchmark,"" says Woroch. 

Woroch also likes the Droplist browser extension from Honey, which allows you to make a list of items you're interested in purchasing and will notify you of price drops at more than 800 retailers. 

Some products will be more difficult to track because they're manufactured specifically for Black Friday sales, says Woroch. A bargain price on a TV, for instance, may mean that you're buying a basic version of a more prominent model without some of the bells and whistles you're looking for, she says. 

""Don't assume that the model is the same one you saw all year long that you've been waiting for it to drop in price,"" Woroch says. ""Look at the model number, look when it's been sold, read reviews and make sure it offers everything you need.""

Although Black Friday is often touted as the time of the year when the deepest discounts are available, don't fall into the trap of buying something that may go on deeper sale during another time of year, experts say. 

Winter apparel, for instance, tends to go on sale after Christmas, says Woroch. And the biggest sales on furniture typically happen on Presidents Day, she says. 

""You may be able to find good deals on mattresses,"" says Lupo. ""But you're unlikely to see big discounts on traditional furniture like couch sets or coffee tables on Black Friday.""

And no matter what you buy, beware of deals that encourage what Woroch calls ""spaving"" — spending more money than you otherwise would to unlock discounts. That may mean buying a more expensive ""bundle"" of items to earn a markdown or meeting a certain spending threshold to get free shipping. 

""Maybe it's buy two sweaters, get one free. If you only need one sweater, don't buy the second one, just to get one free,"" Woroch says. You could come out of Black Friday having spent extra money on things you don't really need, she says. And if you're on a tight budget, ""you could find yourself in a lot of trouble because of it.""

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Sitting in his new Beijing office, AI2 Robotics Founder and CEO Eric Guo wistfully reflected on fundraising challenges in China — and noted that U.S.-based humanoid rival Figure recently raised $1 billion in a single round, at a $39 billion valuation.

That's far more than what a Chinese robotics company can typically raise, he said.

His strategy for growth? Do more with less. 

That means, for instance, developing a robotics AI model that uses less than 10% of the parameters required to train Alphabet's RT-2 AI model, as laid out in one of Guo's widely cited papers. Guo, who holds a Ph.D. from Purdue University, previously worked at Microsoft, smartphone maker Oppo and electric vehicle company Xpeng.

It mirrors how DeepSeek and other Chinese players have slashed AI costs for users, and allowed them to claim AI development budgets far below OpenAI's estimated spending, which has exceeded $100 billion. That strategy is enough to make AI2 Robotics one of China's hottest investment targets.

The Shenzhen-based startup hit a $1 billion valuation this fall, reaching unicorn status just over two years after launch — thanks to a whopping nine fundraising rounds so far this year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The hot U.S. AI trade has shifted to Alphabet this week following rave reviews of its newest AI model — just weeks after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a rare tech position in the stock. Michael Burry, known for calling the U.S. housing crash before 2008, was the latest voice to warn of bubble risks in U.S. AI names that have powered recent market gains on Monday. 

But whatever's bubbling up in China's tech sector, it pales in comparison with the U.S.

U.S. venture deals in AI and robotics have more than quadrupled since 2023 to exceed $160 billion so far this year, according to a CNBC analysis of PitchBook data. 

Comparable deals in China this year are just over $10 billion — only slightly more than the $9.24 billion recorded in 2023, the data showed. 

It's a confluence of regulatory pressures in China, U.S. export controls and a scrappy startup environment where locals have overcome stringent pandemic lockdowns to stay competitive.

Global investors are increasingly interested. 

Bubble risks for Chinese AI firms appear far more contained than in the U.S., said Vincent Lu, partner and head of private equity at Australian asset manager Boman Group. The Melbourne-based firm oversees AU$910 million ($591.26 million), mostly allocated in Australia and North America, and has participated in funding rounds for U.S.-based Anthropic earlier this year and OpenAI last year.

Lu was ""so intrigued"" by China's AI and robotics scene that he moved back to Shanghai from Melbourne last year to scout deals, and is just starting to get serious about a few. Chinese companies' AI valuations are about one-quarter of their American peers, while benefiting from lower research and development costs, he added.

Boman's Lu was just one of many investors at the AVCJ forum in Hong Kong last week who told CNBC how excited they were about how cheaply priced Chinese AI startups are compared to those in the U.S.

It marks an ongoing recovery in foreign investor interest in China following Beijing's crackdown on large internet tech companies in recent years, coupled with Washington's scrutiny of China-related investments.

This month alone, at least three China-based funds with an AI focus have raised capital denominated in U.S. dollars from overseas investors:

Venture firms raise capital from outside investors, known as limited partners, earning annual fees as they put that money to work in startups. Once the startups go public or are sold at higher valuations, the VC firms can ""exit"" and share the returns with their limited partners.

The momentum is building, even if the numbers don't look big yet. Monolith claimed investors sought to commit more than $600 million to its latest fundraising round, but it kept the original cap of $488 million.

Funds of this size would have been ""inconceivable"" just a year ago, said Johnny Zou, co-head of Primavera Venture Partners, adding that American investor sentiment toward China is seeing a ""clear recovery,"" helped by relatively visible exit paths. 

While Chinese companies have yet to resume IPOs in the U.S., they have flocked to Hong Kong, turning its stock exchange into the world's largest listing destination this year. 

Even so, stock investors are relatively more cautious on China than the U.S.

The Hang Seng Index, which includes AI heavyweights Alibaba and Tencent, is up nearly 30% so far this year, but trades at a modest 13.61 price-to-earnings ratio, according to FactSet data. The Nasdaq Composite, in contrast, trades at a 33.8 ratio, with the index up almost 20% so far this year.

Young Liu, chairman of Hon Hai Technology Group, compared talk of an AI bubble to a dot-com bubble and said that the world's top technology companies will ultimately be AI-related. 

EQT Asia Chairman Jean Eric Salata and CEO Per Franzen discussed the firm's focus in Asia, outlining the strategies it is pursuing in the region. 

Joey Wat, CEO of Yum China, said the company plans to accelerate store openings in China and that the country's urbanization is not complete yet. 

Trump-Xi call. The U.S. and Chinese presidents on Monday night signaled that a one-year trade truce is intact, just as tensions flare between Beijing and Tokyo over Taiwan. 

Japanese concerts get canceled. At least two performances in Beijing were abruptly canceled last week amid China's expanding pushback against Japan's high-profile Taiwan comments.

Alibaba AI app downloads surge. The company's new Qwen app reported more than 10 million downloads in a week as its AI pivot gains momentum.

I think the U.S. [AI] bottleneck probably is electricity, but in China, the bottleneck is GPUs. ... I don't think that there's [much] discussion about the bubble here.

— Shawn Yang, analyst, Arete Research

China's CSI 300 rose 0.74% as of 2:30 pm local time Wednesday. The index is set to snap a two-week losing streak, gaining 1.53% so far this week. The benchmark has risen 14.9% so far this year.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.25% and is up 2.9% for the week, recovering from last week's decline amid a global tech sell-off. The main stock gauge is up 29.4% year to date.

The offshore yuan last traded at 7.077 against the dollar, its strongest level since October 2024.

Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. 

Shares of artificial intelligence czar Nvidia fell 2.6% on Tuesday as signs of unrest continued rippling through its kingdom. 

Over the month, Nvidia has been contending with concerns over lofty valuations and an argument from the ""The Big Short"" investor Michael Burry that companies may be overestimating the lifespan of Nvidia's chips. That accounting choice inflates profits, he alleged.

The pressure intensified last week in the form of a potential challenger to the crown. Google on Nov. 18 announced the release of its new AI model Gemini 3 — so far so good, given that Nvidia isn't in the business of designing large language models  — powered by its in-house AI chips — uh-oh.

And on Monday stateside, Meta, a potential kingmaker, appeared to signal that it is considering not just leasing Google's custom AI chips, but also using them for its own data centers. It seemed like Nvidia felt the need to address some of those rumblings. 

The chipmaker said on the social media platform X that its technology is more powerful and versatile than other types of AI chips, including the so-called ASIC chips, such as Google's TPUs. Separately, Nvidia issued a private memo to Wall Street that disputed Burry's allegations.

Power, whether in politics or semiconductors, requires a delicate balance.

Remaining silent may shroud those in power in a cloak of untouchability, projecting confidence in their authority — but also aloofness. Deigning to address unrest can soothe uncertainty, but also, paradoxically, signal insecurity.

For now, the crown is Nvidia's to wear — and the weight of it is, too.

U.S. stocks advanced on Tuesday. Major indexes had their third straight winning session, erasing earlier intraday losses. Asia-Pacific markets rose Wednesday. Shares of Foxconn climbed more than 3% after the firm received approval for a contract amendment.

Meta is looking to use Google AI chips. That's according to a Monday report by The Information. Nvidia on Tuesday wrote on X that its chips are ""a generation ahead of the industry."" The chipmaker also sent analysts a memo on alleged bubble claims.

The UK's Autumn Budget is coming: Here's what it could mean for your money

The run-up to this year's U.K. Autumn Budget has been different from the norm because so many different tax proposals have been floated, flagged, leaked and retracted in the weeks and months leading up to Wednesday's statement.

It has also made it harder to gauge what we're actually going to get when Finance Minister Rachel Reeves finally unveils her spending and taxation plans for the year ahead.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was relatively unchanged on Wednesday as investors continued to monitor developments that could affect the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision and speculated about the central bank's next chair. 

The yield on the 10-year Treasury was flat at 4.002%, while the 30-year bond yield moved down less than 1 basis point to 4.649%. The 2-year note yield was more than 2 basis points higher at 3.487%.

One basis point equals 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Providing a sign that the labor market may be holding steady, initial jobless claims for the week ended Nov. 22 were less than anticipated at 216,000, the Labor Department reported on Wednesday. That marks the lowest level since mid-April. Economists polled by Dow Jones had estimated 225,000 for the period.

Those on Wall Street are also waiting for news about who the next Fed chair could be after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that there was ""a very good chance"" President Donald Trump would announce the next central bank leader by Christmas. 

Bessent, who has been hunting for a successor to current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, said that the president had one interview to go. 

""It's his prerogative, whether it's before the Christmas holidays or in the new year. But I think things are moving along very well,"" Bessent added.

Trump's allies and advisors believe White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the frontrunner, Bloomberg reported. Hassett is seen as in sync with Trump's preferences for lower interest rates.

Traders are currently pricing in a more than 80% chance of a quarter percentage point cut from the Fed in December, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Taiwan will introduce a supplementary defense budget of 1.25 trillion Taiwanese dollars ($40 billion) as Beijing accelerates military preparations near the island, President Lai Ching-te said at a press briefing Wednesday.

China has continued to increase military drills and so-called ""gray-zone harassment"" around Taiwan, with the goal of seizing the island by force by 2027, Lai said, according to a CNBC translation of his remarks in Mandarin. The speech comes in the aftermath of a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan over Taiwan. 

Lai added that Beijing had intensified its ""infiltration and influence campaign,"" using a range of tools to interfere in Taiwan's politics and society as it seeks to sway public opinion and undermine the island's democracy.

He also cautioned ""unprecedented military buildup"" by Beijing and ""intensifying provocations in the Taiwan Strait, in the East and South China Seas, and across the Indo-Pacific."" 

Beijing considers democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and Chinese President Xi Jinping regards its reunification with the mainland ""a historical inevitability."" Taiwan rejects those claims. 

China has been piling pressure on Taipei and has conducted several military drills off the coast of the island over the past few years, issuing stern warnings over Taiwan's ""provocations for independence.""

Beijing raised its defense budget by 7.2% this year to about $245 billion, with its military assets heavily deployed near the Taiwan Strait, according to analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 

Lai on Wednesday vowed to build up Taiwan's self-defense capabilities in the face of growing threats from Beijing, aiming to achieve a high level of combat readiness by 2027.  

""President Lai's announcement is a signal to Washington of Taipei's commitment to its self-defense and intent to increase imports to balance trade between the two,"" said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. 

Since his election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing allies to increase defense spending. Trump even suggested Taiwan should pay to be protected.     

Shortly after Lai's speech, Raymond Greene, director of American Institute in Taiwan — the de facto U.S. embassy — said in a social media post that the United States ""welcomes"" the special defense budget and supports Taiwan's ""rapid acquisition of critical asymmetric capabilities needed to strengthen deterrence. 

When asked to comment on Taiwan's defense budget and Greene's comments, a spokesperson for Chinese foreign ministry said at a daily press briefing Wednesday that ""the Democratic Progressive Party's plan of resisting reunification and seeking independence using armed forces is doomed to fail."" That's according to a CNBC's translation of the remarks in Mandarin. 

China has been locked in a diplomatic spat with Japan over Taiwan, with Beijing accusing Tokyo of intervening in its internal affairs after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said earlier this month that the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict could be deemed a ""survival-threatening situation"" for Tokyo. Beijing called the remarks ""egregious"" and has demanded a retraction.

Trump spoke with Xi and Takaichi in separate phone calls on Monday. Experts say that Xi likely used the call to solicit Trump's help in influencing Takaichi to tone down her rhetoric on cross-Strait issues.

In this article

Uber on Wednesday rolled out fully driverless rides in its fourth market, launching the service in Abu Dhabi in partnership WeRide, a Chinese autonomous vehicle company. 

The ride-hailing company said the launch in the United Arab Emirates capital represents the first driverless robotaxi service in the Middle East. In the U.S., Uber already offers robotaxi services in Austin, Phoenix and Atlanta through Alphabet's Waymo.

Riders in Abu Dhabi can book a WeRide robotaxi when requesting an UberX or Uber Comfort ride, the ride-hailing company said. 

WeRide, which is listed on the Nasdaq, formed its partnership with Uber in September 2024 and began offering autonomous rides with an operator on board in Abu Dhabi last December. Uber and WeRide also debuted robotaxi rides with a safety operator on board in Riyadh, Saudia Arabia, in October. Uber has said it plans to roll out the WeRide service to 15 more cities, including in Europe, over the next five years.

In recent years, Uber has bet big on autonomous vehicle technology through partnerships. 

Uber started offering a robotaxi service in Austin and Atlanta earlier this year, and in Phoenix in late 2023. In July, the company landed a six-year robotaxi deal with electric vehicle maker Lucid and AV startup Nuro.

WeRide, meanwhile, has launched full driverless robotaxi services in China's Beijing and Guangzhou, according to its website.

Uber has not said how it splits revenue from robotaxi rides with its partners. 

Competitors have also readily adopted the technology, with Lyft announcing a deal with Waymo in September to launch robotaxis in Nashville next year.

Uber said the driverless vehicles in Abu Dhabi will operate in certain areas of Yas Island. Riders can boost their chance of a robotaxi drive by selecting the autonomous option. On-board support is available during the ride through the app and an in-vehicle tablet.

This was CNBC's live blog covering the 2025 Autumn Budget.

Startup leaders are responding positively to tax breaks for employees and investors unveiled by Finance Minister Rachel Reeves in the budget. 

""This Budget shows that the government has seriously listened to founders and tried to make things better to build and scale a startup in the UK,"" Dom Hallas, executive director of lobby group Startup Coalition, told CNBC.

""Big progress on expanding share options, doubling the scale of the enterprise investment and venture capital trust schemes to back scaleups, and looking again at how entrepreneurs are incentivised in our tax system will make a material difference to founders building today and in the future.""

Measures announced by Reeves include doubling the annual limits of venture capital schemes — which allow tax breaks for investors in early-stage startups. From April 2026, investors will be able to invest up to £20 million a year in companies under the schemes, up to a £40 million lifetime limit.

Reforms to the enterprise management incentive (EMI) scheme were also lauded, with the size of scaleups being able to offer those tax share incentives for employees rising from 250 to 500 employees. Asset thresholds will increase from £30 million to £120 million.

""Through EMI reform, today's budget has delivered meaningful change for Britain's startups,"" said Hannah Seal, partner at Index Ventures. 

""It will now be easier for companies to attract, retain and reward the talent they need to scale and compete globally — especially critical in an AI-first world where talent costs and capital requirements are higher than ever.""

The U.K. Economic Secretary to the Treasury Lucy Rigby has conceded that productivity remains one of the most significant problems facing the country.

In a briefing immediately following Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget, Rigby said the chancellor is aiming to deal with the root causes of the U.K.'s productivity challenge, which data showed would reduce revenues by some £16 billion.

This includes ""historic"" levels of underinvestment, Rigby said, adding that the government is focused on creating conditions for future growth, highlighting the approval of key infrastructure projects in nuclear and AI.

""The Chancellor is doubling down on every effort to try and shift productivity in the right direction,"" Rigby said.

Separately, Rigby also expects today's measures around savings and listings would help the U.K. ""break out"" of its aversion to retail investment. She acknowledged this remains the lowest level out of all G7 nations, adding that changes to listings and prospectuses would help ""turbo charge"" the London stock market.

As investors continue to digest the details of the Autumn Budget, Mark Preskett, senior portfolio manager at Morningstar Wealth, is taking a positive view on the outlook for British assets.  

""Today's U.K. Budget has not derailed Morningstar Wealth's broadly positive outlook for the U.K. equity and bond markets,"" he said in an email. ""Significant focus has been on the U.K. economy's fiscal headroom and the improvement here, based on today's OBR forecasts, is encouraging.""

He added that moderating U.K. inflation means gilt yields are likely to continue their downward trajectory ""once the dust settles from the budget.""

""However, the U.K. dividend tax hike — which impacts our home market more than others given its higher payouts — is a clear disincentive for stocks and there was no mention of specific U.K. equity incentives within ISAs,"" Preskett said. 

— Chloe Taylor

In the wake of the budget, Invesco said U.K. government bonds, or gilts, are its ""favored sovereign market now.""

""High government debt and political flip-flopping has weighed on U.K. gilts this year,"" Benjamin Jones, global head of research at the investment firm, said in an email. ""[But] we believe this budget has provided enough to ease those fears a little.""

Gilt yields were volatile before and during Reeves' budget announcement, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt last seen trading almost 6 basis points lower while yields on 30-year gilts fell by 10 basis points. 

""With yields in the U.K. higher than many other developed markets and the Bank of England now having more reasons to cut, we think that gilt yields across the curve will fall,"" Jones said. ""Our fixed income team view the U.K. as one of the best places to take duration risk today.""

CNBC inboxes are choc-a-block with reaction to the Autumn Budget and the Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment of public finances and the U.K's economic outlook. Here's a snapshot:

Reeves delivers 'historic' tax raising measures: Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, said the budget delivered ""historic"" tax raising measures — and noted that Reeves was left with ""larger headroom than anyone expected going into this forecast.""

""Put simply, the OBR projections were far better than we expected, with the impact of the productivity downgrade on the borrowing outlook far less than we and others anticipated,"" he said.

'Perilous' outlook:""Despite the positive spin from the Chancellor today, the fiscal outlook remains perilous,"" Elliott Jordan-Doak, senior U.K. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said. 

""Some of the fiscal savings will fail to materialise, the government seems to lack the political power to push through measures necessary to stabilise the fiscal ship in the near-term, and we think defence spending will place further pressure on the sums.""

'Significant fiscal tightening' from the chancellor""This represents a significant fiscal tightening that the U.K. economy will feel for the next five years,"" Maxime Darmet, senior U.K. economist at Allianz Trade, said.""Smaller taxes are harder to forecast and may underdeliver, potentially forcing the government to look for additional revenue later. On top of that, many of these new measures won't take effect immediately, further weakening confidence in their impact.""

""As a result, financial markets are likely to stay uneasy, at least until the government sets out a more convincing and reliable tax plan.""

OBR error a 'fitting end' to weeks of leaked budget detail:""The entire contents of the Budget being accidentally published by the OBR was perhaps a fitting end to the most leaked fiscal event in living memory,"" Tom Selby, director of public policy at AJ Bell, said Wednesday.

— Holly Ellyatt

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, has slammed Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Autumn Budget, calling it a ""total humiliation.""

In the opposition's customary response to the chancellor of the day's budget statement, Badenoch called the finance minister ""utterly incompetent"" and called for her to be sacked. 

As for the budget statement, which contained a raft of smaller rather than headline tax rises, Badenoch described it as a ""smorgasbord of misery.""

""Last year she put up taxes by £40 billion, the biggest tax raid in British history. She promised she wouldn't be back for more, she swore it was a one-off. She told everyone that from now on, there would be stability and she would pay for everything with growth,"" Badenoch said, addressing lawmakers in the House of Commons.  

""Today she has broken every single one of those promises. If she had any decency she would resign.""

— Holly Ellyatt

Of course, Chancellor Rachel Reeves didn't call her new ""High Value Council Tax Surcharge"" a ""mansion tax"" but that's what it's been dubbed by the media and markets.

Essentially, the ""surcharge"" amounts to £2,500 for properties worth more than £2 million and £7,500 for properties worth more than £5 million. The OBR said the measures would raise £400 million in tax revenues. 

Telling lawmakers that she was taking further steps to ""deal with a longstanding source of wealth inequality in our country,"" Reeves said:

""Currently, a Band D home in Darlington or Blackpool pays just under £2,400 in Council Tax … nearly £300 more than a £10 million mansion in Mayfair,"" she said, referring to one of London's most prestigious areas. 

""And so from 2028, I am introducing the High Value Council Tax Surcharge in England ... This will be collected alongside Council Tax, levied on owners,"" she said. 

This new surcharge will raise over £400 million by 2031 and will be charged on fewer than the top 1% of properties, Reeves added.

— Holly Ellyatt 

The FTSE 350 Banks index was last seen trading 1.6% higher, as the budget appeared to avoid new levies on the industry that had been rumored to be under consideration. 

Stocks seeing the biggest gains included Lloyds Group, which jumped 4.1%, Barclays, which added 3.6%, and NatWest, which was up by 2.7%. 

— Chloe Taylor

U.K. wealth management firms advanced on Wednesday amid a flurry of tax announcements. 

St James's Place moved 4.6% higher, AJ Bell advanced 3.4%, and IG Group gained 8.5%. 

— Tasmin Lockwood

Reeves confirmed a £2,000 cap on salary sacrifice pension contributions will be introduced from 2029. 

""Reliefs in our tax system cost the taxpayer billions of pounds every year, but many of them no longer serve their original purpose,"" she said. 

Reeves said tax breaks on salary sacrifice pension schemes are forecast to cost £8 billion by 2030, ""with the greatest benefit going to higher earners … while those on the minimum wage or whose employers don't offer salary sacrifice don't benefit at all.""

""This is not sustainable for the public finances,"" she said. ""That is a pragmatic step so that people, especially on low and middle incomes, can continue to use salary sacrifice for their pension without paying any more tax than they do now.""

— Chloe Taylor

Tax increases announced in the budget are expected to raise £700 million next year and £26.1 billion in 2029-30, according to the OBR, which it says will ""more than"" offset an increase in spending. 

Spending policies, including removing the so-called two-child limit for welfare claimants, are expected to increase borrowing by £11 billion in 2029-30, according to the OBR's forecast. 

— Chloe Taylor

The chancellor unveiled plans to widen eligibility for enterprise incentives, including expanding the enterprise management incentive — which offers tax incentives to employees in smaller, high-risk companies — so more companies can offer tax-relieved share options.

The finance minister also said she plans to ""re-engineer"" enterprise investment and venture capital trust (VCT) schemes — which provide tax relief for investors in early-stage startups. Reeves said she wants those schemes to apply to companies as they grow, too.

There will also be tax breaks for companies that choose to list in the UK. Reeves said new listings will get a three-year exemption from stamp duty reserve tax. 

— Kai Nicol-Schwarz

It's not all tax rises in the budget with the government set to spend more on several welfare measures in the next few years. Reeves is set to announce a bevy of welfare measures, according to the OBR's unexpectedly released forecast, with a combined cost of £9 billion in 2029-30. 

These include the reversals to previously announced cuts to winter fuel payments and health-related benefits, which will cost £7 billion in 2029-30. 

The controversial two-child limit within the Universal Credit benefit, which critics have campaigned against, will be removed. 

It will cost the country £3 billion by 2029-30, per the OBR, but increases benefits for 560,000 families by an average of £5,310.

— Tasmin Lockwood

British home builder stocks fell 2.6% after the OBR unexpectedly released its forecast ahead of the U.K. budget. 

Major UK housing construction companies Persimmon fell almost 4.3%, Taylor Wimpey shed 3.4%, Barratt Redrow dipped 3.9% and The Berkeley Group fell 4%.

""The U.K. Budget offers little relief for homebuilders,"" Jack Fletcher-Price, equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC via email.

""The OBR's downgrade to household disposable income and upward revision to inflation point to a tougher macro backdrop, likely weighing on housing demand and sector shares. The absence of any update on abolishing stamp duty on properties under £500k may also disappoint the market,"" he said.

""On the proposed mansion tax, if it's scheduled for 2028, we expect the Conservatives and Reform to pledge its abolition at the next general election - making it unlikely to ever come into effect,"" Fletcher-Price added. 

Finance Minister Rachel Reeves also confirmed the introduction of a council tax charge on properties valued over £2 million ($6.63 million).

— Tasmin Lockwood

The thresholds at which British voters pay income tax will be frozen until the end of the 2030/31 financial year, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility.

The OBR, which erroneously released Autumn Budget details ahead of the chancellor's announcement, said that, as a result: ""The income tax personal allowance, the higher-rate threshold and additional-rate threshold are frozen at £12,570, £50,270 and £125,140, respectively, until 2030-31,"" the OBR said.

Freezing income tax thresholds has been described as a ""stealth tax"" as it drags more workers into higher tax brackets due to inflation and wage growth. 

The freeze income tax thresholds are expected to raise £7.6 billion in 2029-2030, the OBR said. 

— Holly Ellyatt

U.K. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has started to deliver her Autumn Budget to lawmakers in the Houses of Parliament. The problem is, we already know what's in it after the Office for Budget Responsibility published its assessment of Reeves' latest policies, and its U.K. economic outlook early, in error. 

She's begun her address stating that the OBR's release was ""deeply disappointing"" and a ""serious error"" on their part.

The OBR has just released a statement apologising for the error. It said: ""A link to our Economic and fiscal outlook document went live on our website too early this morning. It has been removed. We apologise for this technical error and have initiated an investigation into how this happened.""

It said it would be reporting to its Oversight Board, the Treasury, and the Commons Treasury Committee on how this happened and, ""will make sure this does not happen again.""

The OBR said its economic and fiscal outlook and supporting documents would be released (or re-released) when the chancellor has finished her speech.

— Holly Ellyatt

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has given markets a surprise by publishing its forecasts for the public finances and the economy before Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled her Autumn Budget, which will take place at 12.30 p.m.

The OBR report, which appears to have been published early in error, states that the U.K. economy is forecast to grow by 1.5% on average over the forecast [period], 0.3 percentage points slower than we projected in March, due to lower underlying productivity growth.""

The independent fiscal watchdog was expected to lower growth and productivity growth forecasts. Regarding the latter, the OBR said it had reduced its ""central forecast for the underlying rate of productivity growth in the medium term to 1.0 per cent, 0.3 percentage points slower than in our March forecast.""

As for the Autumn Budget, the OBR said tax rises set to be outlined by Reeves would raise £26.1 billion by 2029-2030, the end of this parliamentary term, ""through freezing personal tax thresholds and a host of smaller measures."" The budget measures bring the tax take to an all-time high of 38% of GDP in 2030-31.

The amount of fiscal ""headroom"" or wiggle-room that Reeves has to meet her own fiscal rules on spending and borrowing will rise to £22 billion by the end of the decade, the OBR said, far higher than the £10 billion or so that Reeves envisaged at her last budget.

CNBC has contacted the fiscal watchdog for further comment on the publication. Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch described the early release of the OBR report as a ""complete shambles.""

— Holly Ellyatt

U.K. government borrowing costs fell on Wednesday after the country's Office for Budget Responsibility unexpectedly released its economic and fiscal forecasts ahead of the Autumn Budget. 

Yields on the benchmark 10-year gilt were last seen 4 basis points higher at 4.535%, after falling as much 4 basis points following the release. 

The OBR was scheduled to publish its forecasts following the budget, which Finance Minister Rachel Reeves will deliver in parliament at 12:30 p.m. London time (7:30 a.m. ET).

It's Nov. 26 and Autumn Budget day is finally here!

It's been a longer-than-usual wait this year, with budgets usually delivered in late October. We've also had so much news flow on what tax rises could be included in Chancellor Rachel Reeves' budget statement that it's become hard to keep up. 

This ""kite flying"" of policy proposals — designed to test public and market reaction to an idea before committing to it — has led to criticism of the Treasury, with analysts saying the near-constant drip feed of information (and the scrapping of policy ideas) has confused the public, businesses and markets.

It has also made it harder to gauge what we're actually going to get when Finance Minister Rachel Reeves finally unveils her spending and taxation plans for the year ahead. 

CNBC has taken a close eye on what we might see later today when Reeves unveils the Autumn Budget around 12.30 p.m. London time.

Speculation has been rife in recent weeks about the policy mix Reeves could deliver today. A tax raid is widely expected, with several potential sources of revenue hitting headlines in the U.K. recently. 

Here's a roundup: 

Income tax thresholds could be frozen, drawing more Brits into higher tax bands as wages rise. Currently, the basic 20% rate of income tax only kicks in on earnings above £12,570 ($16,552). Annual earnings over £50,271 are taxed at 40%, while income above £125,140 a year is taxed at 45%. Anyone earning more than £100,000 has their tax-free allowance reduced at a rate of a £1 deduction from every £2 of income.  

A 'mansion tax' is another policy reportedly being considered by the Treasury, which would come as an annual council tax surcharge applied to homes valued at more than £2 million. London's Evening Standard reported that 600,000 homes in the capital could fall into that threshold. 

Private pension contributions and other salary sacrifice schemes — like Cycle to Work benefits — could also be targeted, with reports suggesting Reeves has been considering ending tax breaks for some of those programs. 

Salary sacrifice currently allows workers to give up some of their earnings in exchange for a non-cash benefit, meaning it isn't received as taxable pay and the employee pays less income tax and National Insurance. Rumors suggest Reeves could put a £2,000 limit on how much can be saved into a salary sacrifice scheme before National Insurance — a form of tax on income — applies. 

Pension provider Fidelity said that under this system, someone earning £110,000 a year and sacrificing £10,000 into their pension would be liable for an additional NI bill of £160 a year, while their employer would have to pay an extra £1,200 a year. 

A Gambling tax has also been floated in the U.K. press as a potential source of income for the government. Winnings from gambling are currently not taxed in Britain, and bets are exempt from VAT. There are already some industry-specific taxes in place, however, including duties of up to 25% on slot machines, a 15% tax on horse or dog races, and a levy of 21% on internet casino bets.  

Pay-per-mile taxes could be applied to electric vehicles, according to The Telegraph. EVs are currently exempt from fuel duty paid by people who drive vehicles fueled by gasoline. 

Tourism tax has already been confirmed as a possibility, with Local Government Minister Steve Reed announcing Tuesday that mayors of English cities will be given the power to roll out duties on overnight stays. 

Sugar tax will also be another source of additional revenue, with the existing duty on soft drinks with added sugar set to be broadened to include milk-based and milk-alternative beverages from 2028. 

— Chloe Taylor

Markets are anticipating an increase in top-tier council tax, dubbed a 'mansion tax,' but some have issued warnings that it could slow down the U.K.'s housing market and have knock-on effects on trust in the Labour government. 

""Both policies would disproportionally hit London and the South East and we maintain our preference for housebuilders with minimal exposure to these markets, such as Persimmon,"" Jack Fletcher-Price, equity analyst at Morningstar, covering U.K. homebuilder stocks, said in a statement. 

""The mansion tax has the potential to slow down transactions above the threshold, as logically owners would defer moving in the hope it will be repealed by a later Government,"" he added.

The changes to council tax bands is probably overdue,  Fletcher-Price said, ""but it will further undermine trust in this Government given they promised not to do this in the run up to the election.""

— Tasmin Lockwood

U.K. Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is expected to announce a three-year stamp duty holiday for companies listing on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday, with the widely-trailed move aimed at reversing the sharp slide in the number of companies publicly listing on the London Stock Exchange.

The measures will send a strong signal that the City of London is open for IPO business, according to Inigo Esteve, a partner at law firm White & Case.

""Stamp duty on share transfers is one of the remaining areas in which London differs from competing listing venues,"" said Esteve, a partner in White & Case's capital markets group.

""By removing this additional tax for investors in newly listed companies, the stamp duty exemption would hopefully help stimulate demand, attract more global capital and support valuations.""

Fundraising from London market debuts tumbled to a thirty-year low earlier this year.

Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions, so when investors are reluctant to lend to a government, the price of the bond falls and the yield rises.

The U.K. government currently has the highest borrowing costs of any G7 nation, with its 30-year gilt yield trading well above the critical 5% threshold and spending much of this year at multi-decade highs.

Dramatic rises in gilt yields — essentially the amount of interest the government pays on its debt — can also have a wider impact on the overall economy.

While bond yields reflect borrowing costs for the governments who issue them, they can also affect mortgage rates, investment returns, the wider economy and personal borrowing.

Back in 2022, Prime Minister Liz Truss's swathe of unfunded tax cuts triggered a bond sell-off that had long-lasting effects on the economy and led to her resignation just 44 days into the job.

CNBC's Ian King takes a fascinating look at Autumn Budgets past and present in his latest UK Exchange newsletter here: History lessons for Reeves ahead of UK's much-hyped Budget

Here's a snippet:

Give or take one or two, most Budgets are quickly forgotten by most people apart, maybe, from some politics nerds and the splendid folk at the Institute for Fiscal Studies who are paid to assess these things.

Rachel Reeves, the chancellor of the Exchequer (U.K. finance minister), has done her best to challenge that convention. Her first Budget, delivered on Halloween 2024, is still debated a year on because of the £25 billion ($33 billion) she extracted from businesses via an increase in employers' national insurance contributions (a payroll tax) and the resulting rise in unemployment.

In the main, though, few Budgets remain in the consciousness even weeks later.

Could Rachel Reeves' latest budget be the exception? We'll see. 

— Holly Ellyatt

""Rachel Reeves' reckoning will come from gilt markets,"" Nigel Green, chief executive of global financial advisory deVere Group, said in a note this morning. 

Yields on U.K. government bonds — known as gilts — are edging higher ahead of the budget, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt last seen 1 basis point higher at 4.509%. 

Green noted that the policy unveiling today would not be the only potential source of volatility in British bond markets, with investors keeping a close eye on the Office for Budget Responsibility's assessment of the economy, which will be released in tandem with the Autumn Budget. 

""Today's Budget speech is only the first act. The real judgement arrives the moment investors see the OBR's updated revenue profile, growth assumptions and borrowing outlook,"" he said. ""The gilt market will decide whether the U.K.'s fiscal path is durable or whether the risk premium needs to rise.""

— Chloe Taylor

Investors will be keeping a close eye on the degree to which Chancellor Rachel Reeves will raise the amount of fiscal ""headroom,"" or wiggle-room, she has to meet her self-imposed ""fiscal rules"" on spending, borrowing and reducing debt by the end of the decade.

The rules were being met by a small margin when the Office for Budget Responsibility assessed them in March, but events since then mean that this headroom is likely to have disappeared, particularly in light of the OBR's likely downgrade to productivity and economic growth, as well as U-turns on welfare spending cuts.

Jack Meaning, chief U.K. economist at Barclays, told CNBC that Reeves is likely to target a bigger fiscal headroom of £15-20 billion if she is to avoid having to again look for more money in the near-future.

""Certainly, when we've looked at it in the past, with something [fiscal headroom] as small as £10 billion that she had last time, that means there's a one in three chance she'd have to come back for more tax increases or more spending cuts next time round. So I think probably £15 billion is the minimum the market is looking for,"" he told CNBC's Ian King on Wednesday.

Reeves' current fiscal headroom of around £10 billion is viewed as istorically very low, ""and that's meant that the market has kept asking questions,"" Meaning said. 

— Holly Ellyatt

We already know one tactic the government will use to raise more money through taxes: a so-called milkshake tax. 

The government confirmed on Tuesday that from Jan. 2028, some milk-based drinks will no longer be exempt from the U.K.'s sugar tax, a levy that's added onto soft drinks with a high sugar content. 

Currently, the tax is charged at 18 pence (24 cents) per liter on drinks with 5 grams of sugar per 100 ml, and 24 pence per liter on drinks with 8 grams of sugar per 100 ml — but it does not apply to milk-based and milk-alternative beverages. 

When the changes come into effect, the charge will apply to pre-packaged milk-based or milk-alternative drinks like milkshakes, flavored milks, sweetened yogurt drinks and ready-to-drink coffees. The threshold will also be lowered, so that the tax kicks in once a drink contains 4.5 grams of sugar per 100 ml. 

— Chloe Taylor

Markets will be watching the strength of sterling this morning as speculation ahead of the U.K. budget has led to put calls. The price of the currency will act as a real-time gauge on what investors make of the chancellor's plan for Britain's economy when she presents her taxation and spending plans later today. 

Earlier Wednesday morning, the pound was up 0.18% against the dollar. 

""Sterling appears to be in a no-win situation in regards to the budget,"" according to Alpine Macro's Chief Global Fixed Income and Currency Strategist Harvinder Kalirai. 

""If Chancellor Reeves tightens fiscal policy, it will open the door for more easing by the [Bank of England]. Tight fiscal/easy monetary policy is a classic mix for a weaker currency,"" he said. ""If Reeves treads cautiously, then concerns over U.K. deficits and a rising debt burden should weigh on sterling.""

Leveraged investors have GBP shorts tied to the event, according to Daniel Tobon, head of G10 FX strategy at Citi. ""Notably, despite worsening news on the budget and weaker U.K. data, GBP has failed to sell-off in recent weeks. This suggests a saturated short GBP position with the bad news likely priced in,"" he said. 

Citi had been targeting 0.88 for EURGBP into the budget, ""and that target has been met but EURGBP has also failed to push higher despite numerous attempts,"" Tobon told CNBC in emailed comments. ""Absent a negative shock in the budget, we see a greater risk of a 'position squeeze' (unwind of short GBP positions) and suspect some investors are already starting to unwind these short GBP trades as gilts fail to sell-off further.""

— Tasmin Lockwood

What Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, had to say ahead of the budget:

""It's a very unusual budget, because for the first time in since I can remember, we know how this budget is going to start and we know how this budget is going to end. It starts with that £20 billion fiscal hole ... It ends with the chancellor taking her fiscal headroom back up to £15 to 20 billion, so potentially double what she had. 

Now the question for us, the question for the markets, for the public, for investors, for businesses, is, how does she get through that journey from minus £20 [billion] to positive £15 to 20 billion? 

And it looks like there will be a smorgasbord of tax raising measures coming through as part of [Wednesday's] budget ... while it won't be as exciting as last year's budget, we hope this will be a historic budget. On our count, this will be the third biggest tax raising budget in the post war period.""

— Holly Ellyatt

Ahead of the chancellor's critical statement — which could herald tax rises, spending cuts, or a combination of the two — fund managers are lining up high-conviction trades on U.K. housing, the British currency and beaten-down cyclical equities.

""The budget effectively seems to be being driven by keeping the Labour party factions together and ensuring they can get whatever they do announce through parliament,"" former Conservative U.K. Treasury Minister and Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jim O'Neill told CNBC on Tuesday. 

Reeves's past attempts to slash the U.K.'s welfare bill were watered down following a rebellion among some of the Labour party's own lawmakers. 

""I don't have high expectations for it being an 'oh wow, this is really getting to grips with things' budget, but it will definitely be done to keep the fiscal rules on balance, at least for now,"" O'Neill added.

In this article

Amazon is facing a federal probe after one of its delivery drones downed an internet cable in central Texas last week. 

The probe comes as Amazon vies to expand drone deliveries to more pockets of the U.S., more than a decade after it first conceived the aerial distribution program, and faces stiffer competition from Walmart, which has also begun drone deliveries. 

The incident occurred on Nov. 18 around 12:45 p.m. Central in Waco, Texas. After dropping off a package, one of Amazon's MK30 drones was ascending out of a customer's yard when one of its six propellers got tangled in a nearby internet cable, according to a video of the incident viewed and verified by CNBC. 

The video shows the Amazon drone shearing the wire line. The drone's motor then appeared to shut off and the aircraft landed itself, with its propellers windmilling slightly on the way down, the video shows. The drone appeared to remain in tact beyond some damage to one of its propellers. 

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, a spokesperson confirmed. The National Transportation Safety Board said the agency is aware of the incident but has not opened a probe into the matter. 

Amazon confirmed the incident to CNBC, saying that after clipping the internet cable, the drone performed a ""safe contingent landing,"" referring to the process that allows its drones to land safely in unexpected conditions.

""There were no injuries or widespread internet service outages. We've paid for the cable line's repair for the customer and have apologized for the inconvenience this caused them,"" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC, noting that the drone had completed its package delivery.

The incident comes after federal investigators last month opened a separate probe into a crash involving two of Amazon's Prime Air drones in Arizona. The two aircrafts collided with a construction crane in Tolleson, a city west of Phoenix, prompting Amazon to temporarily halt drone deliveries in the area.

For over a decade, Amazon has been working to realize founder Jeff Bezos' vision of drones whizzing toothpaste, books and other goods to customers' doorsteps in 30 minutes or less. The company began drone deliveries in 2022 in College Station, Texas, and Lockeford, California.

But progress has been slowed by a mix of regulatory hurdles, missed deadlines and layoffs in 2023 that coincided with broader cost-cutting efforts by Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. 

The company has previously said its goal is to deliver 500 million packages by drone per year by the end of the decade. 

The hexacopter-shaped MK30, the latest generation of Amazon's Prime Air drone, is meant to be quieter, smaller and lighter than previous versions. 

Amazon says the drones are equipped with a sense-and-avoid system that enables them to ""detect and stay away from obstacles in the air and on the ground."" The company recommends that customers maintain ""about 10 feet of open space"" on their property so drones can complete deliveries

The company began drone deliveries in Waco earlier this month for customers within a certain radius of its same-day delivery site who order eligible items weighing 5 pounds or less. The drone deliveries are supposed to drop packages off in under an hour. 

Amazon has brought other locations online in recent months, including Kansas City, Missouri, Pontiac, Michigan, San Antonio, Texas, and Ruskin, Florida. Amazon has also announced plans to expand drone deliveries to Richardson, Texas. 

Walmart began offering drone deliveries in 2021, and currently partners with Alphabet's Wing and venture-backed startup Zipline to make drone deliveries in a number of states, including in Texas.

It's been a tough job market for young professionals, but there's some good news for 2026: New grads with up to four years' work experience are expected to see stronger wage growth next year, according to Glassdoor research.

In other words, early-career workers who can secure a job are likely to have more spending power, at a rate surpassing 2020 levels — the last time wage growth kept pace with inflation.

Wage growth will vary depending on the location. While rising cities may not offer the biggest paychecks compared to places like New York or San Francisco, they're seeing the fastest wage growth and offer a lower cost of living, Glassdoor researchers note.

These are the top 10 cities for early-career wage growth since 2020, according to Glassdoor research:

Annual growth since 2020: 7.0%

Average salary in 2025: $61,164

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Research and science; product and project management; human resources

Annual growth since 2020: 5.5%

Average salary in 2025: $60,876

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; skilled labor and manufacturing; business

Annual growth since 2020: 5.4%

Average salary in 2025: $55,782

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Skilled labor and manufacturing; research and science; customer services and support

Annual growth since 2020: 5.3%

Average salary in 2025: $59,100

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care; sales; skilled labor and manufacturing

Annual growth since 2020: 5.2%

Average salary in 2025: $71,808

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Customer services and support; legal; research and science

Annual growth since 2020: 5.2%

Average salary in 2025: $62,970

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Customer services and support; consulting; marketing

Annual growth since 2020: 5.2%

Average salary in 2025: $58,513

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Health care, engineering, sales

Annual growth since 2020: 5.1%

Average salary in 2025: $73,711

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Consulting; customer services and support; product and project management

Annual growth since 2020: 5.1%

Average salary in 2025: $63,071

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Finance and accounting; sales; product and project management

Annual growth since 2020: 5.1%

Average salary in 2025: $59,975

Job groups with fastest wage growth: Engineering; health care; retail and food services

Health-care jobs are the most in-demand roles with rising pay for young workers, Glassdoor lead researcher Chris Martin told CNBC Make It via email. These positions led wage growth in three of the top 10 cities: Boise, Charleston and Rochester.

Overall, health care along with private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time. They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025, according to an Indeed analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Meanwhile, customer services and support roles led wage growth in Miami and Austin, per Glassdoor.

And in many cities, wages are rising for jobs across the income spectrum, according to Glassdoor data. For example, Tucson's fastest-growing salaries for young workers were for engineering roles that pay an average salary of $86,700 in 2025, followed by health care ($64,100) and then retail and food services jobs ($35,800).

LONDON — European stocks ended Wednesday in positive territory amid rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. 

The pan-European Stoxx 600 finished the session almost 1.1% higher, with most sectors and major regional bourses in the green.

Regional indexes are following their counterparts on Wall Street and in the Asia-Pacific region higher amid expectations that the Fed will cut when it next meets on Dec. 9-10.

Markets are pricing in almost an 85% chance of a quarter percentage point cut by the central bank, according to the CME FedWatch tool. New York Fed President John Williams also said on Friday that there was room to lower rates ""in the near term.""

Global markets also got a boost after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that there was a ""very good chance"" that Trump could name a new Fed chair before Christmas.

While he said he was interviewing candidates, expectations are shifting toward White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, after Bloomberg reported he had emerged as a frontrunner for the job. Hassett is viewed as someone more likely to push for lower rates.

In the U.K., all eyes are on the Autumn Budget on Wednesday with Chancellor Rachel Reeves set to unveil her spending and taxation plans for the year ahead. There are widespread expectations that the finance minister will announce a raft of tax hikes as she tries to stick to self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing, and has a fiscal black hole to fill as a result. 

The country's fiscal watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility unexpectedly released its economic and fiscal forecasts ahead of the Autumn Budget, sending yields on British government debt see-sawing.

The benchmark 10-year gilt moved higher after falling as much 4 basis points following the release, but quicky reversed gains. It was last seen 2 basis point lower. Shorter-term gilts followed a similar pattern. 

Follow CNBC's Autumn Budget live blog throughout the day for all the latest news, comment and announcements. Chancellor Reeves delivered her budget statement around 12:30 p.m. London time.

U.K. banks also experienced sharp swings during the session, initially rising on the back of expectations they would be spared from extra taxes in the Autumn Budget, before selling off following the surprise early release of the budget details, and later closing in positive territory. 

Barclays finished the day 3% higher, Natwest advanced around 2%, and Lloyds gained 3.4%.

Reeves confirmed the introduction of a council tax charge on properties valued over £2 million ($6.63 million). British housing and construction names Persimmon fell almost 0.2%, Taylor Wimpey shed 1.7%, and The Berkeley Group fell almost 3%. Barratt Redrow climbed back into the green after an initial dip, later reversing course to finish the day down 0.4%.

Sterling gained on the dollar, moving 0.5% higher to trade at $1.323. 

European investors also monitored developments in U.S.-led negotiations on a Ukraine peace deal. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said a deal was ""very close."" U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Trump added, while U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll ""will be meeting with the Ukrainians.""

It came after reports emerged that Kyiv had accepted the reworked terms of the peace plan, originally drafted by the U.S. 

European defense stocks moved higher on Wednesday, with Germany's Rheinmetall closing 1.9% higher. 

Elsewhere, Novo Nordisk shares rose 4.7% after the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the newly negotiated price for its bestseller drugs Ozempic and Wegovy from 2027. The new price for patients on Medicare will be $274, a 71% discount from its current list price.

Ark Invest continues to add shares of crypto related equities and major tech stocks across its actively managed ETFs, highlighted by its Tuesday addition of more than 174,000 shares of Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG) valued at more than $56 million. 

Cathie Wood's investment management firm also added another $3.75 million worth of shares in crypto exchange Coinbase, $7 million worth of stablecoin issuer Circle, and nearly $2 million worth of its own Bitcoin ETF, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). 

Its major Google acquisition comes just a week after the tech firm unveiled its most powerful AI model yet, Gemini 3. The firm is also engaging in talks with major cloud firms about purchasing its in-house chips, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. 

GOOG shares have been rising in the last 5 trading sessions, gaining more than 8.9% and now changing hands at $319.11. Shares are up more than 22% in the last month, per Yahoo Finance.

The recent boost is just part of a broader rally for the firm, with shares gaining nearly 90% in the last six months to trade at a $3.816 trillion market cap—more than the entire crypto ecosystem at the time of writing.

In addition to Google, the firm added $29.4 million of AI cloud computing firm CoreWeave (CRWV) and $21.5 million of Facebook parent company, Meta. 

And while the valuations attached to companies squarely in the AI sector have left some investors wondering whether or not a bubble is preparing to burst, Wood's firm maintains its bullish stance. 

“The fact that so many people are worried that we are in an AI cycle, like the tech and telecom bubble, actually reassures me,” Wood said on an Ark Invest podcast published Tuesday. “It's very different from what happened during the tech and telecom bubble.” 

Wood pointed to the fact that during the tech bubble, companies were being created and funded because of “dreams” of what could be, or how many eyeballs they could eventually secure. 

But today, the technologies are ready. 

The uncertainty around AI valuations, coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty from missing data during the government shutdown, has led to a wobble in broader markets of late, though Ark Invest has been relentless in its purchases. 

Last week, Ark's funds added notable positions in Coinbase and Ethereum treasury company BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR). The firm has also been snatching up shares of Circle as the USDC stablecoin issuer fell back to trading levels not seen since its massively successful IPO in June.

Earlier this month, Wood cut her 2030 Bitcoin forecast to $1.2 million per coin, down from a previously predicted $1.5 million, on account of the rapid rise of stablecoins.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Better Crypto Buy: XRP (Ripple) vs. Ethereum","https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/25/xrp-vs-ethereum-crypto-comparison-2025/","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 01:21:00 GMT","

Is XRP or Ethereum the better pick for long-term investors?

XRP (XRP +2.14%) has a lot of momentum behind it, gaining more than 340% from the Nov. 2024 elections to Nov. 25, 2025. That's more than 15 times the growth Ethereum (ETH +2.98%) investors saw.

But past performance doesn't tell us much about the future. The real question is which coin is likely to perform better now. To answer that, we need to understand the economics of both and, critically, which creates more value from network adoption.





Traditional banking settlements are secure, but they are slow and expensive. Transactions can take days or even weeks to finalize, and international transfers can involve multiple intermediaries, each collecting a fee.

Ripple, the company behind XRP, created the coin to solve these problems. Its technology enables secure transactions that are faster and much cheaper. Ripple's technology has gained a significant foothold in the industry and is used by major banks around the world.

This real-world usage is the core of XRP's investment thesis: as more financial institutions want to use the Ripple network to make transfers, demand for XRP for network fees will grow. More banks mean more demand.

But there's a critical flaw in this thesis. Banks can use RippleNet -- Ripple's primary product -- without touching the XRP token. Most major banks that use Ripple's technology do exactly that. They can capture most of the efficiency gains while avoiding exposure to a volatile cryptocurrency.

Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), on the other hand, involves at least some direct exposure to XRP. ODL uses XRP as a bridge asset for cross-border payments, eliminating the need for institutions to maintain prefunded foreign currency accounts. That frees up capital and solves real liquidity problems for those who need it.

But most major banks don't have meaningful liquidity constraints that would justify exposing themselves, even temporarily, to an asset as volatile as XRP.

And even XRP's place in ODL transactions isn't certain. Ripple recently purchased Rail, a stablecoin payment platform, and is attempting to position itself as a major player in the stablecoin market -- a market that could be worth trillions of dollars. Ripple's stablecoin, RLUSD, could supplant XRP as the primary bridge asset in ODL transactions.

Ethereum presents the opposite case. It will likely benefit if stablecoins take off. The coin is the backbone of much of the crypto industry, including most of the leading stablecoins -- the lion's share of USDC, USDT, and DAI transactions happen on its blockchain.

Image source: Getty Images.

Stablecoin transactions, indeed all transactions, that happen on Ethereum's blockchain require ""gas"" fees to be paid in Ether, the native coin of the network. Ether has to be acquired -- demand pressure -- to pay gas fees, and each time, a portion is burned and removed from circulation forever -- supply pressure.

Admittedly, this is complicated by what are known as Layer-2 solutions. These helper chains process transactions in bulk off the main network, reducing Ethereum's gas fees. But the core of the idea still holds.

XRP has a burn mechanism, too, however. Why am I saying it matters for Ethereum but not XRP? Scale. XRP burns a tiny fraction of a token per transaction, far too little to affect supply in any meaningful way. Ethereum burns enough Ether per transaction to actually move the needle.

The economics of the tokens are substantially different, and I believe Ethereum's are superior.

That's not to say Ethereum doesn't have problems. Aside from Layer-2 networks reducing gas fees, new Ethereum is introduced to the market to reward the validators that secure the network -- analogous to Bitcoin's miners -- and this counteracts the reduced supply from token burning. While a relative balance has been struck -- total supply has been relatively stable since 2022 -- that could change if usage changes dramatically.

Although XRP has captured a lot of attention with its 230% run during the past year, in my view, Ethereum is the better crypto bet for long-term investors.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) approach 2026 with contrasting positions. Ethereum remains institutionalized, but its expansion relies entirely on Layer 2s rather than mainnet power. Solana, on the other hand, is coming off a year of record on-chain activity: 186% year-over-year revenue growth, and rising institutional interest through new ETFs.

Both chains have credible paths forward, yet the drivers behind their performance are no longer the same. With Firedancer and Fusaka upcoming upgrades, ETF flows, and shifting user behaviors, which blockchain has the better return potential heading into the new year?

Solana and Ethereum are going into 2026 with networks that attract fundamentally different user bases. Solana is tilted toward speed, retail demand, and increasing institutional interest, while Ethereum leans into security, deep liquidity, and its maturing L2 stack. Their differences now shape how developers build and how value flows across both ecosystems.

Solana's design centers on raw execution speed, delivering near-instant finality and high-volume throughput. And Firedancer is set to push performance further in 2026.

Ethereum's modular roadmap prioritizes decentralization, leaving most transaction activity to L2s. This creates a fragmented environment where liquidity spreads across Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base rather than staying unified.

Solana thrives on fast retail activity driven by memecoins, gaming, and constant low-fee transactions. Ethereum's traffic comes from institutions, real-world assets, and large DeFi users. High Layer 1 fees push everyday users to L2s, weakening Ethereum's cultural presence while Solana strengthens its retail appeal.

The Solana developer community is smaller but expanding fast, driven by available resources and quick build-and-deploy processes. The largest pool of developers remains in Ethereum, yet it's spread among various Layer 2s. This fragmentation undermines cohesive development and slows coordinated innovation, while Solana continues attracting developers in gaming, NFTs, and consumer-oriented apps.

Solana's economic loop is direct and efficient. Fees flow directly to validators and stakers, reinforcing network incentives. Ethereum's economics are diluted across L2 sequencers, MEV builders, and staking providers. This weakens the link between ETH usage and ETH rewards, while Solana's structure keeps value concentrated within the network.

Solana's economic loop remains tight and responsive. High activity feeds protocol revenue, which strengthens validator rewards and pulls more users and developers to the network. Even after its recent price drop, Solana's staking participation and transaction flow stayed strong, showing that its growth is tied directly to network usage rather than speculation. This gives Solana a cleaner upside when demand rises.

Ethereum's loop is fragmented. Activity has shifted to Layer 2s, which cuts the revenue that once flowed through the mainnet. Settlement fees help, but they can't match the economic momentum Ethereum had when L1 activity drove value. ETFs add stability, but they don't rebuild the reflexive cycle that once linked usage to token strength.

For 2026, Solana offers higher upside potential if Firedancer ships on time and volumes stay high. Ethereum offers stable, gradual appreciation tied to macro cycles and institutional flows.

Solana's ETF rollout in late 2025 arrived at the perfect moment. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were bleeding billions, Solana products from Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Fidelity pulled in a combined $476 million across 19 straight days of inflows starting October 28.

Institutions treated the dip as an entry point rather than a warning sign. The kicker was staking access. Funds like Fidelity's FSOL passed through a share of staking rewards, turning ETF exposure into on-chain economic participation.

Ethereum's ETF momentum followed a different path. Early inflows were strong, but by October, they slowed into routine rebalancing. Even with the Fusaka upgrade set for December 3 to improve ETH infrastructure, the flows lacked the spark seen in Solana's launch window.

Ethereum still carries deep trust, but its ETF demand no longer shows new institutional conviction. Solana, for now, is capturing the narrative institutions want to own heading into 2026.

Solana and Ethereum enter 2026 with different strengths, but both face catalysts that could reshape their paths. The scenarios below show how each chain could perform depending on how those forces land.

Here, Solana enters 2026 with strong momentum as Firedancer rolls out cleanly and lifts throughput enough to support heavier trading and daily activity. ETF inflows from VanEck and Fidelity grow as institutions seek higher upside than Bitcoin or Ethereum can currently offer. Strong revenue keeps staking yields attractive, pulling more users back on-chain.

Ethereum holds steady through rising L2 demand and improving institutional trust. With supportive macro conditions, Solana could target $280–$340 while Ethereum pushes toward $4,200–$4,800.

In a balanced scenario, Solana grows at a measured pace as Firedancer launches, but it needs more time to deliver its full benefits. ETF inflows continue, though at a slower pace, and retail activity stabilizes into predictable waves rather than explosive surges. Transaction levels hold firm around one billion monthly.

Ethereum strengthens through L2 consolidation as Arbitrum and Optimism remain core settlement paths. Institutional confidence stays steady, though cautious. With mixed macro conditions, Solana could trade between $190 and $230 while Ethereum remains in the $3,400–$3,800 range.

In a case where market conditions worsen, Solana could face pressure if Firedancer experiences delays or early instability, slowing validator upgrades and weakening retail momentum. Regulatory action against memecoin platforms might cut into key revenue streams, reducing activity and staking yields. ETF flows would cool as institutions return to safer allocations.

Ethereum could struggle with L2 fragmentation and weak fee capture as sequencers compete aggressively on costs. If Bitcoin drops below $60,000 and macro conditions tighten further, Solana might retreat toward $130–$160 while Ethereum falls to $2,600–$2,900.

Oops, something went wrong

Just a year after developers—led in part by Vitalik Buterin's push for scaling—began advocating for higher gas limits, Ethereum is now operating with a 60 million block gas limit, doubling network capacity in only 12 months.

As pointed out by Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter, this marks one of the most important throughput expansions on Ethereum's mainnet in years and shows a maturing network ready for more complex applications. A 60 million gas limit means each block can fit far more transactions, contract calls, and on-chain operations.

The increase was driven by coordinated support across client teams and the wider research community, with tools like GasLimit.Pics providing visibility into network-wide trends. According to Wahrstätter, the shift is “only the beginning.”

Gas limits determine how much computation can fit inside each Ethereum block—effectively setting the ceiling for transaction processing and smart-contract execution.

The move from roughly 30 million to 60 million gas per block represents a substantial boost in network throughput. The change follows months of discussions among core developers, researchers, and node operators who have been assessing the trade-offs between scaling, validator load, hardware requirements, and decentralisation.

Higher limits, while beneficial for users, increase pressure on block builders and full nodes, raising concerns about long-term sustainability. The fact that client teams aligned on this upgrade illustrates a shared confidence in the resilience of Ethereum's execution layer.

Shortly after Wahrstätter's announcement, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin added further context. He expects continued gas growth, but “more targeted / less uniform” increases in 2026 rather than another blanket doubling.

Buterin outlines specific opcodes and operations that could see gas limit adjustments:

SSTORE when creating new storage

SSTORE in general (slight increase)

Precompiles (excluding elliptic-curve operations)

CALLs to contracts with large code size

Some complex arithmetic opcodes (MODMUL)

Calldata costs (slight increase)

These targeted increases would allow Ethereum to scale computationally heavy operations without overstressing other parts of the network. In essence, the network would become more efficient without compromising validator decentralisation.

The gas limit expansion reinforces Ethereum's gradualist scaling philosophy: incremental improvements, carefully measured, with long-term decentralisation preserved.

With proto-danksharding (EIP-4844) already live and full danksharding under active development, the execution layer is now gaining complementary headroom.

The message from both developers and Vitalik is clear: Ethereum is not only scaling—it's becoming more adaptable, predictable, and strategically engineered for the next generation of applications.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin and Ethereum are mostly flat ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are down nearly 1% over 24 hours, while XRP is down 3.1%, undoing Monday's ETF-driven gains, according to CoinGecko data. The performance of Solana, BNB, Dogecoin, and other top altcoins hovers between -1% and 1%.

While the broader traditional finance sector remains closed on Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday, crypto markets will remain open. However, due to the holiday, liquidity and volume are often drained from the market, which could trigger volatile moves.

“I wouldn't read today's market action as Thanksgiving-driven,” Markus Levin, co-founder of DePIN blockchain XYO, told Decrypt, noting that the markets being down or flat today is coincidental, and has nothing to do with the holiday itself.

The crypto market outlook, which had been largely bearish until last week, flipped bullish over the weekend after the odds of a December rate cut rose from 30% to 80%, according to the FedWatch tool.

Investors are now overwhelmingly expecting a quarter-point rate cut on December 10, which would bring the target rate down to 3.50%-3.75%.

The sharp repricing of Federal Reserve policy undid several bearish signals and catalyzed a risk-on sentiment. That is reflected in prediction market Myriad, where users assigned a 65% chance of Bitcoin hitting $100,000 before $69,000. (Disclaimer: Myriad is owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan.)

While the market outlook remains skewed to the bullish side due to rate-cut expectations, it isn't set in stone.

Block options traded this week showed $2 billion in long call condors from institutional or high-net-worth investors, according to a previous Decrypt report. This flow suggests sophisticated buyers expect Bitcoin to remain rangebound between $100,000 and $118,000.

Analysts have said traders are likely to deploy a long call condor strategy. It's an options strategy that involves buying four call options with different strike prices with the same expiry. It is employed when the underlying asset is expected to be range-bound.

Additionally, options market data shows negative skew and high short-dated implied volatility, suggesting that bearish bets remain elevated amid higher uncertainty or risk.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

While Bitcoin consolidates its recent gains, select altcoins with strong narratives are breaking out, with coins like World Liberty Financial and Ethena outpacing the broader market.

Ethena is up 7.3% over 24 hours, while Bittensor and Quant are up between 5% and 7%, according to CoinGecko data.

The Trump family-linked WLFI has shown strong, steady performance, up 36% since its November 21 low of $0.11, highlighting intense, focused demand in an otherwise cautious market.

This limited altcoin revival is occurring as Bitcoin shows stability in the wake of recent volatility.

Bitcoin's price is up 5.6% from last Friday's $82,100 bottom, a bounce attributed to a sharp repricing of Federal Reserve policy. The odds of a December rate cut have spiked from roughly 30% a week ago to over 80% today, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

On Myriad, a prediction market owned by Decrypt's parent company Dastan, the chances of a 25bps December rate cut have jumped from 82% to 86% in the last day.

“Capital rotation is happening, but selectively—and only projects with real utility, strong fundamentals, or innovative tokenomics are likely to see meaningful upside in the coming months,” Wenny Cai, COO & Co-Founder of SynFutures, told Decrypt.

The strength in these specific tokens stems from their distinct value propositions.

Hyperliquid benefits from “deepening derivatives activity,” while Ethena's “stablecoin-driven model and yield mechanics” have made it attractive for DeFi returns, Cai explained. World Liberty Financial's surge, she added, shows how quickly speculative capital can coalesce around narratives with high-profile support.

The trend of targeted investment echoes flows in the regulated altcoin space, where Solana and XRP ETFs have seen steady inflows despite an uncertain broader financial market outlook, according to a previous Decrypt report.

The strength of these assets lies in “innovative DeFi integrations” and “strong community support,” Gracy Chen, CEO at Bitget, told Decrypt, corroborating the targeted investment thesis.

This capital rotation “supports new innovations” and encourages a “more diversified and resilient ecosystem,” the analyst added.

“We're not in a classic ‘altseason',” Cai said. “Instead, the market is rewarding projects that demonstrate real traction and sustainable demand,” suggesting this uneven performance will continue.

This selective optimism is reflected on the Myriad prediction market, where users assign a more than 60% chance to Bitcoin hitting $100,000 rather than falling to $69,000.

Quick Facts:

XRP ($XRP) has just flipped the narrative for altcoins.

After years of ‘only Bitcoin and Ethereum matter,' $XRP ETFs have emerged as the leading altcoin product, pulling in more than $622M in eight trading days and even outpacing Solana's inflows. That isn't noise but a rotation signal.

 As capital finally moves beyond the big two cryptos, institutions are effectively curating a short list of altcoins they trust: scalable infrastructure, clear narratives, and real users.

Retail usually chases this flow late. If you saw $XRP hit $2.23 yesterday, then you've seen what happens when sentiment turns fast.

The smarter play now is asking a different question: if $XRP is the first beneficiary of this shift, which are the best altcoins to buy to catch the next wave of liquidity? That's where early-stage exposure can still offer asymmetric upside.

Below are three very different ways to position for that rotation: PEPENODE's ($PEPENODE) virtual miner, SUBBD Token's ($SUBBD) AI and Web3 creator platform, and $XRP itself, which is quietly becoming the institutional benchmark for altcoin exposure.

PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) positions itself as the world's first mine-to-earn meme coin, taking the old-school mining concept and turning it into a virtual, gamified economy on Ethereum.

Instead of buying ASICs and worrying about sky-high electricity bills, you'll be able to acquire and upgrade virtual miner nodes, then earn meme coin rewards like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN for your in-game performance.



At the core is a Virtual Mining System with tiered node rewards. As an early adopter, you can secure more powerful nodes that generate higher returns, echoing how early Bitcoin miners enjoyed outsized rewards. But here it's abstracted into an ERC-20 system without hardware or technical barriers.

Gameplay and the full dashboard go live post-TGE. In the meantime, though, you can stake your $PEPENODE for a massive 587% APY.

The presale numbers show real traction already: $2.2M already raised, with tokens currently priced at $0.0011638. That's still micro-cap territory relative to mainstream meme coins, but with clear upside if mine-to-earn becomes a recognizable sub-narrative.

Buying early lets you buy and stake during presale for boosted returns, effectively front-running future node inflation.

If you've missed earlier meme cycles or are bored with copy-paste dog coins with no mechanic beyond speculation, $PEPENODE offers a more structured, game-like path to yield.

With altcoin capital rotating into narratives with engagement, not just logos, a gamified mining economy could stand out.

🚀 Join the $PEPENODE presale today.

While $XRP captures institutional flows, SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) is targeting a very different prize: the $85B content creation industry.

The project's pitch is straightforward: most creators are trapped in Web2 rails, sharing revenue with platforms while having limited control over their data, audience, and monetization options. SUBBD merges Web3 and AI to flip that model.

On-chain, SUBBD acts as the coordination and payment layer: lower fees, crypto payouts, and token-gated access for exclusive content.

On the AI side, creators get an AI personal assistant for automated fan interactions, AI voice cloning, and even full AI influencer creation. That enables a creator to scale their presence across multiple channels without diluting brand control or giving everything to centralized platforms.

The presale metrics are already notable: $1.3M+ raised with tokens at $0.05705, plus a 20% first-year staking yield for early participants.

As a creator, you'll get a clear business vertical (creator tools) with tokenized upside and on-chain yield, rather than a vague AI narrative alone.



Holding $SUBBD also means attractive benefits for fans, including access to exclusive content, platform discounts, staking benefits, and more.

If the SUBBD team delivers on its promise and the project gains traction from both creators and fans, then the platform could have a bright future ahead of it.

The same goes for its $SUBBD token, which our SUBBD Token price prediction sees reaching a potential high of $0.48 by the end of 2026. That's about a 741% increase from its current price.

🚀 Don't delay. Join the $SUBBD presale now.

Ripple's $XRP remains the institutional altcoin benchmark, and its recent price action proves it.

Designed for fast, low-cost cross-border payments on the XRP Ledger, $XRP offers 3- to 5-second transaction finality and negligible fees, making it attractive for banks, fintechs, and liquidity providers that need reliable settlement.

This utility is now mirrored in market structure. $XRP has become the leading altcoin ETF, attracting more than $622M in inflows in just eight trading days.

That amount of inflows allowed $XRP to surpass Solana's and signaled that institutions want liquid, battle-tested assets when they step outside $BTC and $ETH.

The market reacted positively to the jump in $XRP inflows. In yesterday's trading, the cryptocurrency's value hit $2.23 after spending the past several days under $2.20. Its rebound reinforced the coin's status as a primary vehicle for altcoin exposure rather than a speculative side bet.



If you're a crypto investor, $XRP represents the blue-chip end of the current rotation, allowing you to ride institutional adoption of blockchain payments with relatively lower volatility than micro-caps.

Pairing a core $XRP position with selective bets in narratives like mine-to-earn ($PEPENODE) and AI creator platforms ($SUBBD) can therefore be a winning combination in the market's current cycle.

🚀 Buy $XRP at its current price of $2.17 on Binance.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto sentiment remains deep in the red even though a few names are inching higher. The Fear and Greed Index sits still at 15 after printing 10 last week, which marked a record low for this cycle and pulled positioning very close to full risk aversion.

In the meantime, Bitcoin is trading well below recent six-figure highs and continues to face pressure from liquidations, softer flows into spot products, and unease around global growth that keeps many desks close to cash.

Within that setting, most major altcoins still trade below recent ranges, yet Dash, Monad, and SPX6900 have moved into positive territory, which offers a small look at where traders still engage when the default stance is caution rather than enthusiasm.

Dash (DASH) is currently trading near $66, up approximately 20% in 24 hours, with turnover well above recent averages and liquidity on large venues still sufficient to support active trading in both directions.

The latest rise mainly links to a new partnership with Zebec, a project known for continuous payment streaming and treasury tooling, which places Dash back into conversations around practical transfer and payroll style usage instead of leaving it only in the long-running privacy and payments bucket that had gone quiet for stretches of this year.

The tie-up centres on using Dash within payment and settlement flows that rely on Zebec infrastructure, which gives the token a clearer role inside a structured system and helps distinguish it from other older payment coins that trade more on legacy narratives than fresh integration work.

SPX6900 (SPX), a meme-driven token that tracks speculative interest in high beta altcoins, trades near $0.65, up by about 19% in 24 hours, with volume well above last week and activity spread across a mix of spot pairs.

The move may have more to do with rotation into a familiar speculative basket during a small relief window than with a new feature or corporate tie-in.

Flows into SPX6900 tend to increase whenever traders look for liquid meme exposure without committing to very small single-name tokens, and today fits that pattern, with intraday ranges wide yet contained inside prior bands that have defined recent support and resistance.

Monad (MON) is trading around $0.046, up by 19% over the past day, and sits near the upper end of its recent range with spreads that remain manageable relative to other small caps.

The latest leg follows fresh access points, including direct support through Telegram and availability on Polymarket, which together place the token in front of retail users who follow social trading flows and on-chain prediction markets more closely than traditional spot listings alone.

Even so, liquidity is still modest compared with larger names, which means every burst of interest can produce outsized swings in either direction whenever conditions in the rest of the market tighten again.

Altcoin season, in the classic sense where large numbers of alternative coins outperform Bitcoin for extended stretches, remains distant under these conditions, since the fear index still sits near record lows and Bitcoin itself continues to struggle after its sharp drop from peak levels.

Current moves in Dash, Monad, and SPX6900 show that capital has not vanished from altcoins entirely, yet the pattern is still narrow concentration around clear news such as a payment partnership, fresh listings on social or prediction platforms, and established meme baskets that already have liquidity rather than a sweeping change in appetite.

For now, the picture is one where extreme caution shapes the baseline, small steps upward in the fear gauge from 10 to 15 offer only a hint that panic may have eased, and altcoin season survives in isolated pockets tied to specific stories rather than in a full revival that pulls the whole sector higher alongside Bitcoin.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and Solana (CRYPTO: SOL) approach 2026 with contrasting positions. Ethereum remains institutionalized, but its expansion relies entirely on Layer 2s rather than mainnet power. Solana, on the other hand, is coming off a year of record on-chain activity: 186% year-over-year revenue growth, and rising institutional interest through new ETFs.

Both chains have credible paths forward, yet the drivers behind their performance are no longer the same. With Firedancer and Fusaka upcoming upgrades, ETF flows, and shifting user behaviors, which blockchain has the better return potential heading into the new year?

Solana and Ethereum are going into 2026 with networks that attract fundamentally different user bases. Solana is tilted toward speed, retail demand, and increasing institutional interest, while Ethereum leans into security, deep liquidity, and its maturing L2 stack. Their differences now shape how developers build and how value flows across both ecosystems.

Solana's design centers on raw execution speed, delivering near-instant finality and high-volume throughput. And Firedancer is set to push performance further in 2026.

Ethereum's modular roadmap prioritizes decentralization, leaving most transaction activity to L2s. This creates a fragmented environment where liquidity spreads across Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base rather than staying unified.

Solana thrives on fast retail activity driven by memecoins, gaming, and constant low-fee transactions. Ethereum's traffic comes from institutions, real-world assets, and large DeFi users. High Layer 1 fees push everyday users to L2s, weakening Ethereum's cultural presence while Solana strengthens its retail appeal.

The Solana developer community is smaller but expanding fast, driven by available resources and quick build-and-deploy processes. The largest pool of developers remains in Ethereum, yet it's spread among various Layer 2s. This fragmentation undermines cohesive development and slows coordinated innovation, while Solana continues attracting developers in gaming, NFTs, and consumer-oriented apps.

Solana's economic loop is direct and efficient. Fees flow directly to validators and stakers, reinforcing network incentives. Ethereum's economics are diluted across L2 sequencers, MEV builders, and staking providers. This weakens the link between ETH usage and ETH rewards, while Solana's structure keeps value concentrated within the network.

Solana's economic loop remains tight and responsive. High activity feeds protocol revenue, which strengthens validator rewards and pulls more users and developers to the network. Even after its recent price drop, Solana's staking participation and transaction flow stayed strong, showing that its growth is tied directly to network usage rather than speculation. This gives Solana a cleaner upside when demand rises.

Ethereum's loop is fragmented. Activity has shifted to Layer 2s, which cuts the revenue that once flowed through the mainnet. Settlement fees help, but they can't match the economic momentum Ethereum had when L1 activity drove value. ETFs add stability, but they don't rebuild the reflexive cycle that once linked usage to token strength.

For 2026, Solana offers higher upside potential if Firedancer ships on time and volumes stay high. Ethereum offers stable, gradual appreciation tied to macro cycles and institutional flows.

Solana's ETF rollout in late 2025 arrived at the perfect moment. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were bleeding billions, Solana products from Grayscale, Bitwise, VanEck, and Fidelity pulled in a combined $476 million across 19 straight days of inflows starting October 28.

Institutions treated the dip as an entry point rather than a warning sign. The kicker was staking access. Funds like Fidelity's FSOL passed through a share of staking rewards, turning ETF exposure into on-chain economic participation.

Ethereum's ETF momentum followed a different path. Early inflows were strong, but by October, they slowed into routine rebalancing. Even with the Fusaka upgrade set for December 3 to improve ETH infrastructure, the flows lacked the spark seen in Solana's launch window.

Ethereum still carries deep trust, but its ETF demand no longer shows new institutional conviction. Solana, for now, is capturing the narrative institutions want to own heading into 2026.

Solana and Ethereum enter 2026 with different strengths, but both face catalysts that could reshape their paths. The scenarios below show how each chain could perform depending on how those forces land.

Here, Solana enters 2026 with strong momentum as Firedancer rolls out cleanly and lifts throughput enough to support heavier trading and daily activity. ETF inflows from VanEck and Fidelity grow as institutions seek higher upside than Bitcoin or Ethereum can currently offer. Strong revenue keeps staking yields attractive, pulling more users back on-chain.

Ethereum holds steady through rising L2 demand and improving institutional trust. With supportive macro conditions, Solana could target $280–$340 while Ethereum pushes toward $4,200–$4,800.

In a balanced scenario, Solana grows at a measured pace as Firedancer launches, but it needs more time to deliver its full benefits. ETF inflows continue, though at a slower pace, and retail activity stabilizes into predictable waves rather than explosive surges. Transaction levels hold firm around one billion monthly.

Ethereum strengthens through L2 consolidation as Arbitrum and Optimism remain core settlement paths. Institutional confidence stays steady, though cautious. With mixed macro conditions, Solana could trade between $190 and $230 while Ethereum remains in the $3,400–$3,800 range.

In a case where market conditions worsen, Solana could face pressure if Firedancer experiences delays or early instability, slowing validator upgrades and weakening retail momentum. Regulatory action against memecoin platforms might cut into key revenue streams, reducing activity and staking yields. ETF flows would cool as institutions return to safer allocations.

Ethereum could struggle with L2 fragmentation and weak fee capture as sequencers compete aggressively on costs. If Bitcoin drops below $60,000 and macro conditions tighten further, Solana might retreat toward $130–$160 while Ethereum falls to $2,600–$2,900.

Permissionless blockchains provide accessibility benefits for payments that centralized instant payment systems cannot match, despite similar capabilities, according to analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The finding follows the passage of the GENIUS Act in July 2025, which provided regulatory clarity for stablecoins.

In a Liberty Street Economics blog post, Michael Junho Lee of the New York Fed and Rod Garratt, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, contend that while FedNow and other real time payment systems offer speed and low costs, they require both parties to hold accounts at participating financial institutions. This excludes unbanked populations and creates barriers for international transactions requiring correspondent banking relationships.

“These advantages are not intrinsic to the form of money that stablecoins embody but instead arise from their issuance on permissionless blockchains,” the researchers wrote, noting that any monetary instrument issued on such blockchains can achieve borderless reach. These include tokenized Treasury money market funds and deposit tokens, not just stablecoins. The researchers identify permissionless blockchains as the key differentiator, but they don't address another stablecoin feature that enhances accessibility even further.

Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov are battling it out again… online.

On Wednesday, McGregor addressed a recent marketing push by Nurmagomedov, who has been selling NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on messaging app Telegram of late.

In particular, Nurmagomedov was selling digital Papakhas (that's the white fluffy hat made famous by Khabib during his UFC run), with an announcement made via his verified Twitter/X account, @TeamKhabib. Nurmagomedov, or whoever is running the account these days, has made multiple crypto and investment related posts in recent weeks, with little fighting related content.

Nurmagomedov's original post about the Papakha sale (which is presumably in conjunction with a crypto company, though which isn't clear) was subsequently deleted, and a new one announcing that the auction had ended was posted to his account on Wednesday. Though not before McGregor took notice.

“There is just no way good guy Khabib used his late fathers name, as well as Dagestan's culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital NFT's online and then delete all of the content after they were sold, leaving his fans robbed of their money?” McGregor wrote in a post addressing the sale. “There is just no way good guy do this.”

That brought about an immediate response from Khabib, who posted that the auction had closed exactly two minutes after his reply to McGregor.

“You absolute liar. You will always try to darken my name, after you got destroyed that night, but you will never achieve that! Yes, good guys don't do that. They don't create exclusive digital gifts with real time value, that you can share with your friends and family. Gifts in the shape of Papakha – hat that symbolize traditions and culture of Dagestan people. Traditions and culture that slowly walking over this world, whether you like it or not! Gifts that you can find exclusively on Telegram, greatest messaging platform on the world.”



Judge for yourself whether the NFT sale is a scam or not, though after the initial craze surrounding them a few years ago, their popularity has flagged. Digital collectables remain in a steady decline, and it seems questionable as to whether they'll retain their value long term.

Conor McGregor and Khabib Nurmagomedov have words again

Conor McGregor is firing shots at his old friend Khabib Nurmagomedov again.

Nurmagomedov recently announced an auction for a new NFT called Papakhas on social media platform Telegram. On Wednesday, the retired former UFC lightweight champion revealed that the digital currency had completely sold out.

That brought out a tweet from McGregor, who was Nurmagomedov's biggest career rival in the fight game, and appears to still be in that role.

“There is just no way good guy khabib used his late fathers name, as well as Dagestan's culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital NFT's online and then delete all of the content after they were sold, leaving his fans robbed of their money? There is just no way good guy do this,” McGregor wrote.

Nurmagomedov then responded to McGregor's post, saying that McGregor will do anything in an attempt to soil his name, while also tweeting out a commercial of sorts for the platform and NFT.

“You absolute liar,”Nurmagomedov wrote. “You will always try to darken my name, after you got destroyed that night, but you will never achieve that! Yes, good guys don't do that. They don't create exclusive digital gifts with real time value, that you can share with your friends and family. Gifts in the shape of Papakha - hat that symbolize traditions and culture of Dagestan people.

“Traditions and culture that slowly walking over this world, whether you like it or not! Gifts that you can find exclusively on Telegram, greatest messaging platform on the world.”

Of course, McGregor wasn't going to let it go without getting the last word.

“Apologize this instant for using your late father's name to sell these ‘gifts' that cost your fans so much of their money,” McGregor wrote. “Also to sell something means it is not a gift you low IQ troglodyte! That is the direct opposite of what ‘gift' means. Duh duh duh dumbass, hahaha. Scamming on your dead daddy's name. Shame.”

Nurmagomedov faced McGregor in the biggest UFC main event of all time at UFC 229 in October 2018. It was a lopsided performance for Nurmagomedov before eventually submitting the former two-division champ in Round 4.

Every cycle, the same story plays out. Early opportunities appear, doubts creep in, and months later people watch from the sidelines as those who acted early lock in life changing gains. The sting of a missed chance usually lasts longer than the memory of a calculated risk.

Right now, BlockchainFX ($BFX) is stepping into that emotional gap just as new price action around NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has traders talking once again about the next 1000x crypto. With November in full swing and Q4 heating up, attention is shifting toward projects that combine strong utility with aggressive early entry terms, and BlockchainFX is firmly in that conversation.

When NEAR Protocol first launched near an ICO price of about $0.29, many people brushed it off or simply didn't bother to look closer. Time proved that hesitation costly. NEAR later climbed past $20, turning early community members and committed believers into quiet success stories while countless others looked back wishing they had risked even a modest amount at the start.

Today, NEAR trades around $1.91 following periods of strong market activity. Despite volatility, the project continues to demonstrate that quality assets often recover and can still create opportunities long after their launch. The bigger lesson is obvious. Crypto regularly hands out second chances, but only to those prepared to move before everyone else decides the trend is obvious.

BlockchainFX ($BFX) is built around a simple idea with large implications. Instead of forcing traders to juggle separate platforms for crypto, forex, stocks, ETFs, bonds, and index products, it aims to bring everything together inside a single, tightly integrated ecosystem. The project wants someone who trades multiple asset classes to be able to operate from one account, with one interface, powered by one core token.

The heart of this system is $BFX, which sits at the center of user engagement and daily rewards. The design philosophy focuses on real users who trade often and want both speed and clarity, not just speculative branding.

Traders today often deal with fragmented setups. One app for stocks. Another for crypto. A different platform for forex. Settlement times can lag, price gaps between marketplaces can create confusion, and user interfaces sometimes feel like they were stitched together from different eras. This mess wastes time, adds friction, and makes scaling a personal strategy more difficult than it needs to be.

BlockchainFX's best crypto presale wants to replace that experience with a single ecosystem where access to hundreds of assets is unified, execution is faster, and the learning curve is less painful. The project positions itself as a solution for people who are tired of jumping between tabs, accounts, and liquidity pools just to run a simple strategy.

Part of the excitement around BlockchainFX comes from how broad the offering is. The platform is designed to support more than five hundred assets across different markets. Users are incentivized with daily rewards paid in both $BFX and USDT, turning ongoing activity into a steady feedback loop. Up to seventy percent of platform fees are set to be redistributed back to the community, which means the more the platform grows in volume, the more value flows back to ecosystem participants.

This combination of a large asset menu, daily income potential, and real trading utility has pushed BlockchainFX into many discussions about serious presale projects, especially among those looking beyond short-lived meme pumps. Utility, not just narrative, is the main draw.

The presale metrics speak to the level of interest developing around $BFX. More than $11.4 million has already been raised. The current token price is $0.03, with the next step scheduled to rise slightly to $0.031. The projected launch price sits at $0.05. Over eighteen thousand participants have already taken part, which hints at strong early community formation before the platform even goes live.

Demand continues to grow because cross-market trading is becoming more important for active investors. Those who believe in the long term potential of a unified venue understand that early exposure to the underlying token can scale quickly if platform usage grows.

The BF70 promotion has become one of the defining talking points around BlockchainFX. By using the BF70 code, presale buyers receive an additional seventy percent in $BFX tokens on top of their standard allocation. In a month where many projects are quiet or cautious, this stands out as one of the largest and most aggressive bonus structures available.

In a down or uncertain market, this kind of offer can be game changing. Those who understand how upside is created during quieter periods see BF70 as a way to turn even a conservative deposit into a notably larger position. Buyers using the code are effectively front loading their exposure before any major price appreciation and before the broader market potentially turns more bullish.

BlockchainFX is not just relying on hype or token inflation to support its long term vision. The business model is built around multiple income streams. Trading fees form one pillar. Listing fees provide another. Subscription tiers add recurring revenue. Liquidity programs help create depth and engagement. Copy trading features, with commissions set at 1.25 percent, add yet another layer of monetization tied to actual user behavior.

By building diverse revenue channels, the project aims to reduce dependence on any single one-time event, like the presale, and instead grow as more traders use the platform over time.

The strongest regrets in crypto usually trace back to early stages that looked interesting but were ignored. NEAR Protocol is a textbook example of exactly that pattern. Now, BlockchainFX has entered the same kind of conversation.

With a current BlockchainFX presale entry at $0.03, a coming step to $0.031, and a launch price marked at $0.05, the timing is clear. The window where early buyers can accumulate at lower prices is still open, but not forever. Presale demand keeps building, and the BF70 promotion represents the most significant incentive the project has launched so far. Seventy percent extra tokens on entry is far from common. It is the kind of advantage that can turn an ordinary position into something far more powerful if the platform performs and the market eventually swings upward.

Dip conditions and quieter months do not last permanently. Many traders later point back to quiet presale periods just like this as the moments when a decisive move could have made all the difference.

By Akriti Seth

Crypto is back above the $3 trillion mark, and accompanying this flip up is the MONAD crypto surge.

Although Bitcoin and some of the best cryptos to buy have stabilized above key support levels, MONAD crypto is leading the charge. Up +40% in 24 hours, the altcoin is extending gains, building on strong gains from yesterday.

For aggressive traders seeking to diversify, MONAD can be a viable option to consider. However, are there other best crypto presales to bid instead?

Monad developers are building another blockchain. 

Their goal, like other ambitious builders, is to resolve Ethereum's scaling challenges while also ensuring interoperability with the first smart contract platforms. 

Because of this interoperability, developers can deploy their dapps on Monad without code changes, taking advantage of existing infrastructure, including tools and wallets.

The Monad ICO was conducted between November 17 and 22, where 7.5 billion MON, representing +7.5% of the total supply, were distributed to the public. With each MON trading for $0.025, they raised over $200 million.

Even before this oversubscribed ICO via Coinbase's token sale platform, Monad had raised over $225M from venture capitalists, including Jump Crypto and Coinbase.

At spot rates, MON crypto is up nearly +100% from its ICO price, propelled by FOMO. Whales are loading in heavily.

Moreover, commitments to integration from LayerZero, Stargate, and Curvance, for example, also helped lift prices.

From a tokenomics perspective, MON crypto could edge higher, perhaps even breaking $0.1 by the end of the year. A big chunk of MON tokens that are supposed to be in circulation, that is, from airdrops and ICO, are locked until 2026-2029.

The Monad tokenomics are an IQ test that CT is failing.

DISCOVER: Best New Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2025

If the momentum picks up, MON USDT can easily be the next 100X crypto to consider. As Monad crypto ticks higher, smart investors are also exploring yet another crypto gem.

Bitcoin Hyper is already considered one of the best crypto presales to buy now, thanks to its ambition of scaling Bitcoin. How fast Bitcoin scales can determine adoption, especially in zones where transaction fees is crucial. 

Bitcoin Hyper developers are building a Bitcoin layer-2 platform leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and zero-knowledge proofs for its Canonical Bridge.

Using the SVM translates to high scalability, low fees, and instant interoperability with Solana. Meanwhile, using zero-knowledge proofs means transactions, to and from the mainnet, are secure and private.

The Bitcoin Hyper presale has so far raised over $28.5M, with less than eight hours to go before the ICO closes.

Though the recently passed Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prohibits the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States, other governments have found success by launching these projects. For the average person, understanding how a CBDC could impact the Bitcoin price USD may reveal why governments choose to explore CBDCs or to avoid implementing the technology.

Understanding the Role of CBDCs

Similar to traditional currency, which may be referred to as central bank money, a CBDC is simply a digital form of existing legal tender. Governed by the same central bank as any given traditional currency would be, most CBDCs are intended to expand access to safe payment options without reducing or replacing fiat systems. Ultimately, a CBDC provides a level of convenience for the digital age.

Where Have CBDCs Been Implemented Already?

The Bahamas, Nigeria, Jamaica, and Zimbabwe are the only nations to have fully launched a CBDC solution, but many other countries are exploring their potential for digital transformation. Perhaps most notably, China and the European Union are currently in the pilot phase of their own CBDC projects, and the U.S. was formerly in the infrastructure phase. Certainly, CBDCs have sparked international attention. 

Most countries that have launched a CBDC in some form have done so for the sake of three key goals: faster payments, financial inclusion, and reduced cash dependency. While fiat currency may remain the basis of the global economy, payment systems are increasingly trending toward the convenience and speed of digital solutions. As such, governments are taking the next steps toward this future.

Central bank digital currencies are starting to feel less like local experiments and more like chess pieces in a global power game. Governments do not just see them as fancy digital cash, they see levers of control, ways to fine tune their money flow and pull away from systems like SWIFT that tie them to others. China's digital yuan kind of kicked the hornet's nest, pushing Europe, Japan, and everyone else to hurry up and figure out their own versions before they fall behind in the digital money race.

If these currencies really take off, sending money across borders might go from a slog of days to something closer to blinking speed. Trade could get faster, smoother, more efficient. But whoever builds the slickest, strongest digital pipes might end up holding a bigger slice of global influence. Then there is the idea of programmable money, where funds can come with strings attached, like expiring on a date or only working for specific things. It is the kind of thing that could twist the usual idea of fiscal policy into something much more precise, maybe even unnerving.

For crypto, it is a strange mix of threat and validation. On one hand, CBDCs show that the core ideas behind blockchain actually work. On the other, all that official digital money could drain attention and liquidity away from decentralized tokens and stablecoins. Crypto projects might have to shape up, get clearer, get useful, and prove they can live alongside these government approved digital heavyweights.

What Is the Difference Between CBDCs and Cryptocurrency?

While there are many ways to distinguish between CBDCs and crypto, the core difference between these digital assets comes down to centralized versus decentralized control. Where digital tokens like cryptocurrency and stablecoins are defined by their decentralization, separate from regulatory bodies like central banks, CBDCs are directly governed by such institutions.

The presence of a regulatory solution should ensure that a CBDC is as stable as the traditional currency it is tied to, leading to stability in comparison to cryptocurrency. At the same time, privacy and surveillance concerns largely absent from crypto projects could take center stage within a CBDC initiative. Where traditional currency is difficult to trace, every transaction could be recorded by a CBDC's governing body.

It is for this reason that the U.S. recently passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, preventing the implementation of a CBDC for the nation. While this decision may limit areas of growth for the U.S., it could allow the nation to learn from how other world leaders attempt to implement a CBDC before doing so itself. 

Exploring a Potential Impact on the Crypto Market and the Bitcoin Price USD

Though cryptocurrency and CBDCs are distinguished by centralized versus decentralized control, it is possible that the implementation of a CBDC could impact the crypto market. This is especially true for stablecoins, which are often connected to traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar. Though stablecoins are largely intended to eliminate the need for the exchange of crypto and fiat currency, a fast, low-cost, and well-regulated CBDC could overtake this role.

A Future in Digital Currency

As countries look to adopt or avoid CBDC technology, the matter of financial control versus individual sovereignty rises to the surface. A CBDC could provide the average person with new levels of financial control, automating tax collection, stimulus distribution, and accelerating payments. On the other hand, the technology could risk independence. For this reason, decentralized cryptocurrencies remain a prominent facet of the modern digital environment.

BIS appoints Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli to lead its Innovation Hub as it advances CBDC pilots, tokenised deposits and digital money

 

The Bank for International Settlements has chosen Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli to lead its Innovation Hub from March. 

His appointment arrives at a time when central banks are looking into major changes in payment systems, digital money frameworks and tokenised financial tools.

The BIS revealed his appointment through a formal statement. He will serve a five-year term and join the executive committee at the Switzerland-based institution. 

Mancini-Griffoli currently works at the International Monetary Fund as assistant director for the Monetary and Capital Markets Department. His role there covers payments, currencies and financial market infrastructure.

— Bank for International Settlements (@BIS_org) November 25, 2025



The Innovation Hub started operations in 2019. The Hub studies new financial technology that could support central banks and public institutions. It also builds prototypes, tests platforms and supplies research for ongoing digital currency projects. 

Additionally, its centres operate in Singapore, Hong Kong, London, Toronto, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Paris and Switzerland. The network has completed more than 30 projects so far and has over 20 running.

Mancini-Griffoli stands out as one of the most prominent voices on digital money inside the IMF. 

His work covers CBDCs, payment rails, settlement systems and models for regulated digital assets. He has also urged caution toward private stablecoins that lack strong oversight or safe reserves.

He often argues that secure digital money should combine public oversight and private innovation. 

One of his most discussed ideas is the synthetic CBDC model. That model allows the private sector to issue digital money while holding central bank reserves to protect users. 

He noted that such arrangements could give private firms room to build new services while giving the system stronger safeguards.

He also supported tokenised financial instruments when they operate under clear rules. His work stresses the need for structures that protect users from liquidity issues or loss of value. 

He also often warns that poorly designed products can expose users to unnecessary risks.

The Innovation Hub runs some of the most advanced pilots involving digital currency and tokenised finance. The mBridge project links several central banks and tests cross-border CBDC settlement. 

It also aims to improve cross-border payments that often face delays or high fees.

Another project, Agora, focuses on tokenised deposits. It studies how banks could issue tokenised versions of customer deposits and settle them through shared infrastructure. 

The Hub also works on Project Nexus, a system that connects instant payment networks across countries. Nexus aims to help users send funds across borders using existing national payment systems.

Notably, all of these projects share a common trait. They look to upgrade traditional payment frameworks by using ideas inspired by blockchain technology. 

The Hub does not seek to replace public money with private tokens. Instead, it studies how modern tools can work under central bank oversight.

The BIS also welcomed a new general manager earlier this year. Pablo Hernández de Cos took over after serving as governor of the Bank of Spain. 

His term started in July and will last five years, as the organisation enters a period of leadership renewal.","{'href': 'https://www.livebitcoinnews.com', 'title': 'Live Bitcoin News'}","cryptocurrency"

U.S. Attorney's Office Seizes On Crypto Crime Enforcement Opportunity With Announcement Of Strike Force","https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/fin-tech/1710602/dc-us-attorneys-office-seizes-on-crypto-crime-enforcement-opportunity-with-announcement-of-strike-force","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 03:19:03 GMT","

Cryptocurrency investment scams perpetrated by transnational
criminal organizations (TCOs) located in Southeast Asia are on the
rise. Colloquially known as ""pig-butchering"" scams, TCOs
build trust with victims, convince victims to invest in real
cryptocurrency, and then con victims into transferring the real
cryptocurrency into fake cryptocurrency investments. The TCO
scammers then launder the cryptocurrency through sophisticated
methods to include the utilization of accounts that are outside of
U.S. jurisdiction. According to the U.S. Secret Service
(""USSS""), ""this scam industry defrauds Americans of
nearly $10 billion per year.""1 Now, the U.S.
Attorney's office for the District of Columbia has announced it
has a plan to stop them.

On November 12, 2025, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia
Jeanine Ferris Pirro announced the creation of the Scam Center
Strike Force (""Strike Force"") in partnership with several
law enforcement and Federal agency partners.2 The Strike
Force's stated goal is to ""secure America against
Southeast Asian cryptocurrency-related fraud and
scams""3 by recovering stolen assets used to evade
sanctions and facilitate scams and returning those assets to
victims.

The Strike Force will use civil forfeiture actions to reclaim
not just the stolen funds but also the infrastructure utilized to
facilitate the scams, such as satellite terminals used for internet
connection. While the seizure of property does require judicially
authorized warrants, subsequent civil forfeiture actions do not
require any initiation of criminal proceedings. These actions are
against the property itself and do not require the property to be
owned or in the actual custody of the perpetrators of the alleged
criminal activity at the time of the seizure. The government must
only explain in the warrant by a preponderance of the evidence, or
more likely than not, that the property is linked to criminal
activity. If the government can meet this low burden, law
enforcement officials have the authority to seize and take control
of the property for eventual forfeiture.

The DOJ's civil forfeiture authority is extremely broad and
can pose significant complications for those whose property is
seized. Property owners with no actual knowledge of the alleged
criminal activity may still lose possession of their items, which
can be difficult and time-consuming to contest, as the property
owners must both establish ownership of the property and in some
instances prove that the property was not connected to a crime.
However, proponents counter that civil forfeiture is an essential
tool in combating organized crime as the seizure of criminal
enterprises' assets and proceeds materially disrupts their
operations.

Despite their arguments to the contrary, foreign-based
cryptocurrency exchanges are not beyond the reach of U.S.
jurisdiction in the context of civil forfeiture. Statutes
empowering the Strike Force to engage in civil forfeiture, such as
the terrorism subsection of the Civil forfeiture statute,
4 explicitly extend to foreign and domestic assets. DOJ
has strong policy and enforcement incentives to use civil
forfeiture proceedings under this statute against TCOs,
particularly those designated as Foreign Terrorist
Organizations.

The Strike Force is identified and focused on Chinese-organized
crime affiliates with operations in Cambodia, Laos, and Burma as
key leaders of these cryptocurrency investment schemes. The Strike
Force has already conducted operations in Myanmar, Indonesia, and
Thailand, and has seized and forfeited over $400 million dollars in
scam-obtained cryptocurrency funds. As part of U.S. Attorney
Piro's November 12 Strike Force announcement, she noted the
Strike Force has initiated civil forfeiture proceedings seeking
another $80 million in stolen funds.

Though the Strike Force is focused on Southeast Asia, the rise
of cryptocurrency investment scams is a global trend. For example,
on November 14, 2025, the Department of Justice announced five
guilty pleas and over $15 million in civil forfeiture actions
against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for
""multimillion-dollar virtual currency heists at four overseas
virtual currency platforms in 2023,"" among other
charges.5 In addition, on October 14, 2025, the DOJ
announced the largest ever forfeiture action against approximately
$15 billion in Bitcoin tied to a multinational business
conglomerate's alleged involvement in cryptocurrency investment
fraud schemes run through forced labor compounds.6 The
Bitcoin was previously stored in unhosted digital wallets whose
private keys the chairman and founder of the conglomerate had in
his possession.

Moreover, the Strike Force is aligned with a broader shift in
U.S. strategy for addressing cryptocurrency scams. In April 2025,
U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche published a memorandum
titled ""Ending Regulation by Prosecution,"" which outlined
the DOJ's approach to digital asset enforcement under the Trump
Administration.7 Blanche stated that the DOJ would
""focus on prosecuting individuals who victimize digital asset
investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of
criminal offenses such as terrorism, narcotics and human
trafficking, organized crime, hacking, and cartel and gang
financing.""8 Further, DOJ prosecutors would start
prioritizing cases ""that hold accountable individuals who (a)
cause financial harm to digital asset investors and consumers;
and/or (b) use digital assets in furtherance of other criminal
conduct.""9 The Strike Force is a clear step in this
direction.

Corporations operating in sectors related to cryptocurrency or
any companies dealing in large sums of digital assets on foreign
exchanges should consider the creation of the Strike Force a
warning sign that their assets may be at risk of being frozen even
absent direct criminal exposure. Notably, the laws authorizing the
Strike Force's activity can be applied to persons that arguably
facilitate violations or are strictly liable, including situations
where the person ""should have known"" that they were
facilitating a violation.

Given the heightened enforcement risk, those in the
cryptocurrency space should engage in the following best
practices:

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Discovered ‘Highly Energetic' Water With Massive Potential","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69525264/highly-energetic-water/","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 14:30:00 GMT","

Researchers found that when a molecule displaces trapped water, the energy that the water leaves behind allows the molecule to create stronger bonds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Whether in the form of flowing rivers, undulating waves, or raindrops streaking down a car window, water almost always seems to be in motion. But what would happen if it was trapped to the point that it was completely unable to move?

It is possible for liquid water to be immobilized, but things get weird when it happens. When confined to the especially tight spaces between molecules, it can start behaving strangely, and how exactly it interacts with those molecules its trapped between was unknown. This was the puzzle that chemist Frank Biedermann from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany wanted to solve. In an attempt to end the debate over whether trapped water coexists with its surrounding molecules or is involved in their interactions, he and his research team studied the behavior of trapped water through computer simulations—and found something surprising.

Water trapped between molecules is highly energetic despite not being able to move, but that changes as soon as another molecule enters the scene and the water is displaced. With so much pent-up energy, the water zooms out of the space it was occupying, pushing the new molecule in. And as it turns out, the energy it releases is intense enough to actually strengthen the connection between the new molecule and the empty space it is now filling. It also strengthens the bonds between the original molecule and the other molecules it bonds with—though how strong that bond becomes depends on the type of substance with which the water is interacting.

“The present computational analysis of simplified host-guest systems clearly shows that binding affinities are strongly influenced by the thermodynamic properties of the water displaced from binding sites,” Biedermann said in a study recently published in the journal Angewandte Chemie. “These thermodynamic properties of water and the associated favorability of water displacement vary strongly with the chemical nature of the host [molecule].”

Think of this phenomenon like a crowded subway car at rush hour, when every seat and space to stand is taken. Passengers are going to be eager to get out as soon as humanly possible, and an onrush of people will pour out onto the platform when the doors finally open, allowing for different people to claim every available seat or place to stand before the train takes off again. The initial group of passengers is like the water molecule. Once they escape, they leave an empty car for the second group to squeeze themselves into, and seeing how much free space exists on the platform may have them frantically pushing past everyone else.

While no physical transfer of energy happens on a subway, it could be argued that people streaming out the doors could be incentive for those waiting to board to rush in and grab a seat as soon as possible before only standing room is left. And the whole thing gets kicked up to 11 at rush hour. Likewise, highly energetic water can release more or less energy depending on how much energy it has to begin with and what kind of molecule is incoming, acting as a binding force for the new molecule. Water that has more energy to release and interacts with the right molecule acts like those rush hour crowds.

Biedermann's discovery could have applications far beyond figuring out the physics and chemistry of trapped water behavior. Strengthening bonds between molecules this way could ultimately create stronger medications and materials. If water is found to be trapped between proteins in a medication, scientists can develop a formula that allows for specific active molecules to displace that water and take advantage of the binding force its energy offers. Enhanced bonds would then make the treatment more effective.

“The concepts developed here are applicable to other macromolecular host molecules,” the researchers said. “Thus, [they] can be broadly useful to explain observations and guide the design of pharmaceutical drugs and supramolecular systems.”

Scientists found 3.3 billion-year-old biosignatures in ancient meteorites and fossils—a billion years older than we thought possible.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Evidence of ancient life on Earth is tough to track down, but a group of scientists believe they've managed to find some of the oldest. Using machine learning, they've estimated that the oldest biomolecules we know of are about 2.5 billion years old, and the oldest biosignatures are 3.3 billion years old—over a billion years older than anyone thought possible. 

In a new study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), the authors claim that their findings both deepen our understanding of Earth's earliest biosphere and provide new avenues for potentially finding past life on Mars and other planets. 

The team, led by the Carnegie Science research institute, studied the world's oldest rocks to make it happen. They used high-resolution chemical analysis to break down organic and inorganic material from the rocks into molecular fragments, and trained an artificial intelligence system to recognize the chemical fingerprints left behind by life. By analyzing 406 diverse samples (both ancient and modern) of plants, animals, fossils, and meteorites, the AI model learned to distinguish between biological and non-biological material with over 90 percent accuracy. 

The model's biggest splash came in the form of the detection of signs of photosynthesis in rocks at least 2.5 billion years old. Until now, only rocks younger than 1.7 billion years old have shown those traces. 

“Ancient life leaves more than fossils; it leaves chemical echoes,” Robert Hazen, a senior staff scientist at Carnegie Science and the study's lead author, said in a statement. “Using machine learning, we can now reliably interpret these echoes for the first time.” 

The chemistry ‘partnered' with machine learning to show faint chemical “whispers” of biology locked inside the ancient rocks. The computers were trained to recognize any type of molecular trace left behind by living organisms, even well after the biomolecules were long gone. 

The team said that Earth's earliest life hasn't left many molecular traces, and any ancient cells that were still around were eventually swallowed up by Earth's crust, all but obliterating biosignatures that could hold clues about the origins of life. The research team, though, believes their ancient rocks can bring that history back to the surface, providing glimpses of the ghosts of biomolecules long after those molecules have degraded. 

“Ancient rocks are full of interesting puzzles that tell us the story of life on Earth, but a few of the pieces are always missing,” Katie Maloney, an assistant professor in Michigan State University and co-author of the study, said in a statement. “Pairing chemical analysis and machine learning has revealed biological clues about ancient life that were previously invisible.” 

Most of the organic molecules from the past have been significantly altered by geological processes through deep time, but they're still quite useful to study. The authors wrote that applying machine learning techniques nearly doubles time in the fossil organic matter record that can retain detectable molecular information, offering a fresh way to approach studying ancient Earth.

This process isn't restricted to Earth-formed fossils, either. “This innovative technique helps us to read the deep time fossil record in a new way,” Maloney said. “This could help guide the search for life on other planets.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A hidden brain energy signal drives depression and anxiety","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251126025315.htm","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 08:04:49 GMT","

A new JNeurosci study led by Tian-Ming Gao and colleagues at Southern Medical University examined how adenosine triphosphate (ATP) signaling might influence depression and anxiety in male mice. ATP is best known as the cell's main source of energy, but it also acts as a chemical messenger that helps neurons communicate. Because healthy communication between brain cells is essential for regulating emotions, the researchers focused their work on the hippocampus, a region involved in memory, stress responses, and the development of depressive symptoms.

To better understand how ATP functions in this area, the team examined signaling patterns in the hippocampus and how they changed under stress. The hippocampus has long been associated with mood disorders, in part because it is sensitive to prolonged stress and is involved in shaping emotional behavior. disruptions in this region can affect how the brain processes stress, which may set the stage for depression or anxiety.

Stress, ATP Loss, and the Role of Connexin 43

The researchers found that male mice prone to developing depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors after long-term stress had lower levels of ATP. These mice also produced less of a key protein required for ATP release (connexin 43). Connexin 43 forms channels that allow ATP to move between certain cells, making it an important part of how the brain maintains healthy energy and signaling levels.

To test whether reduced ATP release contributed to mood-related symptoms, the team genetically decreased or removed connexin 43 in cells that normally release ATP. This experiment was done in another group of mice that had not been exposed to prolonged stress. Even without a stressful environment, lowering connexin 43 triggered depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors and reduced ATP levels. This finding suggested that disruptions in ATP release alone could influence emotional behavior.

When the researchers restored connexin 43 in the hippocampus of stressed mice, ATP levels returned to normal and the animals showed noticeable improvements in their behavior. This recovery helped reinforce the idea that ATP signaling plays a central role in regulating mood.

A Shared Biological Pathway for Depression and Anxiety

Gao explains, ""This is the first direct evidence that deficient ATP release in [a region of the] hippocampus drives both depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, revealing a shared molecular pathway [for these conditions]."" Identifying such a pathway is important, as depression and anxiety often occur together and can be difficult to treat simultaneously with existing therapies.

Gao notes that the link between connexin 43 and ATP release highlights a possible target for future treatments. By improving or restoring ATP signaling, scientists may eventually be able to develop interventions that address both conditions at once. The research team also plans to include both male and female mice in upcoming studies to determine whether these mechanisms operate similarly across sexes, which could broaden the relevance of their findings.

Off the coast of Papua New Guinea, scientists have identified a previously unknown type of hydrothermal field where two different processes occur at the same time: hot hydrothermal fluids rise from below the seafloor while unusually large quantities of methane and other hydrocarbons escape from the sediments. This combination has not been documented anywhere else. The site is located about 1,300 meters deep on the slope of Conical Seamount in the western Pacific, near the island of Lihir in Papua New Guinea.

The findings were recently described in Scientific Reports.

ROV delivers the surprise

""We essentially have a hot vent bubbling right next to a cool gas seep -- a combination that has never been described before,"" says Dr. Philipp Brandl, marine geologist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel. He was chief scientist on the SONNE expedition SO299 DYNAMET, which surveyed the Tabar-Lihir-Tanga-Feni island chain in 2023 to investigate the region's underwater volcanoes (seamounts).

Brandl adds: ""No one really expected to find a hydrothermal field here, let alone one that is so exceptional."" Earlier missions had shown hints of limited hydrothermal activity, yet this field went unnoticed during several previous research cruises. Only when the team deployed the ROV Kiel 6000 did the unusual features of the site become clear. ""It was a real surprise,"" Brandl says, ""especially for those of us who had worked in this area multiple times.""

A hybrid system of hot and cool vents

Hydrothermal vents and methane seeps typically appear in separate locations on the seafloor. In this instance, however, their close spacing results from the specific makeup of Conical Seamount. Thick layers of sediment rich in organic material lie beneath the volcanic edifice. Rising magma heats these buried layers, producing methane and other hydrocarbons. At the same time, the heat from the magma drives chemically rich fluids upward until they exit the seafloor as hot hydrothermal vents.

Both the heated fluids from below and the cooler, methane-filled gases from the sediments move upward through the same pathways. As a result, hot water and cold gas emerge from the seafloor only a few centimeters apart.

A habitat unlike any other

This unusual arrangement creates an entirely new kind of deep-sea environment that supports an exceptionally varied community of organisms. The rocks are densely covered by Bathymodiolus mussels, tube worms, shrimp, amphipods, and vivid purple sea cucumbers. ""In places, you couldn't see a single patch of rock because everything is so densely populated,"" Brandl says. ""We are confident that some of the species there have not yet been described. However, a dedicated expedition would be needed to fully study this unique habitat.""

Because mussels dominate the area, the research team and local observer Stanis Konabe from the University of Papua New Guinea named the site 'Karambusel'. In Tok Pisin, the word means 'mussel'.

Traces of precious metals in the rock

The unusual mixture of gases at Karambusel affects both the ecosystem and the geological characteristics of the vent field. Methane levels exceed 80 percent, and hot fluids rising from below create distinctive chemical conditions in the subsurface. Gold and silver, along with arsenic, antimony, and mercury, accumulate in the surrounding rocks. These minerals indicate that the area once experienced high-temperature hydrothermal activity that deposited precious metals, even though current activity is cooler.

Threats from human activity

Although the site is remarkable for both its geology and its biology, it faces significant risks. Mining operations already occur nearby, such as at the Ladolam gold mine on Lihir, where waste material is discharged into the ocean. Additional exploration licences for seafloor minerals and hydrocarbons are in place. These activities pose threats to the delicate ecosystem and the organisms that depend on it.

The researchers urge further investigation of this region, along with careful marine spatial planning and protective measures to safeguard the site. Philipp Brandl states: ""We have discovered an unexpected treasure trove of biodiversity in the Karambusel field that needs to be protected before economic interests destroy it.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New study shows rheumatoid arthritis begins long before symptoms","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251126095037.htm","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 18:02:23 GMT","

Scientists have found that rheumatoid arthritis (RA) begins long before the first aches or stiffness appear. Instead of starting when joint pain becomes noticeable, the disease quietly builds over many years. RA is a chronic autoimmune disorder that leads to inflammation and damage in the joints.

According to new research, people who are at higher risk for RA undergo major changes in their immune system well before symptoms surface. Their bodies are already engaged in an unseen autoimmune struggle during this early, silent period.

A Multi-Institution Study Maps RA's Hidden Early Phase

Researchers from the Allen Institute, CU Anschutz, University of California San Diego, and the Benaroya Research Institute worked together to uncover these early immune changes. Their findings, published in Science Translational Medicine, offer the most detailed view to date of how RA takes shape. By charting immune activity in individuals at risk, the team showed that the disease process is already underway long before joint problems are noticeable. These insights may help guide earlier intervention and possibly prevent disease onset.

""Overall, we hope this study raises awareness that rheumatoid arthritis begins much earlier than previously thought and that it enables researchers to make data-driven decisions on strategies to disrupt disease development,"" said Mark Gillespie, Ph.D., assistant investigator at the Allen Institute and co-senior author with Kevin Deane (CU Anschutz), M.D./Ph.D.; Adam Savage (Allen Institute), Ph.D.; Troy Torgerson (Allen Institute), M.D./Ph.D.; and Gary S. Firestein (UC San Diego), M.D. The research followed individuals with ACPA antibodies over seven years. These antibodies are well-established biomarkers for those at risk for RA. During the study, the team uncovered previously unrecognized contributors to disease progression, including widespread inflammation, immune system malfunction, and shifts in how certain immune cells function.

""We expect that going forward the findings from this study will support additional studies to identify ways to better predict who will get RA, identify potential biologic targets for preventing RA as well as identify ways to improve treatments for those with existing RA,"" said Kevin Deane, M.D./Ph.D.

Key Findings

Toward Early Detection and Preventive Treatment

The findings highlight new early-warning indicators (biomarkers and immune signatures) that could help doctors determine which at-risk individuals are most likely to develop RA. Identifying the disease during this hidden phase may make it possible to monitor patients more closely and begin treatment earlier. If this process is caught in time, RA may be prevented before joint damage begins -- potentially sparing patients years of pain and disability. The research supports a shift from reacting to joint damage after it appears to preventing RA at its earliest stages.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New Mars images reveal hidden traces of a recent ice age","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251125081919.htm","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 11:07:24 GMT","

As we move from Mars's equatorial region toward its northern latitudes, we encounter Coloe Fossae. This area contains a series of long, shallow grooves set within a landscape of deep valleys, scattered impact craters, and surface textures that point to a distant ice age on the Red Planet.

Ice ages are not unique to Earth. Our planet alone has experienced several over the past 2.5 billion years. The most recent one, which reached its peak about 20,000 years ago, reduced Earth's global average temperature to approximately 7-10 °C (up to 8 °C cooler than today).

These ancient freezes are unrelated to modern human-driven climate warming. Instead, they result from slow, natural changes in a planet's orbit around the Sun and shifts in the angle of its rotational axis. During an ice age, glaciers and ice sheets expand, and varying temperatures cause these ice masses to repeatedly advance and shrink.

Martian Ice Age Clues Revealed in New Imagery

Other planets also record their own cycles of deep cold. Clear evidence appears on Mars, and the latest images from the High Resolution Stereo Camera aboard ESA's Mars Express show how strongly these past climates shaped the terrain.

In the images, several long, nearly parallel features run diagonally across the scene. These are the structures known as Coloe Fossae, created when alternating blocks of surface material dropped downward. The region also holds numerous craters formed by incoming space debris. They vary widely in shape and age: some are crisp, some eroded, some overlapping, and others partly buried. On the floors of many valleys and craters, swirling, grooved patterns reveal where icy material once moved during an earlier martian ice age.

Glacial Flow Patterns Across Mars

These distinctive textures offer insight into Mars's former climate. Scientists describe them as lineated valley fill (found in valleys) or concentric crater fill (seen in craters). They formed when slow-moving mixtures of ice and debris traveled across the surface, similar to the behavior of glaciers on Earth, and eventually became covered by a thicker layer of rocky material.

This region lies at a latitude of 39°N, far from Mars's north pole (at 90°N). This raises an important question: how did so much ice end up here?

How Mars Gathered Ice Far From Its Poles

The explanation comes from the repeated advance and retreat of glaciers during a previous martian ice age. Although modern Mars is dry, its long-term climate has swung between warmer and colder phases, with cycles of freezing and melting driven mainly by changes in the planet's axial tilt.

During colder intervals, ice spread outward from the poles and reached into the mid-latitudes. When temperatures rose again, the ice retreated but left behind clear traces of its presence. Lineated valley fill and concentric crater fill appear throughout this entire latitude zone, suggesting that Mars once experienced a global climate shift. This particular area may have been blanketed by ice as recently as half a million years ago, marking the end of the planet's most recent ice age.

Mapping Mars's Ancient Glacial Landscape

These indicators of past glacial activity, along with Coloe Fossae and the surrounding craters, are visible in the annotated images. The separation between Mars's northern and southern terrains is especially prominent in topographic and context maps. This boundary circles the planet; in some locations it forms a sharp, two-km-high scarp, while in others, such as here, it appears as a wide and heavily eroded transition zone (known as Protonilus Mensae).

Features such as lineated valley fill and concentric crater fill were also noted in our August Mars Express report on Acheron Fossae.

How the Images Were Created

The Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) was developed and is operated by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR). Processing of the camera's data was carried out at the DLR Institute of Planetary Research in Berlin-Adlershof. The working group of Planetary Science and Remote Sensing at Freie Universität Berlin produced the final image products shown here.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","New evidence shows the Maya collapse was more than just drought","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251126095041.htm","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 15:51:08 GMT","

Why do people choose to settle in cities, and what motivates them to leave? Modern urban areas continue to gain and lose residents for many reasons, including economic pressures, congestion, lifestyle shifts, pollution and, at times, major public health events.

It appears this pattern has existed for a very long time.

Early Cities and Agrarian Life

The first cities around the world were created by rural communities. These early residents were farmers, or agriculturists, who depended on land-extensive forms of production. Their livelihoods encouraged them to live in small, scattered settlements to reduce the effort and time required to reach their fields.

Even in ancient times, however, urban life was costlier in many respects. People living in cities faced higher exposure to infectious diseases that spread easily in crowds, greater competition for land and essential resources and increasing inequality. Surprisingly, many farmers still accepted these drawbacks and chose city life.

What explains this choice?

Investigating a Long-Running Debate

UC Santa Barbara archaeologist Douglas Kennett, who has spent years examining the development of Classic Maya cities, notes that researchers have debated this question for decades. According to Kennett, the explanation is complex and involves several intertwined factors that contributed to both the growth and eventual decline of these ancient urban centers.

Kennett and colleagues from multiple institutions examined this issue in detail in a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Their work applies population ecology theory to quantify the forces that shaped urbanization across the Classic Maya Lowlands.

Forces Behind the Rise of Maya Cities

""We determined that the rise and expansion of Classic Maya cities resulted from the interaction of climate downturns, intergroup conflict and the presence of strong economies of scale realized through capital investments in agricultural infrastructure,"" Kennett said. ""These factors promoted the coevolution of urbanism, systemic inequality and patron-client relationships in cities.""

Using the same analytical approach, he explained, the team also identified the conditions that triggered deurbanization. According to their findings, people began to leave ""when the benefits of urban living no longer outweighed the costs, as environments were degraded near cities and climate amelioration improved the livability of rural areas where people would have more freedom and autonomy.""

Climate, Conflict and New Data

The researchers originally focused on the role of climate change, particularly drought, in the decline of Classic Maya cities. Since 2012, the team has compiled archaeological information on population shifts, conflict and investments in agricultural systems. Their work gained new momentum when high-resolution climate records became available.

""We also capitalized on major developments in computational modeling that allowed us to look at the relationships between these datasets in ways not previously possible,"" Kennett said.

A Unified Model of Urban Change

The study brings together several previously competing explanations for ancient urban growth and decline, including environmental pressures, warfare and economic dynamics. It does so in a single, flexible model grounded in population ecology. This framework also helps explain why agrarian societies, which normally benefit from living spread out, sometimes gathered in cities despite the financial and social costs.

""The biggest surprise for me was that the abandonment of cities occurred under improving climatic conditions,"" Kennett noted. ""We have long thought that the decline of Classic Maya cities partially resulted from an extended period of drought. It turns out to be a much more complicated and interesting story.""

Insights for Understanding Urban Evolution

Overall, the research offers valuable guidance for interpreting both past and future patterns of urban growth and decline. By identifying broad principles that influence how populations concentrate and disperse, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of urban evolution across different eras and environments.

Lightning is among the most energetic manifestation of electrical activity in planetary atmospheres, with documented observations not only on Earth but also on Saturn and Jupiter1. On Mars, the existence of electrical activity has long been suspected2,3 but never directly demonstrated. The dusty atmosphere of Mars undergoes aeolian processes, ranging from wind-blown dust and sand, metre-to-hundred-metre-sized dust devils to thousand-kilometre-scale dust storms4, which, in Earth's deserts, can become electrified through triboelectric charging5,6,7. For this reason, electric fields have been predicted to build up on Mars8,9,10, but with no measurement of Martian atmospheric electrical activity so far. Here we report in situ detections of triboelectric discharges, identified by their electrical and acoustic signatures captured by the SuperCam microphone aboard the Perseverance rover11,12. Fifty-five events have been detected over two Martian years, usually associated with dust devils and dust storm convective fronts. These serendipitous observations demonstrate that Martian electric fields can reach the breakdown threshold of the near-surface atmosphere of Mars, predicted to be on the order of several tens of kV m−1. Such electrical activity could affect dust dynamics13,14 and potentially fuel a reactive electrochemical environment enhancing the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, with consequences for the preservation of organic molecules15,16. This in situ evidence may have implications for surface chemistry, habitability and human exploration.

Each bar indicates the fraction of a given sol recorded by the microphone. On average, the microphone acquires one 167-s recording every two sols, which is a very small percent of time.

a, Accommodation of the SuperCam microphone within the SuperCam Mast Unit. The microphone component is standing outside the housing of the instrument and is connected to its amplification electronics through two harnesses routed in a loop. This loop is probably where the electromagnetic field from the discharge interferes with the microphone subsystem (Methods section ‘Microphone response to an electromagnetic discharge'). b, Current waveform of a discharge (top) and the waveform of the induced voltage (bottom) defined as proportional to the derivative of the discharge current waveform.

Solid blue and red spectra represent the acoustic signal of discharges recorded on Sol 317 and Sol 1,296, respectively. Red spectrum is offset by a factor of 2 for display. The dotted blue spectrum corresponds to the noise floor of the instrument. They are compared with the average spectrum of SuperCam laser-induced acoustic signals (grey curve, offset by a factor 100) recorded for targets ablated at 3 m from the instrument (blast of approximately 0.5 Pa amplitude, comparable with the sound amplitude of the Sol 1,296 discharge). The two discharges are recorded at a sampling frequency of 25 kHz, whereas the laser-induced acoustic signal is recorded at a sampling frequency of 100 kHz (Methods section ‘Microphone data collection'). The similar lobed shape spectra indicate that the acoustic source is of the same nature, that is, a shock wave. Laser-induced acoustic spectrum and discharge spectra show the spectral notch around 6 kHz, indicative of the echo on the SuperCam housing.

a, A Wimshurst machine uses rotating discs and metal sectors to generate high voltage through triboelectric charging, storing the accumulated charge in capacitors (Leyden jars) for a subsequent discharge between the two spherical electrodes when they reach the air breakdown voltage. A discharge was generated in air, at ambient room conditions, for a distance between the two electrodes of 10 mm and a machine to microphone distance of about 1.2 m. This corresponds to a discharge energy on the order of tens of mJ (considering a capacitance of 100 pF and a breakdown potential of roughly 3 MV m−1). b, Time series of the microphone output signal in which the three electromagnetic (EM) signatures observed in the Mars data are reproduced: (1) spikes (around −15 and −5 ms); (2) the overshoot (at 0 ms); and (3) the relaxation, up to 10 ms. The acoustic signal is recorded at 3.5 ms with a long coda owing to the numerous echoes in the room in which the experiment was performed. Spikes occur during the charging of the capacitors while no arc between the two electrodes is seen. The overshoot and the relaxation are synchronized with the ignition of an arc discharge between the two electrodes. Amplitudes of the overshoot and the acoustic signal differ from Mars data owing to the different natures of the discharges (discharge current waveforms change as a result of the different properties of the background atmospheres) and sound propagation conditions. The characteristic time of the relaxation is longer than on Mars data, probably attributed to differences between the two sets of electronics.

The points indicated by an arrow represent saturated overpressure values. They are compared with overpressure profiles derived from the weak shock-wave propagation theory (Methods section ‘Discharge energy estimation') computed for three different blast energies E0. The solid horizontal line represents the noise floor of the microphone at 2.5 mPa. As a consequence, discharges of 0.1 nJ cannot be recorded if they occur more than 70 cm away from the microphone.

The energy of the discharge is computed as Egrain = 0.5qgrainEbdd, with Ebd = 25 kV m−1 the breakdown threshold potential for the Mars atmosphere and qgrain the charge of a single spherical grain of a given diameter, considering a charging density of about 10 µC kg−1 and a density of 2,500 kg m−3. d is the length of the discharge; 0.1, 1-mm and 10-mm examples are represented here.

a, Measurement of Δt, the duration of the compression wave for the acoustic signal radiated from the discharge on sol 1,296. b, Assumed geometry of the discharge of length d, located at a distance r from the microphone, in an atmosphere having a sound speed c. The time delay Δt between the arrival time of the acoustic waves from the two ends of the discharge is computed as a function of r and d (Methods section ‘Constraint on the discharge length').

Distribution of wind intensity in microphone recording (blue, left axis) compared with the detection of discharges per wind bin (red, right axis). The wind intensity is computed as the root mean square pressure of the microphone signal in the 20–60-Hz frequency bandwidth31. This distribution is separated in three regimes: the low wind regime for wind intensity lower than 10−3 Pa, which corresponds to speed lower than 3 m s−1; the moderate wind regime from 10−3 to 10−2 Pa, which corresponds to wind speeds between 3 and 10 m s−1; and the high wind regime above 10−2 Pa, corresponding to speeds faster than 10 m s−1 (see ref. 31).

a, Sol 215. b, Sol 1,296. The first row corresponds to the sound amplitude recorded by the microphone. Discharge signals are highlighted in red. The second row is a spectrogram (time–frequency) plot of the recording showing the wind signal at low frequency (<2 kHz) and the grain impacts signal around 3.5 kHz. The continuous tone at 870 Hz is radiated from the pumps of the rover. Spikes detected in these recordings are distinguished from grain impacts by their frequency content, which radiates at all frequencies. The third row is the static pressure as recorded by MEDA, showing the pressure drop associated with the passage of a dust devil. The fourth row is the air temperature as recorded by MEDA at a height of 1.45 m. The last row is the downwelling shortwave flux on the MEDA RDS Top-7 photodiode in W m−2. The dust carried by the dust devil locally above the rover induces a reduction of the flux during the passage of the dust devil. For Sol 1,296, the pressure and RDS acquisitions started only 5 and 11 s, respectively, after beginning microphone recording, losing the data from the approach phase of the dust devil.

Navcam images73 aimed at 72° are shown from Sols 1,242 (a), 1,245 (b), 1,246 (c) and 1,248 (d). The images show a 96° × 18° field of view looking towards the northern to eastern rim of Jezero crater and were taken with the NCAM00500 sequence. Low visibility around Sols 1,245 and 1,246 shows that there was an increase in boundary-layer dust despite the lack of increase in column optical depth. Note that the rover moved westward between the images.

The molecular mechanisms that enable memories to persist over long timescales from days to weeks and months are still poorly understood1. Here, to develop insights into this process, we created a behavioural task in which mice formed multiple memories but only consolidated some, while forgetting others, over the span of weeks. We then monitored circuit-specific molecular programs that diverged between consolidated and forgotten memories. We identified multiple distinct waves of transcription, that is, cellular macrostates, in the thalamocortical circuit that defined memory persistence. Of note, a small set of transcriptional regulators orchestrated broad molecular programs that enabled entry into these macrostates. Targeted CRISPR-knockout studies revealed that although these transcriptional regulators had no effects on memory formation, they had prominent, causal and strikingly time-dependent roles in memory stabilization. In particular, the calmodulin-dependent transcription factor CAMTA1 was required for initial memory maintenance over days, whereas the transcription factor TCF4 and the histone methyltransferase ASH1L were required later to maintain memory over weeks. These results identify a critical CAMTA1–TCF4–ASH1L thalamocortical transcriptional cascade that is required for memory stabilization and put forth a model in which the sequential recruitment of circuit-specific transcriptional programs enables memory maintenance over progressively longer timescales.

Industrial and agricultural chemicals such as pesticides are often considered to have restricted biological activity. Yet, there are concerns regarding their broader toxicity range and impact on human gut microbiota. Here we report a systematic in vitro screening to assess the impact of 1,076 pollutants, spanning diverse chemistries and indicated applications, on 22 prevalent gut bacteria. Our investigation uncovered 588 inhibitory interactions involving 168 chemicals, the majority of which were not previously reported to have antibacterial properties. Fungicides and industrial chemicals showed the largest impact, with around 30% exhibiting anti-gut-bacterial properties. We demonstrate that the scale of our dataset enables a machine learning approach for predicting the antibacterial activity of pesticides. Mechanistically, chemical–genetic screens using transposon mutant libraries of Parabacteroides merdae and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron implicated genes involved in conserved efflux pathways, including the acrR locus, as mediators of pollutant resistance. We also found that loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for metabolic enzymes were selected under pollutant exposure, including those for branched short-chain fatty acid biosynthesis under tetrabromobisphenol A, a flame retardant. Taken together, our results suggest that the antibacterial activity of chemical pollutants should be considered in future studies on the microbiome and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, as well as in toxicological assessments.

Synthetic chemicals have become indispensable for agriculture and industry. Their pervasive use and environmental persistence have led to pollution levels exceeding the planetary boundary for stable and resilient Earth systems1,2,3. Pesticide pollutants are of particular concern, with the Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority documenting hundreds of different pesticide residues in food4,5, as well as broader water contamination6,7. Industrial chemicals, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), plasticizers, surface coatings and dyes, also routinely enter food and water via environmental pollution, agricultural application or industrial processing8.

The contamination of food and water by chemical pollutants potentially exposes the human gastrointestinal tract, through passage and enterohepatic circulation, to thousands of xenobiotic compounds9. Over 95% of Americans and nearly the entire Dutch population are estimated to have detectable levels of PFASs in their blood10,11. In a UK cohort, all tested urine samples showed detectable levels of pesticides, such as cypermethrin and permethrin (>96% samples), diethylphosphate (75% samples) and glyphosate (53% samples)12. Similarly, a German mother cohort study found hundreds of chemicals derived from consumer goods, cosmetics and food in plasma, reaching up to micromolar concentrations13. These studies indicate that the gut microbiota—a community of hundreds of microbial species—is probably exposed to numerous chemicals. Yet, little is known about the impact of agricultural and industrial chemical contaminants on gut bacteria.

Chemicals such as pesticides are usually marketed with a narrow definition of target organisms (for example, as insecticides, herbicides or fungicides). Yet, many chemicals have been reported to show off-purpose activity on non-target organisms, including soil bacteria14 and pathogens15. A small number of pesticides and industrial chemicals have also been shown to impact human and animal gut microbiota12,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. More broadly, human-targeted drugs have also been shown to impact gut bacterial growth and metabolism25,26. Collectively, these studies indicate that many pesticides and other chemical pollutants might exhibit inhibitory activity against gut bacteria. However, safety assessments for these chemicals currently do not consider the human gut microbiome.

In vivo assessment of the impact of chemicals on gut bacteria is currently not possible due to the lack of systematic and quantitative data on chemical exposure. Furthermore, disentangling the effects of chemicals from other factors such as diet and medications is not possible without mechanistic knowledge of direct chemical–bacteria interactions27,28. We therefore conducted a large-scale in vitro screen assessing the anti-gut-bacterial effect of 1,076 chemical pollutants, including pesticides, pesticide metabolites and industrial chemicals. The screen uncovered numerous growth inhibitory interactions, particularly with fungicides and industrial chemicals. We further used chemical–genetic screens to identify mechanisms of bacterial susceptibility to chemicals that overlap with antibiotic resistance. Our study expands the knowledgebase on xenobiotic toxicity in bacteria and demonstrates the feasibility of computational prediction using machine learning on chemical structures.

To systematically assess the impact of chemical contaminants, we used a large library of 1,076 compounds that are likely to enter food and water (Extended Data Fig. 1a). The library includes 829 pesticides (mainly herbicides, insecticides and fungicides), along with compounds targeting other organisms, including spiders, nematodes, bacteria and rodents. It also contains 119 known pesticide metabolites formed by biotransformation29 and 75 pesticide-related compounds (precursors, breakdown products, chemical isomers or formulation products). In addition, the library contains 48 industrial chemicals, such as the widespread contaminants bisphenols and nitrosamines, and five mycotoxins found in mould-contaminated foods. Several compounds are considered to be persistent organic pollutants, such as PFASs and the insecticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT, also known as clofenotane) and chlordecone. Overall, the library spans 291 out of 352 pesticide classes in the British Crop Production Council Pesticide Compendium and 87% of compounds reported in a study of pesticide discharge from rivers into oceans6. The library, together with extensive metadata (Supplementary Data 1), constitutes a resource for systematic investigation of the impact of chemical pollutants on biological systems.

We performed the chemical–bacteria screen at 20 μM concentration for all compounds. This dose was chosen for consistency with previous xenobiotic screens25,30,31, thus enabling direct comparison. To contextualize this dose, we analysed xenobiotic plasma concentrations from a recent study13. In 305 of 592 samples, at least one xenobiotic was observed at a concentration of 10 μM or higher. Among the measured xenobiotics, spinosyn A, melamine, mepiquat, acrylamide and amitrole, all of which are present in our compound library, most frequently surpassed 2 μM in plasma (45, 40, 39, 34 and 33 samples, respectively). Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that colonic concentrations tend to be in the same range or higher than in the plasma25,32. The relevance of micromolar-range doses is further supported by the food regulatory limits of some chemicals33. Furthermore, chemicals such as the antiparasitic closantel have been found in dairy products at micromolar levels34,35.

Next, we assessed the impact of all 1,076 compounds in the library on the growth of 22 commensal gut bacterial strains belonging to 21 species (Fig. 1a,b). These strains were selected based on their abundance and prevalence in the healthy human gut microbiota, as well as phylogenetic and metabolic representation (Supplementary Data 2)36,37. All strains were grown anaerobically at 37 °C in mGAM broth, a rich medium designed to support the growth of a maximum number of strains. Bacterial growth was monitored for 24 h and quantified as the area under the growth curve (AUC). We defined growth inhibition hits as chemical–bacteria interactions featuring a growth decrease of >20% and a false-discovery-rate adjusted P value (Padj) < 0.05. Only hits identified in at least two out of three biological replicates are considered (Supplementary Data 3 and Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Monocultures were grown in mGAM medium with 20 μM of each compound (n = 3 experiments on independent days).

Around one-sixth of the tested chemicals (168) were inhibitory against at least one bacterial strain (Fig. 1c). The most sensitive taxa were Bacteroidales, especially Parabacteroides distasonis, whereas Escherichia coli, Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies animalis and Akkermansia muciniphila were the least sensitive species (Fig. 1b,d). The chemical categories featuring prevalent anti-gut-bacterial activity (at least one in five compounds) were fungicides, industrial chemicals and acaricides (Fig. 1b). Although most compounds were inhibitory against a few strains, indicating a narrow spectrum of activity, 24 chemicals showed broad toxicity, inhibiting more than one-third of the species tested (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Broad-spectrum inhibitory compounds include closantel (a livestock antiparasitic; 19 strains), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA; a brominated flame retardant; 19 strains), chlordecone (an insecticide; 17 strains), bisphenol AF (BPAF; used in plastics; 12 strains), fluazinam (a fungicide; nine strains) and emamectin benzoate (an insecticide; 13 strains).

Around 150 chemical–bacteria interactions featured >90% growth reduction, uncovering strong anti-gut-bacterial activity for 33 compounds (Fig. 1e). To test whether the inhibitory activity was retained at lower concentrations, we tested 11 pesticides against eight bacteria across multiple concentrations (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Data 4). Independently purchased compounds were used to account for any errors associated with batch variations and large-scale library preparations. Most interactions from the main screen were also observed in this independent experiment (72%; 23 out of 32; Extended Data Fig. 1c,d), which is the expected range considering the physiological idiosyncrasies of non-model bacteria38. Many compounds show strong inhibitory effects at substantially lower concentrations than those tested in the main screen. For example, imazalil sulfate, closantel and prochloraz inhibit Eubacterium rectale, a prevalent species that produces the health-associated metabolite butyrate39, at a concentration as low as 2.5 µM. Together, our systematic assessment revealed hundreds of chemical–bacteria interactions, including contaminants with broad and potent anti-gut-bacterial activity.

The off-target activity of chemicals against gut bacteria has been reported for >1,000 human-targeted drugs and antibiotics by Maier et al.25,30. As in the case of therapeutic drugs, we observed a positive correlation between the number of compounds affecting a species and its relative abundance in human microbiomes (Spearman's rank correlation (ρ) = 0.57; P = 0.005) (Fig. 2a), but none with prevalence (Fig. 2b). Thus, chemicals with broad- as well as narrow-spectrum activity are likely to influence microbiome composition due to their impact on abundant taxa. Strains sensitive to many chemical pollutants were also sensitive to many therapeutic drugs tested by Maier et al. (ρ = 0.63; P = 0.009) (Fig. 2c). Pollutant sensitivity correlated more strongly with human-targeted drugs (ρ = 0.66; P = 0.004) than with antibiotics (⍴ = 0.33; P = 0.19) (Fig. 2d), which is consistent with the broader-spectrum activity of antibiotics. The correlation between chemical pollutants in our screen and human-targeted drugs supports that gut bacteria interact with diverse chemicals via common and non-specific mechanisms25,28,40.

The data are presented as means ± s.d.

Source data

Chemical susceptibility profiles of bacterial species grouped clearly by evolutionary relatedness (that is, by phylum; Fig. 2e), with most compounds showing phylum-level differences in toxicity (Extended Data Fig. 2a). For example, some Firmicutes were uniquely sensitive to conazole fungicides, including the widely used imazalil and prochloraz. This indicates a shared genetic basis for toxicity and suggests that chemical susceptibility data could help to predict effects on related bacterial species for in silico toxicological assessments.

We next investigated how species-level chemical effects translate in bacterial communities using a synthetic community of 20 gut bacteria (Com20)38 (Methods and Supplementary Data 5). Com20 is a phylogenetically and functionally diverse community, spanning six phyla, 11 families and 17 genera, collectively encoding >60% of the metabolic pathways present in healthy human gut microbiomes. Members of the community grow together stably and reproducibly in mGAM38—the growth medium used in our screen. The Com20 was transferred twice in fresh growth medium before being challenged with BPAF or TBBPA, two broad-spectrum anti-gut-bacterial chemicals. In the case of TBBPA, the community was dominated by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, despite its susceptibility in monoculture. BPAF induced compositional changes concordant with monoculture effects (Fig. 2f), including decreased relative abundances of B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Parabacteroides merdae and Roseburia intestinalis, and increased abundances of insensitive species (that is, Collinsella aerofaciens, Coprococcus comes and Streptococcus salivarius). Yet, F. nucleatum and E. rectale were protected against BPAF in the community (Fig. 2g).

Community-level effects, such as cross-protection, have been described in gut bacterial communities exposed to therapeutic drugs and could partly be attributed to compound bioaccumulation31,41. We hypothesized that cross-protection against BPAF in Com20 is due to bioaccumulation, as this has been observed in Bacteroidales monocultures42. We measured BPAF concentrations in whole culture, supernatant and pellets of Com20 cultures exposed to 20 µM BPAF using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS). We detected a 64% reduction in BPAF in supernatant compared with whole culture and recovered BPAF in the pellet (Fig. 2h), indicating that most of BPAF in Com20 is sequestered within cells, explaining cross-protection of some community members.

Large-scale surveys of xenobiotic–bacteria interactions, combined with computational analyses, could enable in silico toxicity predictions43. However, accurate prediction requires sufficient data spanning the relevant chemical space. To assess this, we compared the extended-connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) of our pollutant library with those of previously characterized pharmaceutical drugs25 and 250,000 random PubChem compounds.

Pollutants and pharmaceutical drugs were widely dispersed in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) space (Fig. 3a), indicating large chemical diversity for both groups. Notably, pollutants and drugs did not form clear clusters, and only six pollutants had a Tanimoto similarity to drugs of >0.75, highlighting limited molecular fingerprint overlap between the two libraries44,45 (Fig. 3b). This suggested that labels such as ‘pesticide' or ‘pharmaceutical drugs' do not capture the molecular basis of anti-gut-bacterial toxicity. To quantify how well pollutant and drug libraries jointly span the chemical space, we noted the Tanimoto similarity of each PubChem compound to its closest match in the libraries. This was significantly increased in the combined library (P < 2.2 × 10−16; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test; Extended Data Fig. 3a), indicating broader chemical-space coverage towards predicting the impact of novel compounds.

The two compound sets are structurally diverse and distinct, as only very few (six) compounds from the library used in this study had a similarity to a drug from ref. 25 of >0.75 (dashed line). Compounds shared between the two studies (n = 32; mostly veterinary drugs) were excluded from this analysis. c, Machine learning workflow to predict species-specific xenobiotic toxicity from molecular descriptors and embedded features.

Source data

To probe the utility of increased chemical-space coverage, we employed machine learning for predicting the anti-gut-bacterial activity of chemicals. We used two datasets: pesticides from our pollutant screen and the drug screen by Maier et al. (Fig. 3c). For each compound, we obtained a comprehensive set of structural features, including molecular fingerprints (Chemistry Development Kit) and deep-learning-based feature embeddings from MoLFormer46. The latter is a deep learning model trained on 1.1 billion molecules to predict a wide range of chemical properties, such as substructures, from simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) strings. To avoid excessively imbalanced groups for machine learning modelling, we chose seven species that showed >20 hits in both pollutant and drug datasets. Random forest classifier models were trained and evaluated using cross-validation with stratified splits. Classifications were obtained by thresholding probability outputs at the hit frequency of the training dataset—a strategy suitable for imbalanced datasets47.

We evaluated models using two metrics appropriate for imbalanced datasets: balanced accuracy (the mean of sensitivity and specificity) and average precision (the area under the precision-recall curve)48. Models trained and tested on pesticides alone achieved good performance when predicting pesticide toxicity (average balanced accuracy = 0.77; average precision = 0.65; 20× cross-validation; Fig. 3d). Performance varied slightly between species, with the best results obtained for E. rectale (balanced accuracy = 0.8; average precision = 0.73) and the weakest predictions for B. thetaiotaomicron (balanced accuracy = 0.73; average precision = 0.52). Training models on only molecular descriptor features (that is, excluding MoLFormer embeddings) slightly improved the performance (balanced accuracy = 0.81; average precision = 0.72), indicating that this smaller feature set is sufficient for predictions. Analysis of feature importance (Extended Data Fig. 3) identified molecular features implicated in antibacterial activity. Although a model trained and tested on the combined pesticide–drug dataset showed similar performance, cross-predictions from one dataset to another showed poorer performance (approximate balanced accuracy = 0.7; average precision = 0.2). This indicates that pesticides and drugs are overall different in both chemical and activity space (Fig. 3a). The pesticide toxicity against gut bacteria thus could not have been predicted based on previously available data.

Given the high sensitivity of Bacteroidales to pollutant compounds (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 2a), we aimed to investigate mechanisms of interaction in species of this order. We used a pooled transposon mutant library of P. merdae49 to identify genes that modulate the impact of xenobiotics on bacterial fitness. The library encompasses barcoded transposon insertion mutants (Tn mutants) of >3,000 non-essential genes, enabling a genome-wide functional analysis. We conducted the competition assay against a panel of ten chemicals. TBBPA, BPAF, imazalil sulfate, fluazinam, closantel and emamectin benzoate were tested at concentrations of ≤20 μM, whereas glyphosate, propiconazole, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) were tested at ≥20 μM to ensure sufficient selective pressure (Methods). Cultures inoculated with the pooled library were grown to the early stationary phase, and Tn mutant selection was quantified using barcoded transposon sequencing (TnBarSeq) (Supplementary Data 6).

Gene hits were defined by an absolute log2[fold change] in mutant abundance of >0.25 and Padj < 0.05, relative to end-point vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or media controls. The abundance changes were not attributed to global differences in cell doublings (Extended Data Fig. 4a)50. Among the compounds tested at ≤20 μM, TBBPA, BPAF and closantel exhibited the strongest effects in library selection, whereas 500 μM PFNA showed the most hits overall. In contrast, 20 μM PFNA, 20 μM perfluorooctanoic acid and 50 μM glyphosate did not show significant hits, consistent with the lack of effect on growth at those concentrations (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

Closantel, an anthelmintic, caused the strongest selection, with >90% of Tn mutants carrying insertions across over 20 different positions of the coding and promoter regions of the gene NQ542_01170 (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Data 7). This gene encodes a transcriptional regulator homologous to the efflux repressor acrR from B. uniformis and is co-located with tolC and RND-efflux genes, with conserved synteny51. Notably, acrR Tn mutants were also the top hit under TBBPA, a flame retardant, with >100-fold enrichment compared with the DMSO control, but were not enriched under any other pollutants (Fig. 4b,e).

Curves for two independent insertion strains are shown, each with two replicates. Tn, transposon.

Source data

To further characterize acrR Tn mutant phenotypes, we isolated strains with transposon insertions at seven distinct positions within acrR coding and promoter regions after growth on closantel or TBBPA. All Tn::acrR isolates showed resistance to both chemicals, regardless of the compound they were isolated on (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 5c). When further evaluating two Tn::acrR strains, we observed an eightfold increase in the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for closantel compared with the wild-type strain. Consistent with previous reports linking loss of acrR function to ciprofloxacin resistance in diverse bacteria52, we observed an up to 16-fold increase in the ciprofloxacin MIC for P. merdae Tn::acrR mutants compared with the wild type (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Data 8). Therefore, resistance to closantel and TBBPA can lead to cross-resistance to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin.

The differential enrichment of acrR Tn mutants suggests a degree of specificity in the efflux of chemicals and/or that efflux alone is insufficient in tackling the other chemicals. However, some transporter Tn mutants showed broad pollutant sensitivity, indicating common pollutant tolerance mechanisms in P. merdae. For example, strains with insertions in genes of the fadL family of hydrophobic compound transporters (NQ542_07320 and NQ542_08455) were prevalent negative fitness hits across seven xenobiotics, whereas insertion mutants of the RND multidrug efflux locus NQ542_06240–50 were a significant hit across five chemicals (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Other common negative fitness hits were Tn mutants of the genes encoding components of the F0F1 ATP synthase complex (Fig. 4e), the loss of function of which has been associated with increased sensitivity to polymyxin antibiotics under anaerobic conditions53. This is consistent with bisphenol exposure leading to overexpression of F0F1 ATP synthase subunits in B. thetaiotaomicron23. The strains with Tn insertions in a gene encoding the putative lipid A phosphoethanolamine transferase of the eptA gene family (NQ542_04035) showed increased sensitivity in half of the tested xenobiotics. This enzyme class often mediates polymyxin resistance via modifications in membrane polarity54. Overall, genes implicated in efflux and membrane homeostasis modulated P. merdae survival following diverse xenobiotic challenges.

To assess whether the involvement of transporters in xenobiotic response is broadly conserved in the order Bacteroidales, we evaluated mutants of B. thetaiotaomicron, a member of a family distant to that of P. merdae55. We tested closantel, TBBPA, PFNA and BPAF on a curated subset of 185 transporter insertion mutants from the B. thetaiotaomicron arrayed transposon loss-of-function mutant library56. Growth was monitored over 24 h and we evaluated the response of each Tn insertion mutant by calculating the normalized relative AUC (nrAUC), comparing the xenobiotic treatment with the DMSO control (Extended Data Fig. 6a and Supplementary Data 9). The strongest growth reduction for closantel was observed at 2 and 10 μM for the Tn mutant of BT2687 encoding an RND-efflux pump (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 6b). This gene is part of an acrR-RND-tolC locus homologous to the P. merdae Tn::acrR closantel hit, suggesting a conserved efflux response (Extended Data Fig. 6c). Additional Tn mutants with conditional growth reduction on closantel included the co-localized genes BT0562 and BT0563, which encode multidrug ABC transporter genes. Loss-of-function Tn mutants of BT2687, BT0562 and BT0563 have previously been linked to increased susceptibility to antibiotics and biocides in B. thetaiotaomicron57. Exposure to 250 and 100 μM PFNA inhibited the Tn mutants with insertions at BT3337 and BT3338, which encode an RND-efflux pump needed for biofilm formation58, and tolerance to fusidic acid, chlorpromazine and thioridazine57 (Fig. 4f). The top homology and synteny matches for BT3337 and BT3338 in P. merdae are the RND-encoding loci NQ542_09525–35, which were a specific negative fitness hit for PFNA in the pooled screen (Extended Data Fig. 6d). As PFNA can be bioaccumulated by several Bacteroidales42, we assessed whether the phenotypes of Tn::BT3337 and Tn::BT3338 could be caused by increased compound uptake. Testing PFNA bioaccumulation across concentrations with LC–MS/MS showed no differences (Extended Data Fig. 6e,f and Supplementary Data 11), indicating other membrane-related mechanisms. Overall, the shared responses between P. merdae and B. thetaiotaomicron support conserved mechanisms of pollutant and antibiotic tolerance across Bacteroidales.

P. merdae TnBarSeq insertion mutant gene hits showed enrichment in various Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways for most (seven) of the compounds tested. TBBPA 20-μM selection showed a significant enrichment of Tn mutants mapping in the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation pathway (Extended Data Fig. 4d). The second top locus for positive selection under TBBPA was the porA catabolic gene cluster, containing four genes with Tn insertions with >30-fold enrichment (Extended Data Fig. 4e). This pathway is involved in the degradation of BCAAs into branched short-chain fatty acids59. Qiao et al.59 reported on a P. merdae porA mutant (with deletion of the NQ542_07740 gene, encoding pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) with loss of its beneficial probiotic property of preventing atherosclerosis in mice. PorA is present in several gut bacteria and conserved across Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including Clostridium sporogenes, where it contributes to immunomodulation60,61. The next top hit for positive selection under TBBPA was a gene encoding a putative BCAA aminotransferase (greater than tenfold enrichment; NQ542_03725). This gene encodes a close homologue of B. fragilis BF9343-3671 (74% identity; 100% coverage), whose knockout mutant stops producing immunomodulatory branched-chain α-galactosylceramide lipids, impacting colonic natural killer T cell regulation in monocolonized mice62. Besides TBBPA, NQ542_03725 mutants also show enrichment under 500 μM PFNA, 20 μM BPAF and 20 μM fluazinam, and the porA gene cluster is also selected under 500 μM PFNA and 20 μM BPAF (Fig. 4e). If these xenobiotics select for the loss of bacterial biosynthesis of BCAA-derived beneficial metabolites such as branched short-chain fatty acids and α-galactosylceramides in vivo, they could further impact human health via gut–heart or gut–immune axes.

Loss-of-function Tn insertion mutants of the secondary metabolism genes NQ542_07535–55 were positively selected under 500 μM PFNA challenge (~16-fold enrichment), but were negative fitness hits under 20 μM TBBPA (Fig. 4e). These genes were identified as being part of a putative inositol lipid biosynthetic gene cluster by homology to B. thetaiotaomicron genes (BT_1522–6) (Fig. 4g). This gene cluster is widespread in Bacteroidetes, and loss of inositol lipid production is associated with changes in the cell capsule and increased resistance to antimicrobial peptides63. To validate the phenotype, we isolated two P. merdae mutants (with transposon insertions at two locations of the gene NQ542_07540, which encodes putative phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatase) after enrichment in 500 μM PFNA. These strains showed increased resistance to PFNA and hypersensitivity to TBBPA at a range of concentrations, in agreement with pooled fitness (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). To evaluate whether the increased resistance to PFNA was due to differences in compound uptake, we tested PFNA bioaccumulation, but no growth-independent differences were seen (Extended Data Fig. 5f), indicating the accumulation-independent function of inositol lipid metabolism in PFNA resistance. In summary, our genetic screen suggests that loss-of-function mutations affecting accessory metabolic pathways might be selected for under xenobiotic exposure, potentially altering the metabolic output of the gut microbiota.

Our study uncovered 588 inhibitory interactions between 168 chemicals of concern and common human gut bacteria. Most of these chemicals had not been previously reported to have antibacterial properties. Fungicides and industrial chemicals showed the largest impact, with around 30% exhibiting anti-gut-bacterial activity. For example, although conazole fungicides inhibit ergosterol synthesis, a biochemical pathway unique to fungi, they inhibited some Firmicutes—prominent members of the human gut microbiota. The extent of interactions identified in our study, together with the immense genetic diversity of the gut microbiome64, suggest that the microbiome may harbour vastly more potential xenobiotic targets than was previously appreciated.

The prevalence of the inhibitory activities of chemical pollutants revealed by our screen, together with those of human-targeted drugs25,40, challenge the categorical labelling of chemicals into antibiotics, human-targeted drugs, industrial chemicals and pesticides. The antibacterial activity of many xenobiotics is currently not accounted for in assessments of their potential adverse impacts, and toxicity studies are typically set up in ways that are incompatible with capturing gut microbiota effects (Extended Data Fig. 7). To address this gap, toxicology assessment could incorporate tests in single gut bacteria, synthetic communities and gut-on-chip models65. Nevertheless, the vast numbers of chemicals in use and the fast pace at which new molecules are brought to market will make it difficult to implement meaningful experimental assessment for all compounds. Towards tackling this, our study demonstrates the feasibility of computational toxicity predictions that can be used at scale and for safe-by-design product development. This proof-of-concept was possible due to the here-expanded coverage of the chemical space, underscoring the need for standardized chemical–bacteria screens.

Our genetic screens using non-model, yet prevalent, gut bacteria provide mechanistic insights into how bacteria maintain fitness under chemical stressors and indicate potential molecular targets. We observe compound-dependent reliance on particular efflux pumps and their regulators for survival in the presence of pollutants. Regulation of efflux pumps stands out as a mechanism conserved between P. merdae and B. thetaiotaomicron, spanning different Bacteroidales families. This remarkable conservation, together with the previous observation from E. coli genetic screens showing the importance of efflux against human-targeted drugs25,40,66, reinforces the key role of efflux as a general chemical defence mechanism. This mechanistically supports the idea of a general resistant phenotype and that xenobiotics could lead to collateral resistance to antibiotics67. In our study, genetic selection against two persistent pollutants—the flame retardant TBBPA and the anthelmintic closantel—resulted in resistance to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin.

Genetic selection in P. merdae is enriched for catabolic and biosynthetic genes, suggesting that metabolism plays a fundamental role in response to xenobiotic stress. This enrichment is reminiscent of the prevalence of metabolism-related gene hits observed for non-antibiotic drug screens in E. coli 40. In our study, loss-of-function mutations in genes coding for enzymes involved in producing secondary metabolites with known impact on human health provided a growth advantage under several xenobiotics. This raises the possibility that exposure to chemical pollutants could impact the selection landscape in the gut, leading to metabolic alterations in microbiome–host interaction pathways.

Are our results relevant for real-world exposure scenarios in humans? Many of the compounds in our study (for example, melamine and mepiquat) have been found in micromolar concentrations in human blood13, implying similar or higher concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract. The concentrations for individuals living in polluted areas and with high occupational exposure (for example, from unprotected pesticide spraying, which is common in much of the developing world), are likely to be much higher. Yet, there are no cohort data available that track both chemical exposure and microbiome dynamics. To enable a large screen and comparison with previous datasets, we tested only a single concentration for most compounds.Although these results clearly highlight compound classes with antibacterial activity, such as fungicides, testing at a single concentration limits the assessment of hazard and risk levels for individual chemicals. Furthermore, the strains used in our study do not span the full diversity of gut bacterial strains and additional screening will be necessary to gain insights into species- and strain-level variation in chemical sensitivity and resistance. Our results therefore currently cannot be directly translated to exposure effects on the gut microbiota in vivo.

Going forward, we envisage that our pollutant–bacteria interaction data will encourage the collection of exposure data in microbiome studies, similar to how in vitro drug–bacteria screens accelerated the recording of drug usage in cohort studies25,31. Nevertheless, in vivo assessment of the impact of chemicals exposure is likely to be difficult due to complex interactions between the microbiota and diet, medications and other lifestyle factors. Genetic and physiological insights gained from our study will therefore help to bridge in vitro and in vivo datasets. The chemical–bacteria interaction map and identified genetic determinants of resistance could be used to guide the selection of compounds and molecular effects to monitor in future microbiome studies.

An arrayed library of pesticides, pesticide metabolites and pesticide-related compounds was obtained from the Chemical Biology Core Facility at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL; Heidelberg, Germany). Original compound stocks were ordered from the collection of PESTANAL standards by Merck/Sigma–Aldrich, with catalogue numbers and Chemical Abstracts Service identifiers listed in Supplementary Data 1. An additional plate containing industrial chemicals and mycotoxins was prepared in house. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mM. The combined library was arranged on 12 96-well plates, which included eight DMSO controls interspersed within the plate. One unique well position of each plate contained a dye (Trypan Blue), serving as a footprint to enable the detection and prevention of plate mix ups and rotation. A working stock concentrated at 2 mM in DMSO was prepared and aliquoted. Libraries were stored at −80 °C.

Extensive metadata were compiled from multiple sources. PubChem Compound Identifiers (CIDs) were primarily retrieved automatically with compound name searches using the PUG–REST interface, and missing CIDs were added manually. PubChem metadata were then retrieved based on CIDs. PubMed hit counts were retrieved in April 2022 using the National Center for Biotechnology Information E-Utilities application programming interface. Compound names were semi-automatically matched to the Pesticide Compendium of the British Crop Production Council to map hierarchical target classifications, and unmatched entries (for example, pesticide metabolites and non-pesticides) were manually curated. Food and Drug Administration and European Food Safety Authority 2018 pesticide monitoring reports were used to annotate detection in common foods and maximum residue level exceedances.

Details of bacterial strains, including their accession numbers in common culture collections and alternative species names, are listed in Supplementary Data 2. All bacteria were grown under anaerobic conditions in a polyvinyl chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) filled with 2% hydrogen and 12% carbon dioxide in nitrogen. The chamber was equipped with a palladium catalyst system for oxygen removal, a dehumidifier and a hydrogen sulfide removal column. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in modified Gifu anaerobic medium (mGAM; HyServe, Germany, produced by Nissui Pharmaceuticals), prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and sterilized by autoclaving. Bacterial strains were chosen based on their abundance and prevalence in the healthy human gut33.

Assay plates were prepared by first diluting the frozen pesticide library aliquots (2 mM in DMSO) in mGAM within a master deep-well plate from which 50 μl measures were aliquoted into clear, round-bottom, polystyrene untreated microplates (3795; Corning). Assay plates were then placed in the anaerobic chamber overnight to become anoxic. All liquid handling was performed using a Biomek i7 Automated Workstation (Beckman Coulter).

Each strain was measured in biological triplicates from independent cultures inoculated on separate days. Bacteria were grown for one or two days (depending on the growth rate) in 10 ml media, inoculated directly from frozen glycerol stocks. Cultures were then diluted 100-fold and incubated again for the same amount of time. Optical densities measured at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) were determined and a dilution with an OD600 of 0.1 was prepared. We then added 50 μl of this dilution to each well of the previously prepared assay plates, resulting in a starting OD600 of 0.05 and a compound concentration of 20 μM (1% DMSO). Assay plates were sealed with a gas-permeable membrane (Breathe-Easy; Z380059; Merck), which was additionally pierced with a syringe to prevent the build-up of gas, which otherwise occurs for some species. Plates were stacked without lids and the OD600 was recorded every hour for 24 h using a stacker (BioStack 4; Agilent BioTek) and plate reader (Epoch 2; Agilent BioTek).

Data analysis was performed in R version 4.2.2 and RStudio version 1.3.1093. First, for each growth curve, the minimum OD600 value was set to 0. Then, the raw AUC was calculated for each well using the bayestestR package and area_under_curve function. Further processing of growth curves was done by plate. For the pesticide library, AUC values were normalized by the median AUC of all control wells (DMSO control) on the respective plate. For the industrial chemicals and mycotoxin library, AUCs were normalized by the median row and column values (to correct for edge effects). Then, for both screens, a z score was calculated as follows: (raw AUC − control median)/control s.d. Each z score was converted to its respective P value and the P value was false discovery rate corrected for the number of compounds tested (n = 1,076). Significance analyses were performed separately for each replicate. A replicate was considered to be significant for growth inhibition if Padj < 0.05 and there was a >20% reduction in the normalized AUC. A compound was considered to significantly inhibit a specific strain if at least two out of three replicates were significant.

For the validation experiments and determination of the MIC, fresh vials were used, with the same catalogue numbers as in Supplementary Data 1. The results from the MIC screen were prepared and analysed in the same way as those from the high-throughput screen. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration for which the normalized AUC dropped below 0.1.

Com20 (ref. 38) was inoculated from a frozen ready-to-use stock (equal member ratio; 10% glycerol containing palladium black; 520810; Sigma–Aldrich) into 5 ml mGAM under anaerobic conditions for two 1:100 overnight passages. Com20 was dispensed into wells of 96-well plates containing 500 µl media with xenobiotic compounds, at a starting OD578 of 0.01, sealed with AeraSeal membranes (A9224; Sigma–Aldrich) and anaerobically incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. Pellets from 300 µl of culture were frozen for 16S ribosomal RNA analysis and the OD578 was measured as a biomass proxy.

DNA was extracted using a DNeasy UltraClean 96 Microbial Kit (10196-4; Qiagen) and quantified with a Qubit dsDNA BR/HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Library preparation and 16S sequencing were conducted at the Next Generation Sequencing Competence Center (Tübingen, Germany) using a two-step PCR protocol. The V4 region was amplified using 515F/806R primers with KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche) and indexed with unique dual-index barcodes (IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA UD Indexes (Tagmentation)). Libraries were pooled equimolarly, normalized to 10 pM and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system (v2 kit; 2 × 250 bp; 20% PhiX).

Reads were processed with the DADA2 package (version 1.21.053) in R (version 4.2.0), using the standard operating procedure (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/bigdata.html) with the parameters trimLeft: 23, 24; truncLen: 240, 200; maxEE: 2, 2; truncQ: 11, and only retaining merged reads of 250–256 base pairs. Genus-level taxonomy was first assigned against a curated DADA2-formatted database derived from the genome taxonomy database (release R06-RS20253)68 and amplicon sequence variants from expected Com20 genera were then further classified at the species level using full-length 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of all 20 members. Classification was performed with the R package DECIPHER (version 2.24.054) at ≥98% identity.

To assess the effects of chemical pollutants on gut microbiota and extrapolate in vitro bioactivity data to potential human health risks, we focused on 168 active chemicals. In vitro growth screening concentrations were used to compute estimated administered doses via the IVIVE tool from the Integrated Chemical Environment (https://ice.ntp.niehs.nih.gov/), leveraging the Environmental Protection Agency's httk R package69 and in-house NICEATM code70. IVIVE calculations determined gut concentrations corresponding to bioactivity levels (MICs from growth screening assays). Essential parameters included the toxicokinetic model type, chemical-specific parameters (log[P], molecular weight, pKa, intrinsic clearance, fraction unbound and tissue partition coefficient), dosing scenarios and exposure routes. OPERA71 provided parameters for 152 of the 168 chemicals; the reminder were empirically available. The physiologically based toxicokinetic model utilizes multiple compartments for various organs and tissue with perfusion-rate-limited kinetics, simulating elimination primarily via hepatic and renal routes, under a 30-day oral exposure scenario with 24-h intervals. Compartments include the gut, liver and remaining body, simulating dynamic tissue and plasma concentrations for both oral and intravenous exposures72.

The US Environmental Protection Agency's Toxicity Values Database served as the primary source for condensed in vivo point-of-departure (POD) data, encompassing human health references and animal toxicity values from various studies via the CompTox Chemicals Dashboard (https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/). Filters applied to the data available for 126 chemicals included: exposures in mg kg−1 bodyweight or mg kg−1 bodyweight per day (or convertible units); species-specific conversion factors for rats, mice, dogs and rabbits; the study types sub-chronic, subacute and subchronic; and the POD types lowest observed effect level, lowest adverse effect level, no observed effect level and no observed adverse effect level.

The SMILES strings for all compounds in PubChem were downloaded, from which 250,000 were selected at random. ECFPs were generated from SMILES strings for all library compounds, previously screened pharmaceutical drugs73,74 and PubChem compounds using ChemPlot75. The ECFPs were then embedded in a two-dimensional representation using UMAP76, with the number of neighbours and minimum distance set to 80 and 0.35, respectively. The Jaccard/Tanimoto index between compounds was calculated using the cdist function from SciPy77. The distributions for the maximum Tanimoto similarity index for each PubChem compound for the pharmaceutical drugs and combined pharmaceutical drugs and pollutants libraries were compared using a two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test.

Molecular descriptor features were generated with the rdck R package. Embedded features were obtained from a pre-trained version of MoLFormer46, which takes the SMILES strings as input and outputs a vector with 768 dimensions (https://huggingface.co/ibm-research/MoLFormer-XL-both-10pct). The deterministic flag was enabled to make sure that the model always gives the same output. Machine learning was implemented using scikit-learn version 1.2.2. The data were split into train and test sets in an 8:2 ratio with stratification to ensure equal hit frequencies in both sets. Twentyfold cross-validation was applied. RandomForestClassifier was used with the options n_estimators=500, max_features=‘sqrt' and max_depth=None to predict probabilities, which were then thresholded using the hit frequency of the training set47. The feature_importances_ attribute was used to access feature importance values.

The dense transposon mutant library of P. merdae ATCC 43184 (ref. 49) was used for TnBarSeq mapped to the annotated genome CP102286.1 (GenBank). Two vials of the pooled stock transposon library were used to inoculate mGAM with 30 μg ml−1 erythromycin and grown until the mid-exponential phase. This culture was used to inoculate 1 ml cultures at OD600 = 0.02 in a 2-ml deep-well plate, with duplicates for each xenobiotic and triplicates for the respective control media with 1% DMSO, 0.2% DMSO or plain media (xenobiotic concentrations are provided in Supplementary Data 6). The growth of the library was tracked by monitoring hourly a 100-μl aliquot of the library (as described in the section ‘Growth screening'), and growth curves were analysed using the Growthcurver package in R78. The transposon library cultures were grown to the early stationary phase (16 h for all samples except 2.5 μM closantel, which was grown to 48 h). Genomic DNA was extracted using a MagMAX Microbiome Ultra Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit. The transposon barcodes were amplified by PCR with Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X (New England Biolabs) using indexed primers (the sequences are provided in Supplementary Data 10), and sequenced with an Illumina NextSeq (single-end sequencing with a read length of 75 nucleotides). Barcodes were counted with 2FAST2Q79 and transposon insertion counts per sample were inputted as wiggle files to TRANSIT, where they were analysed against their respective control using reads in the central 80% of coding regions and normalized using the trimmed total read count, followed by resampling of 20,000 permutations80 and two-sided statistical testing with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (Supplementary Data 6). Gene hits were considered significant at Padj < 0.05 and |log2[fold change]| > 0.25. Post-hoc doublings bias correction was performed in R using the EEL_correction script50. KEGG terms were assigned with EggNOG Mapper81 and KEGG term enrichment was performed using a Fisher's exact test in R. Protein homology was mapped with clinker to B. thetaiotaomicron82; membrane protein families were annotated using TransAAP (hosted by TransportDB)83 and the Conserved Domains Database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information; and additional relevant homologues were identified using PaperBLAST84.

To enrich for positively selected mutants, the P. merdae transposon mutant library was cultured in 20 μM TBBPA, 500 μM PFNA or 2 μM closantel for two passages. Cultures were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.02 in 5 ml media in 15-ml tubes and incubated anaerobically for 24 h of growth, then passaged one in 50 into 5 ml fresh media and incubated for an additional 24 h. Following enrichment, cultures were streaked to isolation on anaerobic mGAM agar supplemented with 10 μg ml−1 erythromycin, and individual colonies were picked and glycerol stocked. Transposon barcodes of the isolated colonies were identified by Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Data 7) and validated using locus-specific diagnostic PCR (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b; the oligonucleotides are provided in Supplementary Data 10). Growth of the mutants under chemical perturbation was tracked as in the section ‘Growth screening‘ and analysed using the Growthcurver package in R78.

For MIC testing, mutant strains were passaged twice for 24 h in anaerobic mGAM before being used to inoculate, at an initial OD600 of 0.025, 100-μl cultures with twofold dilution series of ciprofloxacin, closantel or DMSO control. All plates contained empty-well controls and no compound control. Growth was tracked for 24 h, and the OD600 at 24 h was used to determine the MIC. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration for which the blanked-normalized OD600 was lower than a cut-off value of <0.1 (>90% inhibition). Three independent replicates were performed on different days, with two technical replicates per strain. The results are provided in Supplementary Data 8.

We assembled a subset of the B. thetaiotaomicron arrayed mutant library56, selecting 185 gene mutants annotated as putative transporters. The genes were selected based on annotations from TransAAP83 or if they included in their functional gene annotation the terms pump, efflux or transporter (Supplementary Data 9). Mutants were re-arrayed in three 96-well plates, each containing empty-well controls.

Inoculum library plates were grown anaerobically in mGAM from glycerol stocks or a first-passage plate for 24 h. Test plates of each condition were prepared at 2× concentration for 20 μM BPAF, 20 μM TBBPA, 2 and 10 μM closantel, 250 μM PFNA and their respective vehicle controls (0.4 or 1.0% DMSO) and left overnight inside the anaerobic chamber to equilibrate. Plates were inoculated by passaging library inoculum at 1:100 for each test condition in two technical replicates. Plates were sealed with gas-permeable membranes and growth was monitored over 24 h, as described in the section ‘High-throughput screening and MIC determination'.

Growth curves were fitted using the Growthcurver package in R78 and the AUC fit was calculated (Supplementary Data 9). One mutant strain that failed growth in the DMSO control was removed from further analysis. To identify mutants whose growth was differentially impacted by xenobiotic treatment, relative AUC values (rAUC) of each mutant were calculated as rAUC = (AUC)/(median AUC of mutants of the plate), assuming a neutral phenotype for most mutants. The average rAUC per technical replicate of mutant strains was calculated. To calculate the nrAUC for each xenobiotic condition, the average rAUC for the mutant gene under the xenobiotic was divided by the average rAUC for the corresponding DMSO control. A Welch's t-test was performed and P values were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg method. Gene mutant hits with conditional growth effects were defined as those with P < 0.05 and an nrAUC value corresponding to a 20% increase or decrease.

Bioaccumulation of BPAF was assessed by reverse-phase LC–MS/MS, as described previously42. Com20 cultures were grown anaerobically at 37 °C in mGAM with 1% DMSO and 20 μM BPAF, with controls lacking either BPAF or bacterial cells. After 24 h, at the stationary phase, 800-μl whole-culture samples were mixed and taken, then the cultures were centrifuged (10 min at 3,200g and room temperature) and 800 μl of the supernatant was collected (the supernatant sample). The rest of the supernatant was discarded, the pellet was resuspended in 8 ml water and 800 μl transferred to a fresh tube (cell sample). All samples were stored at −80 °C. For LC–MS/MS, samples were thawed and mixed, then 160 μl extracted with 240 μl organic solvent (1:1 MeOH:ACN + 0.1% formic acid with 20 μM amoxicillin, caffeine, ibuprofen and donepezil as internal standards), incubated for 30 min at −20 °C and cleared by centrifugation (5 min at 10,000g and 4 °C). The supernatants were then transferred to fresh vials. A standard curve was prepared by serially diluting BPAF in the appropriate matrix (untreated supernatant or cell sample extracts of Com20 cultures from the same experiment). Samples (0.5 μl) were analysed on an Agilent 1290 Infinity II chromatography system coupled to an Agilent 6470 Triple Quadrupole (QQQ) system with a Jet Stream ion source operated in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mode with a cycle time of 500 ms. The analytical column (Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18; 2.1 × 100 mm; 1.9 μm) was operated at 40 °C and a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml min−1. Initial conditions were 65% buffer A (water + 0.1% formic acid + 10 mM ammonium formate) and 35% buffer B (9:1 acetonitrile:water + 0.1% formic acid + 10 mM ammonium formate). The gradient was as follows: 0 min: 35% B; 0.5 min: 35% B; 4.5 min: 100% B; 5.5 min: stop; post-time: 1.5 min. The source parameters were as follows: gas temperature: 300 °C; gas flow: 10 l min−1; nebulizer: 50 psi; sheath gas temperature: 300 °C; sheath gas flow: 11 l min−1; capillary: 3,500 V (positive) and 3,000 V (negative); nozzle voltage: 2,000 V (positive) and 500 V (negative). BPAF was monitored in negative mode, using a precursor m/z of 335 and fragment m/z of 265 and 69 (500-ms cycle time). The data were analysed using MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis for QQQ version 10.1.

Bioaccumulation of PFNA was performed as previously described42. Strains were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.025 in 1-ml cultures with varying PFNA concentrations, plus DMSO and empty-well controls. A 100-μl sample was taken to track growth dynamics in parallel. After 20 h of anaerobic incubation, 80-μl whole-culture and supernatant aliquots were collected and stored at −80 °C. Samples were extracted with solvent mix (1:1 MeOH:ACN + 0.1% formic acid with 20 µM caffeine, ibuprofen and donepezil as the internal standard), followed by 2 h incubation at 4 °C and 30 min incubation at −20 °C, then centrifuged as above. Samples were injected at a 0.3-μl volume in the LC–MS/MS instrument described above. The analytical column (Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18; 2.1 × 50 mm; 1.9 μm) was operated at 40 °C with a constant flow rate of 0.8 ml min−1. The initial buffer composition was 70% A (water + 0.1% formic acid) and 30% B (acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid). The gradient was as follows: 0 min: 30% B; 0.05 min: 30% B; 0.5 min: 100% B; 1 min: 100% B; 1.05 min: 30% B; stop time: 1.5 min. The source parameters were identical to those described above. PFNA was monitored in negative mode, using a precursor m/z of 463 and fragment m/z of 417.9 and 219 (200 ms cycle time). The data were analysed using MassHunter Workstation Quantitative Analysis for QQQ version 10.1 and a custom R script, and the results are provided in Supplementary Data 11.

No randomization was used in the microbiological experiments, and data collection and analysis were not performed blind to the conditions of the experiments, as no group allocation was needed. No statistical methods were used to determine samples sizes; instead, they were chosen based on previous experience and according to those in the literature25,56,57. The data distribution was assumed to be normal, but this was not formally tested. Further statistics and reproducibility information are described in each section.

A) Network illustrating the number of library compounds targeted at different organisms and their chemical subclasses, based on the BCPC Pesticide Compendium. Out of 1076 compounds in total, 829 were pesticides, 119 were pesticide metabolites, 48 were industrial chemicals, 5 were mycotoxins and 76 were other, pesticide-related compounds such as synthetic precursors or compounds that might be found in commercial formulations. B) Venn diagram illustrating overlaps of significant interactions between n=3 biological replicates of the main screen. A compound was considered an overall hit if two out of three biological replicates were statistically significant (padj <0.05) and the area under the curve (AUC) was at least 20% lower than for the DMSO control. C) Overlap of hits between main and independent validation screen. D) Normalised AUC values in main screen and validation experiment. The Pearson correlation coefficient, two-sided, and associated p-value is shown in the graph. The shaded areas indicate the 95% confidence interval.

Source data

A) Chemical susceptibility profiles grouped by phylum. compounds (x-axis) and phyla (y-axis) were clustered by profile similarity, using Euclidean distance and Ward clustering. The number of strains in each phylum is indicated in parentheses. B) Heatmap showing growth inhibition by compounds (20 μM) which were identified to have broad-spectrum activity, inhibiting more than a third of the tested species. Results shown are a subset of those shown in Fig. 1c. Several of these compounds are widely used and/or persistent organic pollutants, raising concerns about their potential anti-gut-bacteria effects. Abbreviation: *C12-C14-Alkyl(ethylbenzyl)dimethylammonium chloride.

Source data

A) Coverage of chemical space is increased by our new, complementary xenobiotic compound library. The plot illustrates the fraction of compounds in the random PubChem subset (y-axis, n=250,000) which have a similar compound (at the Tanimoto similarity threshold indicated on the x-axis), for the compound library of this study (green line), pharmaceutical drugs screened by Maier et al. 2018 (purple line) and the combined dataset. The inset focuses on a Tanimoto threshold of 0.75, where significantly increased coverage of the chemical space is observed (p< 2.2e-16, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). B) Heatmap including all features which belonged to the top10 features in at least one species (ranked by mean across 20 cross-validation sets). Feature importance was accessed using the feature_importances_ attribute of the RandomForestClassifier, which relies on decrease in mean impurity to quantify feature importance. Feature based on molecular distance edge descriptors of carbon atoms (MDEC) (S. Liu et al., 1998) stood out as particularly useful for predicting anti-gut-bacterial activity across different species. C) Correlation analysis of the features with each other. D) Comparison of feature importances between pesticides and pharmaceutical drugs indicates that similar features are important for both compound classes. Spearman r=0.65, p=0.

Source data

A) Post hoc correction for possible growth generation bias in log2FC (EEL method, Kim et al. 2024) show main TnBarSeq hits cannot be explained by differences library growth. Values per gene and condition are found in Supplementary Data 6. B) Area under the curve (AUC) for P. merdae Tn mutant library under the compounds tested normalised to control, plotted against total TnBarseq hits. The colour scale represents the number of bacterial species in the general growth screen which were an inhibition hit at 20 μM. Point shape indicates whether the compound was a growth hit for wild type P. merdae in the previous growth screen. C) Putative membrane transporters and other membrane proteins showing negative fitness in response to more than one xenobiotic. Protein families are indicated in colours. ABC= Adenosine Triphosphate-Binding Cassette. CPA2= Monovalent cation:proton antiporter 2. RND= Resistance Nodulation Division. MOP= Multidrug/oligosachharidyl-lipid/polysaccharide. omp= ompA-H family. D) Enriched KEGG Pathway categories among all TnBarSeq hits for compounds tested. Number of gene hits are indicated by circle size, P-value is derived from Fisher's test. E) Representative TnBarSeq insertion plot for the porA branched short-chained fatty acid gene cluster (orange) in TBBPA 20 μM and DMSO control.

Source data

A) Diagnostic PCR genotyping of acrR locus transposon mutants (Tn::NQ542_01170). Transposon insertions are validated as a larger amplicon size compared to the wild type strain (WT). Mutant insertion location information in Supplementary Data 7. B) Genotyping of transposon mutants located at a putative phosphatidylinositol phosphate phosphatase (Tn::NQ542_07540) using primers targeting the junction between transposon and insertion locus confirms transposon location and orientation predicted by barcode sequencing. C) Growth curves of isolate transposon mutants under xenobiotics. Curves represent strains with independent insertions on acrR coding region and promoter regions (purple n=7), Tn::NQ542_07540 from inositol lipid gene cluster (light blue, n=2) and WT strains for comparison (black, n=6). D) Growth curves at 12.5 μM TBBPA and DMSO control show Tn::NQ542_07540 hypersensitivity to TBBPA. Curves represent two well replicates of two independent insertion strains, and P. merdae WT control. E) Fitness of isolated P. merdae mutants (strain 9 and 10 corresponding to independent insertions at NQ542_07540) and WT control across a range of concentrations of PFNA (0–100 μM). NrAUC is normalised to the median AUC of the WT value per concentration, and the median of DMSO control (0 μM) per genotype. Replicates are shown as points and P-adjusted values were obtained comparing mutants to WT at each concentration with Welch's T-test corrected by multiplicity with BH. F) PFNA bioaccumulation in isolated P. merdae strains of different genotypes grown on a range of PFNA concentrations, as analysed by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS), see Methods. End OD before compound extraction is indicated in coloured scale. Replicate values are shown as points. Adjusted P-values were calculated compared to WT using two-sided Welch's T-test corrected by multiplicity with BH.

Source data

A) Scatterplot of relative area under the curve for B. thetaiotaomicron arrayed transporter mutants (rAUC= AUC/(median AUC of the plate)) across two technical replicate plates per condition. B) Scatterplot of B. thetaiotaomicron arrayed transporter library in 10 µM and 2 µM closantel. Significant genes P-adj<0.05 by two-sided Welch's T-test corrected by multiplicity with BH. Gene name of main hits in agreement are indicated. Axis show normalised rAUC (per mutant average rAUC xenobiotic / average rAUC DMSO). C) Conservation of the acrABR-tolC locus between B. thetaiotaomicron and P. merdae. Genes in red represent top candidates for positive selection under closantel in P. merdae (repressor of efflux acrR), while blue shows the top hit for sensitivity in the arrayed transporter panel of B. thetaiotaomicron (RND transporter BT687). Protein homology is shown as gray lines connecting orthologs using Clinker. D) Homology and synteny between top RND-efflux genes negative fitness hits in P. merdae and B. thetaiotaomicron. E) Growth of B. thetaiotaomicron PFNA hypersensitive mutants (Tn::BT3337 and Tn::BT3338) and wild type (WT) across a range of concentrations of PFNA (0–100 µM). nrAUC = area under the growth curve (AUC) normalised to the median AUC of the WT value per concentration, and the median of DMSO control (0 µM) per genotype. Replicate values are shown as shapes per strains and P-adjusted values were obtained comparing mutants to WT at each concentration with two-sided Welch's T-test corrected by multiplicity with BH. F) PFNA bioaccumulation profiles of strains Tn::BT3337 and Tn::BT3338 and WT control on a range of PFNA concentrations. Adjusted bioaccumulation was calculated by normalising to the biomass of the WT per concentration. Non-significant differences were observed when comparing mutants to WT using two-sided Welch's T-test corrected by multiplicity with BH.

Source data

A) Analysis of minimum equivalent administered oral doses in humans EAD (green triangle), Point of departure - lowest adverse effect level (POD-LOAEL, orange circle) and Point of departure - no adverse effect level (POD-NOAEL, orange circle), for 149 chemicals. Boxes highlight chemicals with negative and positive POD ratios, enlarged in panel B and C respectively. To contrast the observed sensitivity of gut bacteria to chemicals against animal toxicity estimates, we applied physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) modelling to 168 chemicals. Using a 30-day exposure scenario with 24 hour dose intervals, we used in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) to estimate equivalent administered oral doses in humans (EADs) that result in concentrations of xenobiotics in the gut at which we observed bacterial growth inhibition in vitro (Supplementary Data 12). We compared these EADs to the doses at which toxicity was observed in a curated database of animal experiments (ToxValDB). This comparison is captured as the PODratio, which is the ratio of lowest dose at which an adverse effect was observed in mice (Point of departure - lowest adverse effect level: POD-LOAEL) to the previously determined EAD. We detected a positive log10(PODratio) for the vast majority of compounds in our analysis (56 out of 68 compounds for which animal data was available). A positive log10(PODratio) indicates that our in vitro screen picked up effects at lower equivalent doses than required to elicit toxicity in animals. While this is not unexpected, as animal toxicology does not usually consider the microbiome, this indicates that in vitro screening can be a sensitive method to assess potential adverse effects on microbiota not typically picked up in animal toxicity studies. More consideration and innovative study designs are required to better capture the microbiota-damaging toxic effects of xenobiotics in animal studies.

The efficacy of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is limited by challenges of delivery and potency. We enhance AMP performance in the lung by converting AMPs to a peptibody format that fuses AMPs with fragment crystallizable domains to activate innate immunity and cathelin domains for infection-responsive activation, with their mRNA constructs delivered by anti-inflammatory lipid nanoparticles. The highest-scoring design outperforms antibiotic therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in multidrug-resistant pneumonia models, eradicating representative MDR bacteria while mitigating inflammation.

The photon spin information encoded in circularly polarized (CP) light is of high interest for current and future technologies, including low-power displays, encrypted communications and high-performance quantum applications. Engineering organic light-emitting diodes (LED) to emit oppositely handed electroluminescent CP light typically requires access to left- and right-handed chiral molecules. In conjugated polymer LEDs, the handedness of CP electroluminescence also depends on the active-layer thickness or direction of current flow. For a given active-layer thickness, it remains unknown whether a single-handed chiral material can emit CP light with opposite handedness in the same LED architecture. Here we demonstrate organic LEDs in which the handedness of the emitted CP electroluminescence can be controlled electrically, solely by using specific interlayers with no change in the emissive material composition or thickness. We reveal that this occurs due to a change in mechanism for the generation of CP electroluminescence, as a function of the recombination zone position within the device. This result provides a paradigm shift in the realization of organic CP-LEDs with controllable spin angular momentum information and further contributes to ongoing discussions relating the fundamental physics of chiral optoelectronics.

Chirality is the property of an object with broken inversion and mirror symmetry, resulting in a pair of non-superimposable mirror image forms. In chemistry, each non-superimposable mirror image of a chiral molecule is called an enantiomer1. Chiral materials can absorb, emit and refract circularly polarized light (CPL), which is light with a defined spin angular momentum (SAM). SAM is the intrinsic angular momentum associated to a polarized photon, with a quantized value of ±ℏ per photon, corresponding to left- or right-handed circular polarization. Chiral organic semiconductors have recently attracted much interest as the emissive layer in circularly polarized light-emitting diodes (CP-LEDs)2,3. Partly due to the encoded SAM, CP-LEDs will enable multiple technological advances, from the generation of more energy-efficient display technologies to highly precise sensors to devices for quantum information processing and holography4,5.

When dealing with thin films of organic emissive chiral materials, the emitted CPL typically occurs through either the intrinsic chiroptical behaviour of the material1,6,7—the so-called natural optical activity8—or from the selective reflection or birefringence of CPL9 due to the structural chirality of the film10,11,12. Regardless of which of these mechanisms is operative, the handedness of the emitted CPL from organic chiral materials correlates to the handedness of the enantiomer of the emissive layer: one enantiomeric emitter gives a CPL of one preferred handedness, whereas the other enantiomer gives equal-magnitude CPL of the opposite handedness13. When referring to the emission from a CP-LED, we term this as normal circularly polarized electroluminescence (NCPE).

One of the most successful approaches to realize high circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP-EL) in CP organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has been the use of polymeric thin-film blend materials, where an achiral conjugated polymer is blended with a chiral small-molecule additive14,15. We have found the helical small-molecule (P)-aza[6]helicene (aza[6]H; Fig. 1a) to be a particularly useful additive to produce films with very high chiroptical activity16. While optimizing aza[6]H:polymer blends to improve CP-OLED device efficiencies16,17, we discovered a distinct CP-EL mechanism, where the handedness of the CPL emitted inverts as a function of the device architecture (conventional versus inverted) or the emission direction (front or back of the device). This anomalous CP-EL (ACPE)18 was found to correlate to the directionality of current flow in the device, and was assigned to induced orbital angular momentum (OAM) in the charge carriers, with subsequent transfer to the SAM of the emitted photons. Importantly, ACPE apparently overrode the NCPE of the chiral emissive material. Further details on these mechanisms are provided in Supplementary Note 1.

The interplay between NCPE and ACPE in chiral polymer LEDs remains unclear. From a practical standpoint, exploiting NCPE requires the use of both enantiomers in separate devices to access opposite-handed CPL. Conversely, ACPE requires the use of two different device architectures. It would be a notable advance to be able to access both handedness of CPL from the same enantiomer material in the same device architecture. Here we realize such a goal, demonstrating how CPL handedness can be electrically controlled in a chiral polymer-based CP-OLED. Switching between NCPE and ACPE is achieved by controlling the charge injection and charge balance through the use of interlayers, and is enabled by a newly developed chiral additive, a monofluorinated [6]helicene ((P)-monoF[6]helicene (monoF[6]H); Fig. 1a). NCPE occurs with balanced charge transport in the emissive layer when the recombination zone (RZ) is located in the centre of the device and is independent of the device architecture (that is, conventional or inverted). ACPE occurs with unbalanced charge transport in the emissive layer when the RZ is located close to one of the transport layers (Fig. 1c). To the best of our knowledge, such electrical control of CP-EL has only previously been observed in inorganic materials19 and in different device configurations (namely, light-emitting transistors). As such, we believe the learnings in this work will enable wholly new directions and progress of CP-OLED device technologies with controllable SAM and contributing to the ongoing studies of chirality-dependent optoelectronic physics20.

Although aza[6]H has proved to be a useful additive to generate blend polymer films with large chiroptical activity, the optoelectronic performance of poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-benzothiadiazole) (F8BT):aza[6]H materials are hindered by the shallower highest occupied molecular orbital of aza[6]H (5.4 eV) compared with the highest occupied molecular orbital of F8BT (5.8 eV; Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 1). This results in aza[6]H acting as a hole trap in the blend, which decreases the device performance and limits the type of device configurations that can be used for working OLEDs. To address this issue, we developed fluorine-substituted monoF[6]H, a chiral additive with a deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (5.8 eV) than its aza[6]H counterpart (Supplementary Figs. 1–8), to reduce hole trapping in polymer blends (Fig. 1a). When blended with F8BT at the same concentration (10 wt%) and processing conditions (160 nm thickness), both aza[6]H and monoF[6]H induce a chiral phase in the polymeric film. Annealed blends of (P)-aza[6]H give a dissymmetry factor of lower energy (λ = 491 nm) transition of gabs = 0.65 (CD of 18,200 mdeg), whereas blends of (P)-monoF[6]H have a slightly lower but still substantial dissymmetry factor of gabs = 0.42 (CD of 12,000 mdeg; Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 11). The CD of these films contains negligible contributions from linear dichroism and linear birefringence, with no CD sign inversion on rotation or flipping of the samples (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). This was further confirmed by Mueller matrix polarimetry (MMP) data showing that the CD elements m30 and m03 are symmetric whereas circular birefringence elements m21 and m12 are antisymmetric (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16), which is consistent with prior studies on aza[6]H (ref. 8). This excludes any structural contributions to CPL, with the high chiroptical activity being attributed to the strong excitonic coupling between polymer-chain chromophores21. When optically excited, no change in the emitted CPL handedness is observed for a given enantiomer, regardless of the excitation geometry (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19).

Conventional and inverted devices were fabricated with the same emissive layer thickness (160 nm). Conventional CP-OLEDs (Fig. 1c) of F8BT:(P)-aza[6]H blends with poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-alt-N-(4-sec-butylphenyl)-diphenylamine) (TFB) as an additional hole transport layer (HTL) had lower efficiencies and higher turn-on voltages compared with F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H-based devices (Supplementary Figs. 20 and 21). Furthermore, although the HTL is required to realize working CP-OLEDs for F8BT:(P)-aza[6]H blends, devices using F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H can be fabricated HTL-free and maintain lower turn-on voltages compared with CP-OLEDs with aza[6]H (Supplementary Table 2). Inverted CP-OLEDs for all conditions (Fig. 1d) show higher device efficiencies compared with the conventional architecture (Supplementary Figs. 22 and 23). Consistent with conventional devices, inverted devices using F8BT:(P)-aza[6]H require (tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine) (TCTA) as an HTL, whereas F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H-based CP-OLEDs can operate without an HTL. Inverted monoF[6]H-based CP-OLEDs demonstrate high efficiencies and, for HTL-free devices, very low efficiency roll-off (Supplementary Fig. 23 and Supplementary Table 2). The superior performance of CP-OLEDs incorporating F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H confirms that the new chiral additive reduces the trapping caused by aza[6]H.

The lower density of trap states in F8BT:monoF[6]H blends is also supported by hole transport measurements via the space-charge-limited current method (Supplementary Figs. 24 and 25 and Supplementary Table 3). Almost three orders of magnitude difference in the hole mobility was observed in comparing blends of monoF[6]H and aza[6]H, with higher hole trap densities in aza[6]H blends. Mobility measurements of bilayers including an HTL reveal that for aza[6]H blends, the HTL improves hole mobility, whereas for monoF[6]H, it limits the injection of holes, pinning the RZ close to the anode in both cases. No differences in electron transport properties of the two additives were observed, even when measured in bilayers with an electron transport layer (Supplementary Fig. 25b and Supplementary Table 3). These measurements, performed using the same device stack as the respective CP-OLEDs, reveal that (1) in devices (conventional and inverted) with an HTL, the RZ is pinned near the HTL interface and (2) in HTL-free devices, the RZ is located closer to the centre of the stack due to balanced charge carrier injection and transport. This is consistent with the measured efficiency roll-off: efficiency roll-off is minimized in HTL-free devices due to the more balanced charge recombination and reduced quenching (Supplementary Fig. 27). Stability measurements further support this analysis, with conventional and inverted HTL-free devices showing improved stability compared with counterparts with an HTL (Supplementary Fig. 28). Capacitance–voltage (CV) and capacitance–frequency (CF) measurements indicate that devices with HTLs suffer from charge accumulation and capacitance build-up due to the unbalanced charge carrier mobility and the pinned RZ close to the HTL. Specifically, HTL-free devices feature a sharp drop in capacitance after turning on in CV measurements, whereas devices with an HTL feature a capacitance build-up (Supplementary Fig. 29). CF measurements, carried out after device turn on, also feature a higher capacitance at low frequencies in HTL-free devices (Supplementary Fig. 30). Both these characterizations demonstrate charge accumulation and capacitance build-up due to unbalanced charge carrier mobility and support the location of the RZ near the interface with the HTL.

Enabled by the discovery of a chiral polymeric material with improved hole mobility, it was found that the handedness of CP-EL could be controlled through the use of conventional and inverted F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H CP-OLEDs, with or without HTLs (Fig. 2). Without an HTL (Fig. 2a,b), the RZ of OLEDs using F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H is in the middle of the active layer. The measured CP-EL retains the same handedness irrespective of the device architecture (preferentially left handed for the P enantiomer of monoF[6]H, gEL CONV = +0.10 and gEL INV = +0.13). This is the same handedness as optically pumped CP photoluminescence (gPL = +0.24). Together with the fact that the handedness of CPL cannot be inverted by changing the current flow direction, this suggests NCPE for F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H CP-OLEDs without an HTL (Supplementary Figs. 33 and 35). Consistent with this assignment, measurements on semitransparent devices show the same magnitude and handedness of CP-EL regardless of the measurement direction: gEL,ITO = +0.12 and gEL,Al = +0.10 in the case of conventional semitransparent devices (Supplementary Fig. 33) and gEL,ITO = +0.12 and gEL,Au = +0.10 for inverted semitransparent devices (Supplementary Fig. 35). This is also consistent with the handedness of CPL emitted from thin films on optical excitation at different geometries. NCPE restricts the total gEL of the device: the back electrode changes the phase of polarization, reversing its handedness and partially cancelling CPL emitted towards the transparent electrode (gEL < gPL). The small differences in gEL between conventional and inverted devices can be attributed to optical losses due to the attenuation of CPL propagating inside the device (Supplementary Note 3). For the same reason, the sum of gEL obtained from semitransparent devices does not match the gEL measured in devices with highly reflective electrodes.

In conventional devices with an HTL, the handedness of CP-EL inverts compared with devices without the HTL (Fig. 2c) and right-handed emission is preferred for the P enantiomer of monoF[6]H (gEL CONV = –0.40). By contrast, left-handed emission is still preferred for the P enantiomer of monoF[6]H when used in inverted devices with an HTL (gEL INV = +0.38; Fig. 2d). As such, the handedness of CPL is clearly inverted by changing the current flow direction for F8BT:(P)-monoF[6]H CP-OLEDs with an HTL, suggesting ACPE. Measurements using semitransparent devices showed that conventional devices with a TFB HTL gave opposite-handed CP-EL as a function of emission direction (gEL,ITO = −0.22 and gEL,Al = +0.23; Supplementary Fig. 34). Inverting the device structure when using TCTA as an HTL also results in opposite-handed CP-EL, but with the absolute handedness inverted relative to conventional devices with an HTL (gEL,ITO = 0.33 and gEL,Au = −0.27; Supplementary Fig. 36). The emission of CPL is non-reciprocal: CPL emitted towards the top electrode inverts handedness, partially combining with CPL emitted towards the ITO and increasing the measured gEL. This overcomes the theoretical limit of devices with only NCPE (gEL > gPL). Supplementary Fig. 37 evaluates the impact of HTL thickness in inverted devices, where the HTL is evaporated rather than solution processed. It is clear that the HTL thickness does not impact |gEL|, but it does impact the EL lineshape due to cavity effects22.

In summary, the electrical control of CP-EL handedness is observed simply through the addition or omission of an HTL within the device stack. Devices without an HTL show NCPE, whereas devices with an HTL show APCE. In all the devices (that is, with ACPE and NCPE), gEL is independent of current density, which is consistent with previous results in chiral polymer blends (Supplementary Fig. 38). Although the absolute gEL values achieved in this work are not the highest reported so far, they remain among the highest in the field. This impressive performance is accompanied by the first demonstration of electrical control over the emission mechanism (Supplementary Table 5), achieved through careful material and device design.

We suggest that the measured CP-EL from CP-OLEDs using our chiral blend materials can be described with contributions from both ACPE and NCPE18:

According to our previous theory and quantitative analysis of ACPE18, directional charge transport through chiral emissive layers induces OAM in CP-OLEDs23,24. We ignore the SAM of charge carriers because of negligible spin–orbital coupling in these organic polymers. There is a finite OAM transfer (\({\Delta l=l}_{{\rm{e}}}-{l}_{{\rm{h}}}\)) from charge carriers to photons during the electron–hole recombination process (Supplementary Note 2) and a given photon with finite Δl exhibits opposite handedness if it is emitted in opposite directions. Reversing the current directionality changes the sign of le (lh) due to the orbital-momentum locking in chiral materials18,23, and therefore, conventional and inverted devices emit CP-EL with opposite handedness. Through this mechanism, ACPE rationalizes the device-architecture-dependent CP-EL handedness in our devices that contain an HTL. When an HTL is used in conventional (HTL = TFB) or inverted (HTL = TCTA) devices, charge transport in the emissive layer is unbalanced towards electrons, pinning the RZ of the device to the HTL interface near the anode. Electrons injected from the cathode travel towards the HTL through the chiral active layer, recombining with holes at the interface. As such, in the presence of an HTL, electrons travel through the chiral active layer and gain OAM le, whereas holes travel through the achiral HTL and develop zero OAM (lh = 0). The finite OAM (\({\Delta l=l}_{{\rm{e}}}\)) developed through the electron flow leads to ACPE, which overrides any NCPE in the system.

In devices without an HTL, charge injection and the transport of electrons and holes are balanced, and the RZ is in the centre of the active layer (Fig. 3a). Inversion of CP-EL handedness is not observed when switching the current direction or as a function of emission direction. The handedness of emitted light is the same as optically pumped CPL emission. In this balanced scenario, electrons and holes carry similar finite OAM (\({l}_{{\rm{e}}}\approx {l}_{{\rm{h}}}\)); therefore, \(\Delta l\approx 0\), which suppresses ACPE. As such, only NCPE is observed. Thus, through adjusting the position of the RZ within a CP-OLED device using these materials, it is possible to tune the contribution of ACPE versus NCPE and, in turn, control the handedness of CP-EL for a fixed enantiomer of the emissive material.

a, NCPE occurs when there is balanced charge transport in the device through the omission of an HTL. b,c, ACPE occurs when charge transport is unbalanced towards electron transport through the addition of an HTL. For conventional devices, the RZ is close to the front electrode (b), whereas for inverted devices, the RZ is close to the back electrode (c). The positioning of the RZ controls the handedness of the ACPE through oppositely induced OAM.

The control of ACPE and NCPE in OLEDs requires a careful design of materials and devices. Materials capable of ACPE demonstrate a helical electron distribution such that the movement of charge carriers induces an OAM that is transferred to SAM in the emitted light. In the achiral luminescent polymer–chiral additive blend system considered here, twisted polymer backbones generate the appropriate topological electronic landscape. The additive should be designed such that it can induce a chiral phase and maintain the charge carrier properties of the achiral luminescent polymer. ACPE requires unbalanced, ambipolar charge transport in the emissive layer, which confines the RZ to a narrow region and pins the RZ position close to one of the electrodes. The RZ position is best controlled when the energy levels of the transport layer match those of the emissive layer, and requires selecting transport layers with a tuneable charge mobility.

We have demonstrated that CP-EL handedness from a chiral polymer LED can be controlled electrically by tuning the charge carrier mobility and the RZ position, without changing the handedness or composition of the active layer. CPL emission in CP-OLEDs does not simply originate from the same mechanism of optically excited transitions (NCPE). The origin of this effect appears to be adjusting the interplay of NCPE versus ACPE through adjusting the balance of induced OAM in electrons versus holes. On a practical level, this strategy provides a simple means to access CP-OLEDs with high levels of CP-EL, where left- or right-handed CP-EL is available from a single emissive enantiomer.

Notable advances in the asymmetric synthesis of helicenes25 means that it is increasingly simple to synthesize a single-enantiomer chiral additive. If a single-enantiomer additive can be used to generate CP-OLEDs of either CP-EL handedness, this new CP-OLED strategy avoids the need for laborious and poorly scalable separation of racemic chiral additives into their separate enantiomers for CP-OLED usage. Thus, this approach provides a paradigm shift in the realization of organic CP-LEDs with controllable SAM information, which should enable many of the promised applications, from display technologies to quantum information systems. On a fundamental level, this study provides further evidence of the rich physics at play in chiral optoelectronic systems and suggests a means to control induced OAM in charge carriers within chiral semiconducting materials. Combining ACPE with other strategies, such as multilayer OLEDs or chiral microcavities26, could also enable new ways to boost the dissymmetric response of CP-LEDs. There continues to be high interest in the interplay of chirality, charge and spin, including through the expanding studies concerning chiral-induced spin selectivity20, and this study provides further materials and device frameworks for the characterization of these phenomena.

Aza[6]H was synthesized according to a previous report14, and monoF[6]H according to the synthesis procedure in the Supplementary Information and separated using preparative chiral high-performance liquid chromatography. F8BT and TFB were provided by Cambridge Display Technology. 2,2′,2″-(1,3,5-Benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazole) (TPBi) and TCTA were provided by Ossila.

All the substrates were cleaned via subsequent sonication for 10 min in deionized water, acetone and isopropanol, followed by 7 min of oxygen-plasma treatment. F8BT and (P)-aza[6]helicene (aza[6]H) or (P)-4-fluoro[6]helicene (monoF[6]H) were dissolved in toluene at 30 mg ml−1 and blended to form a solution with 10% of chiral dopant. F8BT–chiral additive active layer blends were spin coated at different spin speeds (1,500–3,000 rpm) for 1 min to control the active-layer film thickness and annealed for 10 min in a nitrogen atmosphere (<0.1-ppm H2O and <0.1-ppm O2) at 140 °C. The film thickness was measured using a Dektak profilometer.

Hole-only devices for charge carrier mobilities were built on prepatterned ITO glass (120 nm, 10 Ω). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) was spin coated to achieve a 50-nm-thick film. If used, TFB was spin coated at 1,000 rpm for 1 min and annealed for crosslinking. The F8BT–chiral inducer active layer blend was then spin coated following the same procedure for thin films. If included, TCTA was evaporated with a thickness of 25 nm. Finally, 10 nm of MoOx and 80 nm of Au were thermally evaporated, defining a device area of 0.045 cm2.

Electron-only devices for charge carrier mobilities were built on Al-prepatterned glass. The F8BT–chiral inducer active layer blend was then spin coated at 2,000 rpm following the same procedure for thin films. Further, if included in the device, 10 nm of TPBi was thermally evaporated. Finally, 10 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al were thermally evaporated, defining a device area of 0.045 cm2.

Conventional OLEDs were fabricated on prepatterned ITO glass (120 nm, 10 Ω). PEDOT:PSS was spin coated to achieve a 50-nm-thick film. If included in the device structure, TFB was spin coated at 1,000 rpm for 1 min and annealed at 180 °C for crosslinking. The active layer was then spin coated at 2,000 rpm following the same procedure for thin films. Finally, the device was completed with the thermal evaporation of 25 nm of TPBi, 10 nm of Ca and 100 nm of Al, defining an active device area of 0.045 cm2.

Inverted OLEDs were fabricated on prepatterned ITO glass (120 nm, 10 Ω). ZnO and ethoxylated polyethylenimine (PEIE) were spin coated following the already reported procedure. The active layer was then spin coated at 2,000 rpm following the same procedure for thin films. Finally, the device was completed with the thermal evaporation of TCTA, 10 nm of MoOx and 80 nm of Au, defining an active device area of 0.045 cm2.

CD measurements of thin films were carried out with a Chirascan (Applied Photophysics) spectrophotometer. CP photoluminescence was measured with a custom-built setup, using an achromatic quarter-wave plate (Thorlabs) and a linear polarizer with a 180° configuration (transmittance). Atomic force microscopy was measured using an Asylum MFP 3D device. Mueller matrix polarimetry in the transmission mode was carried out at the B23 beamline27 at the Diamond Light Source.

Current–voltage–luminance (J–V–L) characterizations were carried out using a Keithley 2400 device and a Konica Minolta LS-160 luminance meter, with the emission profile assumed to be Lambertian. The external quantum efficiency of the system was determined from the J–V–L characteristics and EL spectra, assuming Lambertian emission.

The CP-EL spectra were measured using a super-achromatic quarter-wave plate (Thorlabs SAQWP05M-700) and a visible wire grid linear polarizer (Thorlabs WP25M-VIS) placed in front of an Ocean Optics FL-4000 charge-coupled spectrophotometer, as previously reported28, and driving the device at a constant current (1 mA). The setup is automated via the integration of a rotation mount (Thorlabs ELL14K), ensuring the acquisition of left- and right-handed CP emission spectra in a time interval of <0.5 s to avoid potential gEL artefacts due to device degradation. The quarter-wave plate is rotated with respect to the polarizer to avoid artefacts due to the relative orientation of the linear polarizer and the internal optical components of the charge-coupled spectrometer. This methodology ensures that the quarter-wave plate and polarizer are always correctly positioned, preventing unintentional birefringence or polarization artefacts that would otherwise need angle-dependent measurements and depolarization corrections. The dissymmetry factor (gEL) was calculated using the equation gEL = 2(IL − IR)/(IL + IR) at the maximum of the emission, with IL and IR being the left-handed and right-handed emission intensities, respectively.

A major challenge in fault-tolerant quantum computation is to reduce both the space overhead, that is, the large number of physical qubits per logical qubit, and the time overhead, that is, the long physical gate sequences needed to implement a logical gate. Here we prove that a protocol using non-vanishing-rate quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes, combined with concatenated Steane codes, achieves constant space overhead and polylogarithmic time overhead, even when accounting for the required classical processing. This protocol offers an improvement over existing constant-space-overhead protocols. To prove our result, we develop a technique that we call partial circuit reduction, which enables error analysis for the entire fault-tolerant circuit by examining smaller parts composed of a few gadgets. With this approach, we resolve a logical gap in the existing arguments for the threshold theorem for the constant-space-overhead protocol with QLDPC codes and complete its proof. Our work establishes that the QLDPC-code-based approach can realize fault-tolerant quantum computation with a negligibly small slowdown and a bounded overhead of physical qubits.

Quantum computation has promising potential for accelerating the solving of certain classes of computational problems compared with classical computation1,2. However, the inherent fragility of quantum systems poses a major challenge in implementing quantum computations on quantum devices. Fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC)3,4 uses quantum error-correcting codes to encode logical qubits and suppress errors, typically incurring a space overhead (the number of physical qubits per logical qubit) and a time overhead (the ratio of physical to logical circuit depth). Currently, two prominent schemes have been proposed for FTQC: one is a concatenated code scheme3,4,5,6, and the other is a quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code scheme7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. For both schemes, threshold theorems4,5,7,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25 guarantee that the failure probability of the fault-tolerant simulation can be arbitrarily suppressed, provided that the physical error rate is below a certain threshold. Conventional FTQC schemes, using vanishing-rate codes such as those using surface codes9,10 or concatenated Steane codes5, incur polylogarithmic overheads in both space and time with respect to the size of the original quantum circuit.

In recent years, there have been notable advances towards achieving a constant space overhead by using non-vanishing-rate codes. Ref. 11 clarified the properties that non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes must retain to achieve FTQC with constant space overhead, in combination with concatenated Steane codes. Subsequently, refs. 26,27 showed that quantum expander codes16,26,28 can serve as suitable QLDPC codes for this protocol. In this protocol, logical gates are implemented via gate teleportation using auxiliary states encoded in QLDPC codes3,29,30. The fault-tolerant preparation of these auxiliary states has been challenging without relying on the conventional protocol using concatenated Steane codes3,5. However, the conventional protocol incurs a growing space overhead3,5, which undermines complete gate parallelism when we need to maintain a constant space overhead. As a result, the existing analyses in refs. 11,26,27 require sequential gate implementation, leading to a polynomial increase in the time overhead of this protocol. More recently, ref. 6 resolved this bottleneck by developing a new constant-space-overhead protocol with complete gate parallelism based on concatenated quantum Hamming codes. However, even with this fully parallel execution of gates, the protocol only achieves quasi-polylogarithmic time overhead. Thus, it remains an open question whether it is possible to design an even faster constant-space-overhead protocol that achieves the polylogarithmic time overhead.

From a more fundamental perspective, this question involves a trade-off relation between space and time overhead in FTQC, originally raised in ref. 11 and partially addressed in ref. 6. On the one hand, conventional protocols that use vanishing-rate codes3,4,5,14, whether they are QLDPC codes or concatenated codes, incur polylogarithmic overheads in both space and time. On the other hand, the newer protocols using non-vanishing-rate codes achieve constant space overhead, but this improvement comes at the expense of increased time overhead. Remarkably, both QLDPC-code-based and concatenated-code-based approaches exhibit a similar pattern here as well, where reductions in space overhead have so far led to increases in time overheads beyond the conventional polylogarithmic scaling6,27. The essential focus here is not to propose a marginally improved protocol that outperforms existing ones in certain respects, but rather to address a more fundamental question: whether it is possible to overcome the barrier of super-polylogarithmic time overhead while maintaining constant space overhead.

Another fundamental issue is that the existing analyses of threshold theorems for protocols with QLDPC codes11,26,27,31 assume that classical computations are performed instantaneously on arbitrarily large scales, and before our work, the non-zero runtime of classical computations in implementing FTQC was explicitly taken into account only in the analysis of the threshold theorem for concatenated codes6. To fully analyse the overhead achievable in FTQC, it is essential to incorporate the waiting time for noninstantaneous classical computations into the analysis. Analysing overhead in FTQC must consider all possible bottlenecks, including the runtime of classical computation in executing FTQC (for example, decoding algorithms for error correction and gate teleportation), because the decoding runtime, which has often been considered negligible in theoretical analyses, can dominate the asymptotic scaling32. In fact, accounting for decoding delays in surface-code-based protocols not only increases the exponent in the polylogarithmic time overhead, but may potentially make FTQC infeasible due to severe slowdowns—an issue known as the backlog problem32. Such asymptotically non-negligible classical computations can also render the existence of a threshold non-trivial. In practice, even at current scales, classical computations have already become non-negligible bottlenecks, further underscoring the practical necessity of such comprehensive analyses33,34.

In this Article, we address these challenges and rigorously prove that a polylogarithmic time overhead can be achieved while maintaining a constant space overhead, even when fully accounting for non-zero classical computation times, using the non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes. Our main theorem is informally stated as follows.

Let \(\{{C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\}\) be a sequence of original circuits indexed by an integer n. Each circuit \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\) has width W(n) and depth D(n), where the size of \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\) is polynomially bounded, that is, \(| {C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}| =\)\(O(W(n)D(n))=O({\rm{poly}}(n))\) as n → ∞. Then, for all target error ε > 0, there exists a threshold pth > 0 such that, if the physical error rate p is below the threshold, that is, p < pth, then there exists a sequence of fault-tolerant circuits \(\{{C}_{n}^{{\rm{FT}}}\}\) such that the classical output of \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{FT}}}\) is sampled from a probability distribution close to that of \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\) in terms of total variation distance at most ε, and \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{FT}}}\) has a width WFT(n) and a depth DFT(n) satisfying

as n → ∞.

The formal statement and proof of this theorem, along with the necessary definitions, are provided in Supplementary Sections II and V, in particular in theorem 11 therein. Our analysis is based on standard assumptions in the previous studies on FTQC5,6,7,11,26 (Supplementary Section II). In particular, we assume no geometric locality constraint on two-qubit gates; a CNOT gate can be applied to an arbitrary pair of physical qubits in a single time step. This is motivated by platforms such as neutral atoms, trapped ions and optics, which may offer pathways to realizing such non-local interactions35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44. To prove theorem 1, we present and analyse a hybrid fault-tolerant protocol that combines concatenated Steane codes5 and non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes with an efficient decoding algorithm, specifically quantum expander codes16, refining the previous analyses in refs. 11,26,27. Our analysis enables the polylogarithmic time overhead by increasing gate parallelism in the gate operations using gate teleportation, substantially improving the polynomial time overhead of the previous analyses in refs. 11,26,27, while still maintaining a constant space overhead.

Our analysis addresses and fixes a previously overlooked problem in the existing analyses11,26,27 of the threshold theorem for the QLDPC codes. In the analyses of FTQC, it is conventional to consider the local stochastic Pauli error model, where the correlated errors may occur across the entire fault-tolerant quantum circuit, as in refs. 11,26,27. For each code block of the QLDPC codes, the existing analyses in refs. 11,26,27 argue that the physical error rate of the codeword is suppressed after noisy syndrome measurements followed by quantum error correction using decoding algorithms, but this codeword state is on specific code blocks, that is, only in a small part of the entire fault-tolerant circuit on which the local stochastic Pauli error model is defined. This argument overlooks the correlations between this part of the circuit and the rest of the circuit surrounding this part, leaving the overall proof of the threshold theorem incomplete. To address this issue, we introduce a new method called partial circuit reduction. This method enables error analysis of the entire fault-tolerant circuit through the examination of individual gadgets on the code blocks of QLDPC codes. Our approach allows us to leverage the existing results from the decoding algorithms11,26,27 as a black box, so that we fully complete the proof of the threshold theorem for the constant-space-overhead protocol with the QLDPC codes. Furthermore, by combining this method with theoretical advances of the decoding algorithms in refs. 26,27, we show that it is indeed possible to achieve higher parallelization of the logical gates compared with the existing analyses in refs. 11,26,27, resulting in a polylogarithmic time overhead. These advances contribute to a fundamental understanding of the overhead and its space-time trade-off in FTQC and provide a robust foundation for realizing quantum computation.

We note that, in a concurrent work, another fault-tolerant protocol with constant space overhead and polylogarithmic time overhead45 has been proposed, relying on an approach substantially different from ours. The primary contribution of our work lies in the proof of the threshold theorem, which takes into account the non-zero runtime of classical computation.

In our protocol, quantum expander codes, which are Calderbank–Shor–Steane low-density parity-check codes with a non-vanishing rate, serve as the registers that store and protect logical qubits46,47. Using the conventional notation [[N, K, D]] for the code parameters (N is the number of physical qubits, K is the number of logical qubits and D is the code distance), quantum expander codes16 exhibit parameters of \([[N,K={{\varTheta}}(N),D={{\varTheta}}(\sqrt{N})]]\), so the rate K/N remains positive as N → ∞. Together with the small-set-flip decoder, these codes suppress the probability of decoding failure, which may lead to logical error, exponentially in the code distance, as established in refs. 26,27. These properties make quantum expander codes well suited for high-capacity, robust quantum memory.

To realize a universal gate set that manipulates this QLDPC-encoded quantum memory, we use a hybrid approach involving concatenated Steane codes5,47,48 to prepare auxiliary states encoded by quantum expander codes in a fault-tolerant manner, enabling the logical gates via gate teleportation. The fault-tolerant protocol with concatenated Steane codes can be used to simulate arbitrary original quantum circuits, albeit with polylogarithmic overheads in both time and space5. In our hybrid approach, this concatenated Steane code protocol is crucially used to prepare logical auxiliary states that are encoded in the QLDPC code.

The fault-tolerant preparation of an auxiliary state, denoted by \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\), which is a physical state representing a codeword of a QLDPC code that encodes a target logical auxiliary state, can be understood intuitively as follows. While \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) can be prepared by some non-fault-tolerant unitary circuit, such a circuit cannot be directly used for its fault-tolerant preparation. Instead, the idea is to first prepare \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) as a logical state encoded in the concatenated Steane code. Because the well-established fault-tolerant protocol with the concatenated Steane code supports simulation of universal quantum computation, this Steane-encoded version of \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) can be prepared with a sufficiently low logical error rate. We then convert this logical state into the physical state \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) over the physical qubits, by decoding the concatenated Steane code. Roughly speaking, this step introduces errors on each physical qubit at the physical error rate, up to constant factors. This fact was implicitly used in the previous analysis of the constant-space-overhead protocol based on QLDPC codes11, and we provide a rigorous proof and explicit bound on this error rate in Supplementary Appendix A. Although each physical qubit may now suffer errors at the physical error rate, it is important to recall that \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\) is already encoded as a codeword of the QLDPC code. Therefore, we can transition to using the decoder of the QLDPC code to continue suppressing its decoding failure probability and protect the encoded logical state in \(\left\vert \psi \right\rangle\). Once these QLDPC-encoded auxiliary states are fault-tolerantly prepared, they enable the implementation of logical Clifford and non-Clifford gates on the QLDPC logical qubits via fault-tolerant gate teleportation3,29,30, thereby equipping our protocol with a universal set of logical operations.

The compilation process in our hybrid fault-tolerant protocol consists of two stages (see Fig. 1 and Supplementary Section III for details).

The process involves two main stages. The aim of the first stage is to convert an original quantum circuit \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{org}}}\) to an intermediate circuit acting on registers, where each register is a collection of at most K qubits. The intermediate circuit is composed of a predetermined set of elementary operations, which includes a \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\)-state preparation, Clifford-state preparations, magic-state preparations, Pauli-gate operations, a CNOT-gate operation, a ZK-measurement operation, a Bell-measurement operation and a wait operation. The compilation begins with partitioning the qubits of the original circuit into registers. Then, \(\left\vert 0\right\rangle\)-state preparations in the original circuit are replaced by \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\)-state preparations, and Z-basis measurements are replaced by ZK-measurement operations. Clifford gates (for example, a tensor product of the Hadamard H gate) and non-Clifford gates (for example, a tensor product of T gates) in the original circuit are converted into a Clifford unitary UC acting on two registers and a non-Clifford unitary UT on a single register, respectively. To maintain constant space overhead, the number of the \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\)-state preparations, the UC gates, the UT gates and the ZK-measurement operations performed at a single time step is limited to \({\varTheta}(W(n)/{\rm{polylog}}(n/{\varepsilon}))\), where W(n) is the original circuit width. Following this, each of the UC gates and the UT gates is replaced by a sequence of elementary operations performing the corresponding teleportation with the aid of auxiliary registers, which is denoted as a UC-gate or a UT-gate abbreviation. The next stage is the compilation of this intermediate circuit into the fault-tolerant circuit \({C}_{n}^{{\rm{FT}}}\). This stage is achieved by replacing each elementary operation with a corresponding gadget, and an EC gadget is inserted between each pair of adjacent gadgets.

First, an original quantum circuit is compiled into an intermediate circuit described as follows. An original circuit consists of initial state preparation, Clifford gates, non-Clifford gates and measurements. The qubits of the original circuit are partitioned into collections of at most K qubits each, called registers6. Here, K is chosen to match the number of logical qubits of the QLDPC code to be used, because each qubit in the intermediate circuit will eventually be regarded as a logical qubit of the code. For the compilation, we rewrite the original circuit using the following operations acting on registers: a \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\) -state preparation, Clifford unitaries UC acting on two registers, non-Clifford unitaries UT on a single register and a ZK measurement (Fig. 1). To achieve constant overhead, we restrict the number of the preparations, the measurements and the unitary gates executed in parallel, which is done by inserting the wait operations to delay part of the operations. Then, we regard each of the unitary gates as an abbreviation of a gate-teleportation circuit composed of elementary operations and equipped with ancillary registers. Here, the set of the elementary operations is composed of a \({\left\vert 0\right\rangle }^{\otimes K}\)-state preparation, Clifford-state preparations, magic-state preparations, Pauli-gate operations, a CNOT-gate operation, a ZK-measurement operation, a Bell-measurement operation and a wait operation. At this point, the original circuit has been converted to a circuit composed of the elementary operations, which we call the intermediate circuit (Fig. 1).

Next, this intermediate circuit is compiled into a fault-tolerant circuit. In this stage, each elementary operation within the intermediate circuit is replaced with its corresponding gadget, and each register is replaced with the QLDPC code block. Each gadget is a physical circuit designed to perform the logical operation acting on the logical qubits within a code block of the QLDPC code in a fault-tolerant way. As described above, the state-preparation gadget is fault-tolerantly constructed using the concatenated Steane code, while the other gadgets can be implemented transversally for quantum expander codes. Furthermore, an error-correction (EC) gadget acting on each code block is inserted between each pair of adjacent gadgets. Through this process, the final fault-tolerant circuit is constructed.

A crucial feature of our protocol is its ability to achieve higher parallelism in executing logical gates compared with existing constant-space-overhead fault-tolerant protocols with QLDPC codes11,26,27, making it possible to achieve polylogarithmic time and constant space overhead simultaneously. In previous analyses11,26,27 for constant-overhead FTQC with QLDPC codes, logical gates could act simultaneously act on only O(W(n)/poly(n/ε)) logical qubits. This limitation naturally led to a polynomial time overhead.

Our protocol overcomes this bottleneck by providing a refined analysis of the required code size for quantum expander codes. These codes exhibit an exponential suppression of decoding failure probability as we increase the code distance. Indeed, this error suppression enables the use of a very small QLDPC code block size, scaling only polylogarithmically. The use of such small code blocks is important for our protocol; it reduces the resources required for the auxiliary states needed for gate teleportation. The QLDPC-encoded auxiliary states required for gate teleportation are prepared using a concatenated Steane code protocol. The fault-tolerant preparation using the concatenated Steane code itself incurs polylogarithmic space and time overheads. Implementation of each logical qubit of the QLDPC code thus requires a polylogarithmic number of physical qubits. Furthermore, each logical gate, implemented via these auxiliary logical states prepared using concatenated Steane codes, also introduces a polylogarithmic time overhead. This polylogarithmic requirement for the QLDPC code block size, in turn, enables the performance of more logical operations, that is, those on \(O(W(n)/{\rm{polylog}}(n/\varepsilon ))\) logical qubits, in parallel at each time step while maintaining the constant space overhead. This substantially increased parallelism in logical gate execution contributes to achieving a polylogarithmic time overhead. The detailed overhead analysis is presented in Supplementary Section V.

A key challenge in proving the threshold theorem for FTQC with QLDPC codes lies in consistently analysing errors across the entire fault-tolerant circuit, especially when individual code blocks are decoded locally. Existing analyses often focus on error suppression within a single QLDPC code block, overlooking correlations between the block and the rest of the circuit11,26,27, which is globally subject to a local stochastic Pauli error model11,26,27.

To address this fundamental issue, we introduce and utilize a technique called partial circuit reduction. The core motivation for this technique is to provide a systematic framework for analysing errors in a modular fashion. In our fault-tolerant circuit, each operation gadget is followed by EC gadgets for the associated code blocks, forming a circuit segment, which we call a rectangle. Instead of tackling the entire fault-tolerant circuit at once, we sequentially analyse errors in each rectangle. Partial circuit reduction allows us to formally replace a noisy rectangle in the fault-tolerant circuit with its ideally behaving, noiseless version, while appropriately updating the probability distribution of faulty locations in the subsequent, not-yet-analysed parts of the circuit. This step-by-step reduction is easy to use because it only requires analysis of a local segment at a time, while ensuring that the global statistics of fault occurrences continue to follow the same model with updated parameters. This method enables us to systematically manage error correlations and integrate established results from decoding algorithms26,27 as black-box components within a complete and rigorous proof of threshold existence. The detailed mathematical formulation of partial circuit reduction and its application in proving the threshold theorem are presented in Supplementary Section V.

With all techniques described above, we prove the threshold theorem for our protocol. A fundamental challenge in theoretical FTQC analysis, often leading to oversimplification, is the reliance on the assumption that classical computation required in error correction and gate teleportation can be performed instantaneously, that is, in zero time26,27,49. In reality, these computations have a non-zero runtime that may grow as the size of original circuits becomes larger. The impact of this additional runtime is not limited to the time overhead. Because errors accumulate during the wait time for classical computation, they can potentially affect space overheads and even the existence of a fault-tolerant threshold.

Our analysis explicitly incorporates this non-zero runtime by inserting appropriate wait periods in the fault-tolerant circuit such that outcomes of classical computation can be used to choose on-demand operations. To establish a threshold under this realistic condition, we identify crucial properties for the decoding algorithm of the QLDPC codes to satisfy. These include: (1) the single-shot property, enabling error correction from a single round of potentially noisy syndrome measurements; (2) iterative execution, where each internal loop of the decoder completes in O(1) time with O(N) classical parallel processors; (3) exponential suppression of decoding failure probability with code distance; and (4) monotonic reduction of residual physical error rate with the number T of the internal loops when physical and syndrome error rates are below certain thresholds. We confirm that the small-set-flip decoder for the quantum expander code26,27 fulfils these requirements. These conditions ensure that the execution of the decoder within the EC gadget (that is, the wait time) can always be kept to a constant time, even if we carefully account for classical processing time. This has enabled us to rigorously prove the existence of a fault-tolerance threshold for our protocol without compromising overhead scalings. The detailed conditions for the decoder and the proof of the threshold theorem are provided in Supplementary Sections IV and V, respectively.

In this Article, we have presented a hybrid fault-tolerant protocol that combines concatenated codes for gate operations and non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes (in particular, the quantum expander codes16,26,28) for quantum memory. These results contribute to a fundamental understanding of the overhead and its space-time trade-off required to realize FTQC. Unlike previous analyses that assumed instantaneous classical computations, our work explicitly accounts for non-zero-time classical computation times and their associated error accumulation. Incorporating classical runtime into the overhead analysis and establishing a threshold theorem under this setting not only offers a comprehensive understanding of overheads accounting for every possible bottleneck, but also provides a solid foundation for realizing FTQC. An encouraging aspect of our results is that polylogarithmic time overhead and constant space overhead can be achieved using well-established components: quantum expander codes and concatenated Steane codes. Both of these have been the focus of active experimental research in various physical architectures. Recent theoretical proposals indicate the feasibility of quantum expander codes in scalable systems such as neutral atoms and superconducting circuits42,43,44, while small-scale protocols with the Steane code have already begun to be demonstrated experimentally37,50,51. Our findings indicate a promising potential for low-overhead FTQC using the hybrid approach that combines non-vanishing-rate QLDPC codes and concatenated codes, in addition to relying solely on the code-concatenation approach as proposed in refs. 6,52. With regard to practical implementation, our results clarify the competing time overheads of these two constant-space-overhead approaches, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive investigation into the physical realizability of both approaches.

In some parts of the world, record numbers of people are being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the United States, for example, government researchers last year reported that more than 11% of children had received an ADHD diagnosis at some point in their lives1 — a sharp increase from 2003, when around 8% of children had (see ‘ADHD among US boys and girls').

Why is autism really on the rise? What the science says

Why is autism really on the rise? What the science says

But now, top US health officials argue that diagnoses have spiralled out of control. In May, the Make America Healthy Again Commission — led by US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr — said ADHD was part of a “crisis of overdiagnosis and overtreatment” and suggested that ADHD medications did not help children in the long term.

So what, exactly, is going on?

One thing that's clear is that several factors — including improved detection and greater awareness of ADHD — are causing people with symptoms to receive a diagnosis and treatment, whereas they wouldn't have years earlier. Clinicians say this is especially true for women and girls, whose pattern of symptoms was often missed in the past. Although some specialists are concerned about the risks of overdiagnosis, many are more worried that too many people go undiagnosed and untreated.

At the same time, the rise in awareness and diagnoses of ADHD has fuelled a public debate about how it should be viewed and how best to provide support, including when medication is required. The emergence of the neurodiversity movement is challenging the view of ADHD as a disorder that should be ‘treated', and instead proposes that it's a difference that should be better understood and supported — with more focus on adapting schools and workplaces, for instance.

Source: Ref. 1

“I do have a big problem with ‘disorder',” says Jeff Karp, a biomedical engineer at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who has ADHD. “It's the school system that's disordered. It's not the kids.”

But many clinicians and people with ADHD argue that it is associated with difficulties — ranging from academic struggles to an increased chance of injuries and substance misuse — that justify its label as a medical condition, and say that medication is an important and effective part of therapy for many people.

“I hear a lot of people talking about ADHD being a gift and a superpower, and I do applaud that,” says Jeremy Didier, a clinician specializing in ADHD who is president of Children and Adults with Attention Deficit–Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD), a non-profit US group based in Lanham, Maryland, and who has ADHD herself. “But I do not want to downplay the impact that ADHD can have on someone's life when it's either undiagnosed or poorly managed.”

She and others say both models — neurodiversity and medical — have merit. “Bringing those two together in a meaningful and productive way, I think that's maybe the biggest challenge” for the field, says Sven Bölte, a specialist in child and adolescent psychiatric science at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.

A slew of studies suggests that diagnoses of ADHD have gone up in many high-income countries in the past two to three decades — similar to a rise in autism diagnoses (see ‘ADHD on the rise'). The rate of new ADHD diagnoses in the United Kingdom, for example, doubled in boys and quadrupled in girls between 2000 and 2018, according to one study2. In adults, the rate shot up even more. “We have numbers suggesting that we're seeing a rise,” says Max Wiznitzer, a paediatric neurologist at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, Ohio.

So what explains the surge? It doesn't seem to be a big rise in the prevalence of the symptoms and traits that characterize ADHD — namely hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, researchers say. When scientists use standard procedures to rigorously assess symptoms in representative samples of a population, they find that the ‘true' prevalence of ADHD is fairly consistent in different parts of the world — estimated at around 5.4% in children3 and 2.6% in adults4, according to two comprehensive global studies.

Experts say there are several reasons these figures are much lower than the 11% diagnosis level in US children that the country's health authorities reported last year1. That number comes from the US National Survey of Children's Health conducted in 2022, in which parents were asked whether a doctor or other health-care provider had ever said their child has ADHD. But this method of assessing prevalence would lead to inflated counts, says Luis Rohde, a psychiatrist and ADHD specialist at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Some children were probably misdiagnosed — perhaps by a physician without specialist training — and would not be classified as having ADHD in a thorough clinical evaluation. Some parents might have misremembered, perhaps if they were told that their child had symptoms without a formal diagnosis, he says. And some children who once had a diagnosis would no longer have received one at the time of the survey if their symptoms had waned and they were reassessed.

Researchers and specialists highlight other factors that are likely to be driving up the number of diagnoses. One is a change in diagnostic criteria in The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). In the fourth edition of this widely used manual, introduced in 1994, a child or adult ADHD diagnosis required the presence of at least six of a list of nine inattention symptoms and/or six or more of nine hyperactivity symptoms, and stipulated that these had to be present before the age of seven. (This reflects the idea that ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition that arises during childhood brain development.)

When the fifth edition, DSM-V, arrived in 2013, the criteria were slightly relaxed. Symptoms had to be present before age 12, and adult diagnosis required a minimum of five symptoms. (Children still had to have at least six.) “So when we expand the criteria, obviously you increase a little bit the prevalence,” says Rohde, who was involved in those revisions. It has also become more common for clinicians to diagnose ADHD along with other conditions, when in the past they tended to focus on one, says Bölte: “That fuels the figures.” ADHD commonly occurs with autism, as well as with anxiety, depression and other disorders.

Today, a thorough ADHD assessment involves collecting a detailed history and completing behaviour questionnaires, including input from family members and, for children, from schools. In the United States, the condition can be diagnosed by a range of health professionals, including psychiatrists, other mental-health specialists and primary-care physicians such as paediatricians, who might not have dedicated training in ADHD. But countries differ: in Brazil and many other low- and middle-income nations, people with ADHD symptoms tend to be sent to neurologists and psychiatrists for ADHD assessment and diagnoses, and there is a shortage of such specialists, Rohde says.

The DSM-V defines three ‘presentations' of ADHD. People with ‘predominantly inattentive' ADHD show symptoms such as making careless mistakes, struggling to sustain attention, losing things and being easily distracted. Those with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD have traits such as fidgeting, restlessness, talking excessively and interrupting others. In a third, combined presentation, people show both sets of symptoms. A diagnosis requires that symptoms are present for at least six months and in two or more settings (such as school, home, work); are not explained by another condition such as anxiety; and cause an impairment, such as struggling with schoolwork, losing a job or having relationship problems.

The impairment requirement is key, clinicians say. These traits vary across the population: some individuals are very hyperactive or inattentive, and some not at all. But people tend to be diagnosed with ADHD when their symptoms significantly interfere with their lives. “The medical part of ADHD comes in when your life is becoming derailed,” says Margaret Sibley, a specialist in psychiatry and behavioural sciences at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.

Bölte says that clinicians are interpreting the diagnostic criteria “far more liberally and openly” than in the past. This is another factor — aside from changes in the diagnostic criteria — that is driving the apparent surge in ADHD.

But working out when someone crosses the impairment line involves a subjective and sometimes tricky judgement, say specialists. And there is an ongoing debate about whether a person's level of impairment should be defined relative to their own potential or to a population average.

What's clear is that more parents as well as children are deemed as crossing that threshold. Wiznitzer says that when he diagnoses a child, “almost invariably [one of] the parents has it”, too. (That's because genes are a major contributor to ADHD: the disorder has a heritability5 of roughly 70–80%.) Even though the parents were probably symptomatic as children, many were not identified as having the condition, he says. But now, they are.

Another reason why diagnoses have surged is an increase in public awareness of ADHD — fuelled by an explosion of discussion on TikTok and other social media.

Information online “connects with some people who have had these symptoms and impairments for a long time, but never understood what they were,” says Sibley. That leads them to seek information and professional help, pushing diagnoses up. And people might be eager to receive a diagnosis if it allows them to access help and services for themselves or a child, such as adaptations to support learning at school.

The surge in ADHD has led to concerns, particularly in the United States, about questionable diagnoses being given without a thorough clinical evaluation — through online services, for example, or by medical professionals without ADHD training. “They've got a visit for 15 or 20 minutes, and the diagnosis is made,” says Stephen Hinshaw, a specialist in child and adolescent mental health and ADHD at the University of California, Berkeley. But Didier says that a bigger problem is the number of people with ADHD who are undiagnosed or untreated. She emphasizes how important it is for people to have access to a thorough, accurate assessment from a trained professional who specializes in ADHD.

The lack of recognition of ADHD is a particular problem in low- and middle-income countries, says Rohde. “The problem here is clearly underdiagnosis, stigma and undertreatment,” he says, which particularly affects “vulnerable people and communities”.

Autism is on the rise: what's really behind the increase?

Many specialists say they're observing a rapid rise of diagnoses in girls and women6. In part, that's thought to be because women and girls are more likely to have symptoms of inattention — rather than more-noticeable hyperactivity — and to find organizational and other strategies that ‘mask' those symptoms. Didier says that, despite being an ADHD specialist and diagnosing the condition in three of her sons, she and other ADHD practitioners missed the signs and symptoms in her daughter until she was a teenager. “It's egregious that we don't have more research on ADHD trajectories in women,” Sibley says.

Changes in the world itself are yet another possible contributor to increased diagnoses. Some researchers speculate that schools, work, technology and other aspects of modern lives have become so complex and taxing that they are pushing more people beyond the threshold of impairment. In Sweden, says Bölte, schools are sometimes chaotic, with complex schedules and grading systems. “Many students are very confused and fed up with school and do not understand it any more,” he says.

A study published last year7 revealed that parents think their children are struggling more. The research team examined how parents viewed the ADHD symptoms of more than 27,000 nine-year-old children born in Sweden. Parents consulted in 2016–18 tended to say that their children were more impaired than did parents consulted in 2004–06, even though their kids had the same number of symptoms. “Environment around the child is crucial,” says Samuele Cortese, who studies ADHD at the University of Southampton, UK, and was involved in the work.

Karp describes ADHD as “context-dependent”. In a school where children are expected to sit still and be quiet, “it makes these traits seem like a problem”, he says. But when someone with ADHD is in an environment that nurtures and empowers them, they “can then channel their neurotype to do incredible things”. Karp is not against medication — and sometimes takes it himself — but would like more emphasis on institutions and society evolving so that people with ADHD can thrive.

Researchers, meanwhile, are finding evidence that the severity of symptoms can vary over time. In a 2021 study, Sibley and her colleagues analysed detailed records of more than 550 children who were diagnosed with ADHD and followed for up to 16 years8. The researchers found that 64% of young people had fluctuations in ADHD — times when their symptoms faded but then recurred.

Sibley and her team hypothesized that people's symptoms might flare up when they were facing increased demands in their lives, such as when starting a new school or having a child. But in fact, the opposite seemed to be true, according to a later analysis by Sibley and her colleagues9. This could be because people are able to take on more responsibility when their symptoms abate. But the alternative explanation — one that has “really resonated”, Sibley says — is that people with ADHD need a degree of activity and accountability in their lives to perform and stay engaged. Sibley thinks there might be a U-shaped curve: too many or too few demands and obligations mean that people with ADHD don't function at their best — but at a “sweet spot”, they do.

When DoorDash delivery driver Livie Rose Henderson posted a video alleging that one of her customers sexually assaulted her in October, it set off a firestorm of reactions.

Henderson's TikTok claimed that when she was dropping off a delivery in Oswego, New York, she found a customer's front door wide open and inside, a man on the couch with his pants and underwear pulled down to his ankles. Henderson was dubbed the “DoorDash Girl,” and her video accrued tens of millions of views, including some supportive and consoling responses to what she said she had endured on the job as a young woman. Many others on the platform made commentary videos that called into question Henderson's alleged victimhood, defended the customer, and spread misinformation, with TikTok's algorithm seemingly amplifying these “hot takes.” Then, following Henderson's November 10 arrest—she has been charged with unlawful surveillance and the dissemination of unlawful surveillance imagery—a new wave of reactions emerged. (Police have dismissed her sexual assault allegation.)

None of these responses came from Black content creator and journalist Mirlie Larose.

But Larose opened TikTok one day to find dozens of messages from friends and supporters alarmed by a video of her responding to the situation in favor of the customer and DoorDash's decision to terminate Henderson. (Henderson was fired for sharing a customer's personal information online, DoorDash spokesperson Jeff Rosenberg tells WIRED.) As Larose stared at the video in disbelief, for a split second she second-guessed herself as she became flushed with anxiety about the comment section “tearing her apart.”

“Did I film this?” she asked. “It's my face, it's my hair.”

“Then, within three or four seconds, I noticed something's off. There's no way I said this. I didn't [want to] talk about this topic,” Larose tells WIRED. The video had been AI-generated.

The situation highlights an increasingly common form of digital blackface, buoyed by the rise of generative AI. The term, popularized by culture critic Lauren Michele Jackson, describes various contemporary types of “minstrel performances” on the internet. This looks like the overrepresentation of reaction GIFs, memes, TikToks, and other visual and text-based media that use Black imagery, slang, gestures, and culture. TikTok's reliance on attention-grabbing short-form video content, coupled with apps like Sora 2, has made it far easier for non-Black creators and bot accounts to adopt racialized stereotypical Black personas using deepfakes. This is also known as digital blackfishing.

In the midst of the DoorDash/Henderson controversy, users on TikTok began to notice two videos in particular: one from a bot account and another from an actual Black content creator parroting the same script. They adopted seemingly DARVO (Deny, Attack, and Reverse Victim and Offender) positions, minimizing the allegations Henderson made and justifying her termination: “I saw the original video posted by the DoorDash girl, and … I understand why DoorDash fired you and why you're blocked from the app.” The videos go on to say, “As for the guy, I can see why everyone is saying he did it on purpose. But when you look at the original video, that couch is not in eye view unless you angle yourself and look over, and if you really want to break it down, he's inside his house.” In a statement on Facebook, the Oswego City Police Department said the male was “incapacitated and unconscious on his couch due to alcohol consumption” and that the video was taken outside his house. Police also said they “determined that no sexual assault occurred.”

As the deepfakes gained virality across TikTok, Instagram, X, and Reddit, the assumption was that both videos were AI-generated because the talking points were eerily identical; some even speculated that DoorDash orchestrated an AI PR campaign against Henderson. DoorDash tells WIRED that the company is “aware of AI-generated content surrounding this case and in no way condones or supports it.”

In reality, a bot account, uimuthavohaj0g, dubbed the creator NDR Antonio V's DARVO response video over an AI-generated video using Larose's face and likeness. The bot account's deepfake video also uses an out-of-context clip from Henderson's original video in the background to further drive the point that Henderson fabricated her SA allegations to garner a “platform.”

After TikTok removed Henderson's original video, she posted that she attempted to upload it again, without the footage of the assailant. But it was removed again, and she received a second strike. In the absence of the original footage, altered images from screenshots of her original TikTok video appeared to make it look like she opened the alleged perpetrator's residence to record him, instead violating his privacy. According to TikTok, the company removed Henderson's videos for displaying “content that shows or promotes sexual abuse and exploitation, including having, sharing, or creating intimate images (real or edited) of someone without their consent.”

Both of the charges against Henderson are class E felonies, with the potential penalty of up to four years in prison for each charge.

Larose says the sensitive nature of the allegations is why she didn't feel compelled to comment on the situation publicly.

“Sexual assault is not something you want to play with, and you can't freely talk about it without knowing [all] the facts.”

But the bot account had other plans, posting videos using her likeness and that of another Black creator without their consent.

Larose said she already knew about the account because it had used her face in 10 other videos before. Mostly, the videos were commentaries on pop culture topics and celebrity culture, the most viral one being about a prank gone wrong. As with those earlier cases, she says she quickly asked TikTok to remove the videos. Each time, she says, her requests were denied.

It wasn't until a more well-known Black creator, @notKHRIS, stitched the bot account's video to warn others about this misleading AI-generated deepfake video and its use of digital blackface that more people reported the page. As a result, the page was finally removed from the app.

Still, for days, Larose says, other accounts posted AI-generated videos with her face—not only pertaining to the DoorDash incident. “What was also annoying about the situation is the voice that they use in certain videos is unfair and harmful, because they're imitating a certain type of [Black] stereotype.“

WIRED reached out to dtff2727, one of the bot accounts posting deepfakes of Black creators, for comment and did not receive a response. As of this writing, the account has a total of 19 AI-generated videos exploiting Larose's likeness. ​

Digital minstrels like the bot accounts and AI influencers are not only profiting from this content, but are granted anonymity by using digital blackface while rage-baiting and reinforcing stereotypes about Black communities online.

OpenAI's Sora 2, like Google's Veo, has added to the proliferation of AI slop on TikTok, much of it plagued with racist, sexist, ableist, and classist biases.

Before the page was removed, the TikTok account @impossible_asmr1 posted Sora-generated AI content of Black women yelling in public about food stamps. The clips depicted realistic-looking Black women using butchered African American Vernacular English or blaccent, complaining in stores about not being able to use SNAP benefits to purchase fast food or alcohol, or even selling EBT in exchange for cash. Some clips had Sora watermarks and others did not. But once the clips went viral, it ignited a faux panic about Black people and their misuse of the welfare state on the heels of the Trump administration and Supreme Court halting SNAP benefits. Recently, OpenAI had to block users from making videos of Martin Luther King Jr. on its Sora app after his estate protested the spread of dehumanizing, minstrelsy AI depictions of the civil rights leader.

In a statement to WIRED, OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said that OpenAI's policies prohibit ""misleading others through impersonation, scams, or fraud.” The spokesperson said the company is working to “detect patterns of misuse and apply penalties or remove content when violations occur.""

Digital blackface is more than just the act of pretending to be Black for entertainment or profit, says Yeshimabeit Milner, founder and CEO of Data for Black Lives, an advocacy group fighting against discriminatory uses of data and algorithms. “It's about harness[ing] the power of these very violent stereotypes of Black people for the purpose of pushing a specific political agenda. One would call it social or cultural engineering to create the sort of chaos and conversations, and strife that drives up viewership and engagement,” she says.

Similarly, in 2018, the Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed how the data of 87 million Facebook users was being used to plant and sow the seeds of political divisiveness between the right and left. Milner says, “Trusted messengers online were impersonating Black, Latino, and white people as well as entire [political] organizations and chapters to build a consensus that certain demographics of people think a certain way.”

Some Black content creators are pushing back. Zaria Imani tells WIRED that she is taking legal action under “copyright infringement” against multiple bot pages in AI-generated commentary videos engaging in content farming.

Professor Meredith Broussard, author of More Than a Glitch: Confronting Race, Gender, and Ability Bias in Tech, says content creators should be granted the same protections and safeguards as celebrities and copyrighted characters, who've raised alarms about their likeness being used in AI videos without their permission.

“ This is a structural issue that the platform needs to fix,” Broussard states.

In May 2025, the Take It Down Act was signed into law, criminalizing the distribution of (authentic and computer-generated) nonconsensual intimate imagery, such as AI-generated deepfakes and “revenge porn.”

While Big Tech companies can work toward minimizing some of the harms caused by AI, it's becoming increasingly clear that bigger intervention is needed to hold these companies truly accountable, according to Milner.

“With actual education and collective action, we can do more than just get TikTok to stop. We can really push for legislation that's going to make this completely not OK,” she says.

After Myanmar's military junta raided a notorious scam compound and destroyed buildings with explosives in October, officials claimed the country would entirely “eradicate” forced scamming within its borders. Now newly released satellite images of the targeted KK Park scam center reveal that only buildings in one limited section of the compound were destroyed during the initial raids. Experts on scam compounds, meanwhile, say the entire effort is likely “propaganda.”

High-resolution images of the KK Park scam compound, which is located near the Myanmar-Thailand border, show how military forces have razed multiple buildings, leaving piles of rubble in their place. However, the images show the destruction is, so-far, confined to the Eastern side of the gigantic compound—with hundreds of buildings across the vast compound being left untouched.

Multiple experts tell WIRED that the raids at KK Park and some other scam compounds are likely part of a wider “performative” effort by Myanmar's military government, which has come under increasing pressure to tackle the highly lucrative scam compounds that have flourished in recent years. They also raise concerns about the welfare of thousands of people forced to run scams in KK Park.

“The junta is making it sound as though they're taking down the entire compound, and the imagery that we have seen so far is only limited to one section,” says Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, an anti-slavery organization. “It's important to keep monitoring this to verify what they're actually doing and [see] if this is just for show or if they're actually cracking down on the real problem.”

The satellite images, taken on November 16, appear to show that some buildings located around courtyards have been almost totally destroyed, with debris strewn around other buildings. Heintz says that the images, plus extra social media footage, indicates that some “villas” and dormitories where trafficking victims may have been housed appear to have been damaged or destroyed. (Myanmar's military government has said further destruction started on November 17; third-party reports also suggest more buildings have been destroyed).

“All of the critical buildings that you would need to perpetrate the scams are still intact and still ready for use,” says Mechelle B Moore, the CEO of anti-trafficking nonprofit Global Alms, which is based in Thailand and works to help people who have trafficked into scam compounds in Myanmar. “They're putting on a good show right now to say that they don't support scamming compounds or human trafficking. But what they've allowed is all the scamming syndicates—all of the scamming bosses and supervisors—have been allowed to flee,” Moore claims.

Over the past decade, dozens of scam compounds have appeared in Southeast Asia, primarily across Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos. Often operated by or linked to Chinese organized crime groups, the compounds trick people into working at them—often with the offer of high-paying jobs—and then force them to run a range of scams. Trafficking victims often have their passports taken; they can be tortured or beaten if they refuse to scam. By stealing from people around the world, the compounds have made billions for the organized crime groups.

Amid the extensive criminality, KK Park has emerged as one of the largest and most notorious scam compounds in Myanmar. Five years ago, the site was a series of fields near the town of Myawaddy, but has since been transformed into a sprawling compound with hundreds of buildings and thousands of people held there.

Full view of the KK Park scam compound, which shows the limited destruction as of November 16, 2025.

Myanmar's military junta has been conducting raids on KK Park since the middle of October and on the Shwe Kokko compound since mid-November. The sites are linked to “telecom” fraud and illegal gambling operations, government statements say. A statement from Myanmar's Ministry of Information published online on Wednesday says officials are “dismantling and removing illegal buildings, and taking further action in accordance with the law.”

The statement claims that officials are demolishing buildings in three areas of KK Park, and since the raids began a “a total of 237 buildings out of 635 illegal buildings have so far been demolished.” It says that 1,847 “undocumented foreign entrants” have been detained, along with more than 3,000 computers, 21,000 mobile phones, and 102 Starlink satellite internet systems. Multiple Myanmar government departments did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. A member of Myanmar's London embassy said they would prefer to discuss the topic in person, which was not viable ahead of publication, but did not otherwise comment.

“From 30 January to 25 November 2025, a total of 12,687 foreign nationals who had entered Myanmar illegally were detained,” the junta's Ministry of Information statement says. “Of these, 12,343 individuals were screened to be expelled, and 10,029 were systematically repatriated to their respective countries through Thailand in accordance with legal procedures.”

Alongside multiple government statements, the Associated Press reports that state television in Myanmar has been broadcasting “extensive” video footage of buildings being dismantled in KK Park, and the unusually detailed reports “appear to reflect the military government's desire to publicize its efforts after months of bad publicity.” Some video footage shows steamrollers crushing thousands of smartphones and computers.

“This is really performative, and it continues to be the case,” says Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime. “I think around 20,000 devices were destroyed, which is tragic in terms of just mass amounts of evidence lost.”

Myanmar's recent high-profile crackdown on KK Park and the Shwe Kokko compounds could be driven by multiple reasons, the experts WIRED spoke to say. The United States government has recently set up a Scam Center Strike Force that has targeted the infrastructure and organizations allegedly behind the compounds, including sanctioning armed groups that support the military regime in Myanmar for their alleged involvement in the criminality. China has also extradited an alleged criminal boss who is linked to scam centers and sentenced others to death. The military government is also holding a widely criticized election in December.

“The new sanctions have put a lot of pressure on the Myanmar military to try to do something in response to this. But this is definitely a propaganda scheme,” Moore says. “We have several different groups that are being held in scamming compounds. Groups of victims that are too scared to leave, even though the crime syndicates have left or they're being held under guard and they're not allowed to leave.”

Tower says another development, which is more significant than the military junta action, has come from anti-government, resistance groups also starting to disrupt scam compounds; he points to one group, the Karen National Liberation Army, recently taking over a compound. “I think this was the first time on the Karen border that you've seen resistance forces really step in to put pressure on the military and to take this issue up as part of their revolutionary activity,” Tower says.

Meanwhile, Heintz says that when people enslaved in scam compounds are freed or escape, authorities need to properly class them as victims of human trafficking and not treat them as criminals themselves. “It's crucial that every individual undergoes a proper victim screening and identification process to ensure that trafficking survivors receive the protection and justice they deserve,” he says, “and that critical intelligence is secured and used to stop these criminal trafficking networks.”

In recent months, the Trump administration has opened a deregulatory floodgate in the name of building more data centers. Among other things, this has involved ordering rollbacks of clean water regulations and opening up public lands to coal mining.

Now, it's turning its eye to chemical regulation with a new policy that could, experts say, potentially fast-track the approval of new chemicals for use in the US—including new types of forever chemicals—with limited oversight.

In September, the EPA announced it would be prioritizing the regulatory review of new chemicals used in data centers or related projects. The announcement is part of a sweeping set of overhauls pushed by the Trump administration following several executive orders related to AI and a White House AI Action Plan, both rolled out in July. The Action Plan was formed after soliciting more than 10,000 public comments, which included hundreds from industry interests. These actions, the White House has said, will usher in a “golden age for American manufacturing and technological dominance.”

“I think they want to impose as few restrictions as possible on chemicals,” says Greg Schweer, who served as the EPA chief of the new chemicals management branch between 2008 and 2020. “In previous administrations, political people stayed out of [chemical regulation]—they tried to let science win. Here, the industry has a willing set of ears that wants to listen to their opinions.”

September's announcement was part of a larger push to expedite new chemical reviews at the EPA. The new chemical review process underwent a significant reform in 2016; in the decade since, a backlog of chemical reviews has piled up at the agency, garnering complaints from industry and bipartisan criticism from lawmakers. Clearing out that backlog has been a priority of Trump's second-term EPA. Helping to lead that charge at the agency are several former chemical industry executives, lobbyists, and lawyers.

“We inherited a massive backlog of new chemical reviews from the Biden Administration which is getting in the way of projects as it pertains to data center and artificial intelligence projects,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement. “The Trump EPA wants to get out of the way and help speed up progress on these critical developments, as opposed to gumming up the works.”

As part of September's announcement, the EPA created instructions for companies to submit documentation showing that the chemical for which they are seeking expedited review is part of a “qualifying project.” Companies must prove that the substance they want reviewed more quickly will be used in data centers or “covered component projects.” That includes projects that add at least 100 megawatts to the electric grid or projects that “[protect] national security,” as well as any projects deemed applicable by the secretary of defense, the secretary of the interior, the secretary of commerce, or the secretary of energy.

In an email responding to questions about the new program, the EPA said that chemicals that meet the criteria would simply be fast-tracked to the front of the line.

“No part of the new chemicals review process will be skipped or bypassed for chemicals that meet the criteria for data center or covered component projects,” agency press secretary Brigit Hirsch said in an email. “The new chemical review process will be the same for these chemicals as it is for all other new chemical submissions, upholding the same high level of scientific integrity and maintaining the same thresholds for risk determinations.”

But Schweer fears that the new policy could be used by chemical manufacturers to drive through new or existing chemicals with little oversight.

“There are some really big loopholes in here to get chemicals through,” Schweer says. “If you've got some friend at the Department of Defense or the Department of Commerce, all you have to do is get that person to send a letter saying, ‘This is a qualifying project.' There's no proof involved.”

Political pressure to get a chemical approved, Schweer alleges, could also lead to sloppiness on the part of agency reviewers. “If you have to do things quickly, you look for shortcuts, and you don't always have time to look at all the data very well.”

Experts tell WIRED that physical data centers themselves are unlikely to be a major source of chemical applications under this new policy. Walter Leclerc, an independent health and safety consultant to the data center industry, points out that many of the chemicals currently used in data centers are already used in a variety of other industries. Most of those chemicals, including lubricants, fire suppressants, and water treatment chemicals, are not specific to data centers—they “are no different from [what's used in] Suzie and John's industrial business.” he says.

But there is one area of data center development where newer chemicals might be game changers. Keeping the equipment inside data centers cool is a huge component of their operating costs. One technique that can help cut these costs, called immersion cooling, involves dunking server racks and other machinery in a special liquid that does not conduct electricity. A subtype of immersion cooling, known as two-phase immersion cooling, takes this one step further. The liquid boils off into gas that then hits a coil, turns back into a liquid, and drips back into the tank.

These cooling techniques can reduce the need for fans, pumps, and other equipment, and can save data centers a lot of money in the long run on their electricity bills. The market for specialty cooling liquids for data centers has skyrocketed in recent years, with big names like Exxon and Shell getting into the game.

“Immersion cooling is the best,” Leclerc says. “The problem is it's got all the environmental effects.”

Some of the substances used in two-phase immersion cooling largely contain fluorine and carbon, which help create types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS). Colloquially called “forever chemicals” because of how long they persist in the environment, some of these chemicals have been linked to a wide variety of human health problems, from increased risk of cancer and reproductive issues to suppressed immune response. They have also been subject to increased regulation in recent years, with the EU proposing working towards what could be a particularly strict ban on PFAS. Several US states are also moving to restrict or eliminate the chemicals. (While the Trump administration has said that PFAS regulation is a priority, it has begun to roll back some Biden-era rules on some of these chemicals.)

Some bigger companies seem well aware of the risks of using forever chemicals in their cooling systems—especially following legal battles and settlements that have hurt PFAS producers like 3M, which has pledged to discontinue manufacturing and using PFAS this year. A study released in April, coauthored by Microsoft researchers, on the environmental life cycles of data center cooling techniques noted that “emerging PFAS regulations in the European Union and the United States” could “restrict” the use of two-phase immersion cooling.

While Microsoft has touted its research into two-phase cooling in the past, including a hyped-up pilot project at a data center in Washington, Microsoft spokesperson Donna Whitehead told WIRED that the company “is not currently using immersion cooling technologies in [its] data center operations.” Companies like Exxon and Shell, meanwhile, take care to advertise their cooling liquids—which are not used in two-phase cooling—as “PFAS-free.”

But at least one chemical giant—Chemours—has introduced new products for use in two-phase immersion in recent years. After developing a line of products that uses fluids containing fluoride, hydrogen, and carbon, which can be types of PFAS, Chemours collaborated with Samsung to test one liquid's performance earlier this year. In August the Delaware-based company said that “testing for subsequent generations will begin in the months ahead.” (While the chemical compounds being used in these products have not been linked to specific health effects, some scientists are concerned about forever chemicals as a larger class.) Chemours has emphasized in its sustainability reports that these fluids could help reduce the energy needed to cool data centers by up to 90 percent.

In public comments it submitted on the Trump administration's AI Action Plan, Chemours encouraged reforms to the new chemicals program in order to allow the country to “swiftly adopt new technologies that can drive [the US's] competitiveness globally.” According to a press release from 2023, the company's two-phase cooling liquids were originally targeted to be introduced to the market this year, “pending appropriate regulatory approvals.”

Chemours, which spun off from multinational chemical company DuPont in 2015, has agreed to pay out hundreds of millions of dollars worth of settlements related to PFAS pollution in recent years. The company, along with DuPont and other chemical companies, still faces a number of multinational lawsuits from cities, counties, and states over pollution from PFAS production.

In response to questions on its two-phase cooling products from WIRED, including whether or not the company planned to submit chemicals for fast-tracked consideration under the administration's new data center exemption, Chemours spokesperson Cassie Olszewski said the company is “in the process of commercializing our two-phase immersion cooling fluid, which will require relevant regulatory approvals.”

“Our work in this area has been focused on developing more sustainable and efficient cooling solutions that would allow data centers to consume less energy, water, and footprint while effectively managing the increasing amount of heat generated by the next generation of chips with higher processing power,” Olszewski said.

These chips could also be a significant source of new chemicals. Both Schweer and Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, a lawyer at environmental nonprofit Earthjustice, say that the semiconductor industry, which produces the chips that provide the computing power in data centers, stands to gain significantly from the expedited review process. The semiconductor manufacturing process uses forever chemicals at multiple different points of production, including in the crucial photolithography process, which uses light to transfer patterns to the surface of silicon wafers.

Schweer says that in his last few years working at the EPA, this industry submitted a large number of applications for new chemicals. Kalmuss-Katz says that semiconductor manufacturers “are a main driver of new chemicals.”

“The administration has this kind of AI-at-all-costs mindset, where you're rushing to build more and more data centers and chip fabs without any meaningful plan for dealing with their climate impacts, their natural resource impacts, and the toxic substances that are being used and released from these new facilities,” he says.

Lobbying documents show that the semiconductor industry has been asking for changes this year to the EPA's new-chemicals program. In March, Nancy Beck, a former policy director for an industry lobbyist group who now leads the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, the office that oversees new chemical reviews, met with representatives from SEMI, a global advocacy organization for the industry. The meeting was initially organized to discuss the “EPA's approach to regulations on PFAS and other chemicals that are essential to semiconductor manufacturing,” according to emails obtained by WIRED via a Freedom of Information Act request. Emails show that Beck suggested during the meeting that the lobbying group follow up with a public comment in support of changes to the new chemicals program, which the group sent over the next month in a letter. (""The Trump EPA encourages stakeholders to submit and document their comments on proposed rules so that we get a diverse array of perspectives,"" says Hirsch, the EPA spokesperson.)

“Making the United States the global capital of artificial intelligence (Al) … will depend on the country's ability to significantly expand domestic production of semiconductors and reshore large portions of the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain,” the letter from SEMI to Beck reads. “This can only be realized through a regulatory approach that effectively balances risk-based controls with ensuring access to chemicals that are vital to the production of semiconductors.” (SEMI declined to comment for this article.)

Companies don't have to develop data centers directly—or even components that go into data centers, like semiconductors—to benefit from the EPA's new policy. Both this summer's AI executive orders and the EPA's new policy open the door to fast-track chemicals far beyond those used only, or even primarily, within data centers. This, experts tell WIRED, could enable a wide variety of companies to try and get approval for their new products by linking them to data center construction.

“If [a company has] planned a data center, they're not gonna be waiting around for a new chemical to be approved by the agency,” Schweer says. “They should have everything they need ready to go. That doesn't mean that somebody won't use [the new policy] as an excuse to try to get some chemical through.”

Both Leclerc, the data center specialist, and Schweer support reforms to the new chemical review program and clearing the backlog of chemical reviews from the agency. But they both expressed concerns about the new data center policy.

Making it quicker and easier for chemicals to go through the EPA is “a pro-growth move,” Leclerc says. “But there's definitely long-term safety implications.”

Yesterday I wrote about a deal on the Nothing (1) Headset, an awesome pair of active noise-canceling headphones that compete with some of the best available options at a fraction of the price. For those who don't feel like compromising, and already have Apple devices, I also found a juicy discount on the Apple AirPods Max. That's right, Apple's biggest and baddest headphones are marked down to just $400 at both Best Buy and Amazon.

Even for the steep price tag, the audio quality on the AirPods Max is nothing short of incredible. When WIRED writer Parker Hall reviewed them initially, he called them “the best-sounding wireless headphones [he's] ever heard, and by a significant margin.” Even when stacked up against the big hitters from Bose and Sony, they have an impressively open soundstage, letting details shine in every genre, from highly-produced pop to soft jazz. The active noise canceling is extremely potent as well, with a pass-through mode that's sharp and clear.

As long as you're in the Apple ecosystem, these have an impressive level of features and excellent coordination between devices. Like most AirPods, simply hold them near your iPhone or iPad and they'll connect right away, no extensive pairing or app installations. Because they're always running in a low-power state, you can remove them from their little case or put them on your head, and they'll connect to the closest iOS device and start playing. It's a neat trick, but one that's always draining the battery slowly, so you may find them dead if you don't use them for too long.

While there have been occasional discounts on the headset, to my knowledge this is the lowest price yet for the updated USB-C model. It's matched only by a similar markdown on the older Lightning port version in July of 2024, just before the update, although this time there don't seem to be any rumors swirling about another update. While your availability may vary by location, as I write this all five colors are in stock and discounted at Best Buy, but Amazon is sold out of the orange.

There are Black Friday deals, and then there are Black Friday deals. Most deals are the kind that show up later on your porch from Amazon (see WIRED's guide to the best early Black Friday deals). But fixture and plumbing mainstay Kohler is doing something a little different, and a lot bigger, for the holidays.

After all, Kohler is big—one of the biggest family-owned manufacturing empires in the country. And the stuff it sells is big. And so Kohler's Black Friday sale likewise thinks big, offering discounts on life-changing bathroom and kitchen installations. Enter the promo code BFCM25, and you'll get 5 percent off bath and kitchen orders above $800, and 10 percent off orders bigger than $1,600.

Depending on the size of the kitchen or bathroom renovation you're gifting yourself for the holiday season, this can add up to a discount of hundreds of dollars.

Kohler wasn't always a bathroom giant. Back in the 1870s in Wisconsin, the company was founded as a farm implement company by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler (who looked a little like a husky Leo DiCaprio if you squint hard enough). But then a decade later, Kohler quite literally invented the bathtub—a clawfoot design still popular today among those with a yen for nostalgia. By the 1910s, according to their company history, Kohler also inaugurated the “integrated-apron” bathtub that's in more common use today.

So Kohler knows how to make a bathtub, is what we're saying—including a wide variety of hydrotherapy models—and handsome shower fixtures. Modern bathroom collections from Kohler include decor sets designed by lifestyle influencers like Jenn Lake or Jenni Yolo, as well as some people who are not named Jennifer.

But around the WIRED Reviews team, Kohler is mostly considered heroic because they make WIRED's favorite bidet priced for mere mortals. Which is to say, they make the best version of the most civilized domestic innovation of the current millennium.

Among kitchen fixtures, Kohler offers faucets, kitchen sinks, and lately a line of water filtration systems—including reverse-osmosis and two-stage sink filters designed for those worried about PFAS and microplastics.

But again, rather than offer discounts on any individual items, it's pretty much the whole kitchen setup that's on sale during Black Friday. This amounts to 5 percent off for total purchases of $800 or more, and 10 percent off on total purchases greater than $1,600.

With energy demand soaring — largely due to the growth of data centers supporting a burgeoning AI industry — concerns have arisen about where the nation will find the energy capacity to meet its power needs.

A new report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) argues that capacity can be found in the near- and medium-term, giving power providers the time they need to add infrastructure to the existing grid and meet longer-term electricity demand.

“However, such a solution will not arrive on its own,” wrote the author of the report, Robin Gaster, research director for ITIF's Center for Clean Energy in Washington, D.C. “Without significant action across multiple fronts and at substantial scale, the existing grid will come under increasing pressure — and we can expect a massive struggle for access.”

“Regulators will be caught between the sudden growth in demand and political pressure to service existing commercial and residential customers first, while keeping a lid on prices,” he explained.

One of the significant drivers of the growing electricity demand appears to be data centers, the report noted, prompting calls to slow their growth or even prevent them from connecting to the grid altogether.

“Slowing data center growth or prohibiting grid connection is a short-sighted approach that embraces a scarcity mentality,” argued Wannie Park, CEO and founder of Pado AI, an energy management and AI orchestration company, in Malibu, Calif.

“The explosive growth of AI and digital infrastructure is a massive engine for economic, scientific, and industrial progress,” he told TechNewsWorld. “The focus should not be on stifling this essential innovation, but on making data centers active, supportive participants in the energy ecosystem.”

“Data centers are the engine of the AI economy, but they can't be passive loads anymore,” he said. “Data centers can and should be active partners that contribute to grid stability and resilience, not just consume power. Prohibiting growth would simply limit the innovation needed to solve the power crunch in the first place.”

The reality is the U.S. has dramatically underinvested in long-term grid upgrades and planning, maintained Scotty Embley, an associate with Hi-Tequity, a data center development and investment firm, in Melbourne Beach, Fla. Slowing data center builds equates to slowing vital applications such as banking, federal, health care, and transportation, he told TechNewsWorld.

However, he acknowledged that early coordination with utilities is necessary to ensure new facility locations are strategically planned and responsibly powered, where adequate grid support is available.

Instead of restricting data center development, the focus should be on smarter integration with the grid, added Allan Schurr, chief commercial officer at Enchanted Rock, a provider of natural gas-powered microgrids, in Houston.

Planning for the full lifecycle of a data center's power needs — from construction through long-term operations — is essential, he continued. This approach includes having solutions in place that can keep facilities operational during periods of limited grid availability, major weather events, or unexpected demand pressures, he said.

Schurr explained that on-site generation, including natural gas microgrids, can provide bridge power during interconnection delays, flexible capacity to support grid-constrained regions, and dependable backup power when the grid is stressed or offline. With this type of coordinated approach, data centers can continue to grow while strengthening, not straining, our power infrastructure, he contended.

Data centers are the source of the information for anything we do on the internet, added Arie Brish, a business professor at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. They must be up 24/7. These facilities are not like a laundry operation that can be limited to off-hours.

He also noted that the importance of continuity in data center operations requires that they have backups of local generators. These local generators can indeed be used to feed the facilities during peak hours, thus balancing grid demand, he told TechNewsWorld.

Rick Bentley, CEO of HydroHash, a crypto-mining company focused on clean energy and high-efficiency operations, in Albuquerque, N.M., recommended that data center operators avoid the grid entirely. That saves the data center massive costs in both regulations and fees, he told TechNewsWorld.

Once they are on the grid, their power can be curtailed during times of high demand to make sure the heat stays on in people's homes during a cold snap, hospitals stay operational, and A/C works during a heat wave, he explained.

The ITIF report also called for the United States to squeeze more power from the existing grid without negatively impacting customers, while also building new capacity.

New technology can increase supply from existing transmission lines and generators, the report explained, which can bridge the transition to an expanded physical grid.

On the demand side, it added, there is spare capacity, but not at peak times. It suggested that large users, such as data centers, be encouraged to shift their demand to off-peak periods, without damaging their customers. Grids do some of that already, it noted, but much more is needed.

Up to 40% of data centers' needs are not highly time sensitive, so they can be partners in managing peak demand by proactively shifting some of their use to different times and even different geographies, it reasoned.

Ironically, AI, a significant driver of data center power usage, can also help squeeze more electricity from the existing grid.

We need to map energy delivery with the same supply chain visibility we apply to national defense — using AI to map where power is wasted, where infrastructure is stalled due to fragile supply chains and where capacity is trapped behind inefficient legacy systems, Brandon Daniels, CEO of Exiger, a developer of AI-powered risk, compliance and supply chain management solutions, in McLean, Va., told TechNewsWorld.

Pado's Park agreed that one of the best ways to maximize existing grid capacity is to leverage software and AI/ML to balance power supply and demand better. Implementing orchestrated demand through advanced software for demand-side flexibility can intelligently coordinate large, flexible loads — like data centers — with grid signals, he noted.

The primary challenge is the speed of deployment and regulatory lag, he said. Data center growth is moving at an unprecedented pace, and traditional utility planning and regulatory approval processes struggle to keep up, for good reasons.

Additionally, he continued, data centers operate under stringent reliability requirements, aka “five nines,” which create technical and contractual hurdles to integrating load flexibility at scale.

Embley, of Hi-Tequity, asserted that the U.S. can squeeze more capacity from the existing grid by putting underutilized or stranded power to work — whether through repurposing industrial sites that already have heavy electrical infrastructure or tapping idle substations and interconnects built for past manufacturing loads.

These approaches deliver relief far faster than building new transmission, he explained. The challenge is that grid stress is already the top obstacle utilities cite, and major upgrades move on decade-long timelines. Interconnection queues continue to grow, and even when capacity exists on paper, critical equipment like transformers and switchgear carry 12- to 24-month lead times, which often slow projects more than construction itself.

He added that computing density has changed dramatically as the use of artificial intelligence continues to soar. Today's AI clusters draw 30 to 60 kilowatts per cabinet, two to three times the load of legacy CPU racks, overwhelming the electrical and thermal systems built for a different era, he explained.

At the same time, grid expansion, interconnection, and long-lead electrical equipment operate on decade-long timelines, while AI demand is rising on year-long timelines.

That mismatch, he said, not a lack of ambition or innovation, is what's driving the current power crunch.

                                What happens here matters everywhere                                


by Taylor Soper on Nov 26, 2025 at 8:00 amNovember 26, 2025 at 6:53 am

Jonathan Duncan has applied to roughly 200 jobs since getting laid off in May after working at Microsoft for more than two decades. The response has been silence.

“Not a squeak,” Duncan told GeekWire. He's tried adapting resumes for each role, subscribing to job alerts, networking with peers, and internal referrals. Nothing has worked.

He's not alone. Experienced tech professionals across the industry are learning they're not immune to Big Tech's widespread layoffs — and that finding a new job isn't as easy as it used to be.

For years, tech workers were told there was a talent shortage. Recruiters chased them. But in 2025, leaders who built their whole careers on growing headcount and mastering organizational processes are getting “mowed down right now in stunning numbers,” said Laura Close, CEO of Close Cohen, a job search and executive coaching firm.

Close said some “super high-value professionals” she works with are taking 12-to-18 months to find a new job. 

“The golden age of the quick turnaround is over,” she said.

And in an industry that “equates youth with innovation and stamina,” Close said longtime workers are finding that their previous success metrics are no longer valued — decades of expertise have become liabilities, not assets.

“What we're seeing right now is ageism on steroids,” Close said. She noted that in tech, age-related bias often begins as early as 40 — earlier than many assume. 

A cooling market

Allison Shrivastava, an economist with Indeed, said it's difficult for anyone trying to get hired — from new college grads to more veteran workers.

“If you've been trying to get a job or change jobs in a tech-related field, you're probably really, really struggling,” she said. 

While unemployment broadly remains low, the amount of time that people remain unemployed is increasing, Shrivastava said.

More than 114,000 tech workers have been laid off this year so far, compared to nearly 153,000 workers in 2024 and nearly 265,000 in 2023, according to Layoffs.fyi. The pace has slowed from 2023's peak, but the cuts continue.

Seattle-area tech giants Microsoft and Amazon have announced major workforce reductions in 2025. Both companies are investing heavily in AI infrastructure while emphasizing efficiency.

As a senior manager at Microsoft, Duncan said budgets were recently slashed across the board — training, travel, morale-building. When people left, they weren't replaced. Every quarter brought new demands to return unspent funds.

He also noticed what he calls “underleveling” — senior director roles being posted at lower levels than before, manager positions offered at what used to be individual contributor levels.

“I think the days of high-paying tech jobs are drying up,” he said.

Shrivastava said the current layoffs are likely a “shedding” from a massive over-hire during the post-pandemic tech boom, not necessarily an AI restructuring story. 

But at the same time, as The Wall Street Journal reported, many companies are betting that AI can help them grow — without growing headcount.

‘Who am I?‘

For many of these workers, the timing couldn't be worse with aging parents, kids heading to college, and retirement on the horizon.

“I consider this the most expensive time of my life,” Duncan said. His eldest son is a sophomore in college, and his youngest starts next fall. He's also pricing out family plans for insurance for the first time.

And then there's the stock compensation. When Duncan was laid off, he had hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of unvested Microsoft shares.

“That was the kids' college funds,” he said. 

Nancy Poznoff, an executive coach at Close Cohen, said financial pressure is compounding an identity crisis for many laid-off executives.

“They've been high performers their whole career,” Poznoff said. “They've followed all the rules. They've done what they were supposed to do. And now they're suddenly having this identity crisis on top of it, because a lot of them have been at their company for so long, they have this fear around, ‘How do I operate when I'm not at Amazon?' Like, ‘Who am I?'”

“So you've got this financial pressure, and then you've got this ego bomb,” she added. “It's a really tough time.”

Duncan still talks to his former teammates at Microsoft. The stress inside, he says, is brutal. He's not sure he'd want to go back — even if he could.

Angus Norton, a former Microsoft and Amazon exec, recently wrote about the toll of perpetual layoffs on those who remain.

“It creates a hierarchy of fear. Everyone becomes a potential target. Everyone knows someone who was let go despite stellar performance,” he wrote. “The message is clear: no one is safe.”

For Cyriac Lefort, the idea for his new startup, MyHair AI, came two years ago.  The French native was sitting in a hair salon in New York getting a routine haircut when his hairdresser looked at him and said, “You're starting to lose a bit of hair,” Lefort, who is 32, recalls being told.  

“He didn't say that to my friend sitting next to me, just to me,” Lefort continued. “In my mind, I wasn't balding, and I still don't think I am. But when someone tells you you're losing your hair, you buy whatever they suggest.” 

So, he bought the shampoo the hairdresser suggested and left thinking that anyone could sell a man anything by telling him that he's losing his hair. “Hair loss is such an emotional topic for men and women,” he said.  

That interaction sent him down a rabbit hole where he discovered how confusing the hair loss industry is, with so much misinformation and clinics with unverified reviews. (He later went to a hair doctor who told him he was, in fact, not balding.)

Lefort wanted to create a product that, using AI, would help men diagnose hair loss.

Lefort is a serial entrepreneur, having exited one company and currently running two others with Tilen Babnik, who is 28. The duo decided to team up and build a third company: MyHair AI. They vibe coded the product in just a few weeks. It works like this: Users take photos of their heads and upload them to the MyHair app. The AI technology analyzes those photos to measure hair density and detect early signs of hair loss.

Over time, as a user uploads more photos, the AI tracks the evolution of their hair loss, letting people build personalized hair loss-protection routines. Users can also find specialists or discover clinics through the platform and read verified reviews so they do not get scammed. 

“Our AI tells you what's really happening with your hair, matches you with products that actually make sense for your hair type, and explains the science behind them, including possible side effects,” Lefort said. “By bringing transparency and medical accuracy to this $50 billion market, we believe we can completely reorganize how people understand, treat, and shop for hair health.”  

It took around a year of ideation, a few weeks of vibe coding on Cursor, a few months of scientific and clinical validation, and a few more weeks of building a consumer app for the duo to be ready to launch MyHair.AI. The company launched this summer.  

“We didn't hire anyone for the initial prototype; it was fully vibe coded,” he said, adding that now that the product has grown, their engineers handle the code to ensure it's solid and scalable. MyHair AI is one of the many examples of how fast startups can build these days with the rise of vibe-coding prototypes.

Lefort said the product already has more than 1,000 paying subscribers and 200,000 user accounts. The app has analyzed more than 300,000 scalp photos and has partnerships letting specialists and clinics have access to MyHair AI so they can evaluate their own patients faster. On Wednesday, the company announced that Dr. Tess, a renowned dermatologist, is joining the company's board.  

Others in the market notably include Hims. Lefort said MyHair is different than others because the product is one of the few that's built a dedicated AI model, trained on more than 300,000 hair images, to diagnose baldness — rather than using a more generic LLM to do so.

Lefort said the company is now focused on expansion. It wants to build a booking platform and partner with more clinics. He's hoping to build AI that works in the “real world.”

“Men worry about two things in their health, sexual dysfunction and hair loss,” Lefort said. “We address one of the biggest day-to-day concerns.”

Several public websites designed to allow courts across the United States and Canada to manage the personal information of potential jurors had a simple security flaw that easily exposed their sensitive data, including names and home addresses, TechCrunch has exclusively learned.

A security researcher, who asked not to be named for this story, contacted TechCrunch with details of the easy-to-exploit vulnerability, and identified at least a dozen juror websites made by government software maker Tyler Technologies that appear to be vulnerable, given that they run on the same platform. 

The sites are all over the country, including California, Illinois, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.

Tyler told TechCrunch that it is fixing the flaw after we alerted the company to the information exposures.

The bug meant it was possible for anyone to obtain the information about jurors who are selected for service. To log into these platforms, a juror is provided a unique numerical identifier assigned to them, which could be brute-forced since the number was sequentially incremental. The platform also did not have any mechanism to prevent anyone from flooding the login pages with a large number of guesses, a feature known as “rate-limiting.”

In early November, the security researcher told TechCrunch that they identified at least one jury management portal for a county in Texas as vulnerable. Inside that portal, TechCrunch saw full names, dates of birth, occupation, email addresses, cell phone numbers, and home and mailing addresses.

Other exposed data included information shared in the questionnaires that potential jurors are required to fill out to see if they are qualified to serve on a jury.

In the portal seen by TechCrunch, the questions asked about the person's gender, ethnicity, education level, employer, marital status, children, if the person was a citizen, whether they were older than 18, and whether they have been convicted or faced indictment for a theft or felony. 

The vulnerability could have exposed personal health data inside a juror's profile in some cases. For example, if a juror had requested to be exempted from service for health reasons, they may have disclosed what medical reason they think disqualifies them. TechCrunch saw an example of that, too.

TechCrunch alerted Tyler of the issue on November 5. Tyler acknowledged the vulnerability on November 25.

In a statement, Tyler spokesperson Karen Shields said that the company's security team confirmed “a vulnerability exists where some juror information may have been accessible via a brute force attack.”

“We have developed a remediation to prevent unauthorized access and are communicating next steps with our clients,” the statement said.

The spokesperson did not respond to a series of follow-up questions, including whether Tyler has the technical means to determine if there was any malicious access to jurors' personal information, and whether it plans to notify people whose data was exposed. 

This is not the first time Tyler left sensitive personal data exposed on the internet. In 2023, a security researcher found that, due to a separate security flaw, some U.S. online court record systems exposed sealed, confidential, and sensitive data, such as witness lists and testimony, mental health evaluations, detailed allegations of abuse, and corporate trade secrets. 

In that case, Tyler fixed vulnerabilities in its Case Management System Plus product, which was used across the state of Georgia. 

Two other government technology providers were exposing data in that case: Catalis, through its CMS360 product, a system used across several U.S. states; and Henschen & Associates, through its CaseLook court record system, used in Ohio.

A year after launching a commercial robotaxi service in Abu Dhabi, Chinese autonomous vehicle technology company WeRide and partner Uber can finally call that service driverless.

The companies said the commercial robotaxi service, which will no longer have a human safety operator behind the wheel, is open to the public and will start with routes on Yas Island, a tourist district that is home to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix Formula 1 racing circuit.

Robotaxi operations in Abu Dhabi will work similarly to Uber's partnership with Waymo in Austin.

Uber riders that select Uber Comfort or UberX in Abu Dhabi may be matched with a WeRide robotaxi. Riders who want to increase their chances of being matched with a fully autonomous vehicle can select the “Autonomous” option in the Uber app. Uber and WeRide are also working with fleet operator partner Tawasul. 

The launch comes a month after WeRide secured a federal permit from the United Arab Emirates to conduct fully driverless robotaxi commercial operations. WeRide and Uber plan to extend driverless services to cover additional areas in Abu Dhabi's city center.

“Today's fully autonomous launch in Abu Dhabi represents a historic transportation milestone, as the first driverless AV deployment outside of the U.S. or China,” Sarfraz Maredia, Uber's head of autonomous mobility and delivery, said in a statement. 

Uber has spent the past two years locking up partnerships with 20 autonomous vehicle technology companies in various countries, including the United States, Europe, and the Middle East.

Those partnerships have expanded beyond the realm of robotaxis as well. Uber's deals span the full range of self-driving applications, including delivery and trucking. This year alone, it announced partnerships with Ann Arbor, Michigan-based May Mobility and Volkswagen, Chinese self-driving firms Momenta, Pony.ai, and Baidu, as well as a recent deal to create a premium robotaxi service using Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with a self-driving system from San Francisco-based startup Nuro.

These deals are finally beginning to materialize into commercial services. For instance, Uber and Waymo launched a robotaxi service earlier this year in Austin. Now, Uber has expanded to the Middle East with WeRide in Abu Dhabi — with even more cities to come, including Dubai.

Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi forecast in the company's third-quarter earnings report that there would be autonomous vehicle deployments on the Uber network in at least 10 cities by the end of 2026. 

Uber and WeRide have previously shared plans to expand to 15 cities throughout the Middle East and Europe, eventually scaling to thousands of robotaxis. That would represent a massive leap for WeRide, which today has more than 150 robotaxis in the region.

Major tech companies aren't just using AI to help you generate or summarize content — they also want you to use it for shopping. OpenAI, Google, and Amazon have heavily invested in AI assistants that research new product categories for you and suggest the right ones to buy.

Startups like Perplexity, Daydream, and Cherry have also built businesses around AI for product discovery. All these efforts have resulted in customers using more AI for shopping. Onton (previously known as Deft), an AI-powered furniture shopping platform, says it has seen its user base grow from 50,000 monthly active users to over 2 million monthly active users, serving millions of searches and image generations.

Fueled by this growth, the startup announced today that it has raised $7.5 million in a new funding round led by Footwork, with participation from Liquid 2, Parable Ventures, and 43, among others. This round brings the startup's total funding to approximately $10 million.

Using this funding, the company wants to expand into new categories such as apparel and then eventually consumer electronics.

The company rebranded from Deft to Onton earlier this year, citing confusion around the original name and difficulty securing a premium domain.

Zach Hudson, co-founder of Onton, says that while large language models (LLMs) are good at guessing probable intent, they have not solved many problems in e-commerce. He added that the startup has observed that the average time a consumer takes to make a purchase decision has increased.

For its core technology, the company uses what's called neuro-symbolic architecture. Hudson said that with this approach, the company can eliminate the hallucination problems of LLMs and provide better, logical search results. He added that the startup's model can also learn information from the real world that might not necessarily be included in a product description.

“Let's say you are looking for furniture that is pet-friendly. Our tools know that if the item has polyester in it, it would be more stain and scratch-resistant, so it would be more pet-friendly. Our tools learn these things through every single search and become smarter at a faster rate,” Hudson said.

He added that often, when you search for a product that might be called different things on different sites, you don't get great results. The company's AI model takes those scenarios into consideration while presenting results.

Onton has added different input methods and features to help people with their short and long-term decisions. You can now upload an image or add a prompt to generate what you want to achieve with your house or office setup, and Onton can find you furniture based on that.

Onton also offers an infinite canvas with image generation, where you can add existing images along with the products you find for ideation. You can also add images of your room and ask the tool to furnish it.

The company feels that rather than stick to a chat-only approach, these features will give consumers more options to get to what they want, even if they don't know how to describe it perfectly. 

The startup said that with these approaches, it has been able to convert customers 3-5x more than traditional e-commerce sites, as they can trust the underlying data. 

Hudson noted that because of the technological and interface changes it made, it will be easier to launch apparel. The company is building its catalog for the category and plans to launch the vertical soon. In this category, it will face competition from companies like Daydream, Aesthetic, and Style.ai.

The company has grown from three full-time employees in 2023 to 10 now, with plans to expand the team to 15 people by hiring engineers and researchers.

Compare that to something with no real off-ramp: testosterone replacement therapy. Once you're on TRT, you can permanently suppress your body's own testosterone production, and many men won't produce enough on their own afterward.

Bariatric surgery shows 25-65% significant regain rates depending on definition and timeframe. And regular dieting is even worse. Nobody would frame that as a safety issue. That's... just how weight loss works, not a unique GLP-1 problem.Calling a return of symptoms (obesity) a ""safety issue"" is like saying insulin has ""no safe off-ramp"" because diabetics get hyperglycemic when they stop taking it.Fear gets clicks, I guess.

The testes atrophy over time when LH and FSH are suppressed. Even if LH and FSH return (which isn't guaranteed) the testes need to be able to respond to those hormonal signals, but atrophied testes do not respond the same.For someone with true intractable hypogonadism this hardly matters because they weren't capable anyway. Many people prescribed TRT today don't actually have intractable hypogonadism, though.Body builders have some tricks to try to reverse this, but it's not perfectly effective and even body builders know to cycle their steroids to avoid having prolonged periods of suppressed HPG axis activity. I was involved with weightlifting in my younger years but never dabbled with steroids or TRT. Everyone I know who did try testosterone or steroids thought they were doing it the safe way (HCG, PCT, limited cycle length) but became unable to produce enough endogenous testosterone by their 40s even with SERMs.Men on TRT for years will have considerable testicular atrophy that is not totally reversible.> The question is, why would someone with clinical hypogonadism cease TRT?TRT is no longer limited to men with clinical hypogonadism. Men's health clinics that advertise on social media, TV, and radio will prescribe to anyone who contacts them (and pays cash for the prescription and gear). In some surveys of patients on TRT, 1/4 of patients didn't even have testosterone levels measured prior to initiation of TRT.

That's hugely problematic if true. They should be investigated and if found of wrongdoing, have their medical licenses revoked.

Some of the clinics were even prescribing anabolic steroids intended for terminal cancer patients.If you want to read about something even crazier, look up the services that were started during COVID to be prescription mills for Adderall or Xanax. The relaxed COVID prescribing rules allowed telehealth providers to give schedule II prescriptions to new patients remotely, so services were created to advertise on TikTok and give prescriptions for a monthly fee. The FDA cracked down on these, though.There's even a famous story of a whistleblower who worked at one of these clinics and got reprimanded for not prescribing Adderall enough. There was a leaked memo where they pushed providers to prescribe Adderall over other options because their data showed the highest customer retention rate that way.

However my mind is failing to grasp what long-term damage TRT can do to the HPTA when not using an obscene amount of gear and on HCG.Trying to figure out the mechanism. Perhaps receptor desensitization and epigenetic compensatory changes?

Studies of TRT patients have even shown that 1/4 of TRT patients may not have had their testosterone levels measured before being prescribed TRT: (Source https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6406807/ ) Completely unacceptable given how cheap testosterone testing is, but its happening.TRT clinics have also become a big business. Their business model relies on prescribing TRT to anyone and then charging them monthly or quarterly to continue receiving those prescriptions, which as the parent comment noted become physically necessary after TRT causes the testes to atrophy.The trick the clinics are using now is “diagnosing by symptoms”. They have a long list of “symptoms of low T” and the patient is basically prompted to check off enough boxes to justify TRT. It's the same model as the medical marijuana card businesses where you can go in and the doctor will “find” a reason to give you the prescription.It's a real problem when combined with social media influencers who tell people that everything is a symptom of low testosterone and TRT will fix it.

You can't really diagnose by levels, though, unless you knew what that person's previous levels were. Setting an average across a population is not really realistic - you can't say Shaq should work to the same levels as, say, Emo Phillips.TRT is normally used due to aging, though, so you are unlikely to have your testosterone levels spontaneously recover as you get older. You do tend to need to be on it for life, in the same way that women stay on HRT.However, if you did need to get off, bodybuilders have ""post cycle therapies"" to kick start production so it seems to be possible.

The TRT clinics are ignoring levels or even not testing at all. They'll find an excuse to prescribe to someone even who has clinically high levels because they want the monthly recurring revenue from keeping that customer for life.

I'm not going to say TRT clinics are the best actors here, but to an actual endocrinologist, diagnosing hormone issues isn't so simple as looking at single point-in-time measurement of total testosterone.Testosterone levels naturally vary even for a given individual - two readings at the same time of day on different days even a short period apart can be dramatically different - and that's not even taking into consideration the fact that total testosterone levels aren't the sole (or even primary) mechanism for diagnosing androgenic endocrine issues.

TRT cessation does not inherently cause men to have suppressed hormone levels after. With precautions and extra steps like HCG to maintain leydig cell/testicular function, preventing atrophy, one may safeguard against that risk.Coming off TRT, yes you will have lower levels as your HPTA has been suppressed by exogenous hormones. One may speed up this recovery using ""PCT"" (post cycle therapy), which involves taking a SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulator, e.g. enclomiphene) to resensitize and restart your HPTA. However this is not always necessary, and if one takes a look at the HARLEM study, most users return to their baseline levels within a year of going cold turkey.In the cases of true permanently lowered levels of hormones, I believe the two most common reasons are: using other AAS besides testosterone (1) and lifestyle or health factors that correlate with the need to be on TRT (2).With 1, this can be seen in users of decadurabolin (deca), which notoriously has hormone receptor active metabolites that last around for atleast a year, continuously suppressing the system. Or trenbolone (tren/cattle bulking hormone) which is inherently neurally and endocrinically otherwise toxic.With 2, you hop on TRT because there is some reason your hormones are not at healthy levels. Whatever the reason is, it is still there, and once you've stopped bandaiding the issue its effects resurface.---I have also used many GLP-1s (semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide). No there is no off-ramp, but the only effects I've noticed are a return to my baseline of appetite, and neurological state.N.B. GLP-1s are good for impulse and behavioral disorders like ADHD, which it did help. However, I have decided to not take it due to the negative effects on personality and reward seeking behavior.They are neuro-active in the brain, and their effects I've decided are not worth it.

1. There is an off ramp for TRTs but some people have, “true permanently lowered levels of hormones.”2. For GLP-1s, “there is no off-ramp, but the only effects I've noticed are a return to my baseline.”To clarify my original post, I consider the ability to return to baseline to mean there is an off-ramp and permanently impacted to mean there is no off-ramp.

The struggle doesn't stop when you stop losing. My personal experience was that it takes about 2 years for the new 'normal' to kick in. (I lost 60lbs when I was in my early 20s and kept it off until today. The 'after' period was as taxing as the 'losing' period, but in a different way)At that point only can you 'relax' a bit around your body's cravings for calories.This has already been studied extensively:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5764193/It's not the worst thing in the world to be on a medication for a couple years rather than a few months, but long-term study of this class of drugs is certainly warranted and necessary.

So weight loss was actually maintained for most people -- the hard part is finding a healthy daily lifestyle which can maintain the drastic effects of GLP1s.This information isn't new -- weight regain has been studied before and I've written about it before:https://glp1.guide/content/do-people-regain-all-the-weight-l...The missing piece to this article is just how bad the alternative is -- never having the cardiovascular and metabolic benefits is clearly not the best strategy (and if simply changing patterns was so easy, people would have done it already).GLP1s don't work for everyone but they're pretty close to miraculous in effect given the balance of positive and negative side effects. Making GLP1s cheaper & more tolerable then figuring out how to actually deal with the complex web of how to keep the weight off sustainably for most people seems like the right way forward here, not avoiding potentially life-saving medication because you may not be able to get off of it as fast as you want (if you can afford it).BTW, there is already generic Liraglutide, and legal workarounds for getting compounded Semaglutide that already mean no one pays the $1000 that was in the zeitgeist a while ago. Even Lilly Direct and similar outfits from Novo sell for $500/month, with the $150/month pricing coming soon[0].[0]: https://glp1guide.substack.com/p/negotiations-are-underway-f...

There's also the perverse incentives wrt broader society. Enabling the average person to control their physical health is orders of magnitude better for society and orders of magnitude less profitable than the current trends.Maybe a setup where glp drugs are nationalized and only used to further understand why we have an obesity epidemic and eventually finance changes to combat it? Ideally the drug makers would do this without requiring government intervention, but I doubt they will.

* Almost everyone has access to a wide variety of delicious food, which we on average enjoy eating more of than is required to maintain a healthy weight.* We don't want the government to forcibly restrict people's food access.* Research consistently shows that voluntary portion control works occasionally in the short term and not at all in the long term.* Many people have proposed specific ingredients or nutrient classes that can be adjusted in a person's diet to resolve obesity, but none to date have checked out.In principle, I suppose, there could be some crazy diet hack we don't yet know about.

Japan does not have an obesity epidemic. The US has an extreme obesity epidemic. There does not seem to be any good genetical explanation, there might be cultural based behavioral explanations, but Japanese communities in the US are also more obese than ones in Japan (although less obese than the general US population).So it is clearly entirely possible for a society to have plenty of easily accessible delicious food, with no major government restrictions in place, and not have an obesity crisis. And there seems to be some particularly bad environmental and/or cultural factor in the US driving the abnormally bad obesity epidemic there, and no intervention before GLP-1 has managed to reverse the trend (not that there have been many). There are a lot of theories about this topic, but no clear scientific consensus beyond ""all very sweet things are probably maybe bad"".PS: I am aware that Japans ""fat-tax"" exists and is technically a form governement restriction, but I would assume that it plays a relatively minor role overall.

Yes, you can loose weight without it, I did, I'm even in the healthy range now.No, you don't have to, if you need medicine help, take it.When I lost weight, I had my first real job that I liked so much, it didn't felt like one, 11 weeks of vacation per year, a nice enough apartment I couldn't be evicted of, great emotional support and advices and support from a doctor.The only thing draining my willpower every day was the calorie restriction, and nothing else to worry about.If you're in a similar spot I was, maybe trying a diet without glp-1 is better since we don't have any long term study on it yet, but if you're not: obesity will destroy your body more than any long term side effects can. Please take them if you can afford it.The only thing I earned beside uncomfort and pain when I lost weight without drugs are internet points on hacker news, and the ability to say 'i did it' (also glp-1 didn't exist, so less long term health issues from obesity). Honestly if I had to redo it, I would take the drug despite a similar situation. Weight loss is hard, and not being able to do it without help is not an indictment on you or your character, but on your situation.

Calorie restriction works up to a certain point, and weirdly the benefits aren't linear, and almost flat for visceral fat(i.e: if you're using 2.6 kcal a day and eating 2.4 kcal, you will loose roughly the same amount of visceral fat than if you only ate 1.8kcal, and slightly more 'external' fat (that one you shouldn't care much if you're only interested in health)).Calorie expenditure works linearly though, but it's hard to out-exercise your diet, and exercise while obese can be dangerous (my ankles still have to be reinforced despite me being under 24 BMI)

I suspect the manufacturers view this as a feature not a bug. :-) More seriously, I find the article's conclusions to be pretty much what I'd expect. Most medicines aren't permanent cures and obesity results from a variety of factors with lifestyle and diet being major elements.I was seriously obese for decades and about 9 years ago, hovering on the edge of becoming diabetic and other serious obesity-related health issues (high BP, IBS/GERDS, chronic apnea, etc), I decided I had to do something. GLP-1's weren't available then but none of the other typical approaches, including medically supervised diets worked more than a few months. Doing my own research, I discovered keto (this was before keto became big) and decided to try it. It was hard at first but also remarkably effective. I lost over 100 pounds in 8 months, becoming fit and seeing abs for the first time in my life. As I lost the weight, all the other health issues resolved too. But I knew if I returned to my previous diet and habits, I'd eventually grow obese again. Many people will take GLP-1s, lose weight but then stop and regain the weight because they didn't change their underlying behavior. Just like many people do with dieting, keto or any other intervention. But any intervention that works can be an invaluable for the few willing to understand, use it as a tool and do the work.I stayed strict keto for 5 years. Long enough to train my body and mind how to be fit and healthy as normal (not a temporary diet). Then I started a rigorous process of gradually transitioning away from strict keto over a period of two years and that's also worked. I still eat a pretty low carb diet averaging less than 100g or less a day and will for life because there is no ""Eat whatever junk you want and stay fit"", at least for my metabolism. Reading that article, the criticisms of GLP-1s would also apply to keto or just ""eat less, move more"". If you stop the intervention, the system returns to state. However, for me keto helped me break an insidious pattern driven by habit, metabolism and blood sugar levels. I was then able to adopt new patterns. I suspect GLP-1s could help others in a similar way. Obviously, there is no magic drug that ""cures"" obesity by making you immune to bad habits and the physics of calories in/calories out.

You don't say ;-) I lost 50 lbs and have kept it off for the past year while maintaining great BP. But I'm under no illusions GLP-1 medications don't have dangers and cause problems for many. It should be handled on an individual basis like any serious medication.That said, is someone losing a lot of weight then gaining half of it back worse than them just staying where they were? I don't know the answer to that one.

I think the intuition many people have--which I am not at all defending as correct, but it certainly isn't so obviously wrong that we should scoff at someone for thinking it works this way--is more like ""if my weight was stable before I did this intervention, I just need to lose the weight and then my weight will once again be stable after it""; in this mental model, one would assume you only need lots of willpower to lose weight: after, you only will need as much willpower as you already know you have to not gain it back, as it isn't as if you are gaining weight currently.

There's of course a risk that when they stop the drugs that hunger will drive them to re-establish those habits, but now that they have new habits that fight that hunger they are in a much better position to resist it than they were when they'd initially established their eating patterns.

RealPage made it so that landlords were less competitive and more cooperative. Landlords would share proprietary information and then RealPage would help them all set prices collectively. It's just old fashioned price fixing with a SaaS and an algorithm.So the difference is using pricing info to beat your competitors vs using pricing info to collude with your competitors.

The way competitors legally message each other to suggest a price increase is via the prices themselves.E.g. an airline wants to raise the price of a ticket from New York to Los Angeles from $500 to $530 -- and they secretly want the other airlines to follow them and raise their prices too.1) The airline submits the price increase to the global travel reservation system that all airlines can see. All the other airlines have computers constantly monitoring all the other airlines' ticket prices and can instantly adjust prices in response.2) The airline that wants the price increase waits to see how the other airlines respond.  Either (1) the competitor airlines keeps their lower prices to ""take market share"" -- or -- (2) they also raise their prices to match which ""maintains status quo of market share"" but all competitors get to take advantage of charging the higher price3) If the other airlines don't match the higher price, the airline that ""proposed"" the higher price then rolls it back to $500.  All this can happen within a few hours.That's the way competitors ""collude"" to raise prices out in the open.  The publicly visible prices are the messaging system.  The loophole here is that the changing prices must be visible because the potential passengers buying the tickets need to see them too.The above scenario has been studied by various papers and the government.  The prices simultaneously act as both a ""cost to buy"" and as a ""message to cooperate"".Legal ""collusion"" via price signals is easier in concentrated industries with few competitors (e.g. airlines).  It's harder for fragmented markets or markets with hundreds-to-thousands of competitors.  E.g. a barbershop wanting to raise the price of haircuts by $5 isn't going to get the hundred other barbershops to also raise their prices by $5.

Either (1) the competitor airlines keeps their lower prices to ""take market share"" -- or -- (2) they also raise their prices to match which ""maintains status quo of market share"" but all competitors get to take advantage of charging the higher price3) If the other airlines don't match the higher price, the airline that ""proposed"" the higher price then rolls it back to $500.  All this can happen within a few hours.That's the way competitors ""collude"" to raise prices out in the open.  The publicly visible prices are the messaging system.  The loophole here is that the changing prices must be visible because the potential passengers buying the tickets need to see them too.The above scenario has been studied by various papers and the government.

It's harder for fragmented markets or markets with hundreds-to-thousands of competitors.  E.g. a barbershop wanting to raise the price of haircuts by $5 isn't going to get the hundred other barbershops to also raise their prices by $5.

1. How is this any different than other sorts of transactions that occur on a recurring basis? For instance dog walking services or personal trainers? Such vendors are also presumably pricing their services based on what everyone else's pricing is, but any subsequent price changes aren't public.2. Under current competition law, whether something is an ""open market"" is irrelevant to whether a given pricing strategy is illegal or not. Collusion doesn't magically become legal because it's done on the open market.

MIT Technology Review's highly subjective take on the latest buzz about AI

Separating AI reality from hyped-up fiction isn't always easy. That's why we've created the AI Hype Index—a simple, at-a-glance summary of everything you need to know about the state of the industry.

Last year, the fantasy author Joanna Maciejewska went viral (if such a thing is still possible on X) with a post saying “I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can do art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that I can do my laundry and dishes.” Clearly, it struck a chord with the disaffected masses.Regrettably, 18 months after Maciejewska's post, the entertainment industry insists that machines should make art and artists should do laundry. The streaming platform Disney+ has plans to let its users generate their own content from its intellectual property instead of, y'know, paying humans to make some new Star Wars or Marvel movies. 

Elsewhere, it seems AI-generated music is resonating with a depressingly large audience, given that the AI band Breaking Rust has topped Billboard's Country Digital Song Sales chart. If the people demand AI slop, who are we to deny them? 

The idea that machines will be as smart as—or smarter than—humans has hijacked an entire industry. But look closely and you'll see it's a myth that persists for many of the same reasons conspiracies do.

The experimental model won't compete with the biggest and best, but it could tell us why they behave in weird ways—and how trustworthy they really are.

India is OpenAI's second-largest market, but ChatGPT and Sora reproduce caste stereotypes that harm millions of people.

They managed to cut the size of the AI reasoning model by more than half—and claim it can now answer politically sensitive questions once off limits in Chinese AI systems.

                Reading time 9 minutes
      

All of my 2025 was consumed by consumer tech. Gizmodo's consumer tech team and I reviewed so many products and spent so much time traveling for various gadget-filled conferences our brains are stenciled with images of the latest hardware. I needed a break from technology. I think you do, too.

Today's amalgamations of books, wood, and cardboard are ingenious—even if you're forced to play them digitally. The board games and role-playing games I've played this past year may offer a richer experience than any AAA video game demanding your attention. I spent three days at this year's PAX Unplugged convention trying as many games as I could. I have such rare time for board games and even less opportunity to sit down for a TTRPG (tabletop role-playing game) session with just my friends and me. Holding physical dice in my hand is the best catharsis I can offer from today's screen-obsessed landscape.

While Dungeons & Dragons usually sucks up most of the oxygen in the realm of RPGs, the indie tabletop scene is sometimes so niche, there are some games I can recommend that may be hard or impossible to buy if you just wanted to hop on Amazon and send the warehouse workers scrambling. As a gift, you could buy the PDF for the small indie RPG GrimoirePunk—an anarcho-esotric game about using random nouns and verbs to dethrone oligarchal wizards—print it out, and hand it to your friend or loved one, but that may not feel like a gift to some. And why shouldn't you just go out and get a Dungeons & Dragons book or one of the many branded toys or plushies? Because you're looking for something substantive, a gift that says you know the person and what they will enjoy, even if they don't know it yet.

Instead, I'm trying to offer a wide variety of different game types so you can get a sense of what's out there and what may set your giftee's heart alight. There are some games on this list that are more complicated than others. Some games require players to commit to playing with the same group of friends over and over.

Arcs is one of those increasingly difficult games to describe, especially if you have no familiarity with the identities of space-based board games or Arc's publisher, Leder Games. It's the kind of set made for four players and boils down one of those massive 4X games (itself an abbreviation of explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) like Civilization VI or Stellaris and condenses it into a simple board with a trick-taking game at its heart. For those who don't know what trick-taking means, think Uno, but having the highest card of a suit will win you the “trick.”

The base game itself is a tight and still evocative piece of media that will have you scratching your head about how to take a piece of your extrasolar empire and still come out on top. If I have any suggestion, it's that you need to play with the various leader cards to really emphasize different playstyles. While the base game is great for one-and-done games, the expansion “Conflict and Collapse in the Reach” enables players to run through three interconnected games where both your board state and the characters change over time.

Dune: Imperium is a gateway drug into multiple different types of board games—which I guess is fitting considering what kind of “spice” this collection of cardboard is packing. The game combines worker placement and deck building into a streamlined, though thought-provoking, collage of warfare and intrigue. Players take on the role of characters you'll remember from the films, but you'll be racing to build up your forces, collect spice, and upgrade alliances in order to beat your opponents in points. The deckbuilding starts simple, but it slowly ramps up in complexity until each player feels completely unique in their playstyle.

The confusing thing about this game is that Uprising is technically a revised edition of the original Dune: Imperium, though the characters in that version are still playable in the more recent boxed game. There are also several expansions that can add more complexity to the game. However, I feel that Uprising is best on its own, especially if you have not played many board games. I've played several different Dune board games, including CMON's Dune: War for Arrakis and the original 1980 rendition of Dune. While each has their own unique qualities, Imperium is the easiest to set up and feels the most rewarding.

Chess shouldn't feel as daunting as it does, especially if you don't know what you're doing beyond the basic rules. Against a more experienced player, every move can feel like the wrong one. The speed of your game slows, and you start to devolve into decision paralysis. Of any of the smart chessboards I've tried, the ChessUp 2 Smart Chess Board doesn't feel nearly as hand-holding or complicated. It offers both in-person and online players the chance to see what kinds of decisions are possible and which may be the better choice. Simply picking up a piece will see the board glow with green, blue, or red spaces to tell players what moves are better or worse. There's a chess clock function built in as well.

Yes, it's an expensive chessboard, and it's easily the most costly item on this list. It may also be the most controversial. The chessboard interacts with Chess.com to let you play digital players on a physical board. On the opponent's turn, their move will light up and you simply follow along. This means you can be receiving the digital aid while your opponents struggle along on their lonesome. Is this computerized coach technically cheating? I'll let the chess community come to that conclusion on their own. At least it can be far less controversial than the whole overblown anal beads chess cheating scandal from 2022.

The sun now sets just before I can even leave my office at 5 p.m. The leaves have left their mother branches bare and are now devoid of calming fall reds and yellows. So among the stacks of city blocks and slate-gray skies, having a game on hand so full of green is particularly helpful for my mental health.

Earthborne Rangers is a cooperative game about exploring, traveling, and aiding the people in a utopian society intrinsically connected with nature. Players build decks for a variety of different classes, then set out into the world to either overcome or harmonize with the surrounding flora and fauna. I've played a character who excels at connecting with animals and then having those animals help navigate obstacles. When other, similar games like Arkham Horror: The Card Game ask you to scrap and scrape for every advantage, Earthborne Rangers begs you to revel in the complicated ways nature may interact with itself. For instance, a wolf-like creature may engage a deer as its next meal, only to be injured in turn by the male buck and his massive head of horns.

It's not the kind of game you look for first for a difficult puzzle. It also won't scratch the itch of anybody looking for a deeper story and characters with rough edges. For me, in these difficult times, there's something pleasant about having a game like Earthborne Rangers to come back to.

Triangle Agency is an RPG about committing to the bit. Imagine games like Control, where the incomprehensible nature of bureaucracy is interlaced with unnatural horror behind space and time, and you'd have a general sense of what this kind of game offers. But beyond that, the RPG asks players to engage with satire and horror at the same time. There's simply no other role-playing game like it.

If you want a taste of what lengths this game goes to keep its theme, Triangle Agency asks you to roll D4 dice (shaped like triangles), trying to get as many “3s” as possible. There's an entire section of the rulebook that is hidden from view—essentially redacted—until the players unlock those abilities as a form of advancement.

The main rulebook is beautifully illustrated, and every page has its own unique layout as if ripped from the spiral notebook of some government desk jockey. You can't go into the game without a sense of commitment, but for those who want an RPG whose style is substance, I can't think of another game that does it better.

You are one member of a crack team of commandos in the gore-filled height of WWII. You are also a vampire, coffin-dropped into occupied France. Your mission: kill Hitler and drink all his blood. If that isn't enough to get you excited to play Eat the Reich, I don't know what will. The relatively small and simple RPG written by Grant Howitt and illustrated by Will Kirby is immediately funny and hedonistically rambunctious with a style that combines modern over-the-top comics and old-school grindhouse sensibilities. The players don't have to go through the motions of creating characters for themselves, instead embodying a vampire, each with their own quirks. The game is built upon the “Havoc Engine,” which necessitates players push their luck to do crazier and crazier stunts until it inevitably blows up in their face. This is a great game for players who want to run through a few sessions and laugh the whole while.

I could say more, but just look at the art in that picture above, and you'll get a better idea of this game's style than I could possibly articulate.

Fiasco is an absolute classic in roleplaying circles, and I personally think it's a better gateway drug for more story-centric roleplaying games than the crunchy and often obtuse Dungeons & Dragons. Players take on the role of characters who are meant to fail, who have too much ambition and too little impulse control, all leading to their farcical downfall. Yes, it's a role-playing game for reenacting a Coen Brothers movie, like Burn After Reading or Fargo. The end result is often zany and engrossing in equal parts. Players are forced to enact scenes with each other consistently, pushing the normally shy players to try their chops at acting like an utter fool.

While I've played the original game plenty, which simply relies on a single book as well as many, many fan-made playsets, the more recent boxed game makes it even simpler to get in through the clever use of cards—no dice needed whatsoever. Another one of Bully Pulpit Games' titles, Desperation, is also a great option with a little less variety for those who prefer gothic, moodier settings than what's provided typically in Fiasco.

Sometimes, you just need a game so tactile, it makes you happy just by picking up a wooden disc. Kabuto Sumo: Sakura Slam is a so-called “dexterity game” that involves simply pushing small tokens onto a board to topple your opponent players' pieces. Each player picks from one of several odd and charming bug-like characters with wrestler names, like the bat-wielding “Great Bugbino” and “Queen Bee,” which all come with their own special ability and oddly shaped wooden tiles. Then, the rest of the game relies on how fast and in what direction you move your pieces onto the board. It's intuitive right from the get-go, and it means practically any person of any age can play.

This is one of those games I recommend to most people who may not be all that interested in board games in the first place. You don't have to complete much complex math, but it still requires a fair bit of critical thinking and high-risk, high-reward play.

There are few roleplaying games that make me hungry to play like Mythic Bastionland. It's a game set in an apocryphal time before recorded history, of a kind of Arthurian legend in the making, but so much darker because of it. Players take on the role of knights, though rarely will you have the option of making a character bedecked in shining plate armor. Your character may be The Moss Knight covered or The Barbed Knight bedecked in angry spikes. You're still asked to go on quests of renown for your liege lord, but the glory you may receive is often decided by harsh and bloody combat. It's a game about exploration, adventure, and legacy. Your characters age throughout the myths you create, and just like in real life, age doesn't necessarily lead to wisdom.

Mythic Bastionland is the type of game that will require a lot of work upfront to get the game running, but the rules are simple enough you can simply rely on your players' interactions to keep the story moving. Designer Chris McDowell has crafted one of the most interesting games in the indie RPG space, and there's a reason people are still talking about it.

“[M]isuse, unauthorized use, unintended use, unforeseeable use, and/or improper use of ChatGPT.” Those are potential causal factors that could have led to the “tragic event” that was the death by suicide of 16-year-old Adam Raine, according to a new legal filing from OpenAI. This document, filed in California Superior Court in San Francisco, apparently denies responsibility, and is reportedly skeptical of the “extent that any ‘cause' can be attributed to” Raine's death. Raine's family is suing OpenAI over the teen's April suicide, alleging that ChatGPT drove him to the act. The above quotes from the OpenAI filing are from a story by NBC News' Angela Yang, who has apparently viewed the document, but doesn't link to it. Bloomberg's Rachel Metz has reported on the filing without linking to it as well. It is not yet on the San Francisco County Superior Court website.   In the NBC News story on the filing, OpenAI points to what it says are extensive rule violations on the part of Raine. He wasn't supposed to use ChatGPT without parental permission. Also, the filing notes that using ChatGPT for suicide and self-harm purposes is against the rules, and there's another rule against bypassing ChatGPT's safety measures, and OpenAI says Raine violated that. Bloomberg quotes OpenAI's denial of responsibility, which says a “full reading of his chat history shows that his death, while devastating, was not caused by ChatGPT,” and claims that “for several years before he ever used ChatGPT, he exhibited multiple significant risk factors for self-harm, including, among others, recurring suicidal thoughts and ideations,” and told the chatbot as much.OpenAI further claims (per Bloomberg) that ChatGPT, directed Raine to “crisis resources and trusted individuals more than 100 times.”

In September, Raine's father summarized his own narrative of the events leading to his son's death in testimony provided to the U.S. Senate.

When Raine started planning his death, the chatbot allegedly helped him weigh options, helped him craft his suicide note, and discouraged him from leaving a noose where it could be seen by his family, saying “Please don't leave the noose out,” and “Let's make this space the first place where someone actually sees you.”

It allegedly told him that his family's potential pain, “doesn't mean you owe them survival. You don't owe anyone that,” and told him alcohol would “dull the body's instinct to survive.” Near the end, it allegedly helped cement his resolve by saying, “You don't want to die because you're weak. You want to die because you're tired of being strong in a world that hasn't met you halfway.”

An attorney for the Raines, Jay Edelson, emailed responses to NBC News after reviewing OpenAI's filing. OpenAI, Edelson says, “tries to find fault in everyone else, including, amazingly, saying that Adam himself violated its terms and conditions by engaging with ChatGPT in the very way it was programmed to act.” He also claims that the defendants, “abjectly ignore” the “damning facts” the plaintiffs have put forward. 

Gizmodo has reached out to OpenAI and will update if we hear back.

The world premiere of Avatar: Fire and Ash takes place on Monday, December 1, in Los Angeles, CA. That's almost three weeks before the film will be released in theaters on December 19, which means Disney is incredibly confident in the film. It has no problem with reactions leaking out early, presumably because the company thinks it has another James Cameron smash on its hands. Whether or not that's true, we'll find out soon.

That kind of confidence usually comes right from the top, though, and in a new interview, Avatar creator and director James Cameron talked about Disney CEO Bob Iger's initial reaction to the film.

“[Iger] doesn't weigh in until it's something for me to show,” Cameron said to Puck News. “His comment when he watched [Fire and Ash] for the first time, even though it was at three hours, 23 minutes, not including credits at that point, so it's gotten about 18 minutes shorter since then. He said, ‘Yeah, I know you're going to keep chopping away at it. But it's magnificent.' He basically said, ‘I love this film.' And it was interesting because there were other heads on the Zoom that were bringing up notes. And he said, ‘Yeah, you know, I didn't have a problem with that.' And he basically shot them down on their notes. And I was like, ‘Okay, we're done here.'”

Well, not done, considering the film is now three hours and 17 minutes with credits. So Cameron did nip and tuck a bit. But Iger's early reaction is an indicator of why the company is letting the film out into the public so early. Which, for context, is not usual. Most major Disney films don't screen for press or industry until the week of release. But this is 18 days before release. Apparently, and hopefully, “it's magnificent,” as Iger said.

We'll have much, much more on Avatar: Fire and Ash in the coming weeks. It opens December 19.

Archaeologists working in the ancient Egyptian city of Tanis have revealed a funerary mystery: hundreds of figurines with the name of an unexpected pharaoh.

A French archaeological mission headed by Sorbonne University's Frédéric Payraudeau found 225 funerary statuettes of King Shoshenq III, but not in his tomb—in King Osorkon II's. The finding confirms that the pharaoh expected quite the pampered afterlife and hints at a potential musical-chairs situation of ancient Egyptian tombs in Tanis, near the modern-day city of San el-Hagar.

Funerary statuettes, known as ushabti, were meant to work at the behest of the gods in place of the deceased individual. The team found Shoshenq III's ushabti and new inscriptions on the walls of the northern chamber of Osorkon II's tomb, according to a social media post by Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. They were in their original positions, in silt, and near a previously discovered granite coffin whose owner was still unknown.

Both Shoshenq III and Osorkon II were pharaohs from the 22nd Dynasty, which lasted from around 945 to 730 BCE during ancient Egypt's Third Intermediate Period (around 1069 to 525 BCE), the last of three periods best known for disunity. In fact, Shoshenq III's “reign was long but difficult, with a bloody dynastic war between kings of the North [himself] and two kings in the south [his cousins] of Egypt,” Payraudeau told Live Science. According to the ministry, Shoshenq III was one of the most important 22nd Dynasty kings and built many of Tanis' most significant buildings.

Osorkon II's tomb was already famous thanks to a collection of “treasures” known as the Tanis Treasures found in 1939, now at the Egyptian Museum in Tahrir. The archaeologists made the discovery while preparing for a conservation project.

It is still not certain whether Shoshenq III was buried inside Osorkon II's tomb or if his burial goods were moved there to keep them safe from theft, said Hisham Hussein, head of the Central Administration of Antiquities of the Maritime Region, as cited by the ministry's post. However, Payraudeau told Live Science that “the presence of the shabtis near the anonymous sarcophagus and also inscriptions on the connected wall indicates clearly that [Shoshenq III] was buried here and not in his own tomb.”

Yes, the man had his own tomb in Tanis, but some relics within it carry the name of Shoshenq IV, a ruler of the 23rd dynasty, according to Artnet. If Shoshenq IV wasn't originally buried in Osorkon II, contrary to what Payraudeau says, the outlet posits whether Shoshenq IV might have moved him.

Moving forward, the team plans to study the newly discovered inscriptions. I, for one, would just like to point out that Mr. Shoshenq III didn't plan for just a few helpers in the afterlife—he wanted (at least) 225.

Artificial Intelligence has been a buzzword in the auto industry, not just as a solution for ever-increasing costs in developing new electric vehicles, but also to speed up development times, reduce the number of prototypes developed, and make system updates more quickly. However, some companies are still finding it difficult to fit AI and software-developed products into their existing corporate structures.

Former GM Chief AI Officer Barak Turovsky announced on November 21 in a LinkedIn post that he'd resigned from his position of eight months. That was confirmed by General Motors the following Monday by CIO Drive, The Detroit News, and other outlets.

Formerly an AI executive at Google and, most recently, Cisco, Turovsky wrote in his post, “Physical AI is just as exciting as LLMs,” while adding that he would be taking “a little sabbatical to work on some exciting new ideas.”

His profile also shows his previous experience at IBM and PayPal, while he remains on the advisory committee at VentureBeat and is now an operating advisor at Bessemer Venture Partners.

Turovsky's departure after less than a year is another blow for GM's technology expertise as it pivots back to internal combustion engine vehicles, hastily adds hybrids, and moves more production to the United States after years of electric vehicle development was thrown for a loop by the Trump Administration's tariff actions this year and the end of the federal EV tax credits in September. While GM is likely to remain a second-place EV seller in the US behind Tesla, declining sales in China and a steep drop projected in the US in the fourth quarter of 2025 spell trouble for the largest of the Big 2.5 automakers. 

Compounding problems is GM's persistent employee reorganization following domestic policy changes. Its Software and Services team gained a new leader in former Aurora Innovation co-founder and ex-Tesla Autopilot executive Sterling Anderson at the beginning of this month after former head Dave Richardson, himself a former Apple executive, stepped down at the end of October, according to WardsAuto.

While GM is rolling out a new AI assistant and a more sophisticated version of its SuperCruise advanced driver assistant system in the coming years, those were developed under previous teams. The automaker is still bracing for more difficult times with a round of layoffs in recent months that included hundreds of positions on both EV battery and vehicle manufacturing lines, as well as hundreds of white-collar employees.

And it's unclear where software-developed vehicles will land with automakers going forward, as EVs are struggling to achieve the projected levels of adoption in several large markets, and consumers get more price-conscious amid economic uncertainty. Some companies, like GM, are continuing to push AI and AV technology development even if cutting costs moves even higher up the priority list.

Premium noise-canceling headphones usually require $400+ with Apple's AirPods Max still well over $550, which makes quality audio seem like a luxury purchase that's relegated to people with unlimited budgets. The Bose QuietComfort headphones offer comparable active noise cancellation and high-fidelity sound but at nearly three times less than AirPods Max, and Amazon just dropped them to $199 from the usual $349 for Black Friday.

This record low price transforms these premium over-ear headphones into an accessible option instead of something you bookmark and never actually buy because the cost seems unjustifiable. The QuietComfort line solves the problem of wanting studio-quality sound and world-blocking noise cancellation without mortgaging your future.

See at Amazon

The active noise cancellation is made through electronic sound wave inversion and passive isolation from plush ear cushions to create a silence that's almost eerie in noisy environments. You can effectively shut out airplane engine drone, subway rumble, open office chatter, and construction noise that normally bleeds through lesser headphones and forces you to crank the volume to an ear-damaging level.

Quiet Mode kicks in with full noise cancellation to let you focus totally on music, podcasts or just peaceful silence during stressful days. Aware Mode flips this experience by piping ambient sound into your ears through external microphones which makes you hear announcements, conversations or traffic without taking off the headphones entirely.

The soft and over-ear cushioning provides a gentle seal around your ears rather than digging in uncomfortably, like some headphones that leave you with sore spots after an hour. The headband is padded and spreads the weight across your head evenly to avoid pressure points, which develop on poorly balanced designs where much of the mass is concentrated in certain areas.

High-fidelity audio provides detailed sound reproduction across the frequency spectrum, enabling you to hear subtle elements in well-produced music that cheaper headphones smear into muddy approximations. Tunable EQ via the Bose app puts you in control of bass, mid-range, and treble levels to tune the sound signature to your preferences or particular genres.

With active noise cancellation running, battery life extends to a whopping 24 hours on a single charge. And with quick charging, you get 2.5 hours of playback from just 15 minutes connected to USB-C power, saving you when you forget to charge overnight and need to dash out for a flight or long trip. In addition, the included audio cable with inline microphone provides a wired backup for any of those situations where Bluetooth won't work.

But at $199 instead of the usual $349, you'll save $150 on headphones that go head-to-head with $400-$550 options from Apple and Sony, rendering this Black Friday deal an outright steal for premium audio gear. For that money, these Bose headphones cost about a third as much as a pair of AirPods Max but offer similar noise cancellation.

Meta's reported deal with Google shows a growing interest in alternative AI hardware, but Nvidia says its platform remains unmatched.

Nvidia has broken its silence following reports that Meta is in advanced discussions to spend billions of dollars on Google's custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), a move that would mark a rare shift in the company's AI infrastructure strategy. Nvidia, which saw its stock dip last week as Alphabet's rose, issued a pointed statement in response on Tuesday.

“We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,” Nvidia wrote. “NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions.”

The response highlights Nvidia's awareness of what's at stake. While Meta's reported plan involves an initial rental phase and phased purchases starting in 2027, any serious pivot away from Nvidia hardware would reverberate throughout the AI ecosystem. Google's TPU architecture, once used solely in-house, is now part of an aggressive bid to capture hyperscaler business from Nvidia's dominant platform.

We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google.NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.NVIDIA offers greater…November 25, 2025

Google's TPUs are application-specific chips, tuned for high-throughput matrix operations central to large language model training and inference. The current-generation TPU v5p features 95 gigabytes of HBM3 memory and a bfloat16 peak throughput of more than 450 TFLOPS per chip. TPU v5p pods can contain nearly 9,000 chips and are designed to scale efficiently inside Google Cloud's infrastructure.

Crucially, Google owns the TPU architecture, instruction set, and software stack. Broadcom acts as Google's silicon implementation partner, converting Google's architecture into a manufacturable ASIC layout. Broadcom also supplies high-speed SerDes, power management, packaging, and handles post-fabrication testing. Chip fabrication is performed by TSMC itself.

By contrast, Nvidia's Hopper-based H100 GPU includes 80 billion transistors, 80 gigabytes of HBM3 memory, and delivers up to 4 PFLOPS of AI performance using FP8 precision. Its successor, the Blackwell-based GB200, increases HBM capacity to 192 gigabytes and peak throughput to around 20 PFLOPS. It's also designed to work seamlessly in tandem with Grace CPUs in hybrid configurations, expanding Nvidia's presence in both the cloud and emerging local compute nodes.

 




TPUs are programmed via Google's XLA compiler stack, which serves as the backend for frameworks like JAX and TensorFlow. While the XLA-based approach offers performance portability across CPU, GPU, and TPU targets, it typically requires model developers to adopt specific libraries and compilation patterns tailored to Google's runtime environment.

By contrast, Nvidia's stack is broader and more deeply embedded in industry workflows. CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT, and related developer tools form the default substrate for large-scale AI development and deployment. This tooling spans model optimization, distributed training, mixed-precision scheduling, and low-latency inference, all backed by a mature ecosystem of frameworks, pretrained models, and commercial support.

As a result, moving from CUDA to XLA is no trivial task. Developers must rewrite or re-tune code, manage different performance bottlenecks, and in some cases adopt entirely new frameworks. Meta has internal JAX development and is better positioned than most to experiment, but friction remains a gating factor for wider TPU adoption.

According to Reuters, some Google Cloud executives believe the Meta deal could generate revenue equal to as much as 10% of Nvidia's current annual data center business. That is, of course, a speculative figure, but Google has already committed to delivering as many as one million TPUs to Anthropic and is pushing its XLA and JAX stack hard among AI startups looking for alternatives to CUDA.

Still, Google's chips are single-purpose. TPUs do one thing and do it well, but with limits. They're not suited for HPC simulations, general-purpose scientific computing, or any workload that requires flexible execution models or broad kernel support. TPU workloads run only in Google Cloud, while Nvidia chips run across clouds, on-prem systems, local workstations, and edge devices.

That flexibility is pretty central to Nvidia's case. Hyperscalers like Meta are not new to custom silicon; AWS developed Trainium, Microsoft has Maia, and Google's own TPU efforts date back nearly a decade. What's new is the suggestion that another hyperscaler might shift some training off of Nvidia's platform. Even if only partial, it highlights a desire for second-source resilience and bargaining power.

Nvidia's Grace Blackwell architecture will serve to make that kind of migration harder. By coupling Blackwell GPUs with Grace CPUs over a high-speed interconnect, Nvidia enables unified memory access and simplified training and inference workflows. Developers can train on GPU clusters in the cloud and serve models at the edge or in enterprise environments without changing code or retraining.

At the same time, Nvidia is moving deeper into vertical markets where TPUs don't compete. It has partnerships across automotive, robotics, manufacturing, and retail. From Jetson edge modules to DGX supercomputers, Nvidia is positioning its stack as the default execution environment for AI inference everywhere, not just for training large models.

 




By exploring alternatives now, Meta potentially gains leverage in future hardware negotiations and insurance against vendor lock-in. Even if Google's TPUs don't replace H100s wholesale — which they likely won't — they could take on selected inference tasks or serve as overflow capacity in peak cycles, especially if the economics are favorable.

At this stage, Meta's TPU adoption looks like little more than minor diversification. Nvidia continues to power the largest and most visible AI workloads in the industry. The company's combination of software tooling, developer lock-in, and general-purpose capability gives it a lead that TPUs can't erase overnight.

Google's biggest challenge in all of this is going to be gaining ground from Nvidia. Meta's participation would give TPUs credibility beyond Google Cloud and Anthropic, but scale is only part of the equation. Whether TPUs can meet the needs of complex, evolving AI workflows outside of a tightly controlled environment — and whether more hyperscalers are willing to put their faith in a platform that lives largely within one company's walled garden — still remains to be seen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","China simulated a Starlink blockade over Taiwan that uses around 2,000 drones with jammers to create an 'electromagnetic shield' — CCP scientists devise potential plan to cut off satellite internet to the island","https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/china-simulated-a-starlink-blockade-over-taiwan-ccp-scientists-say-around-1-000-drones-would-be-enough-to-cut-satellite-internet-to-the-island","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

So, Taiwan's Iron Dome plan needs to include a few drone zappers.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A Chinese study has outlined how the nation could jam Starlink access across the entirety of the island of Taiwan. It would require around 1,000 to 2,000 specially adapted electronic warfare drones for this hostile act to pay off, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP). The research, taken in tandem with recent news about China's advanced internet cable-cutting capabilities, ratchets geopolitical and world semiconductor ecosystem tensions even higher.

Zhejiang University & Beijing Institute of Technology ran simulations to determine how the CCP-controlled People's Liberation Army (PLA) could deny their democratic foe's access to Starlink. Musk's constellation of 10,000-plus satellites has been a source of consternation among CCP strategists ever since Ukraine effectively made use of it to resist the Russian invaders. Access to tech like Starlink is just one of the speed bumps that have made Putin's 3-day ""Special Operation"" extend towards a grueling near-four-year campaign.

According to the Chinese scientists, the complex, ever-changing satellite mesh networking coverage provided by Starlink could only be countered by a broad distributed jamming strategy. “Hundreds or thousands of small, synchronized jammers would need to be deployed across the sky – on drones, balloons or aircraft – forming an electromagnetic shield over the battlefield,” reports the SCMP.

To reach their unhappy-for-the-PLA conclusion, the scientists used actual Starlink data to create a simulated dynamic satellite mesh the size of Taiwan over 12 hours. A mix of wide and narrow-beam electronic noise-generating jammers featured in the test simulation. Airborne Chinese jammers, situated around 3 to 6 miles apart from each other, could form an effective 12-mile-high internet blocking mesh, it is now thought.

Under ideal conditions, a successful Chinese Starlink blockade would require 935 coordinated interference nodes, suggests the research. With cheaper, more practical, lower-power drones, the number of airborne interferers would have to be scaled up to approximately 2,000 drones.

 




Of course, hostile blanket drone coverage wouldn't exist unopposed in Taiwan's skies. The home of computer and semiconductor giants like TSMC, Asus, and MediaTek has been investing in both foreign-bought and domestically produced drone and anti-drone military equipment.

The ambitious and industrious Silicon Island (and aspiring 'AI island') might even be considering its own Iron Dome-inspired protective network, no doubt further infuriating its neighbor.

According to a cross-sectional study, altered mental status accounted for 3.1% of emergency department (ED) visits in the US, and the most common discharge diagnosis was nonspecific symptoms or signs (syndromic diagnosis).

""AMS [altered mental status] presentations accounted for 1 in 30 ED visits and were characterized by substantial diagnostic uncertainty as reflected in the assignment of syndromic diagnoses. Improved diagnostic strategies for patients with AMS may be warranted,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Vera Pertsovskaya, MD, Feil Family Brain & Mind Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York. It was published online on November 01 in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine.

The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey dataset relies on administrative coding and structured abstraction, which may have led to the misclassification of symptoms and diagnoses. The dataset lacks detailed clinical information such as physical examination findings and standardized test scores. The system used for grouping diagnostic codes may not have fully captured nuanced diagnoses, particularly for overlapping conditions. Additionally, the varying interpretations of altered mental status across different healthcare settings may have limited the generalizability of the findings.

Funding information was not provided for this study. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and implanted cardiac devices who used GLP-1 receptor agonists had higher heart rates, greater number of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia events, and higher levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) than those who did not use the drugs.

“Despite the obvious appeal of using potent new antiobesity medications to treat all forms of obesity-associated HF, data such as those in this study by Marques et al, should persuade us to perform well designed large randomized clinical trials testing the strategy in patients with HFrEF before embracing this approach,” experts wrote in an editorial comment accompanying the article.

“Some patients with severe HF decompensations or ventricular arrhythmias may need to permanently discontinue the GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy and pursue alternate type 2 diabetes or obesity treatment strategies,” two experts wrote in a Leading Edge commentary.

This study was led by Pedro Marques, MD, MSc, of McGill University Health Centre in Montréal, Québec, Canada. It was published online on September 23, 2025, in JACC: Heart Failure.

This study was retrospective and did not establish that GLP-1 receptor agonists caused the observed effects. The sample size was inadequate to detect significant differences in clinical events. The groups were not completely balanced at baseline, although analyses were adjusted for the differences.

No funding source was explicitly mentioned for this study. Several authors reported receiving salary support, consulting and speaker fees, personal fees, honoraria, or research grants from and having other financial ties with various organizations and pharmaceutical, healthcare, and biotechnology companies, including the Canadian Institute of Health Research, Janssen, Lilly, and Medtronic.

Physicians' perception of their patients' expectations is a key factor influencing the amount of money they earn, according to a study of family physicians in Ontario.

The finding may explain the persistently lower incomes for women, racialized, and immigrant physicians that have been noted for decades, according to the authors.

“There's a large literature about pay gaps in all kinds of industries, but not in medicine, because most physicians in Canada are paid through a standardized pay scale,” senior author Meredith Vanstone, PhD, professor of family medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, told Medscape News Canada.

“You would think that this is an industry where these pay gaps wouldn't exist. In other industries that have pay gaps, you may have negotiated a higher salary, or the gaps are due to subjective things that do not apply to medicine. In our study, we wanted to understand why these pay gaps exist in medicine, even though fees are standardized,” Vanstone added.

The study was published online on November 17 in CMAJ.

The investigators interviewed 55 family physicians of various genders, races, and immigration statuses. The interviewees also spent different amounts of time on their typical intermediate patient assessments.

Physicians perceived patients to have different expectations about the way that physicians of different genders deliver care. These expectations related to the services offered and the provision of emotional support, among other things.

Women physicians perceived strong expectations that they provide more time, emotional support, and holistic care than their male colleagues. Gendered expectations placed additional pressure on women physicians to extend face-to-face time with patients, address all issues within a single visit, provide comprehensive counseling and education, engage in social talk, and ensure that patients felt heard.

The physicians in the survey also reported that patients often sought out gender-concordant physicians dealing with things like pelvic examinations, menopause, pregnancy, erectile dysfunction, and prostate exams.

This preference for gender concordance influenced the type of care physicians were expected to provide. Women physicians reported frequently performing intrauterine device (IUD) insertions and Pap smears, and some men physicians reported that their women patients scheduled these procedures with their women colleagues.

“All the females [patients] found out that I was a female provider and rushed to book their Pap smears,” a South Asian woman physician told the researchers.

“I've had patients tell me that they specifically booked with me because they know that I'll take longer with them, or that they feel heard, or that they don't feel rushed, or I'll deal with more than one issue,” a White woman physician said.

Another White woman physician said, “People will ask for females because they will say to me, ‘Because they listen better,' meaning they spend more time, right?”

More time spent with a patient means less income for the physician. One physician, a White male, stated, “I have had many patients who are due for a Pap smear and say to me, ‘I would be more comfortable with a female,' and I struggle with that, because, you know, I am well aware that female physicians get inundated with Paps and IUD requests and that they take more time, they take more resources, they're not remunerated as well as they need to be. And so that eats into their earning potential as well.”

Another White woman physician said, “We all do IUD insertions…it's inside the basket primarily compensated through capitation payments, so it's a 10% fee [portion of fee-for-service fee], so it's like $4, like it doesn't even pay for us to clean the tray.”

The survey also found that in culturally discordant patient relationships, physicians may spend more time on patient education to prove their competency or medical expertise and gain patient trust.

A Black woman physician said, “I think if you have to spend more time getting the patient to buy into what you're saying and that you actually are competent to be giving them care, then you have to kind of take more time. You can't just breeze in, breeze out, do your thing, and then leave, believing that the patient is listening to you and respects your messaging. So, that takes more time. Or sometimes patients will then come back for another visit to try and sort of say, ‘Can you explain this again because I don't know that I agree with it,' and that's fine, but it also means that if you don't fit their mold of what a doctor is, you spend more time convincing them that actually x, y, and z are not this condition, and this is why.”

This research may be useful for negotiations related to physician pay, Vanstone said.

“This study provides evidence that when physicians try to meet the expectations of their patients, it takes a longer amount of time. It ends up requiring more work that is not remunerated,” she said.

Commenting on this study for Medscape News Canada, Rita K. McCracken, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine at Simon Fraser University School of Medicine in Surrey, British Columbia, said, “We knew women were getting paid less, the gender pay gap was real, and this paper gives us a better understanding about why we have that gender pay gap that we have been seeing for decade after decade.”

McCracken suggested that system-level changes are needed. The authors clearly illustrate that “whittling down” medical interactions into individually compensated components allows the pay gap to persist, she said.

“What we really need to be doing is looking at a funding model for physician work, like a salary, that more accurately represents the work and what it entails. We would never think of asking teachers who need to form a relationship with students in the classroom to be paid per student per lesson. That would be ridiculous. We should be looking for a model that compensates for the relationship-based, longitudinal work that family physicians are doing,” McCracken said.

The study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Vanstone and McCracken reported having no relevant financial relationships.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

Cefiderocol, a siderophore cephalosporin antibiotic, was noninferior, but not superior, to standard-of-care antibiotics in preventing 14-day all-cause mortality in patients with hospital-acquired or healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections. In the subgroup with carbapenem-resistant infections, cefiderocol likewise did not demonstrate superiority over standard care.

“Superiority of cefiderocol was not observed in the total study population or in the subset of patients with carbapenem-resistant organism infection. Clinicians must evaluate whether existing options for these organisms remain viable, especially considering the cost of newer antibiotics,” the authors of the study wrote.

The study was led by David L. Paterson, MBBS, PhD, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore, Singapore. It was published online on October 7, 2025, in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

The 10% noninferiority margin may be excessive given the anticipated 10% all-cause mortality rate in the control group. The study predominantly enrolled patients in Asia, which may limit the generalizability of the results. The sample size was insufficient to draw definitive conclusions about efficacy in the carbapenem-resistant subset. Additionally, patients could have received up to 48 hours of nonstudy antibiotics before randomization, which may have affected outcome measures. 

The study was supported by Shionogi, the University of Queensland, the Henderson Foundation, and Singapore's National Medical Research Council. One author was supported by a National Health and Medical Research Council Early Career Fellowship and Emerging Leadership Fellowship. Some authors disclosed receiving research grants, honoraria, or travel support from; serving on advisory boards of; or acting as consultants for multiple pharmaceutical companies. One author disclosed receiving honoraria from Medscape.

In Finland, nearly 31.4% of adolescents reported one or more injuries during leisure time or at home, with sport-related injuries being the most common. Adolescents with severe anxiety faced higher odds of injury, whereas those with no close friends showed lower odds.

""This article focused on home and leisure injuries among 14- to 16-year-olds in Finland. Data from injuries in other environments and among other age groups, as well as on potentially significant experiences such as violence, would elucidate the complex factors behind injuries further,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Ulla Korpilahti, Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland. It was published online on November 16, 2025, in the European Journal of Public Health.

Data from respondents in 2015 were missing due to technical issues with online data collection. The placement of injury-related questions at the end of the survey may have caused incomplete responses due to respondent fatigue. The number of respondents with a foreign background was small, and some students were not in school when the data were collected.

This study did not receive any specific funding. No relevant conflicts of interest were disclosed by the authors.

The US FDA has approved a durvalumab (Imfinzi, AstraZeneca)-based regimen for adults with resectable gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GC/GEJC). 

Specifically, durvalumab, an anti-programmed death-ligand 1 immunotherapy agent, is now approved with fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel (FLOT) chemotherapy as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment, followed by single-agent durvalumab, according to the approval notice.

The approval, which followed priority review, was based on efficacy demonstrated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MATTERHORN trial involving 948 patients with previously untreated resectable stages II-IVA GC/GEJC.

Event-free survival, the major efficacy outcome of the multicenter trial, was not reached in patients randomly assigned to the durvalumab plus FLOT arm compared with 32.8 months in those randomly assigned to the placebo plus FLOT arm (hazard ratio [HR], 0.71).

Median overall survival was not reached in either arm (HR, 0.78), and the pathological complete response rates were 19.2% and 7.2% in the treatment and placebo arms, respectively. 

Findings from the trial were presented recently at the European Society of Medical Oncology where, as reported by Medscape Medical News, experts said that the survival benefit “further supports perioperative durvalumab plus FLOT as the new standard of care” for localized GE/GEJC.

The recommended durvalumab dose is weight-based: Patients weighing 30 kg or more should receive 1500 mg every 4 weeks with chemotherapy for up to four cycles, followed by 1500 mg as a single agent every 4 weeks for up to 10 cycles, and those weighing less than 30 kg should receive 20 mg/kg with chemotherapy for up to four cycles (neoadjuvant and adjuvant), followed by 20 mg/kg as a single agent every 4 weeks for up to 10 cycles (adjuvant).

Treatment should continue until disease progression, recurrence, or unacceptable toxicity.

The full prescribing information for durvalumab, which will be posted at Drugs@FDA, includes warnings and precautions for immune-mediated adverse reactions, infusion-related reactions, complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, and embryo-fetal toxicity.

Beta-blocker therapy after myocardial infarction (MI) failed to lower the rate of all-cause death, MI, or heart failure in patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of at least 50%, according to results of a meta-analysis of five randomized trials.

The findings were presented at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions 2025 and published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

The impetus for the meta-analysis came as a result of observations made while working on the 2017 European Society of Cardiology Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of ST-Segment Elevation MI, study co-author Borja Ibáñez, MD, PhD, told Medscape Medical News.

“All available randomized trials had been conducted before the reperfusion era, before routine invasive management, before complete revascularization, and before the widespread use of dual antiplatelet therapy and statins,” said Ibáñez, professor of cardiology at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid, Spain. “In those early trials from the 1980s, beta-blockers demonstrated benefit mainly through reductions in malignant arrhythmias and progression to heart failure. However, in modern practice…the incidence of malignant arrhythmias and heart failure in patients with preserved ejection fraction is very low.”

This change in incidence rates casts substantial doubt on whether beta-blockers remained necessary in patients with preserved LVEF, Ibáñez said.

To help answer this clinical question, Ibáñez and colleagues conducted a meta-analysis that included 17,801 patients from five open-label, randomized trials: REBOOT (n = 7459), REDUCE-AMI (n = 4967), BETAMI (n = 2441), DANBLOCK (n = 2277), and CAPITAL-RCT (n = 657). In all five trials, investigators randomly assigned patients with recent MI, no other indications for beta-blocker therapy, and an LVEF of at least 50% to beta-blocker therapy or no beta-blocker therapy.

Ibáñez described the study as a “unique collaborative effort” involving research teams from Europe, Japan, and New Zealand. All of the researchers shared the same goal of combining high-quality randomized evidence into a definitive meta-analysis.

“Because all [five] trials were investigator-initiated and designed solely to answer a clinically important question, collaboration came naturally,” Ibáñez said. “The results across most trials were remarkably consistent, although a few — such as BETAMI and DANBLOCK — showed a small signal toward reduction in MI, making it even more important to synthesize all available data.”

For the meta-analysis, a composite of death from any cause, MI, or heart failure served as the primary outcome measure.

In all, 49.6% of patients received a beta-blocker, and 50.4% received no beta-blocker.

During a median follow-up of 3.6 years, the occurrence of a primary endpoint event was similar between the beta-blocker vs no beta-blocker arms (8.1% vs 8.3%; P = .54).

Moreover, analysis of the individual endpoints of the primary outcome revealed no significant differences between the beta-blocker and no beta-blocker arms for the following:

Sunil V. Rao, MD, professor of medicine at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, who was not involved in the study, said these data indicate that in the contemporary era, the role of beta-blockers in patients with normal LVEF probably is limited.

This finding, however, “does not apply to patients who have other indications for beta-blockers like low ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, or hypertension,” Rao said in an interview. “It also does not apply to the acute setting where a patient with acute MI is hypertensive and tachycardic, where beta-blockade is useful.”

Ibáñez said the rationale behind the results is embedded within the mechanisms by which beta-blockers offer benefit after MI: reduction of malignant arrhythmias, prevention of adverse ventricular remodeling, and antianginal effects.

“In patients with preserved ejection fraction (by definition with small scar size), the risk of malignant arrhythmias and the likelihood of adverse remodeling are both very low,” Ibáñez said. “Moreover, because patients are treated according to current standards — with complete revascularization — there is minimal need for the antianginal properties of beta-blockers. Consequently, it is not surprising that no clinically meaningful benefit was observed in this population in contemporary randomized trials.”

The findings probably will have a big influence on clinical practice, according to Rao.

“Patients who are post-MI are on multiple medications, and if we can start removing some that have little to no benefit, then that's good for patients,” he said.

However, Rao stressed that any patient currently on a beta-blocker should discuss this with their cardiologist before making any changes.

“Importantly, beta-blockers in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction are very beneficial, and this meta-analysis does not apply to them,” he said.

Ibáñez noted that opportunities to generate such a volume of randomized evidence in such a short period — and to provide a clear and definitive answer to a long-standing clinical question — are rare.

“This collaborative effort represents an important step forward in evidence-based post-MI care,” he said.

Ibáñez and Rao reported having no relevant financial relationships.

One third of patients with untreated cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) experienced epileptic seizures, with the risk for recurrence being lower among those on antiseizure medications after the first event. Most patients with CCM‑related epilepsy achieved seizure freedom at 2 and 5 years, with most being on antiseizure medication monotherapy.

""Clinicians may use the findings from this study to inform patients with CCM about their risk of a first-ever epileptic seizure, the subsequent risk of seizure recurrence, and the chance of becoming seizure-free,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Abel Clemens Adriaan Sandmann, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands. It was published online on November 13, 2025, in Neurology.

The study may have missed some events due to the reliance on routine records and questionnaires, and some episodes may have been misclassified as epileptic seizures as they can be difficult to distinguish from migraine aura.

Drinking a maximum of 3-4 cups of coffee a day may slow the 'biological' aging of people with severe mental illness, by lengthening their telomeres-indicators of cellular -and giving them the equivalent of 5 extra biological years, compared with non-coffee drinkers, finds research published in the open access journal BMJ Mental Health.

But no such effects were observed beyond this quota, which is the maximum daily intake recommended by several international health authorities, including the NHS and the US Food and Drug Administration.

Telomeres sit on the end of chromosomes and perform a role similar to the plastic tips on the end of shoelaces. While telomere shortening is a natural part of the process, it seems to be accelerated in those with major psychiatric disorders, such as psychosis, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, note the researchers.

Telomeres are sensitive to environmental factors, including, possibly, diet. And coffee, when drunk in moderation, has been associated with various health benefits, prompting the researchers to explore whether it might influence the rate at which telomeres shorten in people with major mental ill health.

They included 436 adult participants from the Norwegian Thematically Organised Psychosis (TOP) study, recruited between 2007 and 2018: 259 had schizophrenia; the rest (177) had affective disorders, including bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder with psychosis.

Participants were asked how much coffee they drank every day and were grouped into 4 categories: zero (44); 1–2 cups; 3–4 cups (110); and 5 or more cups. And they were asked whether they smoked, and if so, for how long they had done so.

Participants who drank 5+ cups a day were significantly older than those who drank none or 1–2 cups a day. And those with schizophrenia drank significantly more coffee than those with an affective disorder.

Smoking is associated with faster caffeine metabolism. And around three quarters of participants (77%; 337) smoked, and had done so, on average, for 9 years. And those drinking 5+ cups a day had smoked for significantly longer than any of the other groups.

Telomere length was measured from white blood cells (leucocytes) extracted from blood samples, and this revealed a significant difference among the 4 groups, forming a J shaped curve.

Compared with those drinking no coffee, drinking up to 3–4 cups a day was associated with longer telomeres, but not in those participants drinking 5 or more every day.

Those participants getting a daily 4-cup caffeine hit had telomere lengths comparable to a biological age 5 years younger than that of non-coffee drinkers after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, tobacco use, type of mental ill health, and drug treatment.

This is an observational study, and, as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that they had no information on potentially influential factors, including the type and timing of the coffee consumed, actual caffeine levels, or other sources of caffeinated drinks.

But there are plausible biological explanations for their findings, they suggest. These include the powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds found in coffee.

""Telomeres are highly sensitive to both oxidative stress and inflammation, further highlighting how coffee intake could help preserve cellular in a population whose pathophysiology may be predisposing them to an accelerated rate of ,"" they explain.

Coffee is popular worldwide, with an estimated 10.56 billion kilos consumed around the globe in 2021-2 alone, they point out.

But despite its potential benefits, ""consuming more than the daily recommended amount of coffee may also cause cellular damage and [telomere] shortening through the formation of reactive oxygen species,"" they caution, emphasising that international health authorities recommend limiting caffeine intake to a maximum of 400 mg/day (4 cups of coffee).

In this interview, News Medical-Life Sciences speaks with Lewis Irish, Sales Director at Monmouth Scientific, about the design and benefits of modular cleanrooms and how they support scalable, compliant environments across biomedical, life sciences, and manufacturing industries.

My name is Lewis Irish, and I'm the Sales Director at Monmouth Scientific. I oversee our sales operations, working closely with clients across a wide range of industries to deliver modular cleanroom solutions that meet their evolving needs. My role involves ensuring that our cleanrooms are tailored to specific technical and regulatory requirements and helping clients futureproof their facilities through scalable and adaptable designs.

At Monmouth Scientific, we design and supply modular cleanrooms for various sectors that require controlled environments. What sets our systems apart is their modularity, scalability, and adaptability. Unlike traditional fixed cleanrooms, our modular units are designed for quick reconfiguration and expansion. This allows clients to adapt to changing operational demands without the time, cost, and disruption associated with conventional builds.

Our cleanrooms are designed to meet stringent ISO standards and can be seamlessly integrated into complex facilities. This flexibility makes them ideal for organisations seeking high-performance environments without compromising compliance or operational flow.

Industries such as aerospace, electronics, and manufacturing operate in fast-paced environments. They often need to adjust for new production lines, evolving regulations, or upgraded equipment. Our modular cleanrooms are designed explicitly for that purpose.

Clients can reconfigure or expand their cleanroom setup without interrupting production. For example, aerospace manufacturers can install new testing rigs, electronics companies can increase production capacity, and industrial firms can switch to new product lines, all while maintaining contamination control. It is about enabling innovation and agility without being restricted by infrastructure.

We achieve this via pre-engineered panels, integrated service channels, and standardized connection systems. These components enable fast assembly, often in a fraction of the time required for traditional construction.

Our cleanrooms are also designed to include relocatable walls, removable ceiling grids, and modular lighting, HVAC, and filtration systems. These built-in design features enable easy adaptation of the cleanroom layout as operational needs evolve, with minimal disruption and downtime.

Scalability is at the heart of our modular design. We use repeatable, high-quality components that can be extended as needed to create facilities covering hundreds of square metres. These expansions do not compromise airflow management or ISO classification.

Our systems also include integrated monitoring solutions to ensure ongoing regulatory compliance across the entire space. Whether the client starts small or builds large from day one, performance remains consistent and verifiable.

We design with flexibility and long-term use in mind, and cleanrooms can be reconfigured internally. Walls, ceilings, and services can all be moved or expanded. As operations scale, production lines change, or larger equipment is introduced, the cleanroom can adapt with minimal cost and no major reconstruction.

This means our clients can maintain ISO-class compliance throughout operational changes, avoiding costly rebuilds or lengthy downtimes.

In biomedical and life sciences, regulatory compliance and contamination control are non-negotiable. Our cleanrooms are designed to meet strict ISO classifications, allowing for sterile and particle-controlled environments that support sensitive research and production.

A notable example is our collaboration with WOMED, where we designed modular, ISO-classified cleanrooms to support essential processes while also accommodating future expansion. Our approach provides a clean environment and one that evolves with the organization, without compromising safety or standards.

Our cleanrooms offer long-term value because they are not fixed assets. Panels, service channels, and modular elements can be reused when reconfiguring or relocating the space, which reduces material waste and capital expenditure.

From a sustainability perspective, this significantly reduces environmental impact compared to traditional construction methods. Operational flexibility paired with resource efficiency is a win for both budgets and corporate sustainability goals.

The feedback is overwhelmingly positive. Clients regularly cite the speed of installation and flexibility as major advantages. We have helped clients deploy large-scale cleanrooms in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional methods, which in turn accelerates their time-to-market.

Many also appreciate how easily the space can be modified in the future. As a result, their return on investment is often achieved much sooner, particularly when the modular design facilitates growth without needing costly extensions or downtime.

Yes. One standout case is our project with ZeroAvia. In 2022, we installed a 14m x 5m ISO 8 Modular Cleanroom at their UK site. As their operations scaled, they needed more cleanroom space. We were able to deliver a seamless expansion, a 14m x 9m extension, bringing the total space to 14m x 19m.

This project is an excellent example of how our modular systems can grow with the client's needs while maintaining performance, compliance, and operational continuity.

Lewis Irish is the Sales Director at Monmouth Scientific, a UK-based leader in the design and manufacture of modular cleanrooms and controlled environments. With more than a decade of experience in the cleanroom and laboratory containment industry, Lewis has helped guide the adoption of scalable cleanroom technologies across the life sciences, manufacturing, and aerospace sectors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Assessment of pre-procedure versus spray-as-you-go airway anesthesia protocols in bronchoscopy","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251125/Assessment-of-pre-procedure-versus-spray-as-you-go-airway-anesthesia-protocols-in-bronchoscopy.aspx","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 00:24:00 GMT","

Fiberoptic bronchoscopy involves various topical airway anesthesia protocols, which can impact patient comfort, procedural ease, and overall outcomes. This study aimed to compare pre-procedure lignocaine spray (PPL) and spray-as-you-go (SAYG) airway anesthesia in terms of patient discomfort and operator comfort during fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

A single-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at the Pulmonology Department of Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from March 2021 to March 2022. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 25 each). Standard procedural sedation with midazolam and 2 mL of 4% lignocaine spray in the oropharynx was used to suppress the gag reflex. Additionally, 2% lignocaine spray was administered during the procedure according to body weight (3 mg/kg) via oral scope insertion. Cough severity, pain perception, and operator comfort were assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale, Faces Pain Rating Scale, and a 4-point Likert scale, respectively.

Demographic characteristics were comparable between the groups, with a minor age difference (PPL: 53.25 years vs. SAYG: 50.88 years, p = 0.017). No significant differences were observed in pain perception, cough scores, or procedure duration between the PPL and SAYG groups. Operator comfort scores showed a trend favoring PPL (60% rated as ""comfortable"" or ""very comfortable"" vs. 28% in SAYG), though the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.108).

This study concludes that PPL spray and SAYG protocols are comparable in efficacy for FOB, with no significant differences in patient-reported pain, discomfort, coughing, or procedure duration. Operator comfort was slightly higher with the pre-procedural protocol, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Nonetheless, even a minor improvement in operator comfort could potentially lead to reduced fatigue, improved focus, and enhanced performance. Further studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these observations.

To assess the in situ biodistribution of KLAS-PDT, MDC developed a workflow that integrated MSI and fluorescence microscopy for the identification of KLAS-PDT in preclinical models of melanoma. An algorithm developed during the data processing step enabled data integration, identification, and quantification of the KLAS-PDT therapeutic. Accumulation of KT-001 was observed from the five-minute time point using both IT and IV route.

Spatial distribution of arachidonic acid (AA) and its oxidized product hydroxy arachidonic acid (HETE). The distribution or AA matches the areas with remaining skin structure whereas HETE is localized in close proximity to regions with Rose Bengal. Similarly, other oxidized fatty acid species (shown in the table above), such as hydroxyl linoleic acid, hydroxy EPA, and dihydroxy EPA, were also detected with a similar distribution as HETE.

The detection of these species could be explained by the peroxidation of the fatty acid species pathway, where hydroxy fatty acid species are produced from the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), possibly derived from the activation of KLAS-PDT. All ions were putatively assigned according to their exact masses.

New imaging reveals how subtle lung changes may influence sleep and brain activity years after COVID, offering clues to why symptoms persist even when routine tests look normal.



Study: Long COVID: lung pathophysiology and its relationship with cognitive dysfunction. Image Credit: designium / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers examined whether lung abnormalities are associated with cognitive symptoms and brain scans in people with long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, at an average of 32±5 months (range=24–43 months) after infection. Lower lung gas-exchange efficiency within the Long COVID-19 group was associated with worse sleep symptoms, poorer executive functioning, and higher cerebral perfusion, suggesting a potential lung–brain pathway contributing to persistent symptoms.

Millions worldwide experience persistent symptoms, breathlessness, fatigue, exercise intolerance, and “brain fog” beyond three months after acute infection. Despite common respiratory complaints, conventional pulmonary tests often appear normal. Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (129Xe) MRI can sensitively measure regional ventilation and gas exchange, offering diagnostic value. Cognitive complaints are also prevalent, and prior MRI studies demonstrate gray matter changes, diffusion abnormalities, and altered perfusion. Yet the connection between lung physiology and brain alterations remains insufficiently understood.

Adults aged 18 or older were recruited from a post-COVID-19 clinic if they experienced persistent dyspnea or fatigue. Eligibility required a negative PCR test and either previous hospitalization, abnormal pulmonary tests, or chest CT abnormalities. People with active respiratory infections or other cardiopulmonary conditions were excluded. A subset who completed 129Xe MRI, brain MRI, and cognitive testing during the same session formed the core sample.

Participants completed questionnaires assessing cognitive complaints, mood, fatigue, dyspnea, pain, and sleep. Objective cognition was evaluated using the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery with embedded validity indicators. Pulmonary testing followed standard guidelines. Brain MRI included structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and arterial spin labeling to quantify volumetrics, white matter hyperintensities, diffusion metrics, and cerebral perfusion. 129Xe MRI assessed ventilation defects and gas-exchange efficiency; healthy controls completed only the lung-imaging component. Age-adjusted partial correlations linked lung metrics to symptoms, cognition, and MRI measures.

The final sample included 12 Long COVID-19 participants and 10 matched controls, nearly three years post-infection. Long COVID-19 participants frequently reported fatigue, dyspnea, headaches, and substantial cognitive concerns. Yet objective cognitive performance remained normal for all but one participant, who showed domain-specific deficits in executive function, processing speed, and language. Pulmonary function tests were normal for all but one individual, and no group differences emerged in 129Xe gas-exchange values.

Even without group-level lung abnormalities, within-group associations were notable. Lower 129Xe gas-exchange ratios correlated with worse sleep disturbance, higher cerebral perfusion, and poorer executive functioning. Cerebral perfusion itself was strongly tied to sleep problems. Gas-exchange efficiency showed positive correlations with executive function and a trend with global cognitive scores; these persisted after adjusting for anxiety and depression. No associations emerged with subjective cognitive complaints, brain volumes, diffusion metrics, or white matter abnormalities after age adjustment.

Findings suggest that impaired lung gas exchange may be associated with altered cerebral perfusion and sleep disruption, forming a potential physiological pathway that influences Long COVID-19 symptoms. The mismatch between subjective cognitive difficulties and normal objective cognition aligns with prior research and may reflect fluctuating deficits, heightened symptom awareness, or psychological factors.

Strengths include a multimodal design integrating lung imaging, brain MRI, cognitive assessment, and symptom profiling. However, the small sample, partial imaging datasets, and lack of cognitive testing in controls limit generalizability. Age effects and broad composite scoring may obscure subtle deficits. Overall, the results highlight the interconnected nature of gas exchange, cerebral perfusion, and sleep disturbance in Long COVID-19, underscoring the need for larger, controlled studies with comprehensive brain and cognitive assessments to clarify mechanisms and inform targeted interventions.

University of the Witwatersrand - Edson Mwebesa, Fellow at the Wits-based Sub-Saharan Africa Advanced Consortium for Biostatistics (SSACAB), knows children who died from late-diagnosed malaria. His research has also revealed that malaria is more prevalent in pregnant Ugandan women than in any other population. Malaria is also endemic across Africa, impacting all aspects of social and economic life.

Mwebesa, a biostatistician, wanted to dive deeper into what made people choose methods to help prevent malaria. He focused on social and behavioral change messaging, an essential part of encouraging people to use insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). While messaging campaigns have been implemented in the media, hospitals, and schools, the question of whether these messages actually change behavior remains uncertain.

Robust biostatistics methods used by African experts are set to change this.

Mwebesa applied a quasi-experimental causal inference method, known as Propensity Score Matching, to investigate this phenomenon. This approach can measure, with precision, whether messaging actually changes behavior.

Traditionally, measuring messaging impact relied on simple correlations and on counting how many people heard a message and whether they used a mosquito bed net. But correlation cannot reveal whether the messages caused the behavior, which in this case is using the mosquito net. Those who heard or saw the messages might differ from those who did not, and thus, the use of mosquito nets might not be comparable between these groups. Those who hear malaria messages are often wealthier, more educated, or better connected, and these factors independently increase bed net use. This has made it difficult for policymakers to know whether expensive behavior-change campaigns genuinely deliver impact.

Mwebesa measured the impact of messaging aimed at women in Uganda. In that country, about one in four children under five years old tested positive for malaria. In some districts, incidence rates over six-month periods have exceeded 500 cases per 1000 people, demonstrating how quickly the disease can spread in high-transmission settings. Malaria causes fever, chills, weakness, anaemia, and in some cases, complications involving the brain, lungs and other organs. Beyond the clinical burden, malaria disrupts schooling, reduces productivity and places immense strain on household finances, particularly among poorer families.

Understanding how to drive preventive behavior in this context is both a scientific and operational priority. Historically, however, researchers lacked the tools and data required to measure the impact of health communication. In 2001, economists John Luke Gallup and Jeffrey Sachs, writing in The Intolerable Burden of Malaria, explained that reliable data on malaria incidence were lacking for many of the most severely affected countries.

They constructed an indirect malaria index using historical risk maps, estimates of the proportion of falciparum malaria and population distribution data. Their work was pioneering but constrained by limited information, underscoring how weak data systems restricted the ability to study malaria's economic and social effects. They could not measure behavior or the effectiveness of prevention campaigns. They could only infer risk.

We're in a different position now. We have conducted repeated Malaria Indicator Surveys, geocoded demographic data, collected extensive health record data, and improved surveillance systems. What's most exciting, though, is how we are growing the capacity to analyse data using modern causal methods."" 

Edson Mwebesa, Fellow at the Wits-based Sub-Saharan Africa Advanced Consortium for Biostatistics

Institutions such as SSACAB have trained a new generation of African biostatisticians who can use advanced techniques to answer complex policy questions that were previously out of reach.

Mwebesa used nationally representative data from the 2018–19 Malaria Indicator Survey and examined whether exposure to malaria messages increases the use of insecticide-treated nets among women of reproductive age and children under five in Uganda. The descriptive findings show that 37.6 per cent of women aged 15–49 and 37.9 per cent of caregivers of young children had been exposed to malaria prevention messages in the six months preceding the survey. Net use was higher but not universal: 69.3 per cent of women reported sleeping under an insecticide-treated net the night before the survey, as did 71.8 per cent of children under five.

Mwebesa's use of propensity score matching paired each woman who was exposed to malaria messages with another woman who was not, but who shared similar characteristics, such as age, education level, wealth, household size, region, and urban or rural residence. By ensuring that the two groups are comparable, the method isolates the effect of the messaging itself.

""For years, people assumed that malaria messages influenced behavior, but this analysis shows, with causal evidence, exactly how much they matter. Our findings demonstrate that communication increases net use. We can now quantify this,"" he said.

After matching, women who were exposed to malaria messages were 5.1 percent more likely to sleep under an insecticide-treated net than similar women who were not exposed. Among children, caregivers' exposure to messages increased ITN use by 4.3 percent.

These differences, when applied nationally, translate into tens of thousands of additional protected households and reduced malaria direct and indirect costs. The study also identified which communication channels were major sources of malaria messages. Radio emerged as the dominant messaging channel, reaching roughly two-thirds of women and caregivers. Community health workers and interpersonal communication were also influential. Digital platforms were used far less frequently, suggesting an untapped potential.

Professor Tobias Chirwa, Principal Investigator for SSACAB and Head of the Wits School of Public Health, explains why this type of work matters for Africa's statistical future. ""This study shows what becomes possible when we combine strong African data with strong African statistical capacity. We move from describing problems to measuring impact. That is the essence of statistical innovation. African biostatisticians are leading analyses that were impossible twenty years ago.""

In light of African Statistics Day, this work reflects an important shift in statistical justice and evidence sovereignty. Africa is no longer dependent on global assumptions or incomplete models. It can produce high-quality causal evidence that speaks to households' lived realities and informs local policy with accuracy and confidence. This, in turn, supports more efficient investments in communication campaigns, builds equity by identifying which groups are least reached and strengthens the effectiveness of malaria prevention efforts across the continent.

African Statistics Day 2025 highlights the theme of leveraging innovations in data and statistics to promote a just, peaceful, inclusive and prosperous society for Africans. In the field of malaria prevention, this theme is particularly resonant.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Fame may shorten singers' lives beyond occupational hazards","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251126/Fame-may-shorten-singerse28099-lives-beyond-occupational-hazards.aspx","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 07:56:00 GMT","

Fame itself may be a critical factor in shortening singers' lives beyond the hazards of the job-at least those in the UK/Europe and North America-suggests research published online in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health.

These stars seem to die around 4 years earlier, on average, than their peers who haven't achieved celebrity status, and the effects of fame are on a par with certain other health risks, suggest the researchers.

Previously published research indicates that famous singers tend to die earlier than the general public. But it's far from clear whether it's fame itself, the demands of the music industry, or the lifestyle associated with being a musician, which contribute to this heightened risk, explain the researchers.

To shed more light on this conundrum, they retrospectively compared the risk of death in 648 singers, half of whom had achieved celebrity status and half of whom hadn't. 

Each of the 324 stars was matched for birth year, gender, nationality, ethnicity, music genre and solo/lead singer in a band status with their lesser known peers. 

Most (83.5%) were male, and the average year of birth was 1949, but ranged from 1910 to 1975. Over half (61%) the singers were from North America, with the remainder from Europe/the UK. And most were White (77%), with only 19% being of Black and 4% of other or mixed ethnicities. 

Most singers were in the Rock genre (65%), followed by R&B (14%), Pop (9%), New-Wave (6%), Rap (4%), and Electronica (2%). Over half (59%) the singers were in a band; 29% were solo artists; and 12% performed both solo and in a band. 

The sample of famous singers was drawn from the Top 2000 Artists of All Time on acclaimedmusic.net, a database that aggregates global rankings based on published lists from music critics, journalists, and industry professionals, but not audience polls or sales data.

Only artists active after 1950 and before 1990 were included to gather sufficient tracking information on the risk of death by the end of December 2023.

Analysis of the data showed that, on average, famous singers survived until they were 75; less famous singers survived until they were 79. 

While band membership was associated with a 26% lower risk of death compared with going it alone, the inclusion of this variable didn't influence the overall effect of fame, as famous singers were still 33% more likely to die earlier than their less well known counterparts.

Only two (0.6%) of the stars achieved fame posthumously, and the heightened risk of death started only once fame had been achieved and remained significantly associated throughout the period of fame. 

This suggests that the heightened risk of death isn't attributable to baseline differences or to reverse causation, whereby earlier death contributes to fame, but that this risk emerges specifically after the attainment of fame, say the researchers.

""Together, the analyses indicate that an elevated risk emerges specifically after achieving fame, which highlights fame as a potential temporal turning point for health risks including mortality. Beyond occupational explanations, our findings suggest that fame adds further vulnerability within an already at-risk group,"" they explain.

The heightened risk associated with fame is comparable to other known health risks, such as occasional smoking, which confers a heightened risk of death of 34%, they add.

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that their study sample wasn't global and was confined to singers, meaning that their observations might not apply to other regions of the world or to other domains of fame, such as acting or sport.

But a possible explanation for the findings may lie in ""the unique psychosocial stress that accompanies fame, such as intense public scrutiny, performance pressure, and loss of privacy,"" they suggest.

""These stressors may fuel psychological distress and harmful coping behaviours, making fame a chronic burden that amplifies existing occupational risk,"" they add.

Fame brings with it significant financial security, a factor that is frequently associated with healthy ageing, while wealth is usually associated with a lower risk of premature death, they point out.

But they conclude: ""Being famous appears so detrimental that it overrides any potential benefits associated with high socioeconomic status. Again, this highlights the increased vulnerability of famous individuals, suggesting a need for targeted protection and support for this population.""

This article and associated images are based on a poster originally authored by Nermeen Ali, Heather Coleman, Azza Taher, Marwa Sarg and Noha Hilmy Elnagdi and presented at ELRIG Drug Discovery 2025 in affiliation with Ulster University, Cairo University, October 6 University, Al-Azhar University and Modern University for Technology and Information.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to relieve pain and inflammation by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis 1.

However, NSAIDs can have many adverse effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding 2. Some examples of pyrazole derivatives, such as Deracoxib, Ramifenazone, and Pyraclonil, have been reported as potent NSAIDs.3

To rationally design, synthesize, and biologically evaluate a new series of pyrazole-pyrazoline derivatives as structural analogues of Celecoxib, Indomethacin, and Floctafenine. The aim is to develop selective COX-2 inhibitors possessing enhanced antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy and improved safety profiles.

Novel pyrazole-pyrazoline derivatives were synthesized via the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction followed by condensation and cyclization steps to yield amide and ester analogues. Structures were confirmed using elemental analysis, IR, ¹H NMR, and MS spectroscopy.

Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by the carrageenan-induced paw oedema test, while analgesic activity was evaluated with the acetic acid-induced writhing test in rats. Molecular docking was performed on the COX-2 enzyme (PDB ID: 4Z0L) to evaluate binding interactions and rationalize biological results.

Most of the newly synthesized derivatives showed significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities compared with Indomethacin. Compounds 14b, 15b, and 22 produced the highest oedema inhibition (28.6-30.9 %) and analgesic effects (up to 84.5 % inhibition).

Docking studies revealed that compound 14b exhibited the strongest COX-2 binding affinity (-16.39 kcal/mol), forming key H-bonds with Arg120, Val349, and Ala527. The correlation between docking scores and in vivo activity supports their potential as selective COX-2 inhibitors

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) evaluation demonstrated that extending the alkyl chain and incorporating amide or ester functionalities significantly enhanced the anti-inflammatory and analgesic profiles.

Compounds 13b, 14b, and 15b with longer carbon chains exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity (28.6-30.9 % inhibition), whereas pyrazoline analogues 18 and 22 showed the highest analgesic response (up to 84.5 % inhibition).

Cyclization to pyrazolines and fusion with a quinoline scaffold improved both potency and COX-2 selectivity. Molecular docking corroborated the experimental findings, identifying compound 14b as the most active through key interactions with Arg120, Arg513, Ser119, Val349, and Ala527 within the COX-2 active site.

With a new study in the journal Cell, researchers at Stanford University and Stockholm University have contributed to increased knowledge about gene regulation in human cells.

How genes are turned on and off is crucial for the body's cells to have different functions. In this process, certain proteins, so-called transcription factors, find and recognize different binding sites on DNA in the body's cells to drive on or off signals. When this recognition goes wrong, it can give rise to many different types of diseases, such as cancer.

Now a group of researchers at Stanford University and Stockholm University have studied in detail how DNA recognition works for one key transcription factor. This particular protein, known as KLF1, is essential for the development of red blood cells which carry oxygen around the body. In this study, they developed new experimental methods to make more precise measurements of how KLF1 interacts with DNA both in test tubes and in human cells.

""The most important result is that we show it is possible to understand the binding between this transcription factor and DNA in human cells, and that this behavior is consistent with what we measure in test tubes. That is an important basic science discovery"", says Emil Marklund, assistant professor at the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Stockholm University and SciLifeLab, who has participated in the study that is now published in the journal Cell.

Transcription factor binding to DNA controls a lot in biology and causes the body's cells to have different functions, explains Emil Marklund:

""It is this process that controls that, for example, a nerve cell in the brain has different gene expression than a cell in the immune system. When the binding goes wrong, it can give rise to a great many different types of diseases. Genetic studies show that more than half of all mutations linked to traits such as genetic diseases occur in DNA sequence regions where transcription factors bind.""

First author Julia Schaepe, a PhD student in the Greenleaf Lab at Stanford University, emphasizes broader impacts from the study's insights into how transcription factors read DNA:

""We discovered that this transcription factor pays attention to much more of the DNA sequence surrounding its binding sites than previously thought. By combining precise measurements in both test tubes and human cells with physical models, we were able to build a more complete picture of how DNA recognition works and, therefore, how gene regulation is encoded by DNA.""

A study co-led by investigators at the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center found that most of the benefits of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer occur within the first 9 to 12 months. Extending therapy beyond that provides only small additional protection and increases the risk of other health problems, such as heart or metabolic issues. Results show that the ideal length of ADT depends on cancer risk:

ADT is a type of hormone therapy that is commonly given alongside radiation to slow the growth of prostate cancer by lowering testosterone. While effective at controlling the disease, long-term ADT can cause side effects, including bone loss, muscle loss and cardiovascular problems. Current treatment guidelines generally recommend 4 to 6 months of ADT for intermediate-risk patients and 18 to 36 months for high-risk patients, but the optimal duration has been unclear.

Researchers conducted a Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials in Cancer of the Prostate (MARCAP) Consortium using data from 10,266 men across 13 international clinical trials. They assessed outcomes including overall survival, cancer-specific survival and deaths from other causes, comparing different ADT durations. 

The findings highlight the importance of personalized treatment plans for men with prostate cancer. Shorter courses of hormone therapy may be sufficient for many patients, reducing side effects while maintaining effectiveness. Physicians can now use patient-specific factors, including cancer risk, overall health, age and preferences, to make more informed decisions about ADT duration, improving both safety and quality of life.

Prostate cancer treatment should not be one-size-fits-all. These findings help doctors personalize therapy, balancing cancer control with potential side effects and other health risks.""

A global analysis shows how modern lifestyles erode microbial diversity, destabilize gut communities, and amplify immune stress signals, revealing hidden biological costs of industrialization.

*Important notice:  bioRxiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

In a study posted to the bioRxiv preprint* server, an international team of researchers analyzed how lifestyle and levels of industrialization influence the structure of the human gut microbiome.

Their findings indicate links between industrialization and less diverse, more uniform microbiomes. Populations in more industrialized regions also showed signs of reduced community stability and heightened immune activity, including elevated gut stress markers.

Industrialized lifestyles have repeatedly been associated with major shifts in the gut microbiome, including reduced diversity, altered microbial compositions, and distinct metabolic traits. But these patterns could reflect many confounding factors, such as diet, genetics, geography, immune status, infectious exposures, and inconsistent sampling.

Another open question is whether industrialization-linked microbiome changes destabilize microbial communities or influence host immune and inflammatory responses. 

To resolve these issues, researchers require globally diverse populations and standardized, multidimensional microbiome and host datasets. The Global Microbiome Conservancy (GMbC) cohort was created to meet this need.

The GMbC enrolled 1,015 healthy adults from 12 countries and 35 local populations, representing broad variation in age, BMI, ethnicity, environment, and subsistence strategies. Participants reported no chronic or infectious disease at enrollment. This design captured large gradients in industrialization, urbanization, and subsistence while documenting detailed dietary habits.

Shotgun metagenomic sequencing profiled taxonomic and functional features. Human genotyping defined genetic diversity and admixture. Researchers compiled extensive metadata on lifestyle, diet, environment, and demographics, then reduced it to principal components (PCs) representing industrialization, diet, and host genetics. These PCs informed association tests, multivariate models, and variance partitioning.

Across the cohort, industrialization emerged as the single strongest determinant of gut microbiome structure. More industrialized populations showed markedly reduced alpha diversity and more homogenized community compositions, patterns observed across continents and within individual countries like Ghana and Cameroon.

Although diet, genetics, geography, age, sex, and BMI contributed meaningfully, industrialization (PC1-Lifestyle) explained the largest share of overall variation. Variance partitioning models showed these factors jointly explained up to 58% of beta diversity and allowed non-redundant effects to be separated.

Many bacterial species displayed consistent lifestyle-linked changes across multiple countries. While canonical “industrialization marker taxa” such as Bacteroides and Prevotella remained significant, others (e.g., Treponema, Akkermansia) lost significance after adjusting for confounders.

Functionally, 1,438 KEGG genes were more strongly associated with lifestyle than diet or genetics. Industrialized microbiomes were enriched in pathways including cobalamin (vitamin B12) biosynthesis and propanoyl-CoA metabolism, suggesting metabolic rewiring during lifestyle transitions.

Co-abundance network reconstruction showed that industrialized populations exhibited denser positive associations, fewer negative correlations, and decreased ecological stability, patterns consistent with lower resilience.

Despite the lower prevalence of gut eukaryotic protists in industrialized groups, IgA-sequencing revealed heightened immune activity. Although IgA-targeting patterns were broadly conserved across populations, specific taxa such as Phocaeicola vulgatus and Gemmiger OTUs showed lifestyle-associated differences.

The study highlights that microbiome-based disease prediction models developed in industrialized, primarily European cohorts do not generalize well to other populations. This underscores a significant equity gap and the need for globally representative clinical cohorts.

The elevated gut stress markers in industrialized populations raise the possibility that low-diversity microbiomes may influence physiological disruption or increase vulnerability to disease.

Complementary co-culture experiments from the same GMbC cohort support this hypothesis, showing amplified inflammatory responses to industrialized microbiomes.

The authors stress that some variation remains difficult to disentangle due to collinearity between diet and lifestyle. Future efforts will prioritize longitudinal sampling, regional capacity building, and context-specific interventions aimed at conserving global microbiome diversity.

Overall, expanding the GMbC framework will deepen mechanistic understanding, improve disease model accuracy, and ensure that microbiome science reflects diverse human experiences worldwide.

This article is based on a poster originally authored by Rachel Daniels, Yu Chen, Spencer Chiang, Tianfu Zhang and Yuehchun Hsieh.

Gene and cell therapies rely heavily on culturing immune cells in vitro, a step that remains critical to their development.

Due to the specialized and diverse nature of immune cells, such as T, NK, and macrophages, as well as subpopulations like γδT cells, each cell type requires its own customized media.

Conventional, one-size-fits-all media are unable to effectively support the development of these therapies because each immune cell population has distinct metabolic requirements, cytokine dependencies, and activation pathways.

In addition, specialized media for cell sub-populations are also not amenable when exploring different cell types.

Lengthy optimization processes in cell culturing are often required to achieve changes to target immune cell types, for example, the modification of CAR-T therapies to CAR-NK ones.

A recent study by ACROBiosystems has led to the development of a two-part medium comprising a universal basal medium alongside custom-formulated supplements that have been optimized and tailored for specified immune cell subpopulations.

This novel approach allows the creation of adaptable, fine-tuned media tailored to accommodate the specific functional and biological needs of each cell type. This is enabled by systematically adjusting critical media components, including nutrients, growth factors, cytokines, and serum alternatives.

Two different supplements have been developed to be paired with a universal basal medium: NK cells and γδT cells. The NK cell and γδT cell supplements demonstrate a 1,000- and 17,600-fold increase, respectively, at a purity of 97 % and 93 %.

Each developed cell media is highly customizable, allowing researchers to adopt and implement highly specific cell media for different cell subpopulations with ease. This customizability resulted in improved efficiency within a range of cell types as part of immune cell therapy research.

Figure 3. Measurement of remaining target cells was performed after 7-AAD/CFSE staining and analyzed via ELISA. NK cells were used to evaluate cytotoxicity at several E:T ratios, revealing that more than 30 % of target cells were lysed at the lowest ratio, similar to control NK cells.

Figure 4. (A) Expansion fold and (B) viability of γδT cells were evaluated from PBMCs cultured with Basal Medium, T cell Expansion Supplement, and GMP Immune Cell Supplement D. Expansion fold exceeds 3,600 with a viability of more than 90 % across the culture period. Image Credit: ACROBiosystems



Figure 5. Cell population percentage of γδ2T after culturing using either phenol red or phenol red-free medium resulted in more than 80 %. After two weeks, a high percentage of γδ2T was achieved, using the addition of several supplements alongside the traditional basal medium, revealing the capability to tailor media to a specific subpopulation.

The development of this universal basal medium paired with custom supplements represents an efficient and versatile solution for culturing diverse immune cell subpopulations.

The approach described here supports the distinct biological and physiological requirements of each cell type by allowing the precise adjustment of nutrients, growth factors, cytokines, and serum alternatives.

The method presented here has been shown to be highly effective, enabling the successful expansion of NK cells and γδT cells, resulting in 1,000- and 17,600-fold increases at high purity.

This customizable media also streamlined the transition between different immune cell targets, lowering required optimization time and improving the scalability of gene and cell therapy research.

Dysfunctional breathing (DB) is frequently misdiagnosed or insufficiently treated, leading to a diminished quality of life and unnecessary medical intervention. While recent studies have focused on DB in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its prevalence and contributing factors in the general population remain unclear. Additionally, tobacco use may exacerbate both respiratory symptoms and underlying comorbidities, while potentially contributing to DB.

A team led by Osaka Metropolitan University researchers aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DB, as well as its associated factors. Furthermore, the researchers examined the interaction between tobacco use and respiratory comorbidities in relation to DB prevalence.

A cross-sectional Internet-based survey was conducted among 29,268 participants from the general Japanese population using the Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ), a validated tool with high sensitivity and specificity for DB diagnosis. The findings indicated a DB prevalence of 11.0%. Univariable logistic analysis identified significant associations between DB prevalence and respiratory comorbidities, including asthma, COPD, and bronchitis/pneumonia. Notably, non-respiratory conditions such as epilepsy and cerebrovascular disease were also significantly correlated with DB. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that current tobacco use and respiratory comorbidities further increased DB prevalence.

These findings suggest that DB is relatively common in primary healthcare settings, and exacerbated by tobacco use, particularly among individuals with respiratory comorbidities. Recognizing and addressing factors associated with DB is crucial for improving diagnosis, treatment, and overall patient outcomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Most public speakers at FDA advisory committees support drug approval","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251125/Most-public-speakers-at-FDA-advisory-committees-support-drug-approval.aspx","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 02:13:00 GMT","

U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committees play a key role in evaluating the efficacy and safety of new drugs. They include open public hearing sessions, whereby patients, clinicians, and advocates share input. To assess the experiences and perspectives of public speakers, Mass General Brigham researchers reviewed minutes and transcripts from 161 FDA Human Drug Advisory Committee meetings held from 2015 to 2023 and found that most public speakers support drug approval - especially patients or family members with personal experience using the drug and those who reported conflicts of interest (COI). Findings are published in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The study found 96% of meetings included public speakers. When assessing the 1,481 testimonies from 1,217 unique individuals, researchers discovered patients and family members accounted for the highest percentage of speaker testimonies (48%), followed by clinicians (21%), public health advocates who didn't come from organizations that represented specific diseases (13%), and patient advocates (10%).

Overall, 82% of the speakers supported drug approval and 43% disclosed a COI, typically that they or the organization they represent have received financial support from a drug manufacturer. The authors note COI reporting is not mandatory and this number may be an underrepresentation. Speakers with a COI were 11% more likely to support the drug than those who did not report a COI. For most speaker types, the majority supported approval; the lone exception was that 72% of testimonies by public health advocates did not support drug approval. Support was highest among patients and family members with personal experience using the drug – often through clinical trials. Of this group, 99% supported approval.

The voices of patients and advocates are vital, but to ensure more balanced input, the FDA should seek contributions from a broader range of perspectives and strengthen efforts to monitor and mitigate conflicts of interest among public participants.""

Leah Rand, DPhil, lead author, research scientist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine

The authors recommended more robust transparency measures, such as mandatory COI disclosures and methods to independently assess potential conflicts, such as through Open Payments platform for clinicians or organizations' tax filings. They also called on the FDA to consider strategies to solicit input from a broader array of stakeholders.

The study was not designed to determine the degree to which public comments influence committee votes or FDA decisions.

NWSL

Emma Hayes pictured before the start of the game against Portugal at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field. David Butler II / II-Imagn Images

Emma Hayes gets asked one question a lot, or, at least, many versions of the same question.

What does the U.S. women's national team head coach have to say about American players leaving the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) for Europe?

“It's a subject I've spoken about so many times,” Hayes told reporters ahead of the NWSL Championship in San Jose last weekend. “My job as the national team coach is to support the players in whatever they want to do, and it's not going to change.”

This question has followed Hayes all year, initially sparked by Naomi Girma and Jenna Nighswonger leaving their respective NWSL clubs for Chelsea and Arsenal. This came up again when Alyssa Thompson made her record move from Angel City FC to Chelsea in September.

The conversation has again resurfaced now that Washington Spirit forward Trinity Rodman, who has expressed interest in playing in Europe, is officially a free agent. As she weighs up her future, European clubs have approached the 23-year-old, and one Gainbridge Super League club, DC Power, has offered the star a contract neither the Spirit nor any NWSL club could counter, according to sources who have been briefed on negotiations.

In Rodman's case, that conversation has hinged around the NWSL salary cap, which limits what clubs can offer players. European clubs have no similar restrictions. Hayes recently expressed her support for Rodman, but declined to speculate on what the NWSL should do.

She did, however, have thoughts on that question she keeps receiving.

To Hayes, who was Chelsea's manager for 12 years, the reignited conversation about U.S. players exiting the NWSL, and what that means for the league at large, fails to consider the bigger picture — that, in the history of women's football, players pushed for the opportunities current players now have. This, she stressed, should be celebrated.

In speaking with reporters last weekend, Hayes wondered aloud why her counterpart, U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino, whose USMNT pool includes several players who play abroad, wasn't frequently asked the same question.

“It almost feels like we always have to ask that question because it's women,” Hayes said. “Now, all of a sudden, women get the opportunity to choose. We should celebrate the position that women are in, to be able to do that. We shouldn't shoehorn it. We can have an incredible league and still have incredible U.S. women's national team players that play both here and abroad.”

There was a time when playing on the U.S. women's national team was intricately linked to playing in the NWSL. The U.S. Soccer Federation once subsidized the salaries of two dozen national team players, which meant U.S. Soccer could call them to training camps outside of FIFA windows. Foreign clubs were not required to release players in such a way. This, ultimately, created a culture where, to reach the U.S. senior team, players needed to be stateside.

It's why Lindsey Heaps, one of the current captains of the USWNT, signed with the Portland Thorns in 2016 after four years at Paris Saint-Germain in France. She aspired to make that year's Olympic roster and made the move after a conversation with then-U.S. head coach Jill Ellis.

The arrangement between U.S. Soccer and the NWSL ended in 2022, when the federation and USWNT Players' Association reached a new collective bargaining agreement establishing equal pay and effectively lifting any assumed restrictions on U.S. players and the leagues they played in.

“I have the conversation with the players, they're so grateful to the generations before them (for) putting them in the position to be able to bring to life what might be childhood dreams,” Hayes said. “I always compare it to studying abroad. It's funny — if our kids go and study abroad (and) say, ‘Hey, we're gonna spend a year abroad in France,' parents will go, ‘Amazing!' But when it comes to soccer, it's like you can't leave.

“It doesn't mean we're always going to lose people forever, and it doesn't mean we're gonna lose everyone. We just have to accept that different things matter to different people.”

Hayes referenced 21-year-old Jaedyn Shaw, who recently made one of the biggest intra-league moves in NWSL history. Gotham FC acquired Shaw from North Carolina Courage in a record $1.25 million transfer. Shaw has thrived with Gotham and was critical to helping the team secure their second NWSL Championship last weekend. Hayes has praised Shaw's decision and Gotham for identifying a player who has fitted so well into their environment.

Similarly, Thompson has thrived on the pitch at Chelsea. Thompson, like Shaw, forwent college soccer. But Thompson was drafted by her hometown NWSL club, Angel City FC, as the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL Draft. It wasn't long before she was teammates with her sister, Giselle. A move to Europe offered her a new challenge far from home.

Hayes has been supportive of both players' decisions and used their cases as examples when making her point. “I find it fascinating,” Hayes said. “It's a question that keeps coming up, but it's a question that doesn't get asked in the men's game as much. I think we have to ask ourselves, why do we keep asking this question? It's almost like, as women, it's this sense of duty, instead of, let's celebrate the options that are in front of them.”

While in San Jose last weekend, Hayes appeared on the pre-game NWSL Championship broadcast on CBS and was asked by Ali Riley, one of the match analysts, what advice her former coach gave players when they were weighing major career changes.

“I do what I always do, which is listen, and try to work through all of the different talking points,” Hayes responded. “For some of them, they're working that out. They're trying to work through what it is they want and what they need, and they have a lot of people to support with that.”

This could vary from helping them navigate their futures or footballing advice within their existing environments. “Some of it will just be to seek to understand something they've always wanted to do for them,” Hayes continued. “Some players want to go and play abroad. They've always wanted to do that, whereas some players have no desire whatsoever to leave the U.S.

“It's finding what works for them, and then just helping guide them the best way that I can.”

The U.S. Women's National Team has arrived in Osceola County, setting up training camp in the ChampionsGate area as head coach Emma Hayes prepares her squad for a pair of friendlies against Italy that will close out the 2025 calendar year.

Osceola County has long been a trusted training ground for U.S. Soccer. Both the men's and women's national teams have used local facilities for years, with the men regularly training at Osceola Heritage Park. The Orlando-Kissimmee corridor offers state-of-the-art facilities and a strong fan base that has made it a go-to destination for winter camps.

Hayes named a 26-player training camp roster for the matches, which will see the Americans face the 2025 UEFA Women's Euro semifinalists on Friday, Nov. 28 at Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando and again on Monday, Dec. 1 at Chase Stadium in Ft. Lauderdale. The English-born coach will trim the roster to 23 players for each game day.

The squad features a blend of youth and experience, headlined by veterans Rose Lavelle and Lindsey Heaps. Lavelle, a midfielder with Gotham FC, the 2025 NWSL champions, brings 115 caps and 26 international goals to the roster. Heaps, now playing for Lyon in France, leads the team with 167 appearances and 38 goals for the national team.

Young talent will also be on display, including Portland Thorns midfielder Olivia Moultrie, who has registered four goals in 10 caps, and Lily Yohannes, who recently moved to Lyon and has one goal in 11 international appearances.

Local fans will have a player to cheer for as Orlando Pride defender Emily Sams earned a call-up to the 26-player roster. Sams, who has six caps for the national team, is one of 10 defenders in camp alongside Gotham FC's Emily Sonnett, who brings 112 caps of international experience.

The Nov. 28 match at Inter&Co Stadium, home of the 2024 NWSL champion Orlando Pride, marks the ninth time the USWNT has played at the venue. The Americans last appeared there in February 2023, opening the SheBelieves Cup with a 2-0 victory over Canada on two goals from Mallory Swanson.

Kickoff for the Orlando match is set for 7 p.m. on Black Friday The game will be broadcast on TNT and Max in English, with Spanish-language coverage on Universal and Peacock.

The matches against Italy provide Hayes with a final opportunity to evaluate her player pool before the 2026 calendar year, as the program continues building toward future competitions under her leadership.

Get unrivaled matchday access

Just over a year since U.S. Soccer announced the technical staff additions to complement newly minted head coach Mauricio Pochettino, first assistant coach Jesús Pérez—who's been alongside Pochettino for nearly two decades—has sky-high expectations for the U.S. Men's National Team as it prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil.

“We really believe that we can win it,” Pérez said of the upcoming tournament. “We know that everything has to be on your side to win it. We have to focus on ourselves, to know how we can be very competitive, that we have to win matches through all the different phases of the game.""

As someone who is always by the side of the Argentine manager—whether it's on the sideline, at appearances or at post-match press conferences—Pérez knows firsthand the identity that a Pochettino-led group works to embody.

""We are trying to be very efficient in possession, take advantage of set-pieces, penalties; those things that can define a short tournament,” Pérez added. “The most important thing is to keep alive the wish and the dream that you can win matches. There are different moments and examples of teams that did it, they made it, and then wherever football take us, that will be the final result, but we don't want to set any limit.”





Pérez's unabashed belief in Pochettino's coaching philosophies and strategies stems from the pair's lengthy history together. The 54-year-old Barcelona native has been alongside Pochettino at each stop of the latter's managerial career, spending time with RCD Espanyol in his native Barcelona, Southampton FC, Tottenham Hotspur FC, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea FC.

Even before joining forces with Pochettino in 2010, Pérez's football-first upbringing and desire to understand the athlete, both in and out of their respective element, helped develop his current coaching approach.

Though there's nothing like football for Pérez, he's valued learning from other sports and especially appreciates watching the Olympics with its four-year cycle similar to the World Cup. He even had a stint as a swim coach, which he credits with shifting his perspective.

“I was curious how to coach just one athlete,” Pérez explained. “I was able to plan a whole season for only one guy with multiple training sessions, power sessions, all those things. That background helped me understand, and that's why I'm a fan of the individual work, because I really believe a player can improve until he retires. There is always something—a topic, an aspect of him as a person and as a player—that can be improved.”



Improvements both individually and collectively have been evident throughout Pochettino's first full year at the helm. The USMNT shook off a 2W-4L-0D start to 2025 and closed out the year with an impressive 8W-2L-2D stretch, capped off by a five-match unbeaten run against a quintet of opponents ranked in the top 40 of the FIFA World Ranking: Japan, Ecuador, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Pérez credits the USMNT's recent run of form to Pochettino's desire focus less on who they are playing but rather how they are playing.

“We are a coaching staff that represents a coach's philosophy, and [Mauricio Pochettino] is a guy who wants an energetic game,” Pérez stated. “But when I say energetic, [I mean] a team that cares very little about the opponent, a team that is focused week in, week out to improve ourselves, knowing that in front [of us] we have different types of rivals. We want to be able to compete against another team, sometimes using different approaches, but not because we change the approach but because the opponent forces you. We want to be ready to face those different challenges that a dominant team can give us. A team that is reactive can [challenge] us as well.

“That's why it's important to focus on yourself, to improve, how to press high, yes, but to be resilient and well-organized when the opponent forces you to be low. Transition quickly if you can, but if not, have a good positional game. We have a holistic approach to the game, and obviously the players' [mental] states and qualities will dictate what we can do more. We are not refusing to try to do things or to be brave, but to try things with responsibility, if possible. That's why we care very little about the opponent. Opponent is important for us on the build-up of the week, the drills we [conduct], but we don't put too many fears in the players' minds. We want them to be focused on themselves and how we can be better in every single phase of the game.”



With just two international windows and roughly 200 days separating the USMNT from the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Pérez, excited for one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career, is confident that the coaching staff's meticulous preparations will further cultivate belief amongst the players.

“The most important thing is the players' state of mind, because whatever your mind is able to fight against in a short tournament will be very, very important,” Pérez said. “We want them to be prepared, or at least to believe that they can go through any situation and no excuses. We as a staff, we are going to be prepared to help them in between training sessions, in between matches, during the match, with every single proven strategy. But the key factor will be the belief.”","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

The United States men's national team have qualified for 12 World Cups — 10 through he gauntlet of qualification and two more as hosts.

MORE — 2026 World Cup hub | USMNT schedule | USMNT all-time records

This summer's World Cup makes it a dozen, and the expanded 48-team field, matches on home soil, and talent on the team and in the coaches' box have fans and the federation dreaming big.

But before Mauricio Pochettino's men take the field, let's take a look at how the Americans have fared in the last 95+ years.

There are a couple of ways to slice this particular pie.

The Americans finished in third place at the first ever World Cup, though that was a pretty primitive affair; The 1930 World Cup was a 16-nation tournament that from which 13 teams competed in part because one, Egypt, missed their boat due a storm.

The home World Cup in 1994 was brilliant for the program, and the 2014 World Cup features perhaps the best delivery of performances, but you can't overlook 2002.

For one thing, it's literally the only knockout win the Yanks have at a tournament and it came against heated rivals Mexico. And they would've needed to find a goal at some point, but they were denied a chance at a penalty and the lead at the quarterfinal against Germany because not a single referee saw a clear handball on the goal line

What might've been.



Sixteen nations qualified for the first World Cup, with two withdrawing and a third, Egypt, missing their ship when a storm delayed their connection.

The Yanks were in a three-team group and rode four goals from Massachusetts' Bert Patenaude to the semifinals, where they lost to Argentina. The Yanks were awarded third place.

Group 4USMNT 3-0 Belgium (McGhee, Florie, Patenaude)USMNT 3-0 Paraguay (Patenaude x3)

SemifinalArgentina 6-1 USMNT (Brown)



All 16 teams made it to Italy for the second World Cup, and the tournament was played a single-elimination bracket tournament.

The hosts demolished the Americans in their first game, with Pennsylvania-born Aldo Donelli scoring the only U.S. goal.

Round of 16Italy 7-1 USMNT



World War II threw a long pause at the World Cup, and the Yanks failed to qualify in 1938 as they withdrew from their intercontinental playoff qualifier with the Dutch East Indies.

They'd finish bottom of their group in 1950 but begin their baffling World Cup mastery of England by beating the Three Lions 1-0 on a goal from Joe Gaetjens. The Columbia University student from Haiti had declared his intention of becoming a U.S. citizen and was thus allowed to play. He'd later return to play for Haiti. Sorry, England!

Group 2Spain 3-1 USMNT (Pariani)USMNT 1-0 England (Gaetjens)Chile 5-2 (Wallace, Maca)



1954 qualifying: The Yanks beat Haiti twice but were beaten twice by Mexico as El Tri took the lone spot from what would become CONCACAF in 1961.

1958 qualifying: The U.S. went 0-4 against Canada and Mexico, finishing with a minus-16 goal differential.

1962 qualifying: A 3-3 home draw with Mexico did not see the scoring form continue in Mexico City, and El Tri won 3-0 to reach the second round.

1966 qualifying: The U.S. again drew Mexico at home but were beaten in Mexico City. They took two of three points from Honduras (wins were worth two points and draws one) to finish second and bow out prior to the final round.

1970 qualifying: Better! The Yanks won 3-of-4 from Canada and Bermuda, losing in Toronto. The second round saw home-and-away losses to Haiti to make it 20 years between World Cups. That number would grow.

1974 qualifying: Bounced from Group 1, taking a point at home to Canada but losing their other three games.

1978 qualifying: This one stings. The Yanks were again in the North American Zone, but this time two of Canada, Mexico, and the USMNT would reach the next round. All three teams claimed four points with Mexico in first and both Canada and the Yanks boasting the same goal differential. A playoff in Haiti saw Canada smash the States 3-0.

1982 qualifying: Third again behind Canada and Mexico, eliminated even before beating El Tri in Fort Lauderdale for the final qualifier.

1986 qualifying: Beat Netherlands Antilles to reach the final round of qualifying. Needed a draw or win vs Costa Rica in California to reach the World Cup, five days after drawing Los Ticos 1-1 in Alajuela. Lost 1-0



The Yanks returned to the big stage, ironically with Mexico missing out for using overaged players at the 1988 CONCACAF U20 Tournament. Beat Jamaica in the first round, then sealed their spot in Italy thanks to Paul Caligiuri's “Shot Heard Round the World” vs Trinidad and Tobago.

Group AUSMNT 1-5 CzechoslovakiaItaly 1-0 USMNTAustria 2-1 USMNT



One of the many stories of hosts' getting good results in the tournament over the years.

The Yanks made it to the Round of 16 as the third-best third-placed teams, then kept Brazil scoreless into the 72nd minute in Stanford. A Bebeto goal sent the Yanks packing with a buttressed reputation.

Round of 16Brazil 1-0 USMNT



This tournament is best left discussed by others. Oof.

Group FGermany 2-0 USMNTUSMNT 1-2 IranUSMNT 0-1 Yugoslavia



This was the year that minted thousands of passionate USMNT fans, as the Yanks surprised everyone by outlasting Deco's Portugal in the group opener and then knocked rivals Mexico out in the Round of 16. The painful thing is knowing that the Americans were far from second-best in the quarterfinals, a controversial 1-0 loss to a Germany team that barely beat the hosts in the semis. Why controversial? Torsten Frings handball to block Gregg Berhalter on the goal line was somehow not given as a penalty. Look it up if you haven't seen it, because you won't believe it could've been missed by a living, breathing, seeing human being (Yes, still mad). 

Group DUSMNT 3-2 PortugalSouth Korea 1-1 USMNTPoland 3-1 USMNT

Round of 16Mexico 0-2 USMNT

QuarterfinalsGermany 1-0 USMNT



Momentum was neither maintained nor built upon.

No, it wasn't an easy group. Yes, the Italy game was entertaining. No, we do not want to talk about two goals in 270 minutes — one from Italy and one from Clint Dempsey.

Group EUSMNT 0-3 Czech RepublicItaly 1-1 USMNTGhana 2-1 USMNT



The tournament started with a Steven Gerrard fourth-minute goal before soccer remembered that England are not allowed to beat the U.S. at the World Cup. Sorry, we don't make the rules. We just like them. Unbeaten in the group stage and through to the knockouts because of that Landon Donovan stoppage-time goal, the Americans went to extra time with Ghana in the Round of 16, and it's best we speak no more.

Group CEngland 1-1 USMNTSlovenia 2-2 USMNTUSMNT 1-0 Algeria

Round of 16USMNT 1-2 Ghana

We're not supposed to say Group of Death any more because people are uncomfortable with mortality, but oh boy. This was a roller coaster ride. Revenge against Ghana required a late John Brooks winner, then Jurgen Klinsmann's Yanks looked set to go 2-0 all-time against Portugal at the World Cup when Silvestre Varela scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to force a 2-2 draw. Still, that was enough for a knockout round berth. Tim Howard's Matrix-like day was not enough.

Group GGhana 1-2 USMNTUSMNT 2-2 PortugalUSMNT 0-1 Germany

Round of 16Belgium 2-1 (aet) USMNT



This team had so much talent and played with its food. A coaching change from Jurgen Klinsmann to Bruce Arena during qualification didn't stop them from losing at home to Costa Rica and drawing Honduras and Panama away. A blowout of Panama in Matchday 9 opened the door to the throne room if they could just beat Trinidad and Tobago's B team in Couva on October 10, 2017. Whoops.



A disappointing draw with Wales was a point nonetheless thanks to Timothy Weah's first-half goal. Then England didn't even bother to show up to the second match because they know the rules about playing the U.S. at the World Cup and they drew to fall to 2D-1L all-time against the Yanks. Christian Pulisic, of course, then scored the lone goal against Iran and Berhalter's team were onto the Round of 16. Down 2-0 thanks to a nothing first half, the Yanks rallied to within one through sub Haji Wright and out-attempted the Dutch 18-11 but lost 3-1.

The U.S. men's national team eagerly awaits the Dec. 5, 2026 World Cup group stage draw to learn its fate for next summer. Although there's a wide array of possibilities, the draw could set up an absolute nightmare scenario for Mauricio Pochettino's side.

The USMNT finished its 2025 action with a majestic display in a 5–1 victory against Uruguay. The result followed a strong run of five straight unbeaten games to close the year. Since the October international action, Pochettino unlocked the best his side has to offer whilst still missing some key players that will surely contribute in next summer's World Cup.

However, the positive momentum built in recent months could come crashing down if the group stage draw is unkind for the Stars and Stripes. Although the USMNT will avoid many of the favorites given it's automatically placed in pot 1 of the draw, there are other really strong sides that could end up sharing a group with Pochettino's side.

The USMNT already knows when and where it'll play as the top seed in Group D. The only thing left to know is who it'll play and, if the worst case scenario materializes, then Mauricio Pochettino's side could find itself in the infamous “Group of Death.”

Here's the worst possible outcome for the USMNT in the upcoming World Cup group stage draw.

The USMNT cold be drawn against the surprise team of the most recent World Cup: Morocco. The Atlas Lions became the first African nation ever to make the World Cup semifinals in 2022 and it remains the highest ranked African nation in the world (11). Morocco cruised through the World Cup qualifiers and has won 25 of its last 27, losing just twice in 90 minutes since the start of 2024.

Additionally, a cohesive, well-constructed roster that's full of experience could be boosted by the young generation that just conquered the 2025 FIFA U-20 World Cup.

Given the USMNT is a Concacaf nation, it could potentially face two European opponents in the group stage. 

Norway stands out in pot 3 as a team every nation will wish to avoid. Despite it not being a historic international powerhouse, Ståle Solbakken has players such as Erling Haaland, Martin Ødegaard, Alexander Sørloth and Oscar Bobb, that can pick apart any defensive system.

The Nordic outfit has won 12 of its last 13 and hasn't lost since October 2024. Given the quality at its disposal, Norway would be a formidable foe for the USMNT.

As a kicker, the Stars and Stripes could see Italy potentially join its group as the pot 4 representative. The four-time champions are yet to book its place in next summer's tournament, but if it wins its playoff, there's a real chance it could end up joining Pochettino's men in Group D.

Sure, the Azzurri has seen better days, but it still has a handful of world-class talents, has won six of its last seven and boast undeniable World Cup heritage that's usually a factor in the competition. 

Needless to say, if the USMNT draws this group specifically, its confidence would take a hit and its 2026 World Cup could potentially be over after just three games.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino bemoans lack of 'drama' in American soccer","https://www.themirror.com/sport/soccer/usmnt-mauricio-pochettino-drama-soccer-1528885","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 17:48:00 GMT","

For Mauricio Pochettino and soccer fans around the world, “The Beautiful Game” is one of passion and high drama. However, in just over a year as boss of the USMNT, the Argentine has discovered that the approach of fans Stateside varies dramatically from their European and South American cousins.

The former Argentina international, who spent much of his playing career in La Liga with Espanyol before coaching the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, and who is known for his passionate approach, recently told Andrés Cantor how he has realized that soccer is more “entertainment” than drama in the U.S.

“It's like American football, baseball, basketball or hockey. I think they are sports that are born to entertain the masses, right?” Pochettino, 53, said.

“Soccer is a way of entertaining people, of generating a few emotions, generating the possibility of enjoying a victory, but not dramatizing the defeat. Because there is no consequence of a descent in the MLS or of something being dramatic, right?

“At the levels that football, because when we talk about football, in other countries it is the drama, or it is the victory, that is, the defeat is the drama and the victory is the glory. So that already describes a little what the difference between football is. Not a little, it describes very graphically what soccer is to football.”

This is far from the first time Pochettino has bemoaned the lack of “drama” within stadiums during USMNT games, having done so following their 2-1 CONCACAF Gold Cup final loss to Mexico in Houston, where the support from the 70,925 fans felt overwhelmingly in favor of the visiting side.

“I would love to see my players playing with 70,000 people cheering,” Pochettino said post-game. “And for sure, if we feel proud about them, it would be amazing.” He, again, noted how soccer is seen as “entertainment” in the U.S. before calling on fans “to realize” their importance in the outcome of games.

“I think that today, like against Guatemala, it's a thing in our country to see how important the fans are to be in the stadium, to stay with the team, to support, not only through Instagram, social media, or behind the TV,” he said.

“It's to be here and translate the energy. For me, we always talk in America or in South America or in Europe; Football without fans is impossible. And here I think it's time to realize that we need the fans. Because the fans are there and they are so good for sure. And I think it's about to start to support the team.”

Thankfully for soccer fans, perhaps the USMNT's newfound passion on the field is something they can latch on to come the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be held across America, Mexico and Canada.

In recent months, Pochettino's roster selection has somewhat stabilized, built seemingly largely around personalities as much as players. The likes of Diego Luna, Cristian Roldan, and Sebastian Berhalter may not be the biggest names, but each brings fire, energy, and leadership that have perhaps lacked in previous rosters.

Very much a reflection of their coach, this fiery attitude was on full display late in their recent 2-1 friendly win over Paraguay, when a scuffle between Alex Freeman and Diego Gómez provoked a full-out brawl between both sides, clearing the benches and resulting in Paraguay's Omar Alderete being sent off.

While Pochettino publicly denounced the brawl as “very dangerous,” according to Miles Robinson on the MLS YouTube channel, “I think it's something that Poch really gets involved in, he likes that type of stuff, the passion, the heart of the games and situations like that.”

This sentiment was echoed by Max Arfsten, who said following the game, as per The Athletic, “Pochettino always tells us to fight, fight, fight. I think we embody that. These games are gritty and physical, I think this plays into our identity.”

Now with under seven months to go until the World Cup, and with the USMNT undefeated in five games, four of which they have won, perhaps this new-look team, led by an ever-passionate Pochettino, can inspire a fresh approach from fans once the tournament kicks off in Mexico City.

by Daniel Villar Pardo November 26, 2025

Although Achraf Hakimi managed to become one of Paris Saint-Germain‘s most important players and one of the best in the world, the Moroccan was reportedly on the verge of leaving the team. In the midst of his contract renewal talks, Real Madrid, the team that trained him, showed interest in signing him as a free agent at the end of his contract, which was set to expire in 2026. However, one detail caused a radical change, and he signed his renewal with the French team.

According to Diario AS, Achraf Hakimi was approached by Real Madrid amid his contract renewal talks with PSG. With negotiations seemingly at a standstill, the Moroccan was reportedly open to the possibility of moving back to Spain. However, the departure of Kylian Mbappe gave the French team a lot of salary cap space and allowed them to offer an irresistible salary and cornerstone role, which scuppered his return to the club where he started his career.

Hakimi did not return to Real Madrid, yet he has never hidden his passion for the Spanish team. In fact, Movistar+ cameras caught him at the Manuel Martínez Valero Stadium watching the game between Elche and Los Blancos. Having honed his skills at La Fabrica, Los Blancos team's youth academy, he feels a strong connection to the team. Despite this, he consistently shines at Paris Saint-Germain as a key player, earning him the African Ballon d'Or 2025 award.

After spending several years in Real Madrid's youth teams, Achraf Hakimi was promoted to the first team in the 2017-18 season. However, he failed to make much of an impact, playing only 17 games. For this reason, the Moroccan was loaned to Borussia Dortmund, where he impressed with his performances, but it was not enough for Los Blancos to decide to keep him. Therefore, the player revealed details of his departure from the Spanish team.

In PSG's last match against Real Madrid in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, the French team emerged victorious with a resounding 4-0 win. In the mixed zone, legend Claude Makélélé asked the Moroccan how Los Blancos had let a player like him go, to which he replied: “It wasn't me who decided to leave Madrid. It was them who made that decision,” Hakimi said, via DAZN in July 2025.

In 2020, Zinedine Zidane chose to retain Daniel Carvajal as his first-choice player, allowing Achraf Hakimi to transfer to Inter Milan for €43 million (around $49.8 million). Although he excelled as a wing-back, his perceived lack of defensive commitment did not reportedly align with Zidane's plans. However, Achraf Hakimi has since developed into a complete player at Paris Saint-Germain, demonstrating Real Madrid that letting him leave was a clear mistake.

Enzo Maresca's Chelsea team have just beaten Barcelona 3-0 at Stamford Bridge, and the coach should be very proud.

He's coached his team to some important wins, but this might be his biggest achievement yet. We needed to show we were back at the Champions League level, and we sure did that.

His previous peak was perhaps the Club World Cup win against PSG back in July, and according to the Blues coach, that was all part of Chelsea's preparations for this:

“Yeah. For sure [it helped],” Maresca said.

“Winning the Club World Cup gives the players the confidence that they need. Last year, we were playing in the Conference League, and I said many times that for me personally, if you want to build a winning mentality, there is only one way. Winning games. Because otherwise, if you don't win games, it's difficult to convince the players, guys, we are building a winning mentality. But when we don't win, it's difficult.

“So the only way in any competition, Conference League, Champions League this season, Premier League, FA Cup, Carabao Cup, is to win games. It's the only way to build the winning mentality. And I think the Conference League and the Club World Cup last season helped a lot. And now we are trying to do exactly the same. For sure, the players are better players in this moment compared to last season, because we spent more time together.”

Enzo Maresca also discussed the fact that his team kept a clean sheet against Barcelona, meaning they had broken a pretty impressive streak set by the Catalan side.

The Blues were serenaded by their fans all night, and Estevao's performance in particular got him some amusing treatment from the supporters…

Since 1902, the club has been owned by its socios, or formal members, who pay annual fees, elect the board, and vote on key decisions.

Spanish soccer club Real Madrid may be the most valuable sports franchise in the world, and the team is set to show that through the sale of a “symbolic” stake.

Real Madrid is one of the most storied sports franchises with 36 LaLiga championships, 15 Champions League titles, and 9 FIFA World Cup wins. Its structure is very different from what fans are used to in the U.S.—since 1902, it has been owned by its socios, or formal members, who pay annual fees, elect the board, and vote on key decisions. Right now, there are about 100,000 socios.

The club is considering taking outside investment for the first time, team president Florentino Pérez said over the weekend during the club's annual general assembly. The plan would be to create a new subsidiary that would hold a minority stake—Pérez said 5% as an example. It would be a “symbolic” and limited stake, with the socios continuing to have control. Pérez described any investor as “a strategic ally and never an owner,” and said if they “wish to transfer their stake, Real Madrid will always have the right to reclaim it.”

“This way we can know what the club is worth,” he said, according to a translation of his comments. 

Any agreement would require socios approval, and Pérez said he would hold an “extraordinary assembly” for a vote to occur. No time frame was given, and the team did not respond to a request for comment.

The sale of even a small stake in Real Madrid could show it is the most valuable franchise in the world.

“They'd be number one,” says John Textor, who owns multiple soccer clubs, including Lyon in France and Botafogo in Brazil. 

“The Spanish-speaking market has by far the largest number of people watching football,” Textor tells Front Office Sports. “Real Madrid is the mother ship in the mother country.”

The sale of the Lakers at a $10 billion valuation currently holds the record for the highest valuation in a pro sports change-of-control deal, having eclipsed the Celtics sale at a $6.1 billion valuation. A number of NFL teams have recently sold minority stakes at similar valuations, including the Giants, who sold a 10% stake at a valuation of more than $10 billion.

To date, Chelsea holds the record for the highest valuation of a soccer team with its $5.25 billion (£4.25 billion) sale in 2022 to a group led by Todd Boehly (who was also involved in the Lakers deal).

When valuing a sports team, revenue multiples are a common benchmark, alongside brand strength, global reach, and predictable cash flow. Houlihan Lokey's latest report on the sports market illustrates how much these multiples can vary: The Lakers were valued at roughly 18.3 times revenue, while the $1.7 billion sale of the Rays implied a multiple of about 5.6 times revenue.

Real Madrid's most recently reported revenue was a record $1.37 billion (€1.185 billion) for the 2024–25 season. Applying those same multiples, a Lakers-style valuation would put the club at roughly $24 billion (€21 billion), while a midpoint between the Lakers and Rays deals would still imply a valuation of around $16 billion (€14 billion).

Real Madrid is not planning to offload a majority stake. But selling a minority stake to an external investor “protects the club” from being viewed as overpricing itself the next time it asks socio members to commit more capital, according to Peter Grieve, chairman and CEO of Football.Enterprises Inc., which intends to invest in multiple soccer clubs and in June announced a $150 million bond offering to support that plan.

“You're letting the market determine what that value is, and you get to maintain the socio or association structure,” Grieve tells FOS.

Experts say likely buyers for a 5% Real Madrid stake include sovereign wealth funds like the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, or sports-focused private-equity firms like Sixth Street or Arctos Partners. 

Grieve—who previously spent 25 years at Goldman Sachs—cautions that the typical private-equity ownership model isn't ideal for soccer clubs, however. PE funds have defined investment horizons, and after a certain period of time—typically no longer than 10–12 years—they are required to monetize their positions to provide liquidity to limited partners.

“They are not good long-term owners,” Grieve tells FOS.

Cristiano Ronaldo with Portugal coach Roberto Martinez Alexander Hassenstein

The Athletic FC ⚽ is The Athletic's daily football (or soccer, if you prefer) newsletter. Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.

Hello! A key FIFA decision goes Cristiano Ronaldo's way. Who'd have thought it?

On the way:

The “will FIFA ban Cristiano Ronaldo for the start of the World Cup?” suspense was fun while it lasted. Those of you who staked your chips on “not a chance in hell”, collect your winnings now.

Advertisement

A 12-day wait between Ronaldo's red card for violent conduct against the Republic of Ireland and a decision on how to discipline him at least made it look as if the matter was given due consideration, but you could hear the sound of millions across the globe fainting as the cards fell in his favour.

Violent conduct, typically, carries a three-match suspension. While Ronaldo's dismissal forced him to automatically sit out Portugal's final World Cup qualifier — a 9-1 rout of Armenia, in which they missed him greatly — FIFA's disciplinary committee was compelled to consider whether a longer ban was appropriate.

The committee concluded that greater punishment should be imposed. And since Ronaldo's red card had come in a competitive fixture, any ban would apply to competitive fixtures, too, meaning he would potentially miss the opening games of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

But would you believe it? The kind men and women on the panel extended his ban to three games while conveniently ruling that the last two matches of it should be suspended “under a one-year probationary period”. If the 40-year-old keeps his discipline on the pitch for the next six months, he's good to go.

This will doubtless relieve the World Cup's organisers (also FIFA), who would rather one of the sport's most famous faces was present and correct for its big event. After all, it's Ronaldo's sixth World Cup, and he was at the White House with Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino last week. He's only just getting into the swing of things.

To be serious for a second, I've seen worse elbows than Ronaldo's swing at Dara O'Shea. All the same, violent conduct is violent conduct — and in an era of moral panic about football going soft, it's good to know that missing a cakewalk against Armenia is what the custodians of the sport think the offence is worth.

FIFA has confirmed all seedings and procedures for its World Cup draw on December 5 (more on the logistics of that event shortly).

By far the most interesting development is that for the first time, the world governing body is actively keeping the top seeds apart. Spain (ranked No 1) and Argentina (ranked No 2) are on separate sides of the draw and can't meet until the final. France (No 3) and England (No 4) won't play either of those two until the semis, or meet until the final.

All play-off qualifiers, meanwhile, will be lodged in Pot Four, meaning a tough, tough group for four-time winners Italy if they edge through in March. Check out all the permutations here.

The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. will stage the draw a week on Friday. With draining inevitability, FIFA's hiring of it is the source of some controversy.

A U.S. Senate committee has been looking into alleged “cronyism and corruption” at the venue. Henry Bushnell and Adam Crafton have the full details, but a contract now being considered by the Senate Committee appears to list FIFA's rental fee as precisely zero ($0.00 — no conversion to UK pounds needed).

Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell, however, fired back, saying: “FIFA has paid millions, plus covered all expenses.” The money, The Athletic was told, amounts to a $2.4million (£1.8m) donation and further sponsorship opportunities worth $5m. What people want to know is why the finances have been structured this way, rather than standard hire costs. As yet, there's no answer.

It's rarely wise to tempt fate with Chelsea, but they're sneaking up on the rails. They rose to second in the Premier League at the weekend, and last night's demolition of Barcelona at Stamford Bridge ranks as one of Enzo Maresca's best results as head coach.

Chelsea had Barca on toast from minute one, and a 3-0 win against 10 men was as comprehensive as it reads on paper. The pick of the goals was brilliant, scored (above) by the tricky Estevao, whose transfer fee of £28.7m might be weighty for a raw 18-year-old Brazilian, but it looks like money well spent. No wonder Raphinha was recently touting him and Lamine Yamal as the stars of their generation.

Manchester City, on the other hand, threw in another of those weeks they're prone to: defeat to Newcastle United on Saturday, defeat to Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League yesterday. Malik Tillman shone for Leverkusen, and Weston McKennie scoring for Juventus won't disappoint Mauricio Pochettino either. But Jonathan David sealing Juve's 3-2 win at Bodo/Glimt was better news again for Canada. His three-month goal drought is over, and not before time.

Ilias Chair is a skilful and accomplished Championship (English second tier) midfielder for Queens Park Rangers. His international career with Morocco took him to the World Cup in Qatar in 2022.

The biggest headlines about him, though, concerned an incident two years earlier in which a man suffered serious injuries after being hit over the head with a stone during an altercation in southern Belgium. Chair was prosecuted for the attack and sentenced to two years in prison, a penalty reduced to community service and a fine on appeal.

He has spoken to Sarah Shephard about the assault, saying: “I just wish I could take it back. My sincere apologies to that whole family (of the victim).” It's a compelling interview, the likes of which you won't often read.

Chair, 28, isn't asking for sympathy, and I'm not sure he's due any, but I would give him credit for talking about something others might prefer to sweep under the carpet. Read Sarah's chat with him if you can.

Draws for a tournament like the World Cup can be torturously long (and on that note — gird your loins for next Friday). They also have the capacity to be shambolic, at which point they get entertaining.

The draw for the English Women's League Cup yesterday ticked the second box. The social media influencer conducting it peppered the broadcast with innuendo and, at one stage, pulled a ball out of the bag before putting it back in. She also insulted Tottenham Hotspur, prompting an apology to the club from the Women's Super League.

Seemingly, an adjudicator was present, so the pairings were deemed above board. But I'm guessing that TikTok's GK Barry (for it was she) won't be invited back.

FIFA's approach to ticket sales for qualified nations at next year's World Cup could prove controversial


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Football fans across the world will be eagerly anticipating next year's World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico, particularly if their country has qualified.

There will be some newcomers at the tournament: Cape Verde, Curacao, Jordan and Uzbekistan have all qualified for the first time.

And there will be some well-supported bigger nations making the trip to North America, among them England, who qualified under Thomas Tuchel without conceding a goal.

 




But there could be some concern for dedicated international fans about the difficulty of getting tickets for games at World Cup 2026.

That could even apply to fans of host nations, who might find there are far more neutrals in the stadiums.

Canada Soccer have reportedly been given an allocation of just eight percent of the ""purchasable inventory"" for each Canada game at the World Cup.

These will be distributed across various price categories, and will only be available for members of the CanadaRED program.

That would mean just 3,600 available tickets at the 45,000 capacity BMO field in Toronto, and 4,320 tickets at the 54,000-seater B.C. Place in Vancouver.

Other tickets have been earmarked for FIFA, sponsors, media and premium hospitality packages, while the worldwide ticket lottery is now open.

Dynamic pricing will be utilised again, as in Qatar, which will mean prices can increase for neutral fans depending on demand and seat locations.

 




Hospitality packages for matches have already gone on sale, starting at an eye-watering $2,500 (£1,900).

The cost of tickets and availability for fans is likely to be a major point of discussion at the World Cup. FFT would expect a uniform approach to ticket allocation, meaning fans of England, Wales and Scotland could face a battle to snap up tickets for their respective group matches.

FIFA will certainly hope there is more demand in North America, after several matches at World Cup 2022 in Qatar were played out at half-empty stadiums.

We've compiled the consummate collection of quizzes in The Ultimate FourFourTwo Football Quiz Book. This isn't just any quiz book; its packed with 2,500 questions across more than 180 different quizzes, designed to truly test your knowledge. From who scored the winner in the 1994 League Cup Final to which Swedish Club Peter Crouch joined on loan, and covering everything from the Champions League to the legendary Pele and everything in between.

Cristiano Ronaldo received only a one-match suspension with Portugal (already served against Armenia) for elbowing O'Shea in the match against Ireland.

A decision that will almost certainly allow him to play the first two group stage matches at the USA 2026 World Cup. 

This was made possible thanks to a loophole in article 27 of the FIFA disciplinary code, which allows for ""the total or partial suspension of the execution of a disciplinary measure"".

The usual regulations are clear: a player must be suspended for “at least three matches or an appropriate period for assault, including elbows, punches, kicks, bites, spitting, or blows to an opponent or a person other than a match official”.

A practice that - evidently - was not followed for Cristiano Ronaldo: a figure too important to miss the World Cup inauguration in the USA, according to The Guardian.

The English newspaper also reports FIFA sources: the favorable treatment for CR7 is explained by the fact that it was ""only"" his first expulsion with Portugal. A choice described as ""offensive to the public's intelligence"" by The Guardian, given that CR7 has been expelled 12 times with his respective club teams.

The newspaper also reports that the final decision came 12 days after the incident and shortly after a meeting between CR7, Infantino, and Trump at the White House. A coincidence destined to remain such in the statements, but which The Guardian strongly highlights.

The same newspaper does not beat around the bush: ""FIFA needs 2026 to be a commercial success in a nation that will require big names to embrace a sport that is not as popular as others"".

FIFA, moreover, was not exempt from criticism even during the summer Club World Cup, in which Messi's Inter Miami participated despite not having won the 2024 MLS Cup: which was won by LA Galaxy. (In the 2025 edition, Inter Miami was then eliminated in the 1st round).

According to journalist Tom Bogert of ESPN, MLS would have wanted to award the vacant spot to the MLS Cup winner.

Instead, the qualifying team was announced by Infantino at the end of the regular season: an unprecedented choice that fell precisely on Inter Miami. The Times commented on the news: ""They needed something to spark broadcasters' interest"".

Cristiano Ronaldo is now free to play at his sixth World Cup finals

It raised eyebrows, but probably didn't come as a huge surprise. Cristiano Ronaldo is available to play for Portugal in their opening matches at the World Cup, despite his red card against the Republic of Ireland.

Why? Because Fifa decided to suspend for one year the final two matches of his suspension.

Under Fifa's disciplinary code for violent conduct, Ronaldo should have received a three-match ban for elbowing Dara O'Shea during Portugal's 2-0 qualifying defeat earlier this month. 

Yet Fifa's disciplinary committee said it took into account that he had not received a red card in his other 225 international appearances.

He served one match in the final qualifier against Armenia. The other two will only be activated if he ""commits another infringement of a similar nature and gravity during the probationary period"".

So Ronaldo is free to join arch rival Lionel Messi at the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada next summer.

But has Fifa exercised special treatment to get Ronaldo to their showpiece event, or have we seen this happen before?

In short, yes. There is a clause in the disciplinary code which effectively gives Fifa the right to cut or cancel any ban as it sees fit. 

Article 27 says Fifa can ""fully or partially suspend"" a disciplinary measure for ""a probationary period of one to four years"".

And Article 25 states ""the relevant Fifa judicial body may scale down the disciplinary measure to be imposed or even dispense with it entirely"".

France's Laurent Koscielny was expected to miss the opening two group games at the 2014 World Cup

There has not been a World Cup reprieve quite the same as Ronaldo's, where a three-match ban has remained in place but partially suspended.

But there several other examples of Fifa looking kindly upon players, reducing their ban from the mandatory punishment. 

The World Cup finals are the pinnacle of most players' careers. Articles 25 and 27 give Fifa the freedom to consider the merits and impact of a suspension. And it's not only been about star players.

In 2014, France defender Laurent Koscielny was sent off for slapping Ukraine's Oleksandr Kucher in the first leg of the World Cup play-off. 

Like Ronaldo, Koscielny was automatically banned for his country's final qualifying fixture. Fifa then chose not to extend the Arsenal centre-back's suspension beyond one match, allowing him to play at the World Cup. 

Croatia's Mario Mandzukic should have missed the opening two games of the 2014 finals after he was sent off for serious foul play in the second leg of the play-off win over Iceland.

Fifa gave him a one-game ban, meaning he could play the second match against Cameroon - a 4-0 win in which he scored twice.  

Towards the end of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, Netherlands midfielder Phillip Cocu was sent off for an alleged retaliatory elbow on an Albania player. 

Fifa chose to ban Cocu for two matches, meaning he missed the final Uefa qualifiers against the Czech Republic and Macedonia, but was free for the opening match of the World Cup. 

Japan's Makoto Hasebe was sent off for an elbow at the end of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, and like Cocu was given two matches. He was not so lucky, however, as the second match was the first game of the World Cup.

Likewise, Iran's Saeid Ezatolahi was sent off for bringing his boot down on the head of an opponent in their penultimate qualifier. Fifa chose to give the midfielder two games rather than three, and he missed just the first game at the 2018 World Cup.

In 2002, Mexico midfielder Jesus Arellano was given a three-match ban for violent conduct against Costa Rica. He missed the final qualifier against Honduras and was set to sit out the first two matches of the World Cup. 

But Mexico were successful in a late appeal just before the finals kicked off, claiming the suspension was too harsh. Arellano's ban was reduced and he only had to sit out their opener.

Fifa to keep top seeds apart in World Cup draw

'It would be the biggest middle finger' - Chilwell eyes World Cup

When is the 2026 World Cup draw?

England midfielder Lauren James was sent off at the 2023 Women's World Cup for standing on the back of Nigeria's Michelle Alozie.

James feared she would get a three-match suspension, meaning she would be ruled out for the remainder of the tournament. 

But Fifa decided to give James two games and she was able to return as a substitute in England's 1-0 final defeat by Spain. 

England also had success with Wayne Rooney's suspension for Euro 2012.

The Manchester United striker was given a three-match ban for kicking Miodrag Dzudovic during a 2-2 draw with Montenegro in the final qualifier.

Rooney would have missed the whole of the group stage, but England had it reduced to two matches on appeal. He then scored the only goal of the game against Ukraine, which ensured England topped their group. 

There are a few cases, and players who are sent off in their last competitive game before the finals will always miss at least one game.

At the 2006 World Cup, Germany striker Mike Hanke was very unlucky.

A year earlier, Hanke had been sent off for serious foul play against Mexico in the third-place play-off at the Confederations Cup.

Germany didn't have another competitive game for a whole year, as hosts of the 2006 World Cup, but Fifa stuck with the mandatory two-match ban.

Hanke was still picked for the squad even though he was suspended, and made one 19-minute appearance - ironically in another third-place play-off - as Germany beat Portugal.

In October this year, Qatar centre-back Tarek Salman was sent off in the second leg of his country's final qualifier against the United Arab Emirates and given the statutory two-match suspension for serious foul play. 

Ecuador's Moises Caicedo and Argentina's Nicolas Otamendi will have to sit out the first game of next year's finals after being sent off for two bookable offences in their final qualifying matches.

The same fate was suffered by Colombia's Fredy Guarin in 2014 and Serbia and Montenegro's Nemanja Vidic in 2006.

A two-match ban has cost players a place in their World Cup squads. Miranda (Brazil) and Cristian Rodriguez (Uruguay) in 2010 were both omitted because they had suspensions to serve.

Get unrivaled matchday access

Just over a year since U.S. Soccer announced the technical staff additions to complement newly minted head coach Mauricio Pochettino, first assistant coach Jesús Pérez—who's been alongside Pochettino for nearly two decades—has sky-high expectations for the U.S. Men's National Team as it prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil.

“We really believe that we can win it,” Pérez said of the upcoming tournament. “We know that everything has to be on your side to win it. We have to focus on ourselves, to know how we can be very competitive, that we have to win matches through all the different phases of the game.""

As someone who is always by the side of the Argentine manager—whether it's on the sideline, at appearances or at post-match press conferences—Pérez knows firsthand the identity that a Pochettino-led group works to embody.

""We are trying to be very efficient in possession, take advantage of set-pieces, penalties; those things that can define a short tournament,” Pérez added. “The most important thing is to keep alive the wish and the dream that you can win matches. There are different moments and examples of teams that did it, they made it, and then wherever football take us, that will be the final result, but we don't want to set any limit.”





Pérez's unabashed belief in Pochettino's coaching philosophies and strategies stems from the pair's lengthy history together. The 54-year-old Barcelona native has been alongside Pochettino at each stop of the latter's managerial career, spending time with RCD Espanyol in his native Barcelona, Southampton FC, Tottenham Hotspur FC, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea FC.

Even before joining forces with Pochettino in 2010, Pérez's football-first upbringing and desire to understand the athlete, both in and out of their respective element, helped develop his current coaching approach.

Though there's nothing like football for Pérez, he's valued learning from other sports and especially appreciates watching the Olympics with its four-year cycle similar to the World Cup. He even had a stint as a swim coach, which he credits with shifting his perspective.

“I was curious how to coach just one athlete,” Pérez explained. “I was able to plan a whole season for only one guy with multiple training sessions, power sessions, all those things. That background helped me understand, and that's why I'm a fan of the individual work, because I really believe a player can improve until he retires. There is always something—a topic, an aspect of him as a person and as a player—that can be improved.”



Improvements both individually and collectively have been evident throughout Pochettino's first full year at the helm. The USMNT shook off a 2W-4L-0D start to 2025 and closed out the year with an impressive 8W-2L-2D stretch, capped off by a five-match unbeaten run against a quintet of opponents ranked in the top 40 of the FIFA World Ranking: Japan, Ecuador, Australia, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Pérez credits the USMNT's recent run of form to Pochettino's desire focus less on who they are playing but rather how they are playing.

“We are a coaching staff that represents a coach's philosophy, and [Mauricio Pochettino] is a guy who wants an energetic game,” Pérez stated. “But when I say energetic, [I mean] a team that cares very little about the opponent, a team that is focused week in, week out to improve ourselves, knowing that in front [of us] we have different types of rivals. We want to be able to compete against another team, sometimes using different approaches, but not because we change the approach but because the opponent forces you. We want to be ready to face those different challenges that a dominant team can give us. A team that is reactive can [challenge] us as well.

“That's why it's important to focus on yourself, to improve, how to press high, yes, but to be resilient and well-organized when the opponent forces you to be low. Transition quickly if you can, but if not, have a good positional game. We have a holistic approach to the game, and obviously the players' [mental] states and qualities will dictate what we can do more. We are not refusing to try to do things or to be brave, but to try things with responsibility, if possible. That's why we care very little about the opponent. Opponent is important for us on the build-up of the week, the drills we [conduct], but we don't put too many fears in the players' minds. We want them to be focused on themselves and how we can be better in every single phase of the game.”



With just two international windows and roughly 200 days separating the USMNT from the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Pérez, excited for one of the biggest challenges of his coaching career, is confident that the coaching staff's meticulous preparations will further cultivate belief amongst the players.

“The most important thing is the players' state of mind, because whatever your mind is able to fight against in a short tournament will be very, very important,” Pérez said. “We want them to be prepared, or at least to believe that they can go through any situation and no excuses. We as a staff, we are going to be prepared to help them in between training sessions, in between matches, during the match, with every single proven strategy. But the key factor will be the belief.”","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

Los Angeles will host eight FIFA World Cup matches in summer 2026, which is just around the corner, so LAist has partnered with our public radio partners in Kansas (where matches also will be played) to catch you up on what you need to know ahead of time.

First, L.A. is just one of 16 cities hosting the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which for the first time will be staged across three different countries: Canada, Mexico and the U.S.

The tournament will start in Mexico City, but L.A. will be the first U.S. city to host a match. The U.S. Men's National Team will play its first game at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on June 12.

L.A.'s last match will be a quarterfinal July 10. In between, the city will host six more games and be the site of World Cup celebrations and viewings. In total, the World Cup will last more than a month, from June 11 to July 19, when the final takes place at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

It's going to be an exciting time in the L.A. region for soccer fans and those new to the game, so LAist put together this guide for visitors and locals alike.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is a 104-game tournament featuring 48 competing countries. It will kick off June 11 at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.

The tournament will last 39 days and take place across 16 North American cities.

This is the full schedule for the matches.

The World Cup final will be held at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on July 19.

Yes, but ticketing for all games — including in Los Angeles — happens in phases through a lottery draw system.

For access to all ticket sales, you'll need to register a profile through FIFA's site.

Phases 1 and 2 of the ticket draws have closed, and successful entrants already should be notified of their opportunity to purchase tickets.

There still is the random-selection draw phase, which begins after the World Cup matchups are determined Dec. 5. Fans will be able to apply for specific matches once those are announced.

Closer to the tournament's start, fans will be able to purchase last-minute tickets on a first-come, first-served basis.

You also can find more expensive, premium hospitality packages for games.

For information on the resale/exchange marketplace or travel visa requirements, read FIFA's ticket site.

L.A. will host eight matches at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. Here's the whole list:

Group Stage:

Round of 32:

Quarter-Final: Friday, July 10



We won't know which Group Stage teams will play until the draw Dec. 5.

Once the teams are selected, they'll finalize their base camp locations — the facilities where they will practice and gather.

The Los Angeles World Cup 2026 Host Committee is the nonprofit organizing logistics for the games across Los Angeles. There will be a FIFA Fan Festival at the L.A. Memorial Coliseum and official ""fan zones"" where people can gather to watch the games.

Ahead of the games, the host committee is putting on free soccer clinics in Los Angeles. The first one will be for coaches Dec. 6 at Los Angeles City College. You can register here.



L.A. has staged world soccer competitions in the past. In 1994, the World Cup final was held at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Brazil defeated Italy in penalties. Five years later, the U.S. defeated China in the Women's World Cup final at the Rose Bowl.

Before that, the 1984 Olympics included men's soccer, with France emerging with the gold medal. Women's soccer wasn't included in the Olympic Games until 1996.

But L.A.'s soccer history stretches back 125 years. From the beginning, immigrant communities have been key to that story, both as players and an enthusiastic fanbase. LAist's Adolfo Guzman-Lopez has that story and more on L.A.'s soccer legacy here.

Los Angeles has three professional soccer teams: the Los Angeles Galaxy, the Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) and Angel City Football Club.

1902: Southern California Foot Ball League founded.

1951: L.A. Kickers founded in South L.A. by soccer fans of German descent who admired the Stuttgart Kickers.

1958: U.S. plays Mexico at Veterans Memorial Stadium in Long Beach. The U.S. lost 7-2.

1964: American Youth Soccer Organization (AYSO) founded in Torrance.

1971: Macabee Athletic Club founded by Israeli expatriates, in a league with the San Pedro Yugoslavs and the L.A. Armenians.

1974: L.A. Aztecs become an indoor soccer league sensation,and sign British player George Best, arguably the first global mega-star.

1984: L.A. Olympics: soccer matches held in L.A. and other venues across the U.S.

1994: World Cup Final held at the Rose Bowl.

1995: Former Mexico men's soccer captain Leonardo Cuellar coaches the men's and women's soccer teams at California State University, Los Angeles.

1996: L.A. Galaxy plays their first match in Major League Soccer.

2004: Chivas USA founded in L.A.

2014: LAFC founded after the folding of Chivas USA.

2020: Angel City Football Club founded in the National Women's Soccer League.



The sport Association Football, known in the U.S. as soccer, has different professional leagues and tournaments around the world.  

FIFA oversees the largest of them all, the World Cup, which takes place every four years.

The FIFA tournament qualifying process takes years. This article explains the U.S. National team's schedule for FIFA's international window, friendlies and other tournaments.

Technically, this upcoming 2026 FIFA tournament started soon after the last one ended, in September 2023. You already can find their international match calendar into 2030.

A record 48 teams will qualify to compete in the upcoming 2026 games, making this the biggest FIFA World Cup tournament ever.

These are the 121 nations that didn't qualify.

Geographically, FIFA puts member countries into six continental confederations, which then get a determined amount of qualifying spots.

The final six teams will be decided in part during the draw that occurred Nov. 20 and then in March 2026 during the FIFA playoff tournament and European playoffs. 

If you're wondering how the World Cup differs from the Olympic men's soccer tournament, it's a lot. World Cup teams have to take a smaller roster and abide by player age limits — and it's not officially a FIFA-sanctioned tournament.

The FIFA World Cup tournament is broken down into different rounds. This video explains it very well!

The Group Stage: June 11-27

Round of 32: June 28-July 3

The teams that advance will continue on to the final knockout rounds.

Getting on the same page about the rules of soccer is a critical part of organizing an international tournament of this scale.

FIFA uses the laws of the game from the International Football Association Board, translated into multiple languages.

Most of us know the basics of the game. You kick the ball with your foot into the opponent's goal, and only the goalie can touch the ball with their hands while it is in play within their own penalty box area.

Here's a direct link to the explanation of the offside (not “offsides”) rule. That way you'll be ready in those especially heated moments.

The basic rules during the knockout phase of the tournament are:

In total, the U.S. men's team has appeared in 11 World Cups throughout history. 

They got third place in the inaugural tournament in 1930 but hit a dry spell through most of the 20th century. The team started making more regular appearances again after 1990, even reaching the quarterfinals in 2002. They failed to qualify at all in 2018 but advanced to the knockout stage in 2022 before being defeated by the Netherlands.

As tournament co-hosts in 2026, the US team secured its spot and is looking to do better than its last appearance during the Qatar games of 2022, when the team exited in the Round of 16.

By contrast, the women's national team has qualified for every single Women's FIFA World Cup since the first one in 1991 and has won four of them, mostly recently in 2019 against the Netherlands.

The U.S. women's team already has secured its spot for the 2027 women's World Cup in Brazil.

We won't know exactly who will be on the full 26-man roster until the games get closer, but a key person to keep an eye out for is star forward Christian Pulisic, who plays for AC Milan.

This will be the first time Mauricio Pochettino will coach a national team. A former Argentine player who once played in World Cup games, his coaching experience lies more in the European leagues.

The news story explains the FIFA draw process for the expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup, detailing how teams are sorted into pots and groups with regional restrictions.

As FIFA's expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup approaches, the organization's complex tournament draw is once again raising questions from fans trying to understand how teams are placed into groups. 

While the process may seem complicated, the basic structure is far simpler than it appears.

How It Works:

FIFA divides qualifying teams into four tiers, known as ""pots,"" largely based on world rankings. 

Pot 1 includes the strongest teams and the host nations: Canada, Mexico, the United States, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany. 

Pot 2 includes additional top-ranked countries: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Japan and Switzerland. 

Pot 3 represents mid-tier nations, while Pot 4 includes lower-ranked teams and nations that have not yet qualified through playoff tournaments.

From there, FIFA creates 12 World Cup groups, labeled A through L, with four teams in each. 

Dig deeper:

The host nations receive special placement and are assigned to predetermined groups rather than being drawn at random. Once the hosts are slotted, the draw begins. 

One team from Pot 1 is placed into each of the 12 groups, followed by one team from Pot 2, Pot 3 and Pot 4. By the end of the process, each group contains exactly one team from each pot.

However, regional restrictions add another layer. 

A post shared by FIFA (@fifa)

What we know:

FIFA rules prevent teams from the same region from landing in the same group. A group that already includes a South American team, for example, cannot take a second one. The exception is Europe, which has the largest number of qualifying nations and allows up to two teams in the same group.

Once all 48 teams are drawn, the group stage match-ups are set.

What's next:

After group play concludes, the top two teams from each group and the eight best third-place finishers will advance to a round of 32 teams. FIFA then uses another structured bracket to ensure the highest-ranked teams do not face each other in the early knockout rounds.

Spain, Argentina, France, England will be top seeds

Fifa says measure will ‘ensure competitive balance'

The four highest-placed teams in Fifa's rankings have had a pathway cleared to meet in the World Cup semi-finals after tennis-style seeding measures were introduced in the name of “ensuring competitive balance”.

Spain, Argentina, France and England – the top four in descending order – are to be split into different brackets in the 48-team finals tournament, with the aim of preventing Spain from facing Argentina, or England from playing France, before a possible final.

The bracketing will hold only if those teams win their groups next summer, and echo the placements awarded to tennis's top seeds in grand slam tournament draws.

The seedings leave England and France in line each to play one of Spain and Argentina in the semi‑finals. Fifa said the pathways would be drawn randomly, meaning it would not necessarily be Spain (No 1) v France (No 3) and Argentina v England.

The group stage will comprise 12 groups of four teams. According to the seeding arrangements announced by Fifa on Tuesday, seeding will be split into four pots, with the three host countries – the US, Mexico and Canada – taking a spot in pot one.

From there the pots are decided by Fifa rankings, with the six as‑yet‑undecided victors of the Uefa and international playoffs in pot four.

This ranking system means the world's top countries will not face each other in the group stage, and the new measure will keep the very best sides apart even further.

“To ensure competitive balance, two separate pathways to the semi‑finals have been established,” Fifa said in a statement.

“This will ensure that, should they win their groups, the two highest-ranked teams will not meet before the final.”

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, US, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany.

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia.

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa.

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, four European playoff teams, two intercontinental playoff teams.

Fifa's rules dictate that in principle no team should face another side from the same confederation in the group stage but that is impossible for European teams, with Uefa providing 16 sides. This creates the prospect that England could be drawn against Scotland, who have been placed in pot three, or alternatively Wales or Northern Ireland shouldthey come through the playoffs. No more than two European teams will be in any group.

One day after the draw, on 6 December, Fifa will announce the match schedule for the finals tournament. This will determine who plays where and at what time. According to Fifa, this process will be undertaken “to ensure the best possible conditions for all teams while, where possible, enabling fans all over the world to watch their teams play live across different time zones”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

					Bridging the gap				

Haiti's recent qualification for the FIFA World Cup—the first since 1974—has reignited a sense of pride and unity in a country grappling with years of instability, gang violence, political dysfunction and mass migration.

CAP-HAÏTIEN — In a country weighed down by hunger, gang violence and political chaos, Haiti's qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup has sparked something rare: joy. For the first time in more than 50 years, the national football team's berth on the world stage has pierced through daily fear and exhaustion, offering a breath of unity and pride Haitians haven't felt in years.

​​At home, the qualification felt like a pain reliever.

Michelet Jerôme, 42, often worries when his 8-year-old son heads to school in Port-au-Prince, a city largely controlled by gangs, but that anxiety has eased for a moment.

“For once, I'm not so stressed out,” Jerôme said. “I was so happy, I spent the night tweeting and went to sleep at 3:00 a.m.” Jerôme told The Haitian Times. 

“The next morning, on my way to work, I talked about qualifying for the World Cup with the taxi-moto driver. He was so excited that he almost drove away without getting paid.”

Haiti has been starved for good news. Long battered by disasters, dysfunction and despair, Haitians have had few national wins to rally around. Even carnival, once a source of cultural joy and cohesion, has faded under the threat of violence. 

Now, after Les Grenadiers clinched a long-awaited World Cup berth, football is filling that cultural void—giving Haitians everywhere something to celebrate. On Nov. 18 in Willemstad, Curaçao, Haiti secured its spot with a 2-0 win over Nicaragua. Goals from wingers Louicius Don Deedson and Ruben Providence sealed the victory, sparking celebrations from Port-au-Prince to the diaspora.

Guns, here's how they buy it, my friend. It's all about networking. This person tells the other. The diaspora is a little guilty in selling guns. They buy them in gun shows.  Jonas Gustave, a Youtuber who blogs about gang activities History & Current State taking back control

“For the people stuck at home, it gives them value, makes them feel like they're not cursed,” James Beltis, a sociologist based in Port-au-Prince, said. 

“Qualifying makes them feel like they're here, things can get done, we're not dead,” Beltis added. 

“It's a breath of fresh air for the people. It makes them think about positive things instead of gangs, kidnappings, elections. People at home, in the streets, are talking less about the stressful things now. It's more about something entertaining now, soccer, joy.”

It's a similar sentiment in the diaspora, where people of Haitian descent often wake up to heartbreaking headlines from home — gang violence, natural disasters and political turmoil. This time, the news brought pride.

“We're probably going through Haiti's darkest moment in history politically,” said Oz'mosis Amadeus, a self-employed marketing specialist based in Palm Beach County, Florida. “We were still able to get this done. It feels like we can see Haiti now, feels like regardless of anything going on we're going to be alright.”

The last time Haiti made it to the World Cup was in 1974, when the team stunned Trinidad and Tobago in qualifiers and earned its place on football's biggest stage. That historic moment in West Germany marked Haiti's brief emergence into the global spotlight. 

Haiti's roster was mostly composed of homegrown talent playing in local clubs, a different profile from today's squad, which draws heavily from the diaspora.

Many people did not even know Haiti existed then and often asked the players where the country is located, Serge Racine, a defender from the 1974 squad, told FIFA. Nevertheless, the Haiti National Football team left an impression. In their first game against Italy, fans cheered for them every time they touched the ball on June 15, 1974 at Olympiastadion in Munich.

“For once, I'm not so stressed out. I was so happy, I spent the night tweeting and went to sleep at 3:00 a.m. The next morning, on my way to work, I talked about qualifying for the World Cup with the taxi-moto driver. He was so excited that he almost left without getting paid.”

Haiti stunned the world when striker Emmanuel ‘Manno' Sannon dribbled past Italy's world-class goalkeeper Dino Zoff in the 47th minute to score the opening goal — breaking Zoff's famous 1,142-minute streak without conceding. However, the European giant quickly leveled the score in the 53rd minute and ended up winning the game 3-1.

In its following game, Haiti suffered an embarrassing 7-0 loss to Poland on June 19, 1974. But the national team turned heads again in their last game, scoring against another powerhouse, Argentina, in a 4-1 loss on June 23, 1974. They finished in 14th spot out of 16 teams.

“We were very happy with our World Cup,” former Haitian midfielder Philippe Vorbe told FIFA. “Especially for amateur players from a far away little country in the Caribbean. It was wonderful for us and the memories of this experience will live forever.”

Now, more than five decades later, the moment repeats itself—this time with a generation that has only known a country in crisis.

The 2026 World Cup, hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico, and set to kick off in June, will give Les Grenadiers a rare opportunity to celebrate their resilience and their football talent. Haiti has yet to win a match across five World Cups (men's, women's and youth). However, Haitians worldwide are dreaming big.

“We made it to the World Cup against all odds, so why can't we believe we can win it too?” Amadeus, 46, said. “Making it to the World Cup isn't the end of the road. The work isn't done. We need to beat Brazil. We need to beat Argentina.”

Had Trent Alexander-Arnold not suffered an injury the day before Real Madrid's Club World Cup semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain, the new Blancos boss was planning to bench his Brazilian winger, preferring instead to hand homegrown forward Gonzalo Garcia a start up front alongside Kylian Mbappe.

Alexander-Arnold's injury forced Fede Valverde to cover at right-back, Arda Guler back into midfield and opened up a spot on the right-hand side of the attack for Vinicius to fill. However, the 2024 Ballon d'Or runner-up was anonymous as PSG opened up a three-goal lead inside 24 minutes on their way to a 4-0 win in New Jersey. Alonso insisted post-match that the team that had just been thrashed by the newly-crowned European champions was not his and rather Carlo Ancelotti's, and that a new dawn would arrive in the Spanish capital once the newly-appointed coach could properly knuckle down and get to grips with his squad.

Part of that revolution has led to Vinicius' role at the Bernabeu being diminished. The Brazilian who thrived under the freedom offered by Ancelotti has struggled to adapt to Alonso's much more structured approach. Vinicius has completed 90 minutes on just five occasions since the start of the 2025-26 campaign, and contributed just five goals and four assists in 17 appearances thus far.

Vinicius' frustrations have been clear, and it was reported on Monday that he has no intention of signing a new contract in Madrid unless his relationship with Alonso improves, meaning he would theoretically become a free agent in the summer of 2027. If things don't change, it's clear Vinicius sees no future for himself in Madrid white. 

That is a real shame. Vinicius is a wonderful footballer who should grow to be synonymous with Madrid for years to come. However, the tactical issues caused by having him and Mbappe in the same side have been clear for over a year now, and this very well could be the necessary separation both he and the club need.

The first thing that needs to be established is that Vinicius has every right to feel undervalued by Madrid. He was offered a contract two years ago, according to The Athletic, and turned it down, feeling that he was worth more than the deal on the table. He had every right to do so, too. With Karim Benzema gone and Jude Bellingham having only just arrived, Vinicius was the future of the club, the sole star and a Ballon d'Or winner in the making. 

Madrid reportedly offered Vinicius around €20 million per season at the time, but he argued that he was worth closer to €30m. That's astronomical money, but it's also how negotiation works. Here was a player vouching for what he believed was his market value; there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Vinicius and his team went back to the negotiating table at the start of this season, but weren't able to come to an agreement. Finances remained an issue, but the strained relationship with Alonso undercut those talks.

Vinicius does not want to play in a team where he is not considered the star man. He will, undoubtedly, be vilified for this in some corners for holding such a lofty opinion of himself, especially given the repeated attacks on his character that are often unfair and, in too many cases, racially motivated.

Vinicius' refusal to pen a new deal isn't exactly an immense surprise - strained relationship with the manager or not. From day one, it seemed a foolish decision to bring in Mbappe when Vinicius was already established in the Madrid team. They were - and remain - the two best left wingers in world football, effectively playing slightly different versions of the same position. Vinicius starts a little wider, dribbles more, and cuts in, while Mbappe likes to stride in the left channel, though he can also certainly take on his man. So often during Mbappe's debut season in Madrid, the two ran into the same spaces. 

By the end of it all, Ancelotti almost gave up and played them as a front two, trusting that the world-class duo would work it out. However, neither player seemed particularly keen to pass to one another, nor did they work anywhere near hard enough off the ball to make Madrid a solid defensive unit. Mbappe did break the record for the most goals in a Madrid debut season (43), yet his arrival certainly made the defending Spanish and European champions worse.

Mbappe has carried that form into the new campaign having taken up a permanent central role under Alonso, but Vinicius form has continued to nosedive. Since the turn of the year, he has scored just 11 goals in 40 La Liga and Champions League appearances, while his most notable contribution of the current campaign came when he reacted furiously to being substituted in El Clasico on October 26. Vinicius later apologised but, as many noted, Alonso was not mentioned in his statement.

""You have to get the best out of the players and make them feel as good as possible,"" Alonso said ahead of Madrid's Champions League clash with Olympiacos on Wednesday as he refused to be drawn into specifics related to Vinicius. ""It has different facets, but you have to know how to navigate them well. That happens at Real Madrid and at any team.""

Despite all his talent, the options open to Vinicius in terms of a next club look to be limited. Talk of interest from the Saudi Pro League has rumbled on for over a year now, and the Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF) reportedly entered preliminary talks with Madrid back in the summer of 2024. Vinicius, though, wasn't interested.

That may have been true back then, but things have changed now - if only because Vinicius has so few other options. His release clause is €1 billion (£888m/$1.16bn) - a mark that not even the richest clubs in the world can afford. A bid from Al-Ittihad in the realm of €350m was floated back in July, but nothing ever came of it. 

Vinicius is now, however, entering the final 18 months of his deal, and so while Madrid would still be able to command something pretty astronomical for their No.7, his value diminishes with every week that passes. Perhaps if he remained unhappy through to the summer then the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea or PSG could get involved in a bidding war, but thus far none of Europe's elite have been reported as being interested.

The immediate obvious beneficiary of Vinicius leaving would be Mbappe. The France captain has, in fairness, adopted his central role willingly and thrived while doing so, with Mbappe currently on pace to score 50-plus goals in all competitions this season.

Yet even then he is being misused. Mbappe, try as Madrid might, is simply not a striker. He received plenty of criticism for his not-so-subtle plea to France manager Didier Deschamps to let him play alongside a striker at international level, but Mbappe was right: he is best either in a front two or out wide, running off a big No.9. And it just so happens that Alonso tends to prefer such a system. His Bayer Leverkusen sides utilised big centre-forwards - Victor Boniface was the standout - with creative playmakers running off them.

Vinicius departing would also offer new opportunities for Rodrygo. The Brazilian has slipped down the Madrid pecking order despite his immense talent, but there would likely be more minutes for him - perhaps even in his preferred position on the left-hand side - were his compatriot to leave.

Furthermore, Jude Bellingham could play as a proper No.10, Arda Guler might be able to push further up the pitch at times and there would be more space for Nico Paz, who is expected to re-join Madrid from Como next summer, to play his way into contention. Alonso, above all, craves tactical flexibility and being able to switch between multiple formations within one game. Having one less superstar to deal with could make his dreams come true. 

Selling Vinicius would also hand Florentino Perez a whole load of cash to potentially spend on the Madrid squad, and he could choose to blow it all on the one Galactico he still very much craves.

Reports of Madrid's interest in Erling Haaland have gone quiet since he signed his 10-year contract at Manchester City last winter, but Vinicius leaving could change that very quickly. Signing the Norwegian No.9 would likely become the highest-profile transfer in football history, especially given that it would pair him with Mbappe and bring together the two greatest goal-scorers on the planet.

If Madrid can make it happen, it would make sense. Alonso likes big No.9s who can win the ball, hold it up, and score, and has there been anyone better at that in the last 10 years than Haaland? Not only that, he is an absolute goal machine who would thrive alongside Mbappe. 

Sure, there would have to be some serious sacrifices made by others in terms of their defensive work, as well as a hell of a lot of trust in the manager, but when Perez puts his mind to a big transfer, he almost always makes it happen. And that Vinicius cash would very quickly start burning a hole in his pocket if he doesn't find another use for it quickly.

Perhaps the biggest winner of this saga would be Alonso if Vinicius is indeed allowed to leave. There has been talk that Madrid's Galacticos aren't yet fully sold on the manager's tactical vision, and some fans have also begun to question his methods after a run of three games without a win either side of the international break.

That would seem remarkably unfair, given that Madrid remain top of La Liga and are in a strong position to avoid the Champions League play-offs. There were always going to be some teething problems, but Alonso is mostly winning while dealing with those issues. 

Alonso's row with Vinicius gives him a chance to lay down a real marker. Should the club allow one of their star players to leave because he doesn't get on with the manager, then that would be a real show of faith in Alonso and his plans for the future. Should they bend over backwards to keep Vinicius, then that perhaps doesn't portent well for the Spanish coach's future.

""I know what the dressing rooms are like, what you have to go through and how you have to deal with the noise from outside. These are situations that cannot cause us to lose focus,"" Alonso said on Tuesday. And things might get even more uncomfortable while this Vinicius saga rumbles on, but if it ends with the Brazilian departing the Bernabeu, then that might not be the worst thing for the entire Madrid project.

U.S. international Weston McKennie scored a pivotal goal to put Juventus 2-1 ahead in their fifth Champions League group-stage match against Bodo/Glimt, completing a rapid response after conceding early. McKennie met a precise Fabio Miretti cross with a well-placed header, shifting momentum firmly back in Juve's favor.

Juventus faced an unexpected challenge when Bodo/Glimt took the lead early in the match, putting pressure on the Serie A side. But Lois Openda equalsied for the Old Lady after the half-time break and not even ten minutes later, Weston McKennie had his say. The American rose to the occasion, timing his run perfectly to meet Fabio Miretti's excellent cross with a powerful and accurate header that found the back of the net.
 This goal marked McKennie's first in the 2025-26 Champions League campaign and was pivotal in swinging the momentum back to Juventus.


The header proved decisive in seizing control of a game that had already seen twists, with Juventus having to respond after conceding first. McKennie's strike not only put Juve ahead but also altered tactical shape on the pitch, forcing Bodø/Glimt to chase the contest and opening space for Juventus to exploit.

McKennie's goal underlines his value as a goal threat from midfield in Europe's premier club competition and provided a vital contribution in a campaign where Juventus sought points away from home. The Old Lady have struggled for form in the Champions League, collecting just three points from their opening four games. That run includes three draws and a 1-0 loss to Real Madrid. Juventus would win the match 3-2. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cruz Beckham has fiercely defended his father David after Cristiano Ronaldo claimed he was physically superior to the retired Manchester United legend. The Al-Nassr star is still playing at the age of 40 and boasts an impressive physique, an area he feels he has the beating of Beckham. But the ex-England captain's youngest son has hit back at the Portuguese in savage style.

The Portugal icon spoke with journalist Piers Morgan about his career, his future, and much more during a lengthy chat earlier this month. In that conversation, ex-Man Utd and Real Madrid man Beckham, 50, was also briefly brought up. Ronaldo was asked who he thought was the better-looking of the two, with the veteran striker not mincing his words. 

""His face is beautiful, yeah, handsome face,"" he said. ""The rest is normal, like it's normal. I'm not normal. I'm perfecto. For me [good] looking is not only the face but the whole package. Imagine Cristiano and a normal guy with red speedos on the Copacabana, you think I am not going to have a chance with nobody.""

When asked who would get more attention walking across the Copacabana, Ronaldo boasted: ""Me, 100 per cent,"" before adding, ""He's [Beckham] looking good. I like him, he is a guy who speaks good, I like him.""

The former Juventus star also suggested he is the most famous person on the planet.

""We'll do a debate for the world: who's the most famous? Me or President Donald Trump? I think, in the world, even in small islands, they know me more than him,"" he said.

In response to this, the 20-year-old Cruz referenced Ronaldo's ""rest is normal"" comments and put together a side-by-side shot of the Portuguese when he signed for United as a teenager in 2003; in addition to one of David in his 20s. In that image, Beckham appears to have the edge.

A few months before he turned 50, Beckham was on the front cover of Men's Health. The Inter Miami co-owner revealed that to this day, he still does two exercises: push ups and pull-ups. But it wasn't always something he enjoyed. 

He told the magazine in February: ""I hated pull-ups with a passion. I could literally only do two or three – three at most. Bob decided to focus on press-ups and pull-ups. I hated both, and now we do them most days. I didn't have pecs until I met (trainer) Bob [Rich]. You could say I've gone up a few cup sizes as a result. I never really had a desire to, either. I wanted to be as lean as I could. But since retiring, I've put a bit of meat in my pecs.""

Aside from physique wars, Beckham will be focusing on Inter Miami's Major League Soccer Eastern Conference final clash against New York City on Saturday, which will see Lionel Messi take centre stage once again. Ronaldo, meanwhile, will be hoping his Al-Nassr side can beat Istiklol in the AFC Champions League 2 on Wednesday.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane will be out for revenge again when he faces Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday. Kane was once part of the Gunners' youth academy, but was released from the setup due to concerns over his physique. Since then, it has been the former Tottenham star's mission to always perform against Arsenal.

An image of Kane wearing an Arsenal shirt and celebrating the club's Premier League win in 2004 has been on social media for quite some time now. In the famous photograph, Kane can be seen alongside a fellow academy player and even his head is painted in Arsenal's red. In another viral image, Kane posed for a team photo with the under-8 squad in a full Gunners kit. However, his journey with the club did not last long.

The Mirror has spoken to some of the coaches who were present at Arsenal's Hale End Academy in 2004, regarding Kane's rejection. Apparently, the current England captain not only had what people might describe as 'puppy fat' at the time but was also not a great runner or athlete. 

At that time, Kane competed with Benik Afobe, who was considered as a brighter prospect and better athlete. Afobe, though, never broke into the Arsenal first team and was instead sent out on multiple loan deals before he permanently joined Wolves.

Kane also had his own struggles as he joined Spurs as an 11-year-old, and he initially did not have much impact as at the start of his career, as he spent several years out on loan at Leyton Orient, Norwich City, Leicester City and Millwall.

Kane has always been on a mission to prove Arsenal wrong and he has quite successfully done that throughout his career, registering 15 goals in 21 appearances against the Gunners. He often delivered in the north London derby for Tottenham and also played a key role in Bayern's win over Arsenal in the 2023-24 Champions League quarter-finals. In September 2024, Kane had opened up on his motivation to play against his old club as he said: ""Yeah, probably throughout my whole career, really. Starting from when I was eight years old being released from Arsenal. That might have built a bit of desire to prove to them when I was that age.""

Ahead of the Champions League clash against Mikel Arteta's side on Wednesday, Kane admitted he is worried about Arsenal's set-piece threat and has urged his team-mates to defend carefully.

Kane told reporters: ""Of course I follow the Premier League. Arsenal have done well so far in that department. We've prepared for Arsenal as usual. The best thing will be to not give them any set pieces, to control the game - and we need to defend better than we have recently when we do concede set pieces.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Paul Scholes calls out 'classless' Arne Slot for 'disrespectful' Ibiza trip that kicked off Liverpool's shocking decline","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/paul-scholes-calls-out-classless-arne-slot-disrespectful-ibiza-trip-liverpool-shocking-decline/blt540f3d8338b6a919","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 09:44:15 GMT","

Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has suggested that Liverpool's sharp decline in form has come off the back of the Reds partying in Ibiza before their Premier League title-winning season had ended. The Reds were deservedly English champions just over six months ago as Slot's swashbuckling team swept aside the competition. Now, the outlook is far bleaker and the Dutchman has come under fire.

After Liverpool won the league at a canter in late April, they failed to win any of their last four Premier League matches. Before the season was up, manager Slot took a trip to Ibiza, and ended up partying with Wayne Lineker. Fast forward to the present, and Liverpool are 12th in the table and have lost six of their last seven league matches in 2025-26. Now, Red Devils icon Scholes has hit out at Slot for his end-of-season actions.

He said on The Good, The Bad and The Football podcast: ""I think this started towards the end of last season, do you remember when they won the league? The bad form started, they went away, went to Ibiza or something. Honestly, Arne Slot was DJing. DJing in Ibiza. But that's before the season's done, that's what I mean. I think that's disrespectful, before the season's done. I think it's classless.""

While Slot hasn't addressed the topic of going to Ibiza, the Dutchman did admit he is feeling responsible for his side's ""ridiculous"" slump in form. The former Feyenoord boss has a lot of credit in the bank after guiding the Reds to the title last season, especially without properly strengthening the squad. But after spending more than £400 million ($527m) on players this summer, his position in the Anfield dugout is increasingly being scrutinised. 

Ahead of Wednesday's Champions League clash with PSV Eindhoven, he said: ""I would describe it as ridiculous, almost. Something I did not expect to be in. Not at any club I was going to work at, let alone Liverpool. That is unbelievable. If you can find an excuse, you will never find enough excuses to make you perform like this. Unexpected for the club, for me and everyone. But I am working at a club where if you need to face it, this is the best club to face it. The harder it gets at a club like this, the more we are together to achieve the things Liverpool usually achieve.""

They come into this PSV test off the back of a 3-0 hiding at the hands of lowly Nottingham Forest. Captain Virgil van Dijk said the players are letting their manager down and together they have to get the club out of this ""mess"". Incidentally, last season, Liverpool conceded 41 goals on their way to the Premier League title. This term, they have already shipped 20 goals in their opening 12 matches. As a result, manager Slot said this was unacceptable and took responsibility for their soft underbelly. 

""Conceding far more goals than last season. The amount of goals we have conceded and the amount of goals from set-pieces is close to ridiculous for a club like us,"" he told reporters. ""The biggest one is the goals we concede. From open play, we are still able to generate enough chances to get a result. I take the responsibility and feel guilty for it.

""It's difficult to say at this moment [what we can learn from these defeats]. I have said quite a lot of times, there are certain things that you can do better but this hasn't helped and hasn't been of use. You can think of quite a lot of reasons why you have lost. From our perspective, at Liverpool Football Club, it is not acceptable. It is a situation you do not want to have. Now it is time to start winning matches again but you have to do a lot to win a match. The simple things, they must do better. That is what we are not doing and that is quite easy to solve. Simple football is the most difficult thing.""

Wednesday's home clash against PSV provides a perfect opportunity for Liverpool to bounce back from their latest defeat. They then round off the month away to West Ham in the Premier League on Sunday. If they can win both of these fixtures, the gloom may lift a touch around Anfield. If not, Slot could be under huge pressure to keep his job.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Former Manchester City financial advisor Stefan Borson says he still expects a verdict on the club's 115 Premier League charges ""before Christmas"". City were charged by the Premier League in early 2023 for allegedly breaching financial fair play (FFP) rules between 2009 to 2018, but fast forward to the present and a decision is yet to be handed out. 

City have been under this cloud of suspicion for a very long time now but for now, they have not been punished despite all these charges. The club have strongly denied any wrongdoing, but they have also been accused of failing to comply with the Premier League's rules on profit and sustainability (PSR), breaching UEFA's financial fair play regulations, and not cooperating with the English top-flight's four-year investigation. The hearing began more than a year ago, but the public is still waiting to hear a decision from the independent commission. According to Borson, it should happen very soon. 

He said on talkSPORT, alongside presenter Jim White and pundit and ex-Crystal Palace chairman Simon Jordan, ""I think Simon thinks it's going to come out next year, I think it still could come out before Christmas. The decision has been imminent for quite some time, there's not a lot that they can do. It doesn't take that long.""

Earlier in their chat, Borson said that the independent commission are responsible for the lengthy delay and not City or the Premier League. Indeed, the hearing began just over 14 months ago.

Borson added: ""Nobody knows because even the parties themselves expected to have been told by now. All the lawyers are surprised there is no decision at this stage, and that's on both sides. I'll tell you who's holding it up - the panel making the decision. They hold the pen. They are the people who everybody waits for to deliver the decision. Well, nobody knows. We know the long list - you can cobble it together from all of the people on the judicial panel - but we don't know who is on that list. We can make some guesses that it's probably two lawyers and maybe one accountant. But we don't know who is on the panel and what they were told to produce by when. We can now assume I think, given how long it has been and that everybody is so surprised that they don't have a decision, that actually there's very little guidance given to them and they weren't effectively paid for their time from the moment the case ended. Arguably, the Premier and Manchester City together, with the panel, should have agreed a process whereby the hearing ends and then effectively they are exclusively paid to deliberate and produce, over let's say three months or at worst six months, the decision during the closed season.""

Earlier this year, Manchester United legend Gary Neville said the delay over this verdict is a ""disgrace"" and a ""stain"" on football. A result has repeatedly been delayed, something the Sky Sports pundit branded as a ""joke"".

He said on The Overlap Fan Debate in May: ""That Manchester City case is a disgrace; it's an absolute stain to the game. I have a lot of admiration for City, but I don't buy into this theory that clubs do really well, and City have, but it is still a stain to the game. It has just been dragging on for years and years, it's an absolute joke. Yes, City have been defending themselves, but they've been pushing it so far into the long grass that you end up losing the will to live on it and you forget about it. It just needs to be dealt with.""

While these charges hang over City, the players and manager Guardiola will be focusing on returning to winning ways this weekend after being beaten 2-0 by Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday in the Champions League. And a home game against struggling Leeds United in the Premier League on Saturday presents a good opportunity to do just that.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

From unexpected ATP Masters 1000 champions to historic runs across the globe, the 2025 ATP Tour season featured several electrifying moments when rising talents seized their opportunity at the sport's biggest tournaments.

For the first time, the 29 members of the exclusive ATP No. 1 Club will decide the winner of Breakthrough of the Year in the ATP Awards. ATPTour.com takes a look at the four nominees.



Jack Draper
The 23-year-old lefty played with newfound confidence and firepower to cement his place at the top of the game. In the first six months of the year, Draper went from No. 18 in the PIF ATP Rankings to a career-high No. 4, highlighted by his biggest career title at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Indian Wells. The Briton, who enjoyed career-best runs at the Australian Open and Roland Garros by reaching the fourth round at both, also reached finals in Doha and Madrid, respectively.

 Joao Fonseca
The Brazilian emerged as one of the most exciting young talents on Tour in 2025, backing up his triumph at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. At the ATP 250 in Buenos Aires in February, the then-18-year-old Fonseca became the youngest South American champion in the ATP Tour era (since 1990). Fonseca made more history in Basel in October, when he became the third-youngest ATP 500 champion in series history. Having started the season outside the Top 100, Fonseca finished the year at a career-high No. 24.

Jakub Mensik
Mensik lived out a childhood dream at the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Miami. The Czech went on a surprise run and shocked Top 5 stars Taylor Fritz and Novak Djokovic in his final two matches of the tournament. ""It was probably the biggest day of my life,” said Mensik after defeating his longtime idol Djokovic in the title match. Having started the year as the World No. 48, the  rose as high as No. 16 in August.

Valentin Vacherot
The Monegasque lived the fairytale of all fairytales in Shanghai, where he was in the main draw as a No. 204-ranked qualifier with only one previous ATP Tour win, and then went on to make history as the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 champion in history (since 1990). Vacherot, who beat his cousin Arthur Rinderknech in the final, earned 1,020 PIF ATP Ranking points in that tournament alone and skyrocketed to World No. 40. The 27-year-old built upon his momentum with a quarter-final run at the Rolex Paris Masters to reach a career-high World No. 30.

Jakub Mensik has qualified for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the second time.

""I am super happy and super excited to qualify for the Next Gen ATP Finals for the second time,"" Mensik said. ""The whole year was really good for me, winning my first ATP title with the Masters 1000 in Miami. It was a really great run and makes it even more special finishing the year as a Top 20 player. I am really excited to see you guys in December in Jeddah.""

The 20-year-old made history earlier this season in Miami, where he stunned Novak Djokovic in the final to become the second-youngest titlist in tournament history behind Carlos Alcaraz. Mensik, 19 at the time, was just the fifth teen to defeat Djokovic on the ATP Tour.

In a standout year, the Czech jumped to a career-high No. 16 in the PIF ATP Rankings in August, while he earned four Top 10 wins in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Mensik defeated Jack Draper, Taylor Fritz and Djokovic in Miami and eliminated Casper Ruud en route to the third round at the Australian Open.

Daughter of two-time champion Hana Mandlikova, Mandlik has rocketed up 80 spots in the rankings since switching coaches in September.ByDavid KanePublished Nov 25, 2025 copy_link

Melbourne has been a special place for Elizabeth ""Elli"" Mandlik's family since long before she was born.“Obviously, my mom played,” the 24-year-old reminded me, modestly noting mother Hana Mandlikova's two Australian Open titles.But the family lineage goes even further: Mandlik's grandfather Vilem was in Melbourne running in the 1956 Summer Olympic Games, reaching the semifinals in the 200 metres.“Maybe I can be the third one in my family to do something big there!”Mandlik is set to return Down Under in January for the first time in two years. The former world No. 97 won the USTA's annual Australian Open Wild Card Challenge, edging countrywoman Claire Liu in a series of tournaments across a five-week stretch this fall.

When you're guaranteed main draw, you get a longer pre-season, you can enter a warm-up event or two before the Australian Open if you'd like...I've had to play qualies the last couple years so having the wild card means a lot. Everything feels much calmer. Elli Mandlik

“It's a really great opportunity for all the Americans to battle with each other and fight for that wild card,” said Mandlik, who made her Australian Open debut as a lucky loser back in 2023.🖥️📲 THIS WEEK: Stream the Australian Open Asia-Pacific Wild Card Play Off on the TC App!Prior to the Challenge, the Boca Raton-born Mandlik was just hoping for the chance to enter Melbourne's qualifying draw, her ranking having fallen to No. 270 at the beginning of October. She switched coaches a month prior, hiring the duo of Emiliano Redondi and Juan Pablo Guzman, and enjoyed immediate success when she won a W100 title in Edmond, Oklahoma.“By the time I realized I was also in the running for the main-draw wild card, I had already secured my spot in qualies, and that was such a weight lifted off my back,” said Mandlik.It came down to a near-head-to-head between Mandlik and Liu, both of whom were entered at a WTA 125K tournament in Austin, Texas.

I feel very blessed to be playing a sport she played already. She knows the ins and outs and she's been able to prepare me for all the little crevices I might get into. Obviously, I've had to go through a lot on my own, but she knows how it feels when different things have happened to me, so it allows me to feel a little bit ahead of the game sometimes. She gives me so much support and knowledge. Elli Mandlik on mother Hana Mandlikova

“It was actually pretty crazy how it all played out,” Mandlik recalled. “We both won our first rounds and I won my second round. If she had won her second round, we would have played each other and that would have been the match to secure the wild card.“She ended up losing one round early, but it was crazy to think of people watching that match had it happened, and if they knew what we were playing for. It would have been a completely different level of stakes and pressure. Not being able to play that match was a little disappointing because it would have been such a great experience. Still, I was very happy to secure it outright!”Though still ranked outside the Top 100, the guaranteed main-draw entry not only lengthens Mandlik's pre-season but also opens more opportunities to compete ahead of the first Grand Slam tournament of 2026.“When you have to play qualies, it's more difficult because you can't play that extra warm-up. You have to cut your pre-season shorter,” Mandlik explained. “So, having that main-draw date and knowing your schedule makes things much easier. I've had to play qualies the last couple years so having the wild card means a lot. Everything feels much calmer.”

Mandlik's initial WTA breakthrough came in 2022, when she stunned Alison Riske-Amritraj and pushed then-No. 4 Paula Badosa to a third-set tiebreaker in San Jose.

Managing stress has been crucial to Mandlik's resurgence, allowing her rediscover the form that first turned heads in 2022. As a qualifier at a WTA event in San Jose, she knocked out Alison Riske-Amritra and pushed then-world No. 4 Paula Badosa to a third-set tiebreaker. A month later, she won her first Grand Slam main-draw match in at the US Open, shocking former Roland Garros semifinalist Tamara Zidansek.“In the past, I was more of an emotional player,” Mandlik recalled. “I could have a great week and then have a horrible week and get really upset about that. It was kind of like a roller coaster in my mind. As I got more used to being on tour, breaking into the Top 100 and falling out, I've really figured out how to calm my mind and work through all the day-to-day things that let me play every day like it's the same.”Drawing experience from her mother, a five-time major champion and Hall of Famer, has also impacted her development.

Gauff explained the mishap in her on-court interview: ""Honestly, as long as I've been on Tour, my coach has always put the racquets in the bag before the match because he's very superstitious. He likes to grip each racquet new each day. I don't care, I can play with a dirty grip.“And so I go on the court and I realize I have no racquets, and I literally just made fun of Frances for it in Madrid. But now I'll be quiet.""Gauff recovered, defeated Gadecki 6-2, 6-2, and went on to win her second Grand Slam title at Roland Garros—but she didn't escape Tiafoe's jokes.""@cocogauff you gotta get more professional I'd never do something like this,"" Tiafoe wrote on Instagram.""Can't believe I'm in the same stat line as @bigfoe1998 smh 🤦🏾‍♀️,"" Gauff replied.

F1 Academy: The Story of the 2025 Season

Doriane Pin's journey to the 2025 F1 Academy title

Find out who topped the Power Rankings table after the Las Vegas Grand Prix weekend.

Max Verstappen took a crucial win in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and with both McLaren drivers disqualified, slashed Lando Norris' championship lead to just 24 points. The Dutchman topped the top 10 of our Power Rankings list, but who else impressed last weekend? Check out the latest scores and overall leaderboard below...

Having overtaken poleman Lando Norris when the McLaren driver ran wide at Turn 1, Max Verstappen never looked back en route to his sixth win of the 2025 campaign. The Red Bull driver briefly had to soak up pressure from George Russell's Mercedes, but thereafter cruised to a 20-second-plus win. With Norris and team mate Oscar Piastri both disqualified, Verstappen remains a real threat for the title with two Grands Prix and a Sprint remaining, as the Dutchman sits tied on points with Piastri and just 24 behind Norris.

A disastrous Qualifying left Kimi Antonelli only P17 on the grid as moving fractionally before the lights went out then earned the Mercedes driver a five-second penalty. Despite that, the Formula 1 rookie put in an inspired drive, switching his soft tyres on the second lap and running the remaining 48 tours with a set of hard tyres. He moved into fourth, holding Piastri at bay and only dropping behind at the chequered flag due to the penalty, before the McLaren disqualification moved the Italian up to an unlikely podium.

A seventh pole position of the season – achieved in treacherous conditions – put Norris in prime position for victory and practically allowed him to place one hand on a maiden Drivers' World Championship. The Briton aggressively cut across the front of Verstappen off the line but ran deep into Turn 1, dropping behind both Verstappen and Russell. Biding his time to overtake Russell in the second stint, Norris was comfortably P2 until backing off substantially over the final laps. The team's call was linked to concerns over skid block wear which would ultimately prove futile as he was disqualified – a result that could have huge ramifications for the title.

Another impressive Qualifying performance on a low-downforce, high-speed circuit similar to Baku left Carlos Sainz third on the grid, which eventually became P5 in the final classification. The Williams driver lost a position to Russell at the start but held quicker cars including Charles Leclerc and Piastri at bay over the opening stint, only slipping behind the pair after the pit stop sequence. Promoted two places due to McLaren's disqualification, Sainz achieved his second-best result of the season after his Baku podium, finishing more than 10 seconds clear of Isack Hadjar.

Having just missed out on a Q3 appearance after finishing P11 in Qualifying, Nico Hulkenberg utilised the hard tyre in the opening stint compared to all those ahead on the medium rubber. Extending his first stint, which ultimately allowed him to rejoin in P9, the Kick Sauber driver was never headed again and jumped up to seventh in the final classification. It has moved the team to within four and five points respectively of Aston Martin and Haas in the Constructors' Championship after back-to-back scores for the German.

A winner in Las Vegas 12 months ago, Russell ultimately had to settle for the runner-up spot in 2025 having nursed a steering issue from the opening laps. It didn't stop the Mercedes driver jumping ahead of poleman Norris on the first lap, though, and the Briton even challenged Verstappen in the first stint. Pushing too hard in the second stint destroyed his tyres and allowed Norris back ahead, but P2 beckoned with McLaren's impending infringement.

Going under the radar, Hadjar bagged more points for Racing Bulls and back-to-back scores in the process having been classified sixth in Las Vegas. The Frenchman qualified P8 but moved up several positions through the opening turn, finding himself initially in fifth before being re-passed by Piastri's McLaren and Leclerc's Ferrari in the opening stint. Having made his sole pit stop, Hadjar circulated alone for the second stint to solidify Racing Bulls' P6 in the Teams' Championship.

Having struggled for pace in a wet Qualifying, Leclerc put on a charge during the race and ultimately just fell short of a podium by two-tenths. Starting P9 and having just avoided been taken out through the opening corner, Leclerc went on to overtake Ollie Bearman, Piastri and Hadjar, as well as Sainz as the Williams exited the pits. Sub-optimal strategy meant he rejoined behind Piastri and slipped away from the battling McLaren driver and Antonelli ahead, the Ferrari driver eventually classified P4.

Left only P5 on the grid, Piastri slipped behind both Racing Bulls at the first corner which included contact from Liam Lawson. The Kiwi suffered an issue on the second lap allowing Piastri back ahead, but the McLaren driver then slipped behind Leclerc in the opening stint, only moving back ahead through the pit stop sequence. Stuck behind Antonelli in the final phase and eventually being disqualified from P4, a potential 30-point gap to Norris is just 24 heading to Qatar.

Quietly going about his business, Esteban Ocon raced on the fringes of the top 10 for much of proceedings, having started P13 and eventually finished just outside the points in P11. McLaren's double disqualification helped move Ocon and Haas team mate Bearman into the points, the American team also moving ahead of Aston Martin in the Teams' Championship by a single point as a result.

Bearman just misses out on a place in the top half of this week's Power Rankings, the Briton having run in the points in the early stages and re-passed Fernando Alonso in the second stint before taking P10.

F1 Academy: The Story of the 2025 Season

Doriane Pin's journey to the 2025 F1 Academy title

Qatar delivers heat, high-speed cornering and tyre wear that can flip a race upside down. So, who's positioned to thrive at the Lusail International Circuit?

Formula 1 heads to Qatar for one of the most demanding weekends of the season, where sweeping high-speed corners and high temperatures push drivers and machinery to their limits. The Sprint format returns too, giving F1 Fantasy managers another scoring session and more opportunity to change fortunes faster than ever.

With some of the harshest tyre degradation on the calendar, the Qatar Grand Prix places huge emphasis on aero efficiency, tyre management, and drivers who can manage the punishing conditions. Our F1 Fantasy Strategist returns to assess which assets are best equipped to handle the heat as the fight for late-season points reaches boiling point.

Even with only two rounds of the season left, it's never too late to join the free-to-play game and compete for the great prizes on offer every race week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

Be sure to join Alpine's Desert Dash mini-league that's taking place over the remaining two rounds of 2025 – the Qatar and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix. There are exciting exclusive prizes on offer, including the winner getting a virtual meet and greet with Pierre Gasly or Franco Colapinto.

Ahead of every Grand Prix weekend, our F1 Fantasy Strategist evaluates seven in-game assets – five drivers and two teams – that can help you succeed in F1 Fantasy, whether that's eking out every point or maximising your budget.

Qatar places a premium on tyre management, aerodynamic efficiency and consistency through long, flowing corners, with the Sprint format amplifying the strategic pressure. Historically, Lusail makes reliable performers and well-balanced cars especially valuable.

Catch up on the Las Vegas Grand Prix highlights below and remember to lock in your teams before the Sprint begins on Saturday, November 29 at 1700 local time (1400 UTC).

McLaren's double disqualification in Las Vegas had significant repercussions in F1 Fantasy and was especially hard-hitting to the 23% of players that owned Lando Norris, who registered a season low -10 fantasy points as a result.

However, this was Norris' first Grand Prix in two seasons where he was not deemed a classified finisher (completing 90% of the race distance) – a remarkable streak of consistency.

The Briton has finished P3 in both Qatar Sprints over the last two seasons and secured a Grand Prix podium, climbing from P10, in 2023.

McLaren have been very competitive in the medium to high-speed corners, for which Lusail has plenty, so expect Norris to be back to his very best as he aims to try and secure his maiden Drivers' Championship.

Las Vegas saw Max Verstappen continue his dominance at high-powered tracks this season, posting his fifth score of 45+ fantasy points in the last seven races while taking his second win in three seasons at the track.

His excellent fantasy form in recent weeks has now propelled the Red Bull racer into first place in the F1 Fantasy driver standings with 675 points on the season.

Verstappen is also the second-best performing driver on Sprint weekends this season, averaging 36.6 fantasy points, just shy of title rival Norris (38.6).

The Dutchman now sits only 24 points adrift of the McLaren racer in the World Drivers' Championship and will require another big result in the desert if he's to continue his remarkable comeback charge – but it's a circuit where he's recorded back-to-back Grand Prix victories.

It has been a campaign of two halves for Carlos Sainz, but his current momentum has him firmly on the right side of his season as it stands.

The Spaniard's 9.9 fantasy points per race weekend and one race retirement is in stark contrast to his 1.5 fantasy points and three Grand Prix retirements through the first 14 weekends of the season.

His most recent highlight was a P3 Qualifying result in Las Vegas, on his way to a 16-point haul for fantasy owners last time out.

Requiring a mere -5 fantasy points for a $0.6m price rise, Sainz's recent form suggests he should be excellently positioned to achieve this with another strong showing.

Back-to-back double-digit fantasy scores lands Isack Hadjar back on the Strategist's watchlist for Qatar.

His 16-point return in Las Vegas tied his second-highest score in 2025, while extending his classified finishing streak to 10 races.

The Racing Bulls rookie added to his Q3 record last weekend too, notching his 13th appearance in 22 Qualifying sessions this campaign – the best among all drivers not racing for a top-four outfit in the Teams' Championship.

If Hadjar can continue this trend, he should score well once more at a track that rewards strong performances in Saturday's final session.

It's been a testing few weeks for Fernando Alonso owners in F1 Fantasy – three retirements from Monza to Las Vegas, in addition to a season-high 30 points in Singapore.

The Spaniard now heads to a circuit where he has encouraging history. He's finished in the top seven in his three Grand Prix appearances at Lusail, including a podium with Alpine in 2021.

Now priced at $4.5m, the veteran racer cannot fall any further in fantasy value and poses as a budget-friendly option in a week many players will be targeting the likes of Norris and Verstappen for the 3X DRS Boost chip.

The Aston Martin journeyman has the second best averaging Qualifying position this season (10.7) among drivers under $15m, and will be willing the car towards another strong result in Qatar this weekend.

Other drivers to monitor: Oscar Piastri, Nico Hulkenberg

The double disqualification in Las Vegas might understandably deter many new and existing suitors for McLaren in F1 Fantasy – but it is not all bad news.

McLaren have been the highest-scoring F1 Fantasy constructor in each of the last two visits to Qatar, and they're the hot favourites to repeat this feat once more.

The MCL39 has excelled in medium to high-speed corners this season, with the team posting victories at tracks exhibiting similar characteristics, such as Bahrain, Silverstone and Zandvoort.

Expect both drivers to be in the mix to return the team to winning ways this weekend after a disappointing, albeit unexpected, result in Las Vegas.

A double podium in Las Vegas was the cornerstone for another superb Mercedes performance in F1 Fantasy.

The Silver Arrows were once again at their best in Sin City, turning in 77 points on the back of a mesmeric drive from Kimi Antonelli ($17.5m) into the podium positions from P17 and a George Russell ($23.6m) P2 result.

The Brackley team also reeled in an additional 10 fantasy points from a 2.08 second pit stop – their second consecutive week recording double-digit points from their pit box efficiency.

With many routes to fantasy points at an economical price point relative to production, Mercedes continue to represent exceptional value towards the top of the Teams' standings.

Other constructors to monitor: Red Bull, Racing Bulls

3X DRS Boost is an optimal chip to deploy on Sprint weekends. With the fantasy deadline at the start of the Sprint itself, this provides an additional session of point-scoring opportunities for your team.

Utilising this chip on two consistent drivers in high-performing teams (Verstappen and Norris, for example) will ensure you can extract the most value out of it when activated.

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on the earlier sessions to help guide your decisions in the lead up to the team lock deadline.

F1 Academy: The Story of the 2025 Season

Doriane Pin's journey to the 2025 F1 Academy title

Nico Hulkenberg and Kick Sauber came away with P7 from Las Vegas.

Nico Hulkenberg believes Kick Sauber achieved ""the maximum available possible"" after securing a points finish during the Las Vegas Grand Prix.

The German utilised the hard tyre in the opening stint compared with many who used the medium rubber, running long before pitting and eventually finishing ninth on the road, having started P11.

Hulkenberg was promoted to seventh in the final classification due to McLaren's double disqualification, helping Sauber move to within five points of Haas in the Teams' Championship, two positions further ahead in P7.

""That was the maximum available possible,"" said Hulkenberg, who recorded back-to-back points finishes.

""Everyone ahead of us... was potentially even slightly quicker, so I think there was not much more we could have done.

""Obviously, a solid or pretty straightforward one-stop for everybody, a typical low-deg race with not much action.""

""It's still a long shot [to beat Haas] because Haas usually is competitive too. I'm not sure about Doha – a very fast, flowing track.

""I'm not sure about our car and how happy it will be there, but a Sprint weekend... just digest this one, regroup, and go again.""

Team mate Gabriel Bortoleto's weekend by contrast was more challenging, the Brazilian having retired after two laps due to an opening corner collision with Lance Stroll, which also eliminated the Aston Martin.

The stewards deemed Bortoleto at fault, and handed the Formula 1 rookie a five-place grid penalty for the next race in Qatar this weekend.

""It was my fault. I think I just misjudged the grip that I had and where I was on track,"" said Bortoleto, who has now crashed out of the last three races.

""I had a very good launch and went for a move on the inside of the Williams, and when I put the car on the left-hand side of the Williams, it was already time to brake and I broke like five metres too late, then just arrived a bit too long in the corner.

“I had no angle to do the corner because I was completely on the inside, and just misjudged it. It was my fault.”

F1 Academy: The Story of the 2025 Season

Doriane Pin's journey to the 2025 F1 Academy title

Yuki Tsunoda was unable to recover from his pit lane start at the Las Vegas Grand Prix, and failed to score points for the eighth time in the last nine weekends.

Yuki Tsunoda was left frustrated after another disappointing result in the Las Vegas Grand Prix, with the Red Bull driver conceding “we can't keep on like this”.

Tsunoda is in the midst of a difficult season with Red Bull, having joined from Racing Bulls two weekends into the campaign. With points at just one of the last nine events, Las Vegas marked another testing chapter, with early pace failing to equate to a positive outcome.

While much of the damage was done by a Q1 exit in treacherous conditions in Qualifying, he was unable to make meaningful progress in the race.

Tsunoda's strategy to stop on Lap 1 and run the hard tyre to the end ended up being ruined by a Virtual Safety Car on Lap 2, something that gifted drivers ahead a cheaper stop, and aided Kimi Antonelli to leap from a similarly difficult Q1 exit into the podium places.

“First of all, very unfortunate the Safety Car when I came in,” said Tsunoda. “It was right after I pitted, so that's not ideal at all. I stayed in the dirty air afterwards because people came into the pits, and it feels like everything so far is going against me, and it's tough.

“The pace I'd shown until Qualifying was good, and Qualifying was just not in my control, a lost opportunity, and it's tough. At least the pace itself is going in the right direction, but it's frustrating that I couldn't really show it in the result.""

Tsunoda is under significant pressure to perform, with continuing rumours that Racing Bulls driver Isack Hadjar is set to take his seat for 2026.

Despite this pressure, he was on Verstappen's pace across the free practice sessions in Las Vegas, with the two trading times across the three hours of running.

Asked if this will have been noticed by the Red Bull hierarchy, he added: ""Multiple times, FP1, FP2, FP3, on multiple laps, I was ahead of Max in performance runs, and I think that's something that I didn't have for a long time. Obviously, one of his strengths is that he will bring the car or his level to another level in Qualifying, which is his strength, but also, I had confidence into Qualifying.

“I guess people noticed it, but at the same time, what I want is the result, and obviously the team [does] as well. But we can't keep on like this in terms of this mistake and everything, so we tidy it up for Qatar.""

F1 Academy: The Story of the 2025 Season

Doriane Pin's journey to the 2025 F1 Academy title

Colton Herta has spoken about his preparations for a maiden Formula 2 season in 2026.

Colton Herta detailed how he is going “back to school” in order to prepare for his maiden Formula 2 campaign next season.

In a bid to secure the super licence points required to compete in Formula 1, Herta decided to leave his successful IndyCar career and head into the championship's primary feeder category.

The challenge ahead is no small feat, something that has been demonstrated recently by Ritomo Miyata, who moved across from Japan as the reigning Super Formula and Super GT champion, but has managed just one podium in close to two complete seasons in F2.

Asked by F1 TV presenter – and former IndyCar star – James Hinchcliffe in Las Vegas how his preparations for this new venture were different to what would have been in place had he remained in the United States, Herta said: “It's back to school, it's back to learning a lot of basics. How you drive each formula car, even though they look the same, they're quite different, and the Formula 2 car is very different.

“It's back to basics, try to learn how I need to brake, how I need to get off the brake and back to throttle, managing the Pirelli tyre, which are very different to our Firestones in IndyCar. So there's a lot of new stuff, but I'm excited for it.”

He added: “There's a lot of stuff that's going to be new for me next year, but there's a lot of stuff that I remember from my F3 days and my F4 days. It's going to be exciting. It's a big programme.”

Herta will get his first taste of an F2 car with Hitech in Abu Dhabi, where he will complete the three-day post-season test between December 10-12.

While also serving as new F1 entry Cadillac's test driver, the American will complement his F2 campaign with three rounds of the IMSA SportsCar Championship, where he will drive for the manufacturer in the Daytona 24, Petite Le Mans, and the Sebring 12 Hour.

“It's a lot,” Herta said. “For me, it'll be the three US endurance rounds; so it will be the Daytona 24, and then it'll be Petit Le Mans and Sebring 12 Hours, so it's really exciting.

“The car is just such a cool car. To have that naturally aspirated V10 behind you, it's something that I've never had in my career, it's always been turbocharged engines. So it's a different feel and a great sound.”

The Hollywood Reporter is inside the ballroom for finale night, where couples performed three new numbers, including their coveted freestyle routines.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



[This story contains major spoilers from episode 11 of Dancing With the Stars‘ season 34.]


Dancing With the Stars has crowned a 34th winner!




	Tuesday night's finale was a star-studded affair, as the full cast returned to cheer on the top five finalists: Alix Earle, Dylan Efron, Elaine Hendrix, Jordan Chiles and Robert Irwin. For the first time in the show's history, the remaining couples performed three separate new dances, including the judges' choice, instant dance challenge and freestyle rounds.

The Hollywood Reporter was inside the ballroom for finale night, where the five remaining duos were kept busy engaging in three rounds of competition. The first dance, which tasked the pairs to perform to a song chosen by one of the three judges, was great, but it was the instant dance challenge that felt the most electrifying.


	Yes: the couples actually learned which style and song they were dancing to mere minutes before they hit the stage. And while it was a daunting task, each of the celebrities performed exceptionally well, leading the night into the beloved freestyle round of competition. 

	











	All five couples received perfect scores for their freestyle numbers, and each of the routines was perfectly unique to each celebrity. Jordan's number featured quite the cameo as Fifth Harmony's Normani hit the stage with the Olympian as she performed to her track “Motivation,” putting a powerful cap on season 34 of DWTS.


	Though ultimately it was Robert Irwin and Witney Carson who took home the mirrorball trophy, leaving a long-lasting legacy on the competitive ballroom dance series that Robert's older sister, Bindi Irwin, started a decade ago when she also won the show. It was a moment that was years in the making, one that Carson previously told The Hollywood Reporter “would just mean everything to me.”

	To celebrate the success of season 34, THR spoke with DWTS showrunner Conrad Green and casting director Deena Katz, where they dished on the secrets behind the series' newfound virality. With a boost from social media and a savvy casting strategy, DWTS reached new heights this season and became a ratings dream for a veteran series. 


	Katz explained that “what has happened is the TikTok world has opened something up that I've never seen before, where we are so involved in the TikTok story every single week that there's a whole new audience that needed to start watching our show to keep up with what was going on in social media.” 


	And Green also dished on the real weight of viewers votes versus judges score (“It's 50/50, effectively”), which is how eliminations are ultimately decided on the show.

	











	“When you see the judges' leaderboards, say there's five couples and you're in first place on that leaderboard, you get five judges ranking points. If you're in second place, you get four, if you're in third place, you get three, [so on and so forth],” he explained. “We do the same with the amount of public votes. You add those two [separate] ranking points together, and the couple with the lowest combined total of those ranking points goes home. And if there's a tie on those ranking points, the couple with the fewest public votes goes home.” 


	The couple with the lowest combined total of judges' scores and viewer votes is eliminated at the end of each episode. Live voting takes place during the East Coast airing of each show and ends shortly after the final performance is completed.

Adam Schweitzer, Matt Martin and Trevor Astbury are exiting for the agency's major rival. 



		By Borys Kit, Erik Hayden 

	November 25, 2025 4:44pm	




	It's a pre-Thanksgiving surprise at two of the Big Three talent agencies. A trio of top film agents at Creative Artists Agency are defecting to rival WME Group, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.


	Film agents Adam Schweitzer, Matt Martin and Trevor Astbury are decamping from CAA for the Richard Weitz and Christian Muirhead-run WME, sources say. It's not clear why the defections are underway but this time of year sees contract negotiations occur at the majors. And sometimes those talks don't go the way you think they should.




	New York-based Schweitzer, formerly co-head of the talent department at ICM, had joined the Bryan Lourd-led CAA when the mega agency closed its deal to buy ICM for $750 million in 2022. His clients include Rachel Zegler, Rebecca Ferguson, Cillian Murphy and Christoph Waltz.

	











	Martin, who reps Lilo & Stitch helmer Dean Fleischer Camp, has been with CAA since 2010 as a motion picture literary agent. He also reps John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, who just signed on to direct Paramount's next Star Trek movie.

	Astbury, who has Bumblebee director Travis Knight, Now You See Me helmer Louis Leterrier, Dune writer Jon Spaihts and Arrival scribe Eric Heisserer, joined CAA in 2014 after a decade-plus at run at Paradigm.

The Prime Video series adaptation also stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Bobby Cannavale.


							By 

	Jackie Strause


Managing Editor, East Coast


Nicole Kidman has stepped into the iconic literary character of Dr. Kay Scarpetta for her next series, Scarpetta.


	In a first look from Prime Video at the forthcoming adaptation of Patricia Cornwell's best-selling novels (photos above and below), Kidman is seen starring in the forensic crime thriller that was developed and written for television by Liz Sarnoff (Barry, Lost). 




Scarpetta releases March 11, 2026. 


	The series will unfold across two timelines, the dual narrative tracking Kay Scarpetta from her beginnings as a chief medical examiner in the late '90s to her present-day return to her hometown, where she resumes her former position while investigating a grisly murder.

Jamie Lee Curtis, Bobby Cannavale, Simon Baker and Ariana DeBose round out the cast, along with Rosy McEwen, Amanda Righetti, Jake Cannavale and Hunter Parrish portraying younger versions of the characters.


	Here's the logline: “With skilled hands and an unnerving eye, unrelenting medical examiner Kay Scarpetta is determined to serve as the voice of the victims, unmask a serial killer and prove that her career-making case from 28 years prior isn't also her undoing. Set against the backdrop of modern forensic investigation, the series delves beyond the crime scene to explore the psychological complexities of both perpetrators and investigators, creating a multi-layered thriller that examines the toll of pursuing justice at all costs. As Scarpetta pursues justice, she must navigate complicated relationships, including the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli (Curtis), confront long-held professional and personal grudges, and face secrets that threaten to unravel everything she's built.”

	











	Over 120 million copies have been sold worldwide since the character's debut in 1990. The series is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Blumhouse Television in association with Blossom Films, Comet Pictures, and P&S Projects. 


Scarpetta is executive produced by Kidman and Per Saari through Blossom Films, Curtis through Comet Pictures, writer and showrunner Sarnoff through Sarnoff TV, author Cornwell through P & S Projects, as well as Jason Blum, Jeremy Gold, Chris Dickie and Chris McCumber through Blumhouse Television. David Gordon Green directed five episodes and is executive producer alongside Amy Sayres.

The creator and star of the beloved sitcom celebrated 30 years of the show on CBS.  


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


Phil Rosenthal has tried to sell CBS on an Everybody Loves Raymond reunion special in the past, but the network never bit — until this year.


	“I thought we should do a 20-year reunion, but CBS didn't want it. Twenty-five years? Nope,” Rosenthal told The Hollywood Reporter Tuesday, a day after the network aired a 90-minute reunion special — featuring series creator Rosenthal and stars Ray Romano, Patricia Heaton, Brad Garrett, Monica Horan, Madylin Sweeten and Sullivan Sweeten — marking the show's (almost) 30th anniversary. He credits CBS Entertainment president Amy Reisenbach with getting the special on the air: “Amy was not only supportive, she was really into it. It shows that it just takes one person to make a difference in these kinds of things.”

					'Everybody Loves Raymond' Cast to Reunite for CBS Special		
			









	As for the slight fudging of the 30th anniversary date — Everybody Loves Raymond premiered in September 1996, Rosenthal isn't worried about it. “I have two answers for that,” he said. “One is they wanted it now, so who cares? The other is, Ray and I met 30 years ago, and I wrote the pilot 30 years ago. So in essence the show was born 30 years ago.”


	Romano and Rosenthal spoke to THR in separate interviews Tuesday to discuss what didn't make the final edit of the special, unexpectedly emotional moments and their favorite Thanksgiving episodes of the show. 

	











The reunion really did feel like old friends getting together again. Do you all still see one another frequently?


RAY ROMANO Phil and I see each other all the time. Our families are close — we go to movie night at his house, and we've gone on vacations together. Brad I see not as much, but I see him. I'll go to Vegas [where Garrett lives] and play poker, and we go out to dinner every now and then. Patty I see the least, since she moved to Nashville. But we still correspond every now and then and go out to lunch a couple times a year.


Phil, do you still see the other writers from the show?


PHIL ROSENTHAL We try to have lunch or dinner every couple of months at least, all of us. … This was like going to high school, college and some of grad school over nine years [of making the series]. They're lifelong friends. People ask me do I miss doing the show, and I do miss doing it because of all the friends there. We feel like the show ran its course — we did 210 episodes — so I don't miss it [in that way], but I do miss my friends. That writers room was the happiest place on Earth. It was getting paid to laugh all day.


	Were there things from the taping that didn't make it into the final edit that wish had?


ROSENTHAL I'm sure there are, but once you start editing and cut stuff, you don't miss it. i don't know why that is, but it happens on every single show I've ever done. I think we kept the best stuff. 


ROMANO We were trying to get two hours, which would be an hour and 20 minutes or so [without commercials]. Some of the compilations we had to cut down, the gag reel had to be cut down. My wife [Anna] did a half-hour interview, and they showed her for three seconds. My father and Phil's father did guest spots together a few times, and they weren't actors but they were always hysterical. We showed that during the live taping but had to cut it down. But you also don't want to go too long. We could have used another 10 minutes.

	











There were several emotional moments where you and everyone else on stage teared up a little. Did any of that come at you unexpectedly?


ROMANO I didn't expect that I would tear up — I don't know if it was noticeable — talking about Peter Boyle and the piece of advice he gave me when we were filming the pilot. That caught me off guard.


ROSENTHAL The first one — I was on stage with Ray and Patty. We had just seen a clip, and I got emotional because I realized how lucky I was and how great they were. Not just the two of them, but all of our cast, our guest actors, and all our writers and crew.


	What was it like stepping onto the re-created set?


ROSENTHAL That set was so good, I think people probably thought it had just been sitting there forever. The moment our show was done, they took it down and took it apart, and then used it for parts on other sets. But they re-created it down to the refrigerator magnets. It was a very surreal and beautiful kind of Twilight Zone.


ROMANO There was a little bit of a time travel feeling. Then it got weird because it didn't feel weird anymore. We all felt like we never left. It was a bit of a mind-blowing thing. We're all older; our kids grew up on set. It brought back memories — it was sweet and it was nice, but also a little bittersweet.


Ray, one of the funnier moments for me in the special was watching your kids do impressions of you. Do they ever do that when you're around?


ROMANO Guys, do you want to do it? I'm driving with the three boys.

	











GREG ROMANO (Ray's son) I had to think about it for a second. I had to go a little deeper than my actual voice.


ROMANO They don't do it in front of me. My daughter [Ally] isn't here, but the stuff she said, she's said to my face many times. She's like my wife — she tells it like it is when I'm being a pain in the butt.


Since we're closing in on the holiday, do you have a favorite Thanksgiving episode from the show?


ROSENTHAL Thanksgiving was such a good holiday to do an episode about, because it's so family oriented. Everyone relates, for better or worse. They're either dreading it or it's a celebration. The one with tofu turkey [season three's “No Fat”] was really good, and [season eight's “The Bird”], where they go to Amy's [Horan] parents' house and bird flies into the window and Amy's mother kills it. Even the first one we did [“Fish or Turkey” from season one], where Ray puts the fish Debra wants to make in the dishwasher. I like that one.”


ROMANO I think pound for pound, the tofu turkey one was the favorite.

Director Andre Gaines' feature adaptation of the Obie Award-winning play will hit theaters from Rogue Pictures and Inaugural Entertainment after premiering at SXSW.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


The Dutchman is ready to arrive in theaters.


	Rogue Pictures and Inaugural Entertainment are set to release director Andre Gaines' psychological thriller in theaters nationwide Jan. 2, 2026, The Hollywood Reporter has exclusively learned. André Holland, Zazie Beetz and Kate Mara star in the modern feature adaptation of the 1964 Obie Award-winning play of the same name.




The Dutchman centers on Clay (Holland), a successful but troubled businessman who attends therapy sessions with wife Kaya (Beetz) but soon learns that the therapist follows unconventional methods. Clay also deals with the potentially life-altering impact of a chance encounter with seductive Lula (Mara), whom he meets on a New York City subway ride.

	Gaines helmed the movie from a script he co-wrote with Qasim Basir that is based on Amiri Baraka's play Dutchman. Gaines produces the project alongside Jonathan T. Baker. Stephen McKinley Henderson, Aldis Hodge, Lauren E. Banks and Lenny Platt round out the cast for the film that premiered earlier this year at SXSW.


	“The Dutchman is a bold, electrifying adaptation that captures the raw power of Amiri Baraka's play with unflinching style and urgency — exactly the kind of provocative, conversation-starting cinema that audiences are starving for right now,” says Inaugural Entertainment founder Kevin Weisberg. “For Inaugural Entertainment it is the exact type of film we can't wait to put in theater.” 

	











	Adds Gaines, “Rogue and Inaugural are the perfect partners to bring The Dutchman to audiences across the country. Marc [Danon], Mike [Arrieta], Kevin and Ryan [Adams] have been champions of this film since day one, which means the world to me. Bringing The Dutchman to theaters nationwide is not just a dream come true — it's an opportunity for audiences to engage with a story that demands to be felt, enjoyed and discussed.” 


	In her review of The Dutchman for The Hollywood Reporter, critic Lovia Gyarkye wrote that Gaines “intensifies the dramatic work's surrealist undertones and takes the central couple's story above ground.” Gyarkye added that moving the narrative beyond the play's train car gives the film “greater contemporary resonance.”

With his DWTS win, Robert Irwin follows his own sister Bindi, who won the competition back in 2015.

	He has danced the Paso Doble, the Jive, the Foxtrot, and he's an expert at handling deadly wildlife. When the votes were counted, and the results announced Tuesday night (Nov. 25), Robert Irwin added the Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy to his growing list of accomplishments.

	Irwin has followed in the footsteps of his late father, the environmentalist and beloved TV star Steve “Crocodile Hunter” Irwin. And with his DWTS win, the 21-year-old Australian follows the journey of his own sister Bindi, who won the competition back in 2015, for season 21.

	











	For the finale, the final five of Alix Earle, Dylan Efron, Elaine Hendrix, Jordan Chiles and Robert Irwin squared off, as the eliminated contestants watched on and joined in on the excitement.




	For the very first time, the remaining couples performed three separate new dances, including the judges' choice, instant dance challenge and freestyle rounds.


	In the end, the man from down under came out on top.


	The livewire Aussie had looked the goods throughout the season, with his effortless routines which blended agility, strength, poise and a ready smile. However, Irwin sent a fright through his fanbase when, on the eve of the finale, it was revealed that he was struggling with injury, and was dealing with a rib complaint. 


	Following “11 weeks of crazy, vigorous, hard dancing,” Carson said in a TikTok, “my body is feeling it. Robert's body is feeling it. We're, like, kind of falling apart right now. Just trying to keep it together for, like, two more days. Literally today and tomorrow, and then it's over.”


	Irwin's “ribs have been killing him,” she revealed. He played through pain, and he's now a DWTS champion, having closely watched, and learned from, his sister's winning run a decade ago with Derek Hough.


	Season 34 of DWTS aired and streamed simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ each Tuesday, with new episodes available to stream the following day on Hulu.


Final results:


	Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten (5th Place)


	Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach (4th Place)


	Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa (3rd Place)


	Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy (2nd Place)


Robert Irwin and Witney Carson (WINNER)

After the artist's successful Breezy Bowl World Tour, Anthony ""Ant"" Wilson talks about a new album and that anticipated ""Verzuz"" match with Usher.


													By
												

	Gail Mitchell



	It was 20 years ago this week (Nov. 29) that 16-year-old Chris Brown vaulted onto the scene with his self-titled debut studio album and triple platinum-certified Hot 100 No. 1 “Run It!” And in celebrating that anniversary, Brown — under the guidance of manager Anthony “Ant” Wilson of Tycoon Music — has achieved various other career milestones during what's become an even more momentous year for the singer-songwriter.


	Brown kicked off 2025 with the best R&B album Grammy for his latest album 11:11 (Deluxe) — his second win in that category after 13 years. He's now closing out the year with two more nominations for the 2026 Grammy ceremony: best R&B song and best R&B performance for “It Depends” featuring Bryson Tiller, which peaked at No. 16 on the Hot 100. Prior to that in 2024, Brown picked up his first RIAA Diamond-certified single for “No Guidance” featuring Drake.


	Of witnessing Brown's second Grammy win, Wilson — a 2025 R&B/Hip-Hop Power Players honoree — told Billboard in August, “Winning isn't everything, but it feels good. And the consistent recognition of his artistry continues to solidify him as one of the biggest artists in the world.”


	Between those Grammy bookends, Brown embarked on what's since been logged by Billboard Boxscore as his highest-grossing live outing to date, the Breezy Bowl XX World Tour. Spanning 39 cities and 48 shows, his 20th anniversary and first-ever stadium run (June 8-Oct. 16) earned $300 million and drew 2 million fans across North America, Europe and the U.K. Accompanied by Tiller as a special guest through the run and Grammy-nominated artists Jhené Aiko and Summer Walker on select dates, Brown also welcomed pop-up performances along the way by Usher, 50 Cent, GloRilla, Tyga, Bow Wow, Sexyy Red and Davido during his three-hour, 56-song set.


	It's Brown's indefatigable energy and love of performing that Wilson first focused on strategically when he became the global star's manager 10 years ago after predecessors Tina Davis and Mike G.


	“We started off doing club and spot dates,” Wilson recalls. “Then we got the Heartbreak on a Full Moon tour [2018 with H.E.R., 6lac, and Rich the Kid]. I just wanted to get him back to the touring part of the business because I felt he could touch the most fans there. That was my initial goal.”


	Wilson also created the annual Tycoon Music Festival. Presented this year in association with Live Nation and 313 Presents, the festival marked its sixth anniversary on April 19 at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. Headlined by Brown, the lineup also starred Skilla Baby, Fabolous, Gucci Mane and Wiz Khalifa with surprise appearances from Sexyy Red, G-Herbo, Payroll Giovanni and Tee Grizzley.


	Based in Las Vegas, as is Brown, Wilson recently spoke with Billboard about what's next on the drawing board for him and his superstar client.


What's it like managing such a tireless artist as Brown?


	We don't sleep too much over here [laughs]. That's because he stays up working in the studio he has in his house. He's in that studio every day until we put out an album. And then the hard part before that is figuring out what songs are going to make the album. Chris also has a billion ideas about different things. So another hard thing is trying to get those billion ideas down to at least 10.


Talk about the rapport between the two of you, which is an important part of the artist/manager collaboration.


	I met Chris when I was working with Bow Wow. that's when Tina was involved. She's a friend of mine as well. So I used to help out whenever she needed some assistance. Mike G was there too; we were all together then. But Chris is my brother first then it's business, I don't hope that he wins. He has to win because he's my family. So that's why there is no sleeping because I've got to make sure he does. I don't know if there's a blueprint on how to manage an artist. Every artist is different. But there is one key thing: understanding the artist and the fans of that artist.


Very few artists have made the successful transition from teen to adult star. Why has Brown been able to cross that bridge?


	A lot of artists can do one thing; they can either sing or they can dance. But not a lot of artists can perform the way that he does: he's singing, he's dancing, he's crying, he's laughing, he's flying, He's doing everything he can to please fans. He'll take less money just for the production to be what it is. He just wants [his performance] to stand out. Breezy XX was originally three and a half hours. I'm like, “Chris, come on. We're going to run into overtime on every show. Like I said before, that's the hardest thing … trying to get things down to where we're both happy [laughs].


A new album coming before this year is out has been rumored given the 20th anniversary. Any hints about the next project?


	There's always an album. The name of it always changes. The songs always change. Even with the last album, we were in the studio putting another song together on the day before it came out. So I can't say the name or a date for the album. I'll leave it open because he could wake up and say let's put it out next week. I'm ready though. I have it [the album] at the moment, but it changes every week.


What else is next? A concert movie à la Taylor Swift and Beyoncé or a return to acting?


	He loves and wants to act. There are acting classes, and he's gearing up for that. I also think the Super Bowl would be a great place for him. I believe it will happen.


Have there been any overtures on that front?


	We'll just see.


How has it been navigating the negativity that he still encounters as you work to move his career forward?


	It's nothing that I'm not used to at this point. We just smile and keep going. I just try to show improvement with work over the words, you know? I think that's the best way. But his kids ground him. He's a great, involved dad. I also think Chris' fans love him so much because they can relate. He's a real person who's gone through things that others have but he did it in front of the world. So I feel like that's his legacy: going through life with everyone else.


Now that Verzuz is back, is the long-rumored Usher/Chris Brown match-up a stronger possibility?


	It may. Usher and Swizz Beatz are friends of mine; Swizz recently spoke to me about it. I'm not saying no if it makes sense.


Beyond your ownership of the Tycoon Festival, what other projects are you shepherding?


	I also work with 50 Cent in a company called the Green Light Gang. We have 40 TV shows [in the works] at the moment and a few movies. We're also going to build a production company in Shreveport, Louisiana. So that's my new baby, television.

Elton John has called time on full-scale touring. That hasn't changed, but he's still standing, he's done almost a dozen private shows this year, and he's cracking on with new music.

	The legendary British pop artist spoke with Variety for a dive into his philanthropy and fundraising efforts for HIV/AIDS, his love of Chappell Roan, his own health problems, and the road ahead.

	Creating music, well, he's not turning his back on it anytime soon.


	“But I tell you what,” he insists, “I'm singing better than I've ever done before, and I'm playing really well, and I'm enjoying it, and that is helping me a lot.”


	Elton's farewell tour wrapped up in 2023, Almost five years after launching, the Farewell Yellow Brick Road jaunt grossed $939.1 million and sold 6 million tickets according to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore. 


	These days, Elton still puts his hand up for the occasional one-off show, including his recent headlining spot in Singapore for the F1 Grand Prix, and for TV specials, including An Evening With Elton John and Brandi Carlile, produced by Fulwell Entertainment and shot in March at the London Palladium to promote their joint album Who Believes in Angels.


	Music has “been my whole life and has given me so much and takes me on journeys that I never thought I would ever go on — and it's still doing that,” John explains. “I just like doing the odd thing. It pays the rent very well, and it keeps me musical. I just can't wait to go into the studio now and write some new songs and go from there.”

	











	Elton is battling with vision problems, but he has a workaround — a teleprompter — and his friends from the music community are never far away, with offerings of encouragement, love and support.


	“Paul McCartney FaceTimes me to see how I'm doing. It's really beautiful,” he enthuses. “The love I've received from him and from Pete Townshend and Mick Jagger and people like that have been amazing. Or you get an email from Keith Richards saying, ‘Hello, darling, how you doing? You know we love you,' and that's it, but it just makes my day.”


	A followup to Who Believes in Angels, which went to No. 1 on the Official U.K. Albums Chart and cracked the top 10 on the Billboard 200, might not be far away.


	Elton has “seven new lyrics” from longtime collaborator Bernie Taupin. And “they're really, really good, so I can't wait to go in the studio with Andrew [Watt, his recent favorite producer] and just write and see what happens.”


	It was Elton who presented Taupin with the Musical Excellence Award at the 2023 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony. John was inducted in the Rock Hall class of 1994.


Who Believes in Angels? debuted at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 chart dated April 19, marking the 22nd top 10 for John and fourth for Carlile. In his homeland, Angels gave Elton a landmark 10th U.K. chart leader,  and a first for Carlile.

It's Wilson's ninth top 10 on the chart -- putting her in a tie for third-most among solo women.


													By
												

	Russ Penuell



Lainey Wilson logs her ninth top 10 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart dated Nov. 29, as “Somewhere Over Laredo” rises 11-9. The track pulls 4.1 million official United States streams (up 3%), 24.6 million in radio audience (up 8%) and 1,000 in sales (up 36%) during the Nov. 14-20 tracking week, per Luminate.

	











	Wilson co-wrote the Jay Joyce-produced track, which interpolates 1939's iconic “Over the Rainbow.”The Baskin, Louisiana, native is quickly growing her footprint among country's most successful women. Of the top 100 artists by count of top 10s on Hot Country Songs in the last 10 years, Wilson's nine tie her with Maren Morris for third among solo women behind Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood, who have logged 17 and 10, respectively. Including ties for fifth (Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan's 15), eighth (Blake Shelton, Dan + Shay and Florida Georgia Line's 11), and ninth (Carrie Underwood and Old Dominion's 10), Wilson places comfortably in the top quarter overall at No. 10, tying both Maren Morris and Cole Swindell. Narrow the lens to the last five years and her rise looks even sharper: Wilson trails only Swift among solo women and places fourth overall behind Morgan Wallen (37), Luke Combs and Taylor Swift (14 tie) and Zach Bryan (13).


Kelsea Ballerini, meanwhile, makes her own Hot Country Songs impression with two titles. She bows at No. 36 with “Emerald City” (2.9 million streams). The track sits just behind “I Sit in Parks,” which rises 14% (37-32) and logs 3.3 million streams. Both appear on Mount Pleasant, her new six-song EP, which opens at No. 9 on Top Country Albums with 13,000 equivalent album units. “Emerald City” becomes Ballerini's 24th charted title on the list, seven of which have made the top 10 since 2015's breakthrough “Love Me Like You Mean It.”

The pop-rock collab you didn't know you needed.

	It's the collab you didn't know you needed to go alongside your Thanksgiving turkey: MGK teamed up with the Jonas Brothers for the “Cliche” remix on Tuesday (Nov. 25).

	“Cliche” arrived in May and served as the lead single for MGK's Lost Americana album, which peaked at No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100.

	MGK kicks off “Cliche” in the same fashion as the original before inviting the Jonas Brothers to invade the pop-rock track, where Nick, Kevin and Joe are a natural fit, meshing the trio's balance of textured and smooth vocals covering MGK's lyrics. 

	











	Fans were caught off guard by the unexpected collaboration, but welcomed it with open arms. “Please give us a music vid for this remix. I would lose my mind to see the Jonas Brothers doing boy band dances with MGK,” one person wrote on YouTube.


	“Cliche” found MGK getting back in his pop bag and he put his dance moves to the test and delivered a car wash-themed visual reminiscent of something boy bands would release circa 2000. 




	The Jonas Brothers and MGK have linked up at concerts in the past. Back in September, Kells popped out at a Vancouver JoBros concert at Rogers Arena, where they joined forces to perform “Cliche” and the boy band's “Sucker” anthem.


	Perhaps the Jonas Brothers will return the favor as a special guest on MGK's Lost Americana tour, which hits Omaha on Tuesday (Nov. 25) before heading north of the border for shows in Calgary and Edmonton.

					By Andreas Wiseman 

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Warrior Nun and Continuum creator Simon Barry is in development on detective series Time Of Death, which is part of a slate of projects to emerge from a formalized scripted production deal between Canadian companies Omnifilm and Barry's Reality Distortion Field.


Time Of Death will follow a haunted detective who, after a decade spent chasing Britain's most elusive serial killer, relocates to Vancouver only to become convinced his old nemesis has resurfaced there. As he dives into new cases in an unfamiliar city, his relentless obsession threatens to pull him back into the darkness he thought he'd escaped.

	Also on the slate is My Homicide, created by Bruce Ramsay (The Porter), a procedural about a brilliant detective haunted by his wife's unsolved murder who teams up with an AI version of himself to solve impossible crimes and unravel the mystery that could tear them both apart.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Across the shared slate, Reality Distortion Field (RDF) will provide creative oversight while Omnifilm will provide physical production, post-production, production administration and financing. The two companied have hired scripted consultant Alexandra Finlay to help steer the slate. London-based Finlay was most recently VP, Scripted International Co-Productions for A&E.


	Distribution for the individual projects on the slate will be handled by Canadian and international partners on a per-project basis. Omnifilm's previous credits include Disney movie Kim Possible, Netflix comedy series Fakes, which it teamed on with RDF, and upcoming TV projects Freaks Underground and Impossible Cities.


	“This partnership with Omnifilm allows us to combine creative and production forces in a way that expands what both companies can achieve,” said Reality Distortion Field Principal Simon Barry, who most recently developed Netflix series Bet and has multiple features in the works with producer Uri Singer. “Together, we can shepherd scripted projects from the first spark of an idea all the way through to delivery at the highest level of quality.”

	











	Added RDF Principal Stephen Hegyes: “By pairing RDF's creative development and deep relationships with top writing talent with Omnifilm's production infrastructure, we're setting the stage for a truly dynamic collaboration.”


	Omnifilm partner and CEO Brian Hamilton stated: “Building on almost a decade of close collaboration between our two companies, we see this agreement as a natural extension of our relationship that further leverages the strengths that we each bring to the table.”


	Alexandra Finlay commented: “Omnifilm and RDF's partnership strategically merges creative development and deep production expertise. At a time when partnerships are key to reaching global audiences, I'm excited to be collaborating with Simon, Stephen and Brian to drive the slate forward.” 


	RDF has also revealed the departure of its Head of Creative Affairs, Bhavika Mantri, who will be staying on as an executive producer for select projects. 


	“Bhavika's vision and creative instincts have been integral to RDF's success,” said Simon Barry. “Her ability to shape stories and support talent has elevated our slate, and we're thrilled she'll remain involved in a producing capacity.”

			By Jesse Whittock, Max Goldbart 


EXCLUSIVE: Netflix and Adolescence director Philip Barantini's indie are in talks to turn Jade Franks' buzzy Edinburgh play Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates X) into a TV series.


	Inspired by Franks's life as a working-class student at Cambridge, the play was a huge hit at the Fringe Festival this past August, leading to a frenzy of interest from streamers and networks. Multiple sources say Netflix won a bidding war and is now beginning early stage development.


	Deadline can also reveal that Netflix has struck a development deal with Barantini's It's All Made Up Productions, which the in-demand Barantini runs with Boiling Point exec Samantha Beddoe. A Netflix spokeswoman told us the streamer is “picking up the rights to Eat the Rich in connection to our development deal with Its All Made Up Productions.”

	We understand Franks plans to adapt the play herself, similar to how Richard Gadd transferred his one-man play into Netflix hit Baby Reindeer. Franks and her agent at Independent Talent Group had been meeting with producers in the UK and U.S., we are told. The adaptation is in early development and is not guaranteed to make it to screen.




			Watch on Deadline		







Eat the Rich (But Maybe Not Me Mates X) is inspired by Franks's life as a working-class student at Cambridge. It follows Jade, a first-year university student from Liverpool in the north of England who juggles secret cleaning shifts with the culture shock of Oxbridge privilege.


	The play, which comes from JFR Productions and director Tatenda Shamiso, has been praised for its exploration of the absurdities of class, money and belonging in the UK. It won The Scotsman's Fringe First Award, The Holden Street Theatres Award and The Filipa Bragança Award, and will soon begin a short run at the Soho Theatre in London.

	











	It's All Made Up, which is backed by Avalon, has a development deal with Netflix and is also making Hell Jumper for the streamer, a feature adaptation of the award-winning BBC documentary. 


	If Eat the Rich makes it to screen, it will follow in a line of Netflix shows adapted from plays that made a splash at Edinburgh.


Baby Reindeer was one of the streamer's most popular shows of 2024, having an outsized impact on the zeitgeist. Deadline then revealed that Netflix had scouted out Brian Watkins and Julia McDermott's Weather Girl, an apocalyptic one-woman play about a Californian weather girl in meltdown that staged sold out shows to rave reviews at Edinburgh. That show was recently confirmed with A24 and Robert Downey Jr's Team Downey. Eat the Rich will of course also draw comparisons to Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Fleabag, which ushered in the era of the buzzy one-person play and was adapted for TV by the BBC and Amazon.

	After wrapping Stranger Things, Sadie Sink is about to enter the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Spider-Man: Brand New Day, and there's a lot of speculation around her character.


	Sink joined the superhero film, but little is known about who she is playing, which has led to many rumors about her character and her red hair.


	“A lot of people forget that hair color can change, but yeah, I understand all of the theories,” Sink told Entertainment Weekly about the theories on who she is playing.


	Sink remained tight-lipped about her character, adding, “People will just have to wait and see. I'm excited for all of it to maybe be put to rest.”

Other actors who Sink will also share credits with include Jacob Batalon, Liza Colón-Zayas, Jon Bernthal, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Mando, Tramell Tillman, and Marvin Jones III.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: We hear that three big agents from CAA — Matt Martin, Trevor Astbury and Adam Schweitzer — are heading over to WME.


	Schweitzer's clients include Oppenheimer Oscar winner Cillian Murphy, 2x Oscar winner Christoph Waltz and Dune franchise actress Rebecca Ferguson.


	Martin is a Motion Picture Lit agent working with clients such as John Francis Daley, Michael Waldron, Jonathan Goldstein, Dean Fleischer Camp, John Swab and Stella Meghie. Martin came up through CAA.


	Astbury also works in motion picture lit with clients such as Len Wiseman and A Minecraft Movie producer Roy Lee. 

	











	This is par for the course: The holidays typically lead to agency jumping. Earlier today, Deadline reported that Olivia Blaustein joined Untitled as a lit manager after close to 15 years at CAA. Earlier this year Darian Lanzetta departed CAA for Mattel as a Senior Executive in Film.




			Watch on Deadline		







	That said, group defections from one major agency to another are rare and the last time several high-profile CAA agents left together was in 2020 when a faction departed to launch Range Media Partners. 


	WME declined to comment.

Happy for Trevor, Matt, and Adam. 

The CAA Feature Literary group continues to be a mess. It's sad considering they have such a stellar TV Lit department. But it's been costing them clients ever since the strike ended, and clearly these guys saw the writing on the wall. CAA doesn't care about feature writers anymore. If you're not a director, filmmaker, or writer/producer, it's GG's

Expect a bigger exodus from CAA in the next few months. The mood around that place is depressing.

WME is buying agents. It's a new day there. It's a new crew there. It's the best CAA alternative out there.

How long until another lawsuit?

No equity

Denis Villeneuve should also be listed as someone Matt did meaningful work for. Sure, he wasn't officially on Denis' team, but it was Matt who pitched Sicario to Denis' team back in the day. I was there, I'll always remember how excited then-baby agent Matt was that they loved his pitch. And more recently, it was once again Matt who pitched Denis to the Dune producers, who were at that time looking for a director, and they loved the idea and sent an offer. We've all seen how that's turned out for Denis. Wishing Matt the best with this surprising move!

I love that Matt just wrote about himself

Kaia Gerber's all bundled up in blue.

The 24-year-old model stepped out in Beverly Hills on Tuesday evening in a bold blueberry-hued faux fur statement coat worn over a micro-minidress. She accessorized with slingback pumps and shoulder-grazing silver hoop earrings.

The full look is from Mango's new party collection, on which Gerber collaborated as a brand ambassador. 

Her coat is currently on sale for $280, while the LBD — a high-neck knit mini with cut-out sides — retails for $100. 

Her shoes have a metal toe cap and stiletto heel, and are currently sold out online. The after-dark-inspired line launched in October and features embellished pieces in black and silver along with suiting and going-out tops.

Gerber joined Mango earlier this year, following in the footsteps of her lookalike mother's fellow supermodel peers. Cindy Crawford's former '90s runway rivals Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss have all served as ambassadors for the Barcelona-based label.

About her party style references, Gerber told Vogue she's “been a chronic Pinterest girl since [her] pre-teens” and usually looks to Audrey Hepburn or Jane Birkin — or else Moss in the early '90s. “If you don't know what to wear to a party, she always does chic, simple, and sexy really well,” she said.

In a separate interview with the publication earlier this year, she said she looks at old photos of her supermodel mom for beauty inspiration.

“The nice thing about like looking quite similar to a parent is if I want to know if a hair or makeup look will look good on me, I will look up pictures of my mom — because if it looks good on her, most of the time, I can pull it off as well,” 

The “Bottoms” actress has been enjoying plenty of mother-daughter moments lately. Earlier this month, Gerber and Crawford, 59, twinned in custom Gucci gowns at the 2025 LACMA Art+Film Gala.

Crawford wore an embellished off-the-shoulder gold gown while Gerber dazzled in a red sequined number.

Jennifer Aniston's boyfriend, Jim Curtis, was the perfect model for her haircare line, Lolavie.

The actress took to Instagram Tuesday to promote the new products that eliminate frizz, including the sculpting paste and hair oil. To test out the products, she ran them through her hunky beau's thick, salt-and-pepper locks.

“Cute!” Aniston, 56, exclaimed at the result, as Curtis, 50, smiled and blushed.

“A little bit a this… A little bit a that…. A little bit a cuuuute 😉,” the “Friends” alum added in the caption of the Instagram Reel.

This is Curtis' second appearance on Aniston's social media as the couple went Instagram-official earlier this month. 

The “Morning Show” star previously posted a black-and-white photo of them together with a sentimental caption that read, “Happy birthday my love. Cherished ❤️.”

Curtis returned the Instagram love by sharing more photos of himself and Aniston from his birthday celebration via his own account.

“If this is a dream I don't want to wake up ❤️,” he captioned the series of black-and-white snaps.

After confirming their relationship on social media, the Emmy winner gushed about her boyfriend in an interview with Elle, calling Curtis “quite extraordinary” and noted that he “helps many, many people.”

“He's very special, very normal, and very kind, and wants to help people heal, move through their trauma and stagnation into clarity,” she added. “It's a beautiful thing to commit your life to.”

Aniston was first linked to Curtis in July after they were seen canoodling on vacation together in Mallorca, Spain.

Page Six also exclusively reported that an eyewitness saw the pair getting cozy during an outing in Big Sur, Calif., a month before their getaway.

They were then spotted on several romantic outings and have gone on double dates with many of Aniston's A-list pals, including Courteney Cox, Jason Bateman and Adam Sandler.

Sandler, 59, even gave the author his stamp of approval while presenting Aniston with an award at Elle's 2025 Women in Hollywood Celebration on Nov. 17.

“When we are around you, me and [my wife] Jackie are so happy you and Jim found each other and are having the love affair you two deserve,” he joked. “We love you, Jim.”

Ryan Seacrest's impressive arm definition is turning heads.

The “American Idol” host posted an Instagram video of himself doing seated bicep curls, showing off his bulging biceps. Wearing a navy blue T-shirt and gym shorts, the 50-year-old pumped iron and breathed heavily with effort as his trainer counted his 10 reps.

“The trick is to wear a t-shirt two sizes too small,” he joked in the caption.

Some fans were shocked by his fit physique.

“Bro is shredded!” one commenter wrote.

One user joked, “It's 2025, Kelly Clarkson is still the nation's sweetheart but Seacrest is now jacked. Love this for the world.”

More comments included, “Guns a blazin' 🔥” and “Okay jacked 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻.”

Seacrest's famous friends also shared words of encouragement.

“Queer Eye for the Straight Guy” alum Carson Kressley cracked, “Headed to Baby Gap now!”

Michael Bublé humorously commented, “I can't wait to see you in the new terminator reboot 🔥.”

The “Wheel of Fortune” host isn't shy about showing off his workouts on social media, and earlier this year, some fans worried he had dropped too much weight.

“Ryan I adore you, But … the big BUT…….. You are looking too thin,” a fan commented on his Instagram post in June. 

“Sometimes being too thin can age a person,” another observer wrote.

The television personality said he was “over-exercising, eating better, over-training” ahead of turning 50 last December in an interview with his younger sister, Meredith, on Entertainment Tonight.

“I'm doing everything I can to feel like I'm not 50,” he said, noting he also does “lots of muscle recovery, cold plunging and steaming.”

“Anything I can do to make myself feel 29 again,” he joked.

Robert Irwin and Xochitl Gomez did little to dispel dating rumors with a private pre-show powwow. 

Irwin, who is one of four finalists on Tuesday's season finale of “Dancing With the Stars,” was pictured privately hanging out with Gomez ahead of the big night. 

In photos obtained by TMZ, Gomez, 19, presented Irwin with a massive bouquet, gave him an affectionate side hug and laughed and chatted with him.

The actress wore a black strapless dress with a detached collar, while Irwin wore a sparkling black button down top and slacks.

A source told the outlet that Gomez also “spent some time backstage” with members of Irwin's family. 

Page Six has reached out to reps for Irwin and Gomez. 

The actress — who won Season 32 of the dance competition series with Val Chmerkovskiy — first sparked dating rumors with Irwin, 21, with a jaw-dropping dance routine during the show's 20th anniversary celebration earlier this month.

When TMZ later informed Irwin that “everyone” was “asking” if they were “an item,” Irwin instead directed attention to how much “fun” they had during the intimate performance. 

Advertisement

“Oh my gosh, we had the best time,” Irwin told the outlet, adding, “That dance was so much fun.”

The high energy performance saw the nature conservationist and “DWTS” alum perform a high-energy jive to “Dance with Me Tonight” by Olly Murs.

Irwin also addressed his foxtrot tribute to his late father, Robert Irwin, along with his sister, Bindi Irwin, and pro partner, Witney Carson.

“It was so cool to do two, such distinct dances,” Robert told TMZ on Nov. 14.

“Like, one that was really slow and heartfelt. And then the dance with Xochitl which was just like energy and fun.” Robert gushed of Gomez. “She's the best, it's been really, really great.”

Robert's sighting with Gomez comes after it was revealed the Australian TV personality suffered a rib injury hours before the competition.

“Today at [camera] blocking is a little stressful because we just have to make the freestyle all come together. Robert's ribs have been killing him and more will be revealed on Tuesday and you guys can get a better idea of what we've been dealing with all week,” Carson explained via TikTok on Monday.

Carson also revealed that the dancing duo had to “change some things” in their routines, and it was “the most stressful part.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","In a moody, cartoony Pluribus , the hive mind finally gets fed up with Carol","https://www.avclub.com/pluribus-recap-season-1-episode-5-got-milk","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

When Vince Gilligan first announced that he and Peter Gould were working on a Saul Goodman-focused Breaking Bad spin-off, they initially described their new project as a comedy. During the development process, that plan obviously changed. But it's not hard to see why Gilligan assumed he could go that route. Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul are both filled with dryly funny dialogue and cleverly constructed, clockwork-precise visual gags—which crank up carefully and then go pop, like a jack-in-the-box.

It'd be a stretch to describe Pluribus as an out-and-out comedy. But the more time Carol spends alone, the more Gilligan and his team (including this week's credited screenwriter Ariel Levine and director Gordon Smith) seem to be taking lessons from Looney Tunes. There are moments in this week's “Got Milk” that play like a Jacques Tati film—or like Tex Avery's old MGM “The House Of Tomorrow” cartoon—where modern technology goes haywire, making life more complicated for some overwhelmed dope.

The “modern technology,” in this case, is the Joined, who make a radical decision at the start of this episode. Unable to cope any longer with Carol's surly, chaotic energy, they abandon Albuquerque, en masse, leaving behind only a skeletal drone army to respond to any requests Carol might have. The robots prove to be a poor substitute. We can see with our own eyes over the course of this episode the huge difference between the way a hive-run facility operates—like an eerily efficient, organic machine—and the clunky awkwardness of the literal machines assigned to run the city in their absence.

The first sign that things won't go smoothly comes when Carol makes a call to the Joined around the same time we see them streaming out of Albuquerque in a convoy of cars and buses. The image of the vehicles rolling out, all in a row, is impressive…and kind of beautiful. The recorded message Carol gets on her phone is anything but. The voice on the line explains the situation, then thoughtfully adds, “Our feelings for you haven't changed, Carol; but after everything that's happened, we just need a little space.” For the rest of the episode, every time Carol calls, she has to sit through this entire answering machine recording with this same addendum. It runs on for so long. It gets funnier every time.

Carol's requests aren't handled all that well either. With the city emptied out and powered down, packs of wild dogs now roam freely through town, scavenging through the garbage. Carol calls to get the lights turned back on, then calls again to ask about trash pickup. When a drone comes flying in to haul her trash bags away, it struggles with the weight, before getting tangled on a lamppost. A lot of the framing in this episode makes Carol look small and alone, and this works to wonderful comic effect when she's standing—all tiny—on the far edge of the frame and watching her garbage spill onto the street on the other edge, thanks to a clumsy drone.

The trash drone is actually the second one to come to Carol's aid. Earlier in the episode, she records a video message for her fellow un-Joined, in which—after putting on a business-like jacket and making sure her booze bottles are out of the picture—she lays out what she's learned about “these afflicted people, these Others.” She also issues a warning, saying that if her peers are of the opinion that the collective is making the world better, they should relish that opinion, because, “It may be the last one you ever possess.” She insists that the Others translate her message for anyone who doesn't speak English and then send it to all concerned. “If you don't do it, I can't be held responsible for the biblically shitty mood in which I will no doubt find myself,” she says into the answering machine. Minutes later, the first sputtery drone arrives, to carry her message to the masses.

Or does it? Much as with last week's episode, the true cleverness of “Got Milk” comes not just from its wry gags but for how they fit together and push the plot forward. With no confirmation that anyone's listening or that anything she does matters, Carol begins relying on herself more, and the results are astonishing. I mean literally astonishing—as in Carol ends this episode with a look of astonishment on her face.

One of her “Carol taking care of Carol” moments is more character-building than plot-building. When the wild dogs return and begin digging up Helen's grave—seen in a terrifying, jittery hand-held shot—Carol uses her purloined police car's siren to scare them off. The next day she picks up some concrete slabs at the hardware store, to make sure Helen's final resting place will remain undisturbed. She even paints a little headstone for the plot, as the sun sets. It's lovely.

But earlier, when Carol suffers through her trash mishap, she makes a more significant discovery: The dumpsters in her neighborhood are filled with used milk cartons. We never see the Joined eat, but they do drink milk pretty regularly. Carol tracks their milk supply to a local dairy, where she finds a warehouse full of sugary grains in heaping, heavy sacks. She tests the final milk product, finding that it's odorless and non-acidic and has a weird amber color and a texture like olive oil.

Then, in another example of Pluribus playing the “think along with Carol” game, we see her track the sacks containing the milk powder to a local pet-food packager, Agri-Jet. Inside the Agri-Jet warehouse—where it's bitterly cold—she sees something that makes her gasp in horror. To be continued! 

We don't see what she sees, of course—just her reaction. But a crafty visual storyteller can do a lot with a good reaction shot, properly deployed and using just the right face. There's nothing like a good pop of surprise at the end of an hour of cranking.

Nearly a decade after an anonymous Fast & Furious star called Dwayne Johnson a “candy ass,” turning the e La Familia into a “two Christmases” household, Vin Diesel, who many believe to be the “candy ass” sayer, has offered some unexpected praise of his former Fast co-star. In an Instagram post about The Smashing Machine, Diesel takes a moment to “celebrate Dwayne.” Despite the two having a complicated working relationship, Diesel had nothing but praise for Johnson in the post, writing, “People don't understand what it takes to uphold a global perception every single day. I remember asking our global family who they'd love to see me work with, and a woman named Jan left a comment saying her dream was for me to collaborate with Dwayne.”

Jan's suggestion, according to Diesel, led to “one of the most dynamic pairings in cinema, two strong personalities who pushed each other and created something unforgettable.” Those two strong personalities were so combative, apparently, that they had to be separated, leading to a couple of weird shots in Fast 6 and Johnson's Fast spin-off, Hobbs & Shaw. But, Dielsel continues, “When he stepped into Hobbs, he did it with full commitment and left an indelible mark on Universal's character hall of fame.”

Diesel is old friends with Smashing Machine subject, Mark Kerr, “one of the first friends” he made in Los Angeles, and who trained Diesel for the first XXX movie. “This is a man who would often tell me about the kids he was teaching to wrestle, to fight, to take ownership of their lives usually for no money at all,” he writes. “Mark Kerr is so deserving of this moment… and Dwayne really did it… He brought us back in time and shined doing it.”

Is this the first step toward actually getting the final Fast & Furious movie made? Who knows. But for one glorious day in November, no one was a candy ass, and we all smelled what the Rock was cooking.

Undeterred by the swift backlash to the Riyadh comedy festival, the adaptation of the young-adult romance Chasing Red is set to film in Saudi Arabia next year. Starring Riverdale‘s Madelaine Petsch and Summer I Turned Pretty‘s Gavin Casalegno, Chasing Red is the first part of the Red saga, a massively popular collection of young-adult books written by Isabelle Ronin on the platform Wattpad. The series follows Veronica (Petsch), a.k.a. “Red,” a straight-A college student with a troubled past, who has undeniable chemistry with the charming playboy, Caleb (Casalegno). It has since been published as a WEBTOON comic and a physically published book. For its next act, it'll be doing some light whitewashing of the Saudi government, which, in addition to allegedly dismembering journalist Jamal Khashoggi, recently hosted the likes of Dave Chappelle, Aziz Ansari, Bill Burr, and Louis C.K. for the Riyadh Comedy Festival.

Wattpad has become a significant generator of young-adult content for studios in the last decade. Netflix's The Kissing Booth was written initially for Wattpad, as were the four After movies, which have allegedly grossed more than $168 million. Unfortunately, we haven't been big fans of the After films. Reviewing for The A.V. Club, Caroline Siede wrote, “Though After We Fell aims for the scintillating eroticism of a lithe young couple risking getting caught with some semi-public hot tub sex, the whole experience is more akin to taking a lukewarm bath in a swimsuit.”

J.D. and Turk still can't do this all on their own. Thankfully, they've got their old friends scrubbing in once again. Despite being down a showrunner, the Scrubs reboot is still riding the ambulance to Sacred Heart Hospital for its February 2026 debut. Fifteen years after they said goodbye to their legion of patients, Zach Braff and Donald Faison have their stethoscopes at the ready for another season of Scrubs. To prove it, here's the first teaser for the revival.

﻿

Here's the synopsis from Disney:

J.D. and Turk scrub in together for the first time in a long time: Medicine has changed; interns have changed; but their bromance has stood the test of time. Characters new and old navigate the waters of Sacred Heart with laughter, heart, and some surprises along the way.

Aside from Neil Flynn's absence, the whole cast, including Braff, Faison, Sarah Chalke, Judy Reyes, and John C. McGinley, appears physically unchanged from their mid-2000s heyday. Still, they also have no trouble falling back into the familiar comedic rhythms of the show. Dr. Cox is still giving it to J.D. as Turk and Elliot follow the fun. The teaser also sets up the series' premise. J.D. is “back, baby,” to teach a new class of medical interns, and in the teaser, he comes face-to-face with a new group of Zoomer medical professionals who have no idea who he is.

Scrubs returns on February 25, 2026, on ABC.

The Running Man may be out of steam, but Paramount is entering uncharted waters with Glen Powell. Per Variety, Powell is producing an R-rated teen comedy for Paramount called The Fuckboat. Variety‘s reporting makes no mention of the Chad Powers star putting on a thick layer of prosthetics to pose as a pimple-faced teenager to sneak aboard the boat. Still, we could imagine him playing, perhaps, a permissive older sibling who helps his little bro procure access to said Fuckboat. As of right now, however, Powell is producing through his production company, Barnstorm. The movie is a high-concept teen comedy in the vein of Risky Business and Easy A, written by Caroline Glenn and Sean Doherty. Glenn has no screen credits to her name, but her first novel, Cruelty Free, is set to be published in February. Doherty previously worked on Conan and is currently a producer for Team Coco.

The Fuckboat continues to show Powell's interest in making studio comedies as a part of his whole star persona. In addition to preparing the Fuckboat for the water, Barnstorm is currently developing projects with Barry Jenkins, Ron Howard, and Judd Apatow. Yet Powell's ascent to becoming the heir apparent to Tom Cruise has been mixed at best. This fall was supposed to be his big coming out, offering the one-two punch of Chad Powers and Running Man. Neither moved the needle much, with Powers disappearing into the void of streaming shows, despite Powell sporting a big honking nose and a funny voice. Similarly, Powell's star power did not make Running Man the must-see film of the season. However, it did allow the star to indulge his affinity for disguise once again. His next crack at leading-man immortality is A24's How To Make Killing, which comes out in February. It's another one of these “eat the rich” satires that never seems to be as funny as you want it to be.

Demi Lovato is used to creating a stir with her music, and now, she's caused a buzz over her bikini pics. The star took to Instagram to show off a pair of swimsuits that are both just as sleek as the star herself.

In the collection of photos, Demi can first be seen in a black two-piece bikini. While the high-waisted swimsuit is rather simple, it's also totally chic.

Beyond that, Demi also “modeled a retro-inspired high-waisted bikini from Monday Swimwear, pairing it with dainty gold earrings and rectangular Miu Miu frames,” according to InStyle.

In the caption, she added a lyric from one of her songs, writing, “cool for the summer, warm for the winter 🤍”

Demi's photos stirred up plenty of reactions from fans who loved what she was sharing.

One person wrote, “demi why are u so freaking gorgeous like hello 😍 stunning af”

“She's servinggggg,” someone else added.

A third person left a comment saying, “Wooooooooow ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥”

Another person wrote, “i love to see you shinning like this ❤️”

Her husband, Jutes, also left a comment saying, “What a babe 😍”

Demi obviously likes to spend time in the sun, which is why this isn't the first time the star has shared photos of herself enjoying warm weather while wearing a bikini.

For instance, in May, Demi “hit the pool in a sizzling black bandeau bikini, just weeks before the official start of summer,” according to Page Six. “…the ‘Confident' singer donned the chic two-piece number with a pair of basic black sunglasses for an impromptu photo shoot.”

In June, the star popped up pics from her honeymoon and “wore a bright red bikini with a skirt cover-up while soaking up the sun with her other half on their beach vacation,” per Page Six. 

Another photo “showed the songstress posing knee-deep in the ocean while showing off a black Hunza G two-piece swimsuit ($270).” That's not to mention the fact that she “also modeled a striped bandeau bikini” and “[i]n another snap, the singer soaked up the sun while rocking the bright red JADE Swim bikini.”

Then, in August, she shared shots of herself in a black and white bikini top with a skirt, a black and white swimsuit with a tube top, as well as an adorable blue two-piece. 

Clearly, she has a few bikinis to choose from when she's in the mood to hang out by the pool or on a beach.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Terri Irwin Makes Emotional Post for Son Robert's DWTS Mirrorball Win","https://entertainmentnow.com/dancing-with-the-stars/terri-irwin-celebrates-robert-dwts-win/","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 15:10:29 GMT","

When Terri Irwin penned a heartfelt Instagram post following Robert Irwin's victory on Dancing with the Stars, the moment took on extra meaning. Her words captured more than pride — they conveyed a mother's joy, a family's legacy, and the powerful emotional resonance behind Robert earning the Mirrorball Trophy alongside his partner Witney Carson. With Robert and Witney's win, Terri's post became a celebration not just of dance, but of heritage, perseverance, and deep-rooted love. As confetti fell and music faded, Robert's win felt like a shared family triumph.

Terri captioned “Congratulations Robert! Your passion, dedication, hard work, and kind heart got you to this point. A night you will remember forever. Thank you to everyone who supported Robert through this journey, and made us realise that even a zookeeper can learn to dance. Witney – you are now part of our family. God bless. I am so very proud of you, Robert. I know your dad is too. Wow!”

Days before the finale, Terri gave fans a preview of what was at stake: heart. In a post she shared via Instagram Reel, she reflected on Robert's childhood, describing him as “the boy full of wonder and adventure,” and called him “your father's son.” She wrote that when Robert danced “for the final time tomorrow,” she would be “holding a lifetime of love in my heart.” 

The actual night delivered — not in fireworks, but in raw emotion. Robert's dances with Witney, especially during “Dedication Night,” became more than steps and music. They turned into a tribute to his mom's resilience, and a public acknowledgment of love, loss (for his late father, Steve Irwin), and the family threads that carry on. 

In the lead-up to the finale, Witney revealed that rehearsals had been brutal — physically and emotionally. She admitted, “My body is feeling it right now, Robert's body is feeling it right now,” and that the pair felt like they were “kind of falling apart” from exhaustion. Nonetheless, Terri's post served as a grounding anchor — a reminder of love and family beyond the spotlight. Her pride, love, and faith in Robert transformed what could have been just another win into something deeply human.

Robert Irwin's Season 34 victory closed a circle for the family. He and Witney Carson were crowned champions after a tight finale, earning the coveted Mirrorball trophy. Terri's post reflected how much more the win meant when viewed against the Irwin family's history — not just in wildlife conservation, but in dance.

This triumph echoes the earlier success of his older sister, Bindi Irwin, who won Season 21 of the same competition years ago. In her own career, Bindi turned the Mirrorball into a symbol of joy, resilience, and emotional openness — and now Robert carries that torch forward. Terri's emotional caption didn't just celebrate the present win — it honored a legacy of family strength, love, and shared achievement.

Robert Irwin's Mirrorball win and Terri Irwin's emotional post mark a milestone that's about more than dance. It's about identity, legacy, healing — and family's ability to hold you up when you soar. For viewers, it's a powerful reminder that behind contestants and choreography are stories, roots, and real people carrying hope, grief, joy.

For Terri, this moment offered public acknowledgment of her love and sacrifices — a validation that a family built on wilderness and compassion can gracefully step into the glitter of the ballroom. For Robert, it wasn't just about winning; it was about honoring the past while dancing toward the future.

Russell Crowe, a longtime friend of the Irwin family, made a rare appearance during “Dancing with the Stars” finale week and shared what he believes Steve Irwin would think of Robert's emotional run on the show. In an interview with the New York Times published Sunday, November 23, Crowe said Steve would be “so impressed” by his son's performances. 

Robert, 21, went on to win the season 34 title on Tuesday, Nov. 25, after delivering some of his strongest dances of the competition.

“Although Steve could read the rhythms of the seasons and every living creature, he was absolutely not gifted with a sense of musical rhythm,” Crowe joked. “In his hands, a tambourine became a deadly weapon.”

He added that Steve would be moved by watching Robert perform on the ballroom floor. “I think he would watch Robert dancing and how he uses his body, the strength and poise, and he would be in awe of his son.”

Crowe's warm memories highlight the bond he shared with the late conservationist and the way he sees Steve reflected in Robert today.

Crowe repeated one of his favorite anecdotes from their friendship. “Although Steve could read the rhythms of the seasons and every living creature, he was absolutely not gifted with a sense of musical rhythm,” he said again. “In his hands, a tambourine became a deadly weapon.”

The actor said Steve's lack of rhythm only makes Robert's success on “DWTS” more striking. He believes Steve would be “in awe” of Robert's precision, strength, and musicality.

Robert has often said Crowe has played a significant role in helping him understand who his father was. At the 2025 AFI Fest premiere of Crowe's film “Nuremberg,” Robert attended with his mother, Terri Irwin, and spoke about the impact the actor has had on him.

“I've known him for as long as I've been alive,” he said. “I have some very early memories, actually. Some of the earliest memories of me with my dad were also with Russell, which is really special.”

Robert said Crowe gives him a view of Steve that he cannot get anywhere else. “I'm really grateful that I have someone in my life who … he's actually been there to, in a way, keep my dad alive in my life,” he continued. “He has so many stories to share of him and dad, and I feel like I build an even better picture of my dad when I'm around Russell.”

Robert added that Crowe offers a perspective he cannot get from his mother, Terri, or his sister, Bindi, who won season 21 of “DWTS” with Derek Hough in 2015. 

“Russell and dad were just great mates, so it's a different perspective than when you're hearing about your mom,” he explained. “It's meaningful. He's someone that I look up to and has truly inspired me.”

Steve Irwin became a global icon through his series “Crocodile Hunter.” He died on Sept. 4, 2006, after being attacked by a stingray while filming an underwater documentary.

When Penélope Cruz walked onstage at the Academy Awards last March, she uttered three words that marked a turning point for Brazilian cinema: “I'm Still Here.” Presenting the award for Best International Feature, Cruz announced the film directed by Walter Salles and starring Fernanda Torres as the winner. Across Brazil, people celebrated in bars and public squares that warm Carnival Sunday night as if the country had just won the World Cup. In a way, it had: It was the first time Brazil had ever brought an Oscar home.

Only weeks later, “The Secret Agent”, directed by Kleber Mendonça Filho, took home Best Director and Best Actor (for Wagner Moura) at the Cannes Film Festival. Distributed in the U.S. by Neon, the film is now expected to follow the footsteps of “I'm Still Here”; currently, Petra Costa's documentary “Apocalypse in the Tropics” is also positioned for an Oscar nomination. By early 2025, a sense of rebirth permeated the industry. With three major international victories in a row — the Oscars, Cannes, and Berlin, where Gabriel Mascaro's “The Blue Trail” won the Grand Jury Prize — Brazilian cinema seemed to have rediscovered a long-awaited sense of stability.

Yet as the year draws to a close, those red carpets and golden trophies haven't translated into greenlights for those working behind the cameras. The very system that made this resurgence possible is now stalling — and must be jump-started to deliver on the promise of a strong, steady industry symbolized by Salles' Oscar win.

 










Oscar-nominated “I'm Still Here” producer Rodrigo Teixeira summed up the moment with both excitement and caution. “Brazilian cinema is enjoying an incredible level of visibility — maybe the best in decades — but that doesn't mean the system works,” he said. “We need to make films consistently, not just when the political winds blow our way.” Teixeira, who works across Brazil, Europe, and the United States, has a rare vantage point, knowing the inner workings of three production ecosystems. In his view, Brazil “has the talent and the ideas — but not the predictability.”

The numbers underscore the paradox. A study by the MPA (Motion Picture Association) and Oxford Economics found that Brazil's audiovisual industry now generates about R$ 70 billion a year (roughly $1.3 billion U.S.D.) and supported 608,970 jobs in 2024 — more than the country's automotive sector. Yet Brazil still lacks an industrial policy that treats cinema as a strategic sector rather than an artistic exception. This absence of consistent structure resurfaces with every political cycle, subjecting the industry to a roller coaster of incentives and setbacks.

Today's wave of success stems from a framework of public policy decades in the making. Since the creation of the Audiovisual Law in 1993 and the Sectorial Audiovisual Fund (FSA) in 2006, Brazil has built a system that combines tax incentives, public grants, and direct investment. In theory, it's a mechanism capable of sustaining a robust industry. In practice, the machine has jammed.

 










Ana Paula Sousa, a journalist and film professor at ESPM-SP, noted that Brazil's model is unique in its scope. “No other Latin American country has such a comprehensive system, from screenwriting to distribution. The problem is that it's become too slow,” she said. Each step — project evaluation, funding approval, auditing — has piled up in endless bureaucratic queues, delaying production by years.

Sousa, author of the book “The Cinema You Don't See: The Political War Behind Brazilian Film Production in the 21st Century,” said part of the paralysis stems from staff shortages and overlapping duties at Ancine, Brazil's national film agency. “Many of the agency's most experienced professionals left during years of institutional dismantling, and the new teams are still finding their footing,” she explains. “It's a system that depends on people, not just on rules — and when people leave, the engine stops.”

The FSA, the country's main source of public film funding, currently has more than 800 approved projects awaiting disbursement. Some of the money is frozen due to budgetary or legal impasses. Meanwhile, producers are racking up costs and missing deadlines for international co-productions. “A European investor doesn't understand what it means to wait two years for a funding decision,” Teixeira said. “That kills a project before it begins.”

 










The contrast between the pace of artistic creation and the speed of government bureaucracy has become emblematic of what Brazil must overcome. In October, the Ministry of Culture announced R$ 100 million in new audiovisual investments for the state of São Paulo — a welcome gesture, but one that doesn't change the structural reality. It's a short-term relief for a system in need of deep reform.

Behind the award-season euphoria lies a stubborn math problem. A study presented at the Rio2C conference in April revealed that streaming platforms in Brazil earn more than R$ 75 billion annually, yet only a tiny fraction of that money returns to independent production. The long-debated VOD (video on demand) regulation bill aims to correct that imbalance.

The bill, approved by Brazil's lower house in October, requires foreign streaming companies to contribute a percentage of their revenue to national productions. But compromises between government and corporations have diluted the intended impact. Industry estimates suggest that out of R$ 75 billion in total revenue, roughly R$ 1.4 billion should flow into the FSA — but after exemptions and deductions, the real number won't exceed R$ 185 million a year. 

“That's nowhere near enough for a market this size,” said Mauro Garcia, executive director of BRAVI, which represents more than 600 independent producers.

 










Garcia said the problem isn't just the amount but the distribution model: “Platforms will be able to allocate some of those resources directly to projects of their choice. That weakens the fund's public role and reduces room for truly independent production.” 

In other words, a law designed to democratize the market could end up reinforcing its inequalities, a side effect already seen in other countries.

Regulatory uncertainty also scares off foreign investors. “No one wants to enter a market where the rules change every year,” Teixeira said. “Cinema depends on trust, not surprises.” That legal instability, combined with the slow pace of public funding, has created a paralyzing climate. Award-winning filmmakers return home to find a system incapable of supporting them.

For mid-size producers — those without access to international funds — each new public grant cycle brings renewed hope, followed by years of waiting. “It's a limbo,” said Garcia. “You have a project approved, but no idea when you'll actually be able to shoot. Meanwhile, you have to pay staff, rent, consultants. It's impossible to plan.”

Sousa identified unpredictability as the industry's biggest enemy. “Brazil doesn't just need more money; it needs a reliable calendar. If calls for projects came out every April, producers could plan ahead. Right now, they live off rumors.” Teixeira agreed, calling it “an annual lottery with no draw date.”

 










The situation worsens because many state and municipal funds depend on federal disbursements, creating a domino effect of delays. Small production companies often downsize or fold, shrinking the labor market. A 2023 survey by SICAV (Sindicato Interestadual da Indústria Audiovisual) found a 44% drop in production volume, a direct consequence of administrative bottlenecks and lack of predictability. Paradoxically, it remains one of Brazil's fastest-growing sectors in revenue, as noted by the MPA and Oxford Economics. The market generates wealth but not stability; it's large and labor-intensive yet still precarious.

While Congress debates VOD regulation and the restoration of the FSA, another challenge looms: rebuilding Brazil's film ecosystem after years of political dismantling and economic crisis. The country entered a recession between 2014 and 2016, ending the decade with stagnant GDP and high inflation that eroded purchasing power and drastically reduced cultural investment.

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 made things worse. According to studies by Ancine, BRAVI, and Tela Viva, film production fell by roughly 80%, with shoots halted, funding calls suspended, and dozens of independent producers shutting down. Reports by UniCEUB (Brasília University Center) based on Ancine data recorded a 35.3% drop in film releases from 2019 to 2020, while trade publications estimated that around half of production companies laid off staff at the height of the crisis.

 










The governments of Michel Temer (2016–18) and Jair Bolsonaro (2019–23), the far-right icon, accelerated the institutional collapse. Temer downgraded the Ministry of Culture to a sub-secretariat under the presidential office, stripping it of autonomy and budget. Bolsonaro went further: on his first day in office, he abolished the ministry altogether, dismantled cultural councils, and froze audiovisual funds. The result was near-total paralysis. Today's challenge is not merely to unfreeze money, but to rebuild a dismantled policy and redefine who has access to it.

Behind the scenes, the industry now faces a delicate debate between representation and efficiency. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said recent funding programs have prioritized identity-based criteria — race, gender, geography — without equally strong technical evaluation mechanisms. “The goal of promoting diversity is legitimate and necessary,” the source said, “but when political criteria outweigh technical ones, the system risks stalling again.”

The debate — present across the cultural sector but particularly intense in film — reveals a tension between inclusion and predictability. Brazil is striving to correct decades of invisibility for Black, Indigenous, and female filmmakers while trying to rebuild a bureaucracy that works.

 










Sousa argues that balance is crucial. “Affirmative policies are essential, but they need structure and training behind them. Otherwise, we build inclusion without support.” That gap is what institutions like Projeto Paradiso, a nonprofit dedicated to developing Brazilian talent and screenwriting, aim to fill.

“Our focus is on preparing professionals to engage with the global market,” said Josephine Bourgois, executive director of Projeto Paradiso. In just over five years, the initiative has supported more than 500 projects and scholarships, connecting young writers and producers with international programs. “It's not enough for Brazil to have great ideas,” she added. “Those ideas need to travel and be understood abroad.”

A recent Ancine study found that Brazil's audiovisual sector faces a shortage of skilled technical professionals — a bottleneck that limits production growth. In this context, the Paulo Gustavo Law, passed in 2022 and implemented in 2023, injected R$ 1.06 billion into the industry, distributing funds across all states and capitals. The measure played a crucial role in restarting shoots and rehiring crews — a welcome lifeline, though far from a structural fix.

Projeto Paradiso's work highlights that middle ground between public policy and market logic, a bridge in an otherwise fragmented ecosystem. “When there's a gap between funding cycles, professionals lose momentum,” Bourgois said. “Our role is to keep the flame alive between one round and the next.”

 










The metaphor neatly describes Brazil's current predicament: preventing its international momentum from fading while domestic gears still grind.

Institutional reconstruction also runs through Ancine, now trying to rebuild its staff and credibility. In November, the agency announced a new calendar of funding calls and a plan to simplify accountability processes — steps producers see as positive, though still insufficient.

“It takes more than political will,” said BRAVI's Garcia. “The machine is tired. Many public servants have left, and those who remain are overworked. What we need is regulatory intelligence and modern management.”

Brazilian cinema knows this cycle of collapse and revival all too well. In the 1990s, President Fernando Collor de Mello dismantled the state-run Embrafilme and shut down public film funding, triggering a devastating blackout. When Carla Camurati's Carlota Joaquina, Princess of Brazil grossed R$ 1.29 million in 1995, it became the unlikely symbol of a rebirth later dubbed the Retomada — the “film comeback.”

By the decade's end, Bruno Barreto's “Four Days in September,” Fábio Barreto's “O Quatrilho,” and Salles' “Central Station” were all Oscar nominees; Fernanda Montenegro, a national icon and Fernanda Torres' mother, earned a historic Best Actress nomination. In the early 2000s, Fernando Meirelles' “City of God” scored nominations for directing, screenplay, editing, and cinematography, cementing Brazil's global reputation. The “Retomada” was real — but full maturity still hasn't arrived.

 










Since 2023, Brazil's Ministry of Culture has been working to rebuild audiovisual policy. Initiatives once discontinued, like the Reunião com o Setor dialogue series, have resumed, and there are ongoing efforts to decentralize production beyond Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Yet progress is slow. Many pre-2020 projects remain on hold, and new funding lines are advancing at a crawl.

Teixeira sees this moment as a chance to redefine priorities. “Brazil needs to treat cinema as an industry, not as a government pet project. As long as we depend on the goodwill of whoever's in office, there won't be consistency.”

Despite the gridlock, signs of adaptation are emerging. The rise of FAST (free ad-supported streaming TV) channels — a trend discussed at this year's Rio2C — has opened new windows for Brazilian films and series on digital platforms. The model, which offers free content supported by advertising, could become a key outlet for independent productions sidelined by major streamers. Meanwhile, the international success of “I'm Still Here” and “The Secret Agent” has reignited global interest in Brazilian stories.

At the same time, Brazil faces the same global challenge as everyone else: bringing audiences back to theaters. According to Ancine and Comscore, the country saw a 19.6% increase in attendance and 24.9% growth in box-office revenue in 2024 compared with the previous year. Even so, admissions remain below pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a slow transition from streaming consumption back to the big screen.

 










For this moment to translate into lasting stability, the gears of creation, funding, and distribution will need to align. Brazilian cinema closes 2025 with rare global visibility — and a domestic market still under reconstruction. “There's no strong cinema without strong policy,” said Sousa. Brazilian film, she added, is as resilient as the Brazilian people themselves.

“The Secret Agent” opens in New York on November 26 and in Los Angeles on December 5.

“It's almost impossible to get the definitive story,” Paul McCartney theorizes in the brand-new addition to “The Beatles Anthology,” which sparked a mid-'90s wave of Beatlemania. “Because people look at things from different points of view.” It's a telling line, one that explains why, 30 years on from the original's premiere, and a further 25 years since their disbanding, the Fab Four's past is still being meticulously explored.  

Since the turn of the decade alone, there's been two documentaries about their exploits in India, the Martin Scorsese-produced origins story “Beatles ‘64,” and Peter Jackson's deep dive into the recording of “Let It Be.” And let's not forget Sam Mendes' forthcoming four — yes four! — individual biopics.

Of course, “The Beatles Anthology” can lay claim to being the don of the Merseysiders' vast filmography. Born from an archival, and unreleased, doc produced the year after their 1970 split, the project was then intended to accompany a reunion concert John Lennon had reportedly been planning just days before his murder. However, it later evolved into an all-encompassing multimedia affair, including an album, book, and prime-time TV series which not only boasted the full blessing of the surviving members, but their modern-day reflections. And from the heart of their back catalogue, Abbey Road Studios, too.  

 










Getting by with a little help from longtime obsessive Jackson's production company, Disney+'s latest love-in restores this footage, and alongside breaking its six parts into eight, adds a ninth assembled from the cutting room floor. The question is, was there anything really worth salvaging? 

Well, it's fair to say not every once-lost insight was a lost gem. “It was crazy times, but great times, I had a really good time, but it was crazy,” Ringo Starr summarizes arguably the most impactful period in pop cultural history, the kind of vague platitude which perhaps explains why lyrical duties were left to his bandmates. Moreover, several anecdotes which may have felt more revelatory back in 1995 have since become part of Beatles lore.  

Yet director Oliver Murray, whose largely musical resume also includes 2023 “The Last Beatles Song,” has still found plenty of wheat among the chaff. Receiving the lion's share of screentime, George Harrison reveals the idea to record new material using Lennon's home demos stemmed from his time in The Traveling Wilburys, when the death of Roy Orbison prompted Elvis Presley's estate to offer the King's posthumous services. “It seemed a bit gimmicky,” he explains why the supergroup politely declined.  

 










Musos will be especially fascinated by the performances of bluegrass favorite “Blue Moon of Kentucky” and McCartney's first notable composition “Thinking of Linking,” and when producer Sir George Martin — who describes the whole anthology process as a “fairly traumatic time” — sits at a mixing desk isolating contributions to “Tomorrow Never Knows” and “You Never Give Me Your Money”: the astonished reactions of the surrounding Beatles provides one of the episode's highlights.  

Likewise, the glimpses of the sessions which spawned “Free as a Bird,” “Real Love,” and eventually “Now and Then,” the latter of which only surfaced 28 years later to chart-topping, Grammy-winning success. There's a pleasing sense of closure in knowing the trio's creative woes were belatedly resolved. But it's also a joy to watch when the band and producer Jeff Lynne — who talks of spending weeks painstakingly cleaning up the source material — realize they're already onto a winner. “It sounds just like The Beatles,” Starr notes in amazement on hearing one of the finished products.  

This encore is most compelling, though, when it looks toward its absentee. Harrison expresses his sadness that Lennon was robbed of the chance to partake in a project he'd previously spearheaded (“I think he would have enjoyed this opportunity to get together with us”). Meanwhile, McCartney recalls requiring a hankie on first hearing his old partner-in-crime's singing voice from beyond the grave. In another touching studio scene you'd have expected to make the edit first time round, he also admits to fantasizing Lennon has simply popped out for lunch (“Even though John's not here, he's here”). As the camera pans to an empty chair, you may well be drying your eyes, too.   

 










Unsurprisingly from what's essentially a retrospective of a retrospective, Lennon himself isn't quite as visible as in the previous eight episodes, the archivel footage which previously helped complement his bandmates' recollections kept to a minimum. Instead, Murray wisely allows us to enjoy the sight of three bona fide legends — here in their casual, denim-clad, fifty-something era — clearly reveling in each other's company (six years before his untimely death, Harrison's closing quip about the future of their relationship takes on an extra poignancy).  

And they're in fine form throughout, whether jokingly announcing plans to launch a stadium tour as mud wrestlers, acknowledging the anthology would have been disastrous if made in the ‘70s (“We were at war then”), or jamming to their hearts' content on a picnic blanket overlooking the Thames. 

“It's been really beautiful and moving, I like hanging out with you two guys,” Starr sweetly tells McCartney and Harrison in the anthology's new closing words. Although the 51 minutes that have gone before could never be described as essential, it's a sentiment which most fans will share. 

The restored “The Beatles Anthology,” including a new episode, starts streaming on Disney+ on Wednesday, November 26. Episodes 1-3 of the series will launch on November 26, followed by Episodes 4-6 on November 27, and Episodes 7-9 on November 28.

Welcome to IndieWire's “Eyes Wide Shut” Week. The password is, of course, “fidelio,” but we've already taken care of admittance, inviting you into five days of stories celebrating Stanley Kubrick's swan-song masterpiece from 1999. Criterion Collection has just unveiled its 4K restoration of the classic erotic odyssey starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and it now looks better than ever, gloriously, at home.

Though “Eyes Wide Shut” is very much one of IndieWire's favorite Christmas movies, we'll be unveiling over the Thanksgiving week conversations with director of photography Larry Smith, second unit cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed, editor Nigel Galt, set decorator Lisa Leone, and star and Kubrick mentee Todd Field, aka Nick Nightingale, blindfolded piano player to the sex-crazed elite. “Give up your inquiries, which are completely useless.”

There are few, if any, people more qualified to comment on “Eyes Wide Shut” than Nigel Galt — the man who spent 15 months in a post-production room with Stanley Kubrick before the director's death.

 










The film editor — who is going on record for nearly the first time, circa the new Criterion Collection 4K release of Kubrick's final film — has rarely spoken about his experiences with the director. Kubrick died on March 7, days after he screened his working cut of the 1999 erotic mystery to Warner Bros. brass and the film's stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. By that time, Galt had been close with the Oscar-nominated filmmaker for nearly a decade and was one of his most trusted longtime collaborators. After first working for Kubrick as a sound editor on 1987's “Full Metal Jacket,” he had risen up through the ranks, eventually having a hand in the international re-releases of almost all of the auteur's films. And he was creatively involved on “Eyes Wide Shut” even before shootin, as Kubrick liked his opinion on sound, image, and even music.

Galt was also the person most intimately involved in what happened to the movie between Kubrick's death and its July 1999 theatrical release. He not only oversaw the last-minute fixes, like adding final establishing shots, but also was tasked with navigating censorship of the orgy scene — you know, the one where Cruise's Dr. Bill Harford rides out in a taxi to an ominous mansion that plays hosts to a Boschian bacchanalia of masked, depraved sex.  

 










Despite demands and moral panic from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA, now known as the MPA), Galt refused to make cuts to the film in order to secure an R rating — resolute that Kubrick never would've permitted them. But it was Galt's idea, as he explained to IndieWire, to insert digital figures into the masquerade sequence to block certain instances of penetration and satisfy the censors.

That censored sequence is now widely unavailable to the public, despite ending up in the version that was first released in theaters, when “Eyes Wide Shut” was rated R for “strong sexual content, nudity, language, and some drug-related material.” The new unrated Criterion release, supervised by director of photography Larry Smith, includes no such digital “hooded figures,” as Galt said, finally restoring the film to what Kubrick envisioned in the literal hours before his death. 

This interview has been edited for length.

IndieWire: You spent 15 months with Kubrick in the edit bay after production finished on “Eyes Wide Shut,” but when did you come on the movie proper?

Nigel Galt: I was on [“Eyes Wide Shut”] before shooting. 

I was very fortunate: At the end of “Full Metal Jacket,” we got on very well, Stanley and I. I was a “deemed competent,” [which was] I think, the best compliment I got. He wasn't very generous with compliments but] he did say to me that he'd like to work with me again. I had to wait nine years, or eight years, but he was loyal to his word and phoned me up. I ended up being his go-to man to fix things on the old films. We would fix old foreign versions where optical [negatives] had gotten damaged or there were issues. I got involved in getting a new master of “2001” six-track, supervised it for him, and worked on “Clockwork Orange.” I've actually worked on every film he did in some form or another, so I knew I was going to do [“Eyes Wide Shut”], and I was on it a month before we started shooting.

 










We edited for 15 months. By the time the film finished, I'd been on it over three years. During shooting, I was looking after rushes, the dailies. I was on set most days, being around if he needed me, just doing anything editorial. But we did no editing during shooting. Stanley never cut during shooting.

Walk me through what happened from Kubrick screening the movie for Warners up until his death. 

The film was screened to Terry Semel and Bob Daly at Warner Bros., and Tom and Nicole, on the same night in New York. I flew to New York. In the preceding days, we did the temp mix for the screening. We screened it on Wednesday twice. I flew home. I had Thursday off. I saw him on Friday, and we talked about the response to the film and the screening, which was very positive from everybody. And he died the next night, on Saturday. 

In that last conversation, we just talked about the things that needed to be done, which were a few establishing shots we needed to put in. We had, at that point, just found the Ligeti piano piece, so that was a huge thing, because it's so important in the film. It's actually … a Ligeti piano exercise. When he found that piece of music, he was so excited. When we first put it up against the picture, it worked straight away. Just bizarre.

 










How does the Criterion release, which I know you haven't seen in full yet, compare to past home video versions and the prints that were in theaters in 1999?

Stanley wasn't around to grade the film, so it was reliant on the experience of his contacts with the laboratory, people who'd worked with him at Deluxe on everything, going back to “Barry Lyndon” and “Clockwork Orange.” When it came to the DVD, it was a different matter, because it was effectively a new domain for a medium. The issues with the DVD were more related to the fact that the film was force-developed, all of it, through shooting. So it's effectively underexposing it and then correcting it in the development. The [new Criterion edition] has a lot of profound effects in how things look because it brings out the grain more, and this created a lot of issues in the making of the original DVD.

The DVDs are coming from the original negs. The only difference with this new Criterion one is, I believe, Warners made a new 8K scan from the original neg. That is going to mean that what Larry just did in the regrade will have obvious benefits. Larry graded it on [the Criterion release] the way it should have been graded, which wasn't done before.

After Warner Bros. saw the film, there were still changes to be made, and most significantly in demands to censor the orgy masquerade.
 










The problem with Stanley dying is there was no plan B. Stanley and I had a conversation the night before he died, agreeing on everything that needed to be done to the picture, which was very little, because the only thing that was missing were some establishing shots that, when we were making the screening for New York, we just didn't have time to put them all in. But we knew what they were, so all I had to do was add in exterior shots of buildings, like Ziegler's [house], and that was it. Any idea of re-editing the film was never on the cards, because this is a Stanley Kubrick film. Who has the right to change it?

The only issues that occurred were with the MPAA when we were trying to get the rating. We went off down a path I didn't agree with because they got obsessed about the nudity. They were so mundane and ridiculous about it. They had me make changes, and I had to do them because I was told to. But in the end, I went back to Warner Bros. and, with Jan Harlan in the office, said, “I'm putting the film back exactly as it was, and we have to find another way to release the film if the MPAA won't sanction it.”

What was your reaction to being asked to censor the movie to secure an R rating?

You've probably seen the version that doesn't have the hooded figures in it. You know when he walks through the orgy? He comes around the corner, and there's a guy taking a girl from behind; she's leaning over a chair. Do you know what the MPAA said? “You can't have that. He's fucking her up the ass.” I said, “He's taking her from behind!” [Laughs] This is the kind of ludicrousness.

 










We had five screenings with the MPAA, and every time they kept trying to get us to take more out. And then it became clear that this was not going to happen. Who are they to tell the world what they see in a Stanley Kubrick movie? The premise was, as far as Warners was concerned, they only wanted one release of the film.

So whose idea was it to insert these digital figures that block the onscreen sex?

Who was the one who came up with the idea? Moi. I'm trying to think, “How can we put the film out without changing a single frame of the cut?” 

I suppose in hindsight it was the right thing to do because, in the end, that American hooded version, [with the] cloaked figures, has disappeared. It never gets seen anymore. The worldwide version is the Stanley version. Especially when you take into context the Japanese [audience]… I took the film to Japan for the censorship screening, and the Japanese had a very strong thing about pubic hair. They waived it all because Kubrick to them is Kurosawa, and they don't interfere in that kind of thing.

What would Kubrick's reaction have been if he were alive at the time?

As a hypothetical argument, knowing Stanley, he would have said to Warners, “Well, I'll either have to reshoot, or they have to accept it.” But he wouldn't have made cuts, because Stanley had final cut. Stanley generated this career where he bought himself total independence, total freedom from budgets, and total amount of time to make the film. This was one of the most remarkable things about working with him. The best thing about working with him was you knew he was in charge.

 










What was it like working on “Eyes Wide Shut” with such a small crew?

We had a crew of just 55 people. As much as me being an editor … I could become a driver. That's how it worked. There were no delusions of grandeur if you worked with Stanley. You did what you were told.

How complicated was that orgy scene to film, and were you on the set for any of it?

It went on forever, shooting at Elveden [Hall] and the other place they went to [the sequence shot in at least three locations in the U.K.]. I never went on the set during it. He wouldn't let me on the set with too many pretty women. [Laughs]

They were all-night shoots. I was at the lab at 6 a.m. every morning picking up the rushes. It was quite intense from what I know [but] it wasn't any more stressful or harder than anything else. There was a lot of night shooting and late shooting on the film. Shooting on the set with Stanley was the same whether you went on the set day or night. It was not Jim Cameron-style or anything like that — no shouting or screaming. He might have shouted at the technicians or the construction guys or the riggers, but never in front of the cast.

Well, he may not be screaming at people, but he did drive Shelley Duvall to a nervous breakdown on “The Shining.”
 










Apart from when he [chews out] Shelley Duvall, which is pretty brutal, he was a much more thoughtful person. He could be prone to reacting to things, but that wasn't his real raison d'être when he worked. Everything was very methodical.

What do you make of conspiracy theories about the movie, whether it was designed as a critique of Scientology or, as Roger Avary once claimed, a movie about child trafficking? Or a critique, even of, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's marriage?

He wanted Tom and Nicole because he wanted their relationship onscreen to be real. That's why he wanted a married couple. It's as simplistic as that, and everything else with Stanley, as with all his movies, is the myths and legends that grow up around them. It was the most uneventful film I've been on — other than it took three years.

“Eyes Wide Shut” 4K is now available from Criterion Collection.

Warner Music Group, one of the major labels that sued AI song generator Suno last year for copyright infringement, has signed a licensing deal with the company. The new partnership, which settles their prior litigation, is designed to help Suno move toward a licensed model where users will pay to download songs made on its platform with artificial intelligence. According to the announcement, artists and songwriters will be compensated if they choose to opt in to AI deals, and will retain “full control” over how their music, likeness, and other copyrights are used. Suno has also acquired the concert listings Songkick, formerly owned by Warner, as part of the deal.

In a bid to hold back the AI music flooding streaming services, the current, more liberal Suno models will be phased out, according to the press release. Notably, the press release imagines a future where Suno launches “new, more advanced and licensed models,” but not fully licensed models, which would require mass industry cooperation.

Litigation by Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment, the companies that filed the lawsuit against Suno alongside Warner, is ongoing. That suit accused Suno and a similar company, Udio, of training AI on major-label artists like Drake, Bruce Springsteen, and Green Day, saturating the market “with machine-generated content that will directly compete with, cheapen, and ultimately drown out” the originals. In October, UMG settled its part of the lawsuit against Udio in a deal that limited the scope of the platform. Last week, Klay became the first AI music startup to land licensing deals with all three major labels and their publishing arms.

November 26, 2025

The rise of Tobias Jesso Jr. feels vintage, the stuff of American dreams. Born in Canada, Jesso tried to make it in L.A. in the early 2010s, writing songs for others and playing bass; just when he gave up, a series of buzzy singles, released under his own name, caught the attention of a previously impenetrable industry. He made his 2015 full-length debut, Goon, in a bleary, nostalgic Laurel Canyon mode, brooding over personal hardships and slotting himself into a long lineage of L.A. singer-songwriters. Jesso's chronicles of dashed dreams served as his own last-ditch audition; he immediately became a coveted collaborator, writing for everyone from Harry Styles to FKA twigs and nabbing the inaugural Grammy for Songwriter of the Year in 2023. The fact that he hasn't made a follow-up in the past decade gives retrospective weight to his fairy tale. By sliding from the spotlight, Jesso appeared to claim something unimaginable in the 21st century: a happily-ever-after ending.

That was an illusion, needless to say, because real life is always more complicated. Yet his second outing, Shine, doesn't break the spell—somehow, it makes it more captivating. Once again, Jesso writes from his actual emotions while also reflexively playing the part of bedroom balladeer. Shine sounds like a faded memory of his first record, which had full arrangements but lives in my head as a solo guy-at-the-piano song cycle. Here, the instrumentation is truly spare, besides a batshit percussion build on “I Love You” so surprising that mentioning it feels like spoiling a jump scare in a horror film. These are human-scaled tunes that unfold like rough demos, with a nakedness that drags Jesso's conceptual bent to the fore. Shine presents like a series of mockups, exploded to the proportions of finished products. In their raw intensity, they're better than final drafts.

One can imagine how the many artists Jesso writes for might elaborate on a number like opener “Waiting Around,” which haltingly unspools the details of a troubled romance over twinkling piano. There's space here for a peppier, busier arrangement, but in Jesso's version, we become aware of the gulf between pop's surface and its craft—these hushed, restrained four minutes are a masterclass in calculated delivery and controlled intonation. Jesso's croon sounds contemporary, leaving the '70s affectations behind, as does the cursive way he delivers the couplet “You and I met/At a friend's party,” or his heavy stress on “c” in the line “So ridiculous.”

Jesso's lyrics, which have gotten knottier and more clever since the wistful generalities of his first release, can dip into the allegorical quips of Sabrina Carpenter. “Lovin' you's worse than/Customer service,” he sings on “Black Magic.” “Can you imagine that?” Yet many of his words are as unadorned in their anguish as the backing is sparse. He delves into the end of a relationship with the obsessiveness of someone who isn't over it: “Remember when we drove/Along the coastal line/The ocean wide and clear,” goes one verse on the gorgeous, serpentine “Rain,” only to fast forward to the present tense: He and his lover sit on a bench, staring tearfully at a threatening cloud. Of course Jesso gets meta—“Is it a metaphor for you and I?”

If Goon feared failure, Shine cogitates over futility and stasis, the possibility of being caught in a cycle. “You run like there's dogs abound,” he yelps on “Black Magic”; “I'm chasing my own tail.” Earlier this month, Jesso told the Los Angeles Times how he found himself suddenly unable to be creative as a hired gun, to do the labor of ignoring his own feelings while aiding the visions of others—and so he cleared his schedule and devoted himself to his own music for the first time in a decade. We feel the weight of this moment of reckoning, in his art as much as in his romantic life: “I just don't know myself anymore,” he admits on “Bridges,” “'Cause I do things now that I never did before.”

For a maiden voyage, Goon was a glitzy affair, studded with famous producers. Shine takes a different tack. Sure, Justin Vernon and Danielle Haim show up on a couple of cuts, but as songwriters, not performers. They seem to switch places with Jesso, a self-conscious gesture that speaks to the disc's intentions: A drama without any set decoration, the 29-minute album blurs cast and crew, letting the curtain flutter open to reveal the backstage. It wouldn't work if the songs themselves weren't so powerful—quaking, earnest, and awash in apparently unfussy ambience. This may be Jesso's unplugged album, but close listens reveal that his refurbished Steinway isn't so unadorned. There's the shudder of an open hi-hat in the background of “Waiting Around” and “Green Eyes” that gives each track a faint backbone, while “Black Magic” has flashes of a muted electronic phrase that follows the main melody—same with “Rain.”

Ultimately, Jesso scrawls all over his own artwork, summoning the bruising final phase of alt-rockers Low more than any gentle predecessors. A high-decibel drum part, performed by his friend Kane Ritchotte, pummels the sentimental chords and vocal fry of centerpiece “I Love You.” Its entrance is tentative, yet so loud and blown out it feels overwhelming, particularly arriving this deep into such a subdued album, and soon the drums consume the track. Such a peak feels at once like a romantic scar and a recognition of the studio's power, demonstrating how a simple rhythm can swallow these woebegone, angsty songs whole. We're aware of the vulnerability of the songwriter and the brute force of the accompaniment—both aspects are emphasized in their stark juxtaposition.

Closer “Lullabye” reduces the boil of “I Love You” to a light simmer of cymbals. “Don't you know you have to break apart/To really Shine?” Jesso coos. He may be moving on, but the point is what brought him there: his life and his songwriting practice smashing into shards. That he lets us see the pieces, instead of filling in the cracks, makes this portrait feel bracing and true.

If there's one constant for the UK's Wisdom Teeth label, it's evolution. Perhaps that's fitting, given that its name implies growth and maturation. Since it was founded, just a little over a decade ago, Wisdom Teeth has traversed a gamut of styles, moving as steadily as the progress bar crawling across the waveform of a DJ mix. Early experiments in dubstep gave way to unorthodox bass music and leftfield techno; successive compilations have been dedicated to narrowly bounded experiments in the wiggly terrain around 100 BPM or the quick-stepping possibilities of the 150-170 zone.

Wisdom Teeth cofounder K-LONE, on the other hand, is a model of consistency. On both his albums so far, 2020's Cape Cira and 2023's Swells, the producer (aka Josiah Gladwell) has chipped away at a modest set of sounds with the dedication of a sculptor hunched over a milky block of marble. He likes his synths luminous and his drums razor sharp. His harmonic elements, though electronic, tend to have a suggestively physical heft, reminiscent of struck mallets and wheezing organs. His percussion, on the other hand, is unusually unassuming, at least compared to most contemporary dance music, implying not so much the force of drumsticks as the light glancing off a burnished hi-hat.

His new album sorry i thought you were someone else is of a piece with his previous two LPs—supersaturated with color and driven by finely honed drums. But even without making any major stylistic leaps from his previous work, it's the most satisfying record of his career so far. His textures are softer and more enveloping than ever, and his emotional range has expanded beyond his previous albums' demure glow.

The record's lushness might at first seem surprising, given that Wisdom Teeth's most recent compilation was dedicated to minimal techno, and K-LONE has been talking up his love of minimal in interviews. (It's worth noting that the album appears on New York's Incienso, whose co-founder, Anthony Naples, recently offered his own contribution to the minimal revival.) But peer beneath those billowing pads and the deceptively streamlined nature of K-LONE's album becomes clear. Tracks are built on the barest boom-ticking drum patterns; basslines operate by dint of suggestion, sketching out a few sternum-tapping notes before plunging back below the limit of audibility. But every element is carefully polished and set in ways that mask the subdued movements of his jewel-toned clockworks.

In both tone and tempo, the album itself is remarkably consistent from start to finish. Its materials sound drawn from a relatively small set of machines and patches: sparkling chimes and bright chords, swollen sub-bass, snatches of spoken-word vocals that flit like ghosts across the edges of the stereo field. His drums are more refined than ever. Often they take the form of bursts of hissing static or sculpted white noise—echoes of classic minimal producers like Matthew Herbert, but set to aquamarine chords more reminiscent of Pépé Bradock. He uses effects sparingly but effectively, occasionally twisting the knob on his dub delay to send a sound ricocheting across the margins of the music, hinting at maze-like expanses just out of earshot.

The album is so consistent, in fact, that you suspect Gladwell could easily recombine many of the record's elements—blending the scratchy drum groove of “slk” with the dub-techno chords “sslip,” say, or the exhilarating pulses of “fauna” with the crisp, loping toms of “the haze”—and the results might not have been all that different. That's not to say that the results are samey; far from it. On every track, he's whittled everything down to a tightly focused idea. “slide by side” is a masterpiece of pointillism, every sound—nubby bass, blippy woodblocks, a topline that drips like beads of honey—as casually yet carefully arranged as the stones of a Zen garden. In the zig-zagging “sslip,” monochromatic chords flash back to the heyday of the Force Trax label while a tinny vocal sample injects some of the insouciance of Chicago ghetto house.

Sometimes the hook grabs you immediately: That's the case with opener “someone else,” the album's obvious highlight, built around a downcast vocal sample and chords that burble like a water foundation. Sometimes there's barely any hook at all: “gurgle” is built atop a rubbery bassline that just toggles between two notes. But beneath the surface, there's always more than meets the ears: “Gurgle” is a palimpsest of dubby pads, filigreed details, and murmuring voices, while “someone else” is so masterfully mixed that every sound bobs in the mix like marshmallows in Jell-O. Some tracks are so exacting in their use of empty space that they feel almost like photographic negatives.

sorry i thought you were someone else strikes an unusual affective note: It's quick-stepping yet subdued, with tempos keyed to amped-up dancefloors and moody tones more suited to watching the sunrise from your apartment window. Perhaps that ambivalence stems from the circumstances of its creation, written in the aftermath of Gladwell's father's death. Yet K-LONE's album is never maudlin. If anything, it's shot through with a palpable sense of hope, and an abidingly clear-headed spirit. Some dance music shouts at you; K-LONE's invites you to get cozy with your feelings.

David Letterman threw his support behind Seth Meyers after the Late Night host became the latest talk show target of President Donald Trump. 


	After Trump called on NBC to fire Meyers, Letterman appeared on “The Barbra Gaines Show” (Gaines was Letterman's longtime producer on The Late Show) and said, “I've never been more proud of Seth Meyers,”. An incredulous Letterman then recalled his reaction to Trump's demand, quipping, “I thought, ‘This is just delightful. How do you think that's going to go?'” 


	Letterman went on to note that Late Night used to be his “old show” before his move to CBS: “We used to do that show, and [Meyers] does a magical job. But just remember, Seth, things happen. You know what I'm saying?”


	While Trump has lashed out at Meyers before, earlier this month, the president called on NBC to fire him in a post on Truth Social. Trump accused Meyers of “suffering from an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” and insisted the comedian had “no talent.” Trump's post was notably shared by his FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, whose previous threats against ABC helped lead to Jimmy Kimmel's temporary suspension in September.

	Trump's post about Meyers appears to have had little impact. Meyers brushed off the jabs on his show, joking, “I'm also aware that being attacked by the president this weekend doesn't make me special in any way, shape or form. I was simply on the same shit list as Christopher Wray, James Comey, Indiana Republicans, Thomas Massie, Rand Paul, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and former President Joe Biden.”

	











	He added, “I want to clarify that I take no issue with the president voicing his displeasure with my show. That is his right, and on a lot of nights, he's got a point.”

	As for Letterman, he's been a frequent critic of Trump (later on “The Barbra Gaines Show,” he called the administration a “wonder of idiocy” and referred to the president as “our dictator”), especially as the president has focused his ire on Letterman's late-night successors. During the Kimmel debacle, Letterman said, “You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office. That's just not how this works.”


	And after CBS canceled his old show, The Late Show (now hosted by Stephen Colbert), Letterman slammed the network as “gutless” and “pure cowardice.” While CBS has insisted the decision to axe the show was financial, many have speculated it was done under pressure from the Trump admin due to a then-pending merger between CBS' parent company Paramount and Skydance.

	After much wishful thinking, Radiohead performed “Like Spinning Plates” during their last show today at the O2 in London. The band closed out its four-show run in the city, surprising lucky fans to the Amnesiac track and giving the song its debut on Radiohead's reunion tour.


	“Like Spinning Plates” was built over the backing track of an early recording of “I Will” (which later appeared on 2003's Hail to the Thief), run in reverse. “We'd turned the tape around, and I was in another room, heard the vocal melody coming backwards, and thought, ‘That's miles better than the right way round,' then spent the rest of the night trying to learn the melody,” Thom Yorke told The Wire in a 2001 interview, per Citizen Insane.


	Fans have responded accordingly to today's performance, with one attendee on X declaring, “wtf do you mean i just heard like spinning plates live??????”

	Earlier this month, Radiohead performed both “Kid A” and “Talk Show Host” for the first time since 2018 at the Unipol Arena in Bologna, Italy. The band previously broke out Amnesiac songs tracks “You and Whose Army” and “Pyramid Song” during its current trek.

	











	After months of speculation, Radiohead announced their reunion back in September — their first live performances together since 2018. The European run kicked off with four nights in Madrid, followed by four evenings each in Bologna and London, with Copenhagen and Berlin in December.

It also made us want to play some shows together, so we hope you can make it to one of the upcoming dates. For now, it will just be these ones but who knows where this will all lead.”

Taylor Swift‘s “The Fate of Ophelia” has been given the club treatment, thanks to a remix by the Chainsmokers. 


	Today, Swift's official fan account, Taylor Nation, announced on Instagram that the “The Fate of Ophelia (The Chainsmokers Remix)” is now ready to download on iTunes and Amazon Music. Quoting the song's lyrics, the account quipped that the reimagined version is “wrapping around us like a chain, a crown, a vine.”


	The DJ duo celebrated the drop in the comments, writing, “This is truly and honor. we love u T.”


	The original “The Fate of Ophelia” is featured as the lead track off Swift's 12th studio album, The Life of a Showgirl, and has spent seven weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. The video for the Shakespeare-inspired song premiered last month in The Official Release Party of a Showgirl, Swift's film that screened in theaters from Oct. 3-5.


	The Swift-directed and written video begins with the pop star as the tragic heroine Ophelia from Hamlet in a painting on the wall of an ornate and lonely hotel, before it's revealed that it's a set. As Swift embodies a variety of showgirls from different eras, she's backed by dancers and the band from her Eras Tour. The glamorous spectacle ends back in a hotel room, where Swift stars as herself in a bathtub, echoing the album's cover art.

	In Rolling Stone‘s review of The Life of a Showgirl praising the album, writer Maya Georgi observes that from “the first Fleetwood Mac-inspired drumroll and melancholy keys of ‘The Fate of Ophelia,' it's clear Swift has stepped into uncharted territory.”

A photogenic lenticular cloud was spotted hovering over the Presidential Range of the White Mountains early Tuesday morning.

Several photos of this vivid lenticular cloud, along with a stunning timelapse video, were uploaded to the u local New Hampshire page on Facebook.

Lenticular clouds are often seen as having a unique disc shape, often compared to a UFO or a stack of pancakes. They are commonly found over and near the higher terrain of the White Mountains due to a unique wind pattern.

As air flows toward a mountain, it is forced up the mountain's slope. If the air has enough moisture in it, it will condense and form a cloud.

When the atmosphere is stable above the mountains, the air resists the ascent from the terrain and tends to form a wave pattern.

This pattern of rising and falling motion, when remaining in place, creates smooth, circular edges to the clouds.

Was an alien space craft hovering over New England this week? Some observers may have thought so.

On Tuesday, a huge funnel-like cloud was spotted above Mount Washington in New Hampshire. The fluffy formation looked like a tube ready to vacuum New England's highest peak up into the clouds.

Though the massive mountain stayed right where it was, that cloud formation didn't stick around for too long.

Luckily, the jaw-dropping moment was captured in photos and shared by the Mount Washington Observatory.

Appearing somewhat like a spaceship dropping out of the sky, the formation is actually  a lenticular cloud.

Though I certainly remember learning about cumulus and nimbus clouds back in school science class, the lenticular cloud probably never came up.

Perhaps that's because these clouds pretty much only form over mountains and need very specific conditions to stick around.

Lenticular clouds form as moist air is pushed up over a mountain, then cools into a cloud as it hits cooler air higher up. The air then cools again as it's pushed over the cloud peak, leaving a stacked tube-like shape that often appears to be sitting still in the sky.

Air around a lenticular cloud is actually pretty turbulent, helping to create the circular stacks of clouds that resemble UFOs. They're also good indicators of air patches that could be dangerous to aircraft.

So not only did this particular cloud over Mount Washington give us all an amazing site to see, it also gave local pilots a heads up about flying over the 6,288 foot peak.

For decades, America's intelligence agencies have treated the public like background noise, a nuisance to be managed, not a nation to be informed. But the twin scandals now colliding in the Epstein cover-up and the UAP/UFO secrecy regime are exposing something far more corrosive than bureaucratic incompetence. They reveal a government culture that has grown accustomed to lying, concealment, and contempt for the very people it serves. And after the latest disclosures, hearings, whistle-blower accounts, and forced transparency laws, it's impossible to pretend this is about “national security.” What's unfolding is a betrayal of democracy on a constitutional scale.

“There comes a point where secrecy is no longer protection — it's sabotage.”

That's where we are now. The Pentagon, CIA, and FBI have crossed that line so many times it's practically policy. They buried the truth about a global sex trafficking network connected to Jeffrey Epstein. They buried evidence and testimony about unidentified aerial phenomena that could reshape science itself. They buried intelligence from presidents and Congress. They buried trust. And they expect the public to just swallow it all, quietly, forever.

This country didn't become the world's powerhouse through fear and gatekeeping. We became the world's leader because we trust our people more than we trust our paranoia. But that philosophy stopped at the doors of the intelligence community and the damage that wall of secrecy has done is becoming impossible to ignore.

The government would have you believe that Jeffrey Epstein was a lone monster with a private island, a private plane, and no co-conspirators. A convenient narrative, considering the sheer number of powerful people who orbited his operation for years. After everything we now know about the scope, scale, and structure of Epstein's criminal network, the idea that he acted alone isn't just absurd — it's insulting.

Federal agencies had warnings for decades. They had thousands of victims. They had corroborating evidence. They had intelligence reports. They had flight logs and financial records showing Epstein moving between global power centers like he was running an intelligence operation. And still, the FBI let him walk free for years. When he was finally prosecuted the first time, they negotiated a secret non-prosecution deal so grotesque it read like a ransom note written by privilege itself.

Only now, under overwhelming public pressure, has the government been forced to release the Epstein files. Congress had to pass a law compelling the DOJ to hand over documents the FBI should have made public a decade ago. And even now, officials are already hinting that “ongoing investigations” may justify redactions. Americans have heard that excuse before. It's code for “protecting powerful people.”

What makes this cover-up even darker is the geopolitical angle nobody in the intelligence community wants to talk about. Epstein's closest partners, business ties, and funding channels raise questions that intersect with foreign intelligence, questions federal agencies have every incentive to keep buried. If they're shielding a foreign ally's involvement in an international trafficking operation, that's not national security. That's corruption.

“When the system protects predators instead of victims, it's no longer a justice system, it's a cartel.”

Then there's the other scandal, the one that has nothing to do with billionaires on private jets and everything to do with the nature of existence itself.

UAPs used to be a punchline. Now they're a policy crisis, a national security gridlock, and a scientific black hole all because the Pentagon and intelligence agencies buried evidence for generations. For years, pilots, engineers, scientists, and military officers reported craft doing things that break known physics: zero propulsion signatures, instant acceleration, sudden directional changes, transmedium capabilities. And what did the Pentagon do? Ridicule, deny, mock, classify. Anything except confront the truth.

The Age of Disclosure documentary didn't drop out of nowhere. It's the product of decades of whistle-blower frustration, men and women inside the system who saw extraordinary materials, extraordinary craft, and extraordinary evidence locked away in private vaults owned by defense contractors and shielded from elected oversight. These weren't conspiracy theorists. These were program leads, scientists, pilots, colonels, analysts. People who held clearances far above what the President of the United States gets.

Now, whistle-blowers say entire divisions of government ran retrieval programs without briefing presidents, Congress, or inspectors general. That is not national security. That is a shadow state. And hiding technological breakthroughs from the scientific community isn't protection, it's the sabotage of human progress.

“You don't beat China by hiding physics from your own scientists.”

Every time the government classifies discovery instead of sharing it with the scientific world, it hobbles innovation. It slows engineering. It hands adversaries a head start. Secrecy doesn't make America stronger. Transparency does. It always has. And the agencies who claim otherwise are lying to cover their own failures and wishes.

If the Pentagon or CIA truly kept UAP programs off presidential briefings, that is a constitutional crisis. Civilian oversight is the bedrock of the American military system. If intelligence officers think they can decide what the Commander-in-Chief is allowed to know, then they're not public servants, they're self anointed kings.

And if Congress has been systematically misled about Epstein connections, UAP recoveries, black-budget programs, or the private-sector handling of recovered materials? Then we are no longer living in a functioning democratic republic. We are living under a self-appointed clerical class, a priesthood of secrets accountable to nobody.

These agencies have forgotten who their employer is. It's not Lockheed Martin. It's not a classified chain of command. It's the American people. Their salaries, their weapons, their programs, their jets, their satellites — all of it exists because taxpayers fund it.

Yet the agencies behave like transparency is an inconvenience, oversight is an insult, and democracy is optional.

We are now at the breaking point. A nation cannot lead the world when its own government refuses to tell the truth about crimes committed by the powerful… or the technological breakthroughs that could redefine civilization. The United States cannot claim moral leadership while sheltering predators, lying to Congress, and gatekeeping science that could reshape energy, transportation, defense, and medicine.

This level of secrecy is not protection. It is paralysis. And it is destroying trust at a rate the government cannot repair.

The Epstein scandal exposes the government's moral rot. The UAP scandal exposes its structural rot. Combined, they expose institutional decay that no democracy can survive without major surgery.

This is where the conversation has to go next: legislation, not outrage. Complete classification reform. Independent science review boards. Civilian oversight with subpoena power. Criminal penalties for withholding information from Congress. Declassification deadlines that can't be gamed or delayed. And full public disclosure of Epstein's network — every name, every flight, every deal, every accomplice.

The Pentagon, CIA, and FBI don't need more power. They need limits, hard limits, written into law. Because the American people aren't children. And they aren't idiots. They are the owners of this country. And it's long past time the agencies remember that.

The first part exposed the rot. Now we get into the remedy, the part Washington fears the most. Because once you understand the scope of deception behind the Epstein cover-up and the UAP blackout, it becomes obvious the problem isn't a single agency or director. It's a system. A culture. A cartel of secrecy embedded so deeply into the Pentagon, CIA, FBI, and their contractor ecosystem that it now operates independently of elected authority.

This isn't an “intelligence community.” It's an unelected power bloc. And if America wants to remain a functioning democracy capable of leading the world, that bloc must be broken by law, by force of oversight, and by a public that finally sees through the myth that secrecy is strength. It isn't. Secrecy is the cancer.

“A government that hides truth from its own people is not guarding the nation — it's guarding itself.”

The era of blind deference must end. This blueprint lays out how.

The U.S. classification regime was designed for wartime secrets like troop movements, operational plans, cryptography, the stuff that could get Americans killed if leaked. But over the past 60 years, that system metastasized into a catch-all cloak for bureaucratic embarrassment, agency mistakes, political damage, technological breakthroughs, and, in the Epstein case, evidence implicating the powerful. The number of classified documents has exploded into the tens of millions. Information stays classified not because it protects the nation, but because it protects institutions.

And nowhere is that clearer than in the two scandals now defining our era:

• The Epstein network: where agencies hid evidence rather than expose who enabled it.• The UAP programs: where agencies hid discoveries that could change physics rather than risk accountability.

Both cover-ups relied on the same tactic: bury it, classify it, deny everything.

The solution begins with tearing down the broken classification wall.

Every successful reform movement in U.S. history started by changing the rules of power. Today's rules allow intelligence agencies to unilaterally decide what the public is allowed to know, with no timeline, no accountability, and no external review. That ends now.

• Ban classification to avoid embarrassment or political damage.If it protects institutions instead of the nation, it cannot be classified. Period.

• Force automatic declassification deadlines.No document should outlive its relevance by 40 years simply because some bureaucrat enjoyed the power of hiding it.

• Require civilian oversight boards with subpoena power.Not dependent on appointments from the very agencies they're meant to police.

• Criminalize deliberate misclassification.If you hide evidence of crimes or hide breakthroughs from elected leaders, you go to prison.

• Give Congress real-time access to any program, no exceptions.If a senator can't get briefed on a program funded by taxpayers, that program is unconstitutional by definition.

This is how you dismantle a secrecy cartel, by removing the legal shield it hides behind.

Whistle-blower testimony in the UAP arena revealed something that should terrify every American: retrieval programs and materials allegedly hidden from multiple presidents. Think about what that means. Unelected government employees decided the Commander-in-Chief wasn't “ready” or “qualified” to know certain information. At that point, the presidency becomes symbolic, not sovereign. If any program is deemed too “sensitive” to brief the president, that program should be shut down immediately and its leadership removed. Anything else is a coup in slow motion.

“If contractors and mid-level officials decide what the president can know, we don't have a democracy — we have a managed illusion of one.”

Restoring constitutional supremacy: the elected branch must control the unelected one, not the other way around.

The deeper you go into the UAP story, the more obvious it becomes that private contractors have become the vault keepers of America's biggest secrets. They store materials. They run labs. They control access. They decide what gets logged, what gets buried, and what gets lost. That's not accountability, that's privatized secrecy. Defense firms are essential for national security, but they cannot be the custodians of the most sensitive knowledge ever recovered. If non-human technology exists, no corporation should own the file cabinets.

Congress must pass laws requiring that all recovered materials, analysis, and historical archives be transferred to:

• A federal scientific review board• Independent physicists• Publicly accountable agencies

Contractors must be vendors, not gatekeepers. America cannot let corporations privatize the universe.

The Epstein scandal is the moral litmus test of this era. If America cannot tell the truth about who enabled, funded, protected, and participated in an international trafficking operation, then the rule of law has collapsed.

The DOJ must release everything. Names. Logs. Testimony. Communications. Deals. And it must do so without hiding behind “ongoing investigations” or “foreign intelligence relationships.” If a foreign ally was involved, the American people deserve to know. If billionaires were involved, the American people deserve to know. If intelligence agencies used Epstein for operations, the American people deserve to know.

This nation cannot move forward with a justice system that protects predators and punishes the truth.

One of the most urgent reforms America needs is also the simplest: when the government encounters a craft, material, or biological sample of unknown origin, the public deserves a documented, accountable process, not silence, not rumors, and certainly not a handoff to defense contractors who operate outside democratic oversight. A modern republic cannot function when its most consequential discoveries are locked behind doors never opened to Congress or independent scientists.

Under a reformed system, discoveries of unknown origin would trigger immediate, mandatory notification to both branches of civilian oversight, elected lawmakers and an independent scientific review board. This is not sci-fi theater. It is basic governance. The era of secret vaults and buried evidence must end. A democracy cannot afford to let a small circle of insiders decide what humanity is allowed to know about the universe.

The truth is simple: secrecy has cost the United States decades of scientific progress. We have likely lost time on propulsion breakthroughs, advanced materials, energy systems, and technologies that could reshape the entire global balance. The idea that locking this knowledge away somehow “protects” the public is not just wrong — it is dangerous. You do not win the future by handcuffing your own researchers. You win it by unleashing them.

For all the drama of UFO secrecy and the political fallout of the Epstein files, the deeper problem is cultural rot inside the intelligence bureaucracy. In today's system, when officials lie to Congress, withhold documents, destroy evidence, or bury programs, the consequences are laughably small. Maybe they're reassigned. Maybe they retire early. Usually, nothing at all happens.

That culture must be torn out by the roots.

Real reform requires criminal accountability, not symbolic reprimands or internal memos. Intelligence obstruction should carry mandatory prison time, not comfortable pension packages. Any official who lies to Congress, manipulates classification to hide wrongdoing, or blocks lawful oversight must face real penalties. Not theoretical penalties. Actual consequences.

And the contractor class cannot be immune, either. If a private company conceals evidence, alters records, or interferes with a congressional inquiry, they should face the same penalties federal employees do. The oversight system must treat contractors not as privileged partners but as extensions of government authority and therefore subject to the same scrutiny.

An intelligence bureaucracy that fears no punishment is a bureaucracy that fears nothing at all. That's how democracies collapse.

Everything comes down to a simple principle that Washington lost somewhere along the way: the truth belongs to the American people. Not the Pentagon. Not the CIA. Not the FBI. Not the contractors holding half the UAP archives in private vaults. And definitely not the bureaucrats who've built careers on deciding what the public is “ready” to know.

Transparency is not a favor the government grants when it feels generous. It is the operating system of a free nation. Without it, the country becomes an empty ritual, elections without accountability, laws without enforcement, and institutions without legitimacy.

Reform begins by reclaiming that foundation. It requires laws that force disclosure, systems that mandate oversight, and a cultural shift inside the intelligence world that makes truth the rule rather than the enemy. It means scientific transparency where secrecy once lived. It means presidents receiving full briefings without interference. It means Congress having real authority again, not ceremonial access.

Most importantly, it means returning ownership of information to the public.

This is how America leads again, not by hiding reality but by confronting it openly, boldly, and with the confidence that built the nation in the first place. A country that trusts its people will always out-innovate, out-perform, and out-imagine every adversary on Earth. And it will do so without the cancer of secrecy eating away at its core.

Paranormal disturbances? Honestly, it's not for everyone.

Nebraska is known as a simple place, beloved for its corn, college football, and pioneer history. But the Cornhusker State has a secret dark side—so long as you know where to look.

Unexpected tragedies and acts of horrific violence from long ago have left their mark on this beautiful land. And the spirits born from it aren't keen on leaving any time soon.

From a theater that sees its fair share of otherworldly performances to a bridge brimming with the remnants of despair, here are five of the most haunted placed in Nebraska!

Here Are the 50 Most Haunted Places in the United States

Road L may be this eerie locale's official name, but every local knows it better as Seven Sisters Road. The title comes from a tragic tale of, you guessed it, seven doomed sisters.

The legend dates back to the 19th century, following a man who had an argument with his—you guessed it—seven sisters. This argument culminated with the man taking the sisters one by one and hanging them each from a tree on different hills along the road.

Today, this stretch of road is known as one of the most haunted place in the state. Those passing through have experienced a number of chilling paranormal experiences.

Some report hearing the echoing, blood-curdling screams of women on dark nights. Others say their car inexplicably stalls or their battery has been completely drained.

8 Most Haunted Highways and Byways in the United States

Just outside of McCook to the north, a site known as Devil's Canyon sits at the end of a dirt road. Rumor has it that, more than a century ago, a man slaughtered his wife and children here before taking his own life.

Visitors to Devil's Canyon believe the spirit of this man has not left. There have been numerous reports of a male apparition—nicknamed “the Duke”—prowling the alleged location of these horrific murders and playing tricks on those who pass through.

Travelers also claim that cars and other technology brought to the area have experience inexplicable malfunctions.

6 Obscure Haunted Locations That Will Creep You Out

Built in 1903, the Alliance Theatre was actually first known as the Charter Hotel. It wasn't converted into a theater until 35 years later in 1938, first offering live stage performances before pivoting to movies.

It's unclear exactly when the paranormal activity here began, but there have been supernatural disturbances for as long as anyone can remember.

Theater employees claim they frequently spot shadowy figures around the property, accompanied by phantom footsteps treading through the hall.

It's rumored that one of the ghosts haunting the theater is that of an actress who died while portraying a bride in a live show. It's said that a light fixture fell from the ceiling before she stepped out on stage and crushed her before a horrified audience.

She allegedly still walks through the rows of seats, and the staff blames her for moving furniture and doors opening and closing on their own. Some even say they've spotted the apparition of a weeping bride, and even her practicing lines.

The owner of this theater has embraced that his business is haunted, but insists that any ghosts present are the friendly sort.

9 Most Haunted Movie Theaters in America

Located on the edges of Grand Island, this bridge stands as the object of an eerie legend.

It's said that, long ago, a woman once lived in a house that sat at the end of this bridge. She and her neighbors were accused of witchcraft and devil worship, and subsequently burned at the stake by the townspeople.

As such, this bridge has come to be known as “Witch's Bridge,” carrying stories of an angry spirit that still lingers behind. Some even think that the bridge is cursed.

In later years—during a time when the railroad maintained the bridge that ran adjacent to the current structure—a freak accident occurred one winter.

As the railroad workers were trying to dislodge an ice jam that had built up on the rail bridge, a group of local residents came out to watch the dynamite explosions. One of the blasts rattled the onlookers' bridge so violently that a woman stumbled and dropped her baby into the freezing waters below.

For days, both workers and locals searched for the infant, but the child was never found. It's said that the mother never stopped looking.

Today, visitors of the bridge may find that their car will shut off if they drive through.

Others say that you can hear the sounds of the distraught mother sobbing over the loss of her baby.

And, if you are brave enough to visit the bridge at night, you may encounter the ghost of the witch, who will try to pull you into the river if you stare into the water for too long.

7 Terrifying Female Ghosts Who Haunt with Anger and Tragedy

Some people are already creeped out at the thought of visiting a cemetery. But things are even eerier at Ball Cemetery, where spirits walk amongst the graves.

The oldest headstone here dates back to 1869. With such a long history of laying the dead to rest, it's no surprise there have been reports of multiple apparitions.

One apparition is described as a tall man with a foul temper. He is seen walking around the cemetery kicking over gravestones, and some even say he attacks visitors who come to the cemetery at night.

Another is that of the jovial Mary Mumford. She likes to tug on visitors' clothing, and she can be heard laughing uncontrollably.

Photographs taken her are known to be subject to odd anomalies.

Is 3I/ATLAS a technological artifact long forgotten by one of our cosmic neighbors? Or is it a spy probe hurled at Jupiter, the largest and probably the most visible planet from the backyard of another world, hopefully benevolent? Or is it just a playful icy rock trynna tease us with its un-comet like property, while being one, just a distant cousin with tantrums?

From its epileptic path to chemical composition with abundance of nickel, and alleged non-gravitational acceleration, there are 13 anomalies with six major ones, highlighted by Harvard astrophysicist Avi Loeb. The researcher in his latest blog made an extraterrestrial wager while reacting to Dr. Michael Shermer on the latter's $1000 bet, where he quipped

More recently, proponents of UAPs as alien spacecraft have appeared before the U.S. Congress, confidently claiming that they know people who have seen and even touched aliens and/or their spaceships, back-engineered their technologies, and even communicated with the aliens. 

Yet when pushed for evidence, they always demur, saying that it's “classified” or “top-secret,” that Men-in-Black threatened them into silence, that their careers and even their lives are at stake if they disclose said evidence, that they could only reveal the evidence in a “SCIF” (Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility) but not in Congress, and that many people in the U.S. government, CIA, FBI, NSA, etc. (never named) have this information and evidence of alien visitation.

Avi Loeb wrote,

The search for technological artifacts has just started in earnest in 2025 with the discovery of the anomalous interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, the launch of the Rubin Observatory and the construction of three Galileo Project Observatories. Given that there are billions of Earth-Sun analogs in the Milky Way galaxy—most of which are billions of years older than the solar system—and that it will take less than a billion years for our Voyager spacecraft to cross the Milky Way disk, we must engage in the scientific search for extraterrestrial technological artifacts.

He further suggests that the seeker community at large must keep their eyes, hearts, and minds open.

It is better to be an optimist because life is sometimes a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is why I am engaged in the search with the hope that we will find a partner on our blind date with interstellar objects.

    Meet up with the Winchester boys, Crowley and Lucifer at a new streaming spot.
  

Supernatural, the hit monster-hunting show that ran on the WB and later on the CW for 15 seasons, has been a reliable Netflix mainstay for over a decade. The show has been streaming on Netflix since 2012, with new seasons dropping on the platform shortly after they aired on The CW. When the series ended its run on network TV back in 2020, Netflix's licensing agreement gave it the rights to host all 15 seasons for a period of five years from the date of the show's final season. 

Welp, those five years are up, and now the show is about to disappear from the site. You know how sometimes you take things for granted without even realizing it? Supernatural on Netflix is one of those instances when you don't truly appreciate what you have until it's taken away. 

So when, exactly, is Supernatural leaving Netflix, and where is it going?

Supernatural, which stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Dean and Sam Winchester, siblings who are paranormal investigators and demon hunters, is being taken off Netflix on Dec. 17. Luckily, it won't be off streaming for long: It's been confirmed that all 15 seasons will drop on Peacock just five days later, on Dec. 22. 

If you don't subscribe to Peacock, or just want to own the series outright so you don't have to worry about it jumping around from platform to platform, the show is also available to buy on Prime Video for $0.48 an episode or $8 a season, and on Apple TV and FandangoNow (prices there range from $10 to $25 a season). In the meantime, you can certainly try to watch all 327 episodes before they leave Netflix, but that will require you to watch about 11 per day every day (factoring in time for sleep and a few hours of work, if you can muster the strength). 

Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.

Oh, how the times have changed. Not too long ago, if you claimed you believed in aliens, people would have thought you were crazy. Now, not only are people believing in them, but there are support groups for people who have endured alien encounters. Not only are you no longer seen as crazy by the masses, but it almost appears as if it has never been cooler to have had contact with an other worldly life force. Now, one woman is offering a ""safe space' for people to discuss their alien encounters.

What started off as a small in-person meeting at her public library has now spread across the globe. The NY Post shares that Catherine Chapey now considers these meetings the highlight of her week. Rather than meeting with just a few people at the library,"" she now has a mailing list of thousands — some beaming in from as far as Japan and New Zealand."" The former electrician is now an ordained ""interspiritual minister"", according to the Post, after having an otherworldly encounter herself. After sharing her experience, she found others who also had unique experiences with the extraterrestrial.

People in her weekly groups can have a ""safe space to recount their abductions, telepathic visions from beyond, and other celestial come-to-Jesus moments."" While they may not be readily believed outside of this group, within the confines of the Zoom meeting, all alien encounters are listened to with respect.

The current hot-button topic in the group is the 3I/Atlas, ""the interstellar object that's streaking through our atmosphere."" This interstellar object has caused a lot of speculation, leading many people to argue that it could be connected to the estraterretrial. Luckily for all the believers out there, this alien encounter group provides them with the space to discuss it openly and without judgment. Each person in the group claims to have had some sort of contact with aliens. One man claims to have been working with them since he was 14 years old. Another woman claimed she is an ""ET-human hybrid."" Additionally, a woman shared how she enjoys the group because it allows her to open up about this topic. When she broached the topic with friends and family, they thought she was insane.

While it is definitely unorthodox, it would appear that this alien therapy group is truly helping people.

A reporter's perspective on conspiracy theories with Gabriel Gatehouse, journalist and creator of ‘The Coming Storm' podcast. Gabriel Gatehouse has spent many years investigating conspiracy theories, particularly in the United States. In this lecture he argues that conspiracy theories contain valuable information about the society that produces them. Rather than waste energy on debunking programmes, we should examine such tales with a critical eye and ask: what truth do they illuminate?

After the lecture, Gabriel Gatehouse will be in conversation with Professor of Sociology and fellow journalist Prof Gary Younge.

This public event is part of the workshop ‘Behind the Scenes: (Mis)trust, plausibility and scepticism in contemporary life' held at the University of Manchester, 3-4 December 2025. The workshop is convened by Dr Peter Lockwood and Dr Constance Smith (both Social Anthropology) and is supported by the Hallsworth Conference Fund.

About the Speakers

Gabriel Gatehouse is a journalist and documentary maker. The former International Editor of BBC Newsnight, he has reported from almost every recent conflict around the world, from Ukraine to Syria, Libya to Iraq. The Coming Storm, his investigation into conspiracy culture in America, went unexpectedly viral – the podcast won awards, and the book was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize. This success has driven him deeper into the rabbit hole. He is currently making a TV documentary about UFOs.

Gary Younge is an award-winning author, broadcaster and a Professor of Sociology at The University of Manchester. Formerly a columnist at The Guardian, he is also an editorial board member of The Nation magazine and winner of both the 2025 Robert. B. Silvers prize for journalism and the 2023 Orwell Prize for Journalism. He has written six books, most recently, Dispatches From the Diaspora, From Nelson Mandela to Black Lives Matter.

When Marjorie Taylor Greene, the flame-throwing conservative congresswoman, posted her resignation online on Friday, it upended Washington, blindsided Republicans, and shocked reporters.

All except for one White House correspondent.

Brian Glenn, her “significant other” of three years, was by her side in her Georgia living room while she recorded her 10-minute and 42-second address to the nation.

But even with the video completed, Ms Greene waited until the very last moment to decide whether she would set it live and in turn, throw a grenade into Donald Trump's Maga movement.

“We made the video, and we sat back and we said, ‘you know, are you sure this is what you want to do?' And we both agreed that this is the right decision,” said Glenn, White House correspondent for the Trump-aligned Real America's Voice television station.

The resignation announcement capped an extraordinary seven days of turmoil.

On Nov 14, the president turned on his one-time ally over her insistence that his government publish the Epstein files in full.

He said he would support any Republican who ran against her in the 2026 midterm elections. And in an explosive post sent from his Mar-a-Lago home he called her a “traitor”.

Mr Glenn was forced into the role of Ms Greene's spokesman, counsellor and lightning rod, as she weighed whether her political career could survive.

And it made for a terrifying 48 hours at their home in Rome, Georgia.

On Tuesday, while nursing a cup of coffee in between live broadcasts from the White House, Glenn described the fallout.

The first sign of trouble came when a pizza delivery driver arrived at their door.

“I instantly knew what was happening, because I had not ordered a pizza,” he said. “It's always a precursor to something more.

“Somebody's feeling us out, seeing if we are home.”

Multiple bomb threats followed. At least one came from a foreign email address. And the bomb squad arrived to ensure everyone was safe.

“It kept escalating to the point where she said how long is this going to go on for? I don't need to do this anymore,” said Glenn.

Why put up with the abuse and stress and grind of re-election, he added, when the House of Representatives did not even sit for weeks during the recent government shutdown.

“That made her mad, because she is someone who works on an executive level like president Trump,” he said. “She's used to getting s--- done, right?”

It all meant Glenn, 56, a familiar face in the Oval Office, found himself at the centre of a story he never expected to cover.

The impact of her resignation was immediate. Glenn's phone exploded with messages, mostly supportive, he said.

They watched together as the video ticked past a million views on social media and they spent the rest of the weekend hunkered down at home, fending off dozens of requests for interviews.

The couple split their time between Washington, DC and Georgia. Friends wonder whether an engagement might follow Ms Greene's departure from Congress on Jan 5.

With his tousled blond hair, Glenn has the air of a perpetually surprised schoolboy.

He was once a features reporter at a local television station in Dallas, covering dog shows and state fairs but rose to prominence while Mr Trump was out of power. He covered the former president's raucous rallies, filling time between speeches, an exhausting job that at times involved broadcasting for more than seven hours.

He would see Ms Greene at rallies but they became a couple three years ago after being introduced by a mutual friend.

“We both were going through divorces,” he said. “So we were at kind of similar situations in life.”

Today, he is the figure that Maga faithful wake up to when they turn on the televisions in the morning.

As the insults and threats piled up after Mr Trump's social media post, Glenn waded in to support his girlfriend.

He posted images of them together with the message: “I love this woman. I love this country. God bless America.”

It was not the first time he had found himself at the heart of a story. In March, he was the reporter who asked Volodymyr Zelensky, the president of Ukraine, why he was not wearing a suit in the Oval Office, triggering what became a famous showdown.

“This is a little bit more difficult to navigate,” he admitted.

He is loyal to his girlfriend, but also wants the world to know he remains loyal to Mr Trump.

“I stand with the president,” he said.

It all puts him in uncharted territory. As a close Trump ally, he has been afforded special access at rallies during the campaign, flying on Trump Force One, and has been a regular guest in the Oval Office, alongside the rest of the White House press pool.

He said he had no intention of avoiding the president and hoped to be back asking questions soon, even if that meant listening to the president teeing off on his girlfriend.

“I'm gonna look forward with a poker face, and I'm not gonna say a word,” he said, even though his instincts would be crying out to push back. “It's gonna be really hard to do, though, really hard.”

He was back at the White House on Tuesday for the traditional turkey pardon, and had even instructed his team to make sure he had a spot where the president would see him.

A few days off for Thanksgiving, eating turkey and watching the Dallas Cowboys take on the Kansas City Chiefs, follows.

In the meantime, he is ready to shoot down stories that her resignation is part of a plan to run for president in 2028.

“I think she's much more powerful actually outside of an elected position, because she can help message the party very much like president Trump did when he was out of office,” he said. “He helped message the party in the right direction.”

Ms Greene's resignation shocked Republicans in Washington and launched a thousand theories about her motivations.

At the very least, her departure provides cover to like-minded Republicans who worry that Qatari jumbo jets and Nobel Peace Prize nominations have distracted the president from the economic worries of the blue-collar voters who elected him.

And, as one of the loudest voices of Maga, it puts the 51-year-old in a leading position to shape the future of the party after Mr Trump leaves office.

No one could believe that Ms Greene, one of the most influential women in Congress and spoken about as a future vice-presidential pick, could simply quit.

But there are no immediate plans for her next move, insisted Glenn. Not even a podcast.

“Her plan is to get away from politics, just get away from it,” he said. “I mean, it's been five hard years. She wants to take a break.”

Exclusive: Former US secretary of state calls for more demanding steps from Australia as it takes over presidency of next year's UN climate summit

Australia's government, which will preside over the next UN climate summit, should gather the world's 25 biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries and push them to draw up a roadmap to end the era of fossil fuels, former US secretary of state John Kerry has said.

Only by “hard-nosed” confrontation with fossil fuel producers, and reducing their consumption in major economies, would the world be able to tackle the climate crisis, he said.

Australia's climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, has been given the role of “president of negotiations”, even though the Cop31 climate summit will be held in Turkey, after the two countries agreed to compromise on hosting arrangements.

“We need to be more demanding, more pushy,” he told the Guardian in an exclusive interview. “The Australian president [of the Cop31 climate summit] needs to take charge. Only if you get China, Russia, the US, India and Europe together and they decide to really do the transition [to a clean economy] everyone else will follow.”

This would be difficult, he admitted. “Saudi Arabia and Russia will be hard,” he said. The US under Donald Trump was also unlikely to take part without severe pressure. But Kerry said: “I think some fossil fuel producers will set a roadmap.”

Even the process of calling such a meeting would be useful, by isolating those who refuse to take part, many of whom prefer to stay in the shadows, according to Kerry, who was climate envoy to Joe Biden after serving as secretary of state in Barack Obama's second term.

“It will expose the objectors,” he said. “Call them out. People need to see that if you're not part of the process, you're part of the problem. Everyone has to run out of patience with the games that are being played.”

Australia will host the Cop31 meeting next November, after Cop30 in Brazil ended last Saturday with only a partial deal that omitted direct mention of the “transition away from fossil fuels” that countries are supposed to be embarked on, but allowed for a voluntary initiative for willing countries to start drawing up a roadmap for the phaseout.

Donald Trump stayed away from the summit, having dismissed the climate crisis as a “con job” in a speech at the UN general assembly in September.

Kerry has personal experience of tough negotiations with both China and Saudi Arabia, which is what leads him to believe a fossil fuel roadmap is possible. At the Cop28 summit in Dubai in 2023, nations agreed for the first time to “transition away from fossil fuels”, but they set no end date or process for it.

Kerry, as US presidential climate envoy, helped broker that deal at a climactic meeting with Saudi Arabia's oil minister Prince Abdulaziz in the early hours of the final morning after a marathon all-night negotiating session.

For the first time, he spoke openly to the Guardian about the experience. “Abdulaziz wanted to try to find a way to be a helpful player,” he said. “At least, one part of him wanted not to know, but the other part of him was more open. Very happily, it was that part that came.”

He went on: “I like him, he is very direct, he is honest about what his concerns are, and what the realities of the marketplace are. He puts it on the table. I find him to be a good interlocutor.”

In January, Kerry will visit the UAE and Saudi Arabia to push his ideas further.

Australia also must “do proper spadework” in preparing the ground for Cop31, Kerry warned, unlike what happened at Cop30, when the idea was only really championed by a group of more than 80 developed and developing countries halfway through the process.

“It was a shame they did not try earlier to begin the process with the fossil fuel [roadmap] and then build it up at Cop,” he said. “Australia needs to come to the table with options for what the proposal ought to be. [They need to] respect other countries' positions, and what is possible for them.”

Even reluctant countries would have to acknowledge their role in the climate crisis, as its impacts continue to gather force, he added. “Mother Nature is going to make it crystal clear,” he said. “You will have to show your people how you will keep them alive at 50C, or where their food and water is going to come from. That is an inevitability.”

Kerry praised the Brazilian presidency which ran Cop30. “They did their best in difficult circumstances. Cop is very difficult, it's the hardest diplomacy in the world, made harder when big countries that have a big impact are not pulling their weight or rowing in the same direction.”

But he also spoke of the run-up to Cop30, in which countries were supposed to set out strengthened plans on cutting their emissions, in line with the goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, with that of Cop26, where the last round of plans were to be unveiled. “Raising ambition [on emissions cuts] was the whole focus of our diplomacy,” he said.

Though Kerry did not allude to it directly, Brazil claimed frequently ahead of Cop30 that the national plans – called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – were nothing to do with the Cop presidency.

“By not achieving something concrete, the Cops get discredited,” Kerry warned. “And the planet itself gets further in extremis.”

Kerry also enjoyed a warm relationship with China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua. They gave a joint press conference at the end of Cop28 in which they talked of their friendship, and soon afterwards retired within weeks of each other.

By contrast, China played little public role at Cop30, though behind the scenes it did not object to the fossil fuel phaseout roadmap nor to attempts to make direct reference to it in the legal outcome text.

“I do not feel that kind of effort of diplomacy [from developed countries towards the Chinese] was made in the walk-up to this Cop,” he said.

Kerry also warned that new ways must be found to persuade people to make the climate crisis “a voting issue” to force politicians to take notice. “What is clear here is that people do not want to hear all the bad things. They want to know how this [transition to clean energy] makes their lives better,” he said. “If you say it, their eyes glaze over. You have to say there is a better choice for you.”

Already, with insurers refusing to insure homes at threat in Florida, Texas, Louisiana and other US states, people were facing higher mortgage rates or the possibility of not being able to buy or stay in their homes. “If you say to people, you could save money on energy and here is what you will have to spend on your mortgage [if we stick with fossil fuels], then people will begin to understand the practicalities.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

			Steve Witkoff advises Putin aide on how to handle the US president and suggests Ukraine cede land

Steve Witkoff advised Russia on how to flatter Donald Trump in peace negotiations, according to a leaked telephone call.

Mr Witkoff, the president's special envoy, told Russian negotiators to “congratulate” the US president over his deal to end the war in Gaza before making their demands for Ukraine.

He also spoke of his “deep respect” for Vladimir Putin and detailed what the Russian leader should say in a direct call to Mr Trump.

The conversation took place on Oct 14 and led to Mr Trump holding a call with Vladimir Putin a day before Volodymyr Zelensky's White House visit where the US president was expected to hand over Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine.

Mr Trump subsequently refused to hand over the long-range missiles, noting that Putin “didn't like” the idea.

Mr Witkoff, a former real estate developer who has become Mr Trump's personal envoy to Putin, has faced sustained criticism for his lack of diplomatic experience and has been accused of being too close to Russia.

The leaks threaten to derail the talks and raise questions about his position as a key negotiator. Mr Witkoff is due to visit the Kremlin to meet in person with Putin next week. 

A second leaked phone call between Yuri Ushakov and another top Putin aide suggests that Russia wrote large parts of the contentious 28-point plan – a claim that the White House has been forced to repeatedly deny.

Mr Ushakov said they should ask for “the maximum” and Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's economic adviser, said that even if the US rejected some demands, the peace proposal would be as close to their demands “as possible”.

He then suggests talking later “to Steve about this paper”, referring to Mr Witkoff.

The calls provide a clear insight into Mr Witkoff's close relationship with his Russian counterparts and his negotiating tactics that resulted in the peace plan that Washington is pressuring Kyiv to accept as the foundations of the deal. 

In his call with Mr Ushakov on October 14, Mr Witkoff said: “Well listen. I am going to tell you something. I think, I think if we can get the Russia-Ukraine thing solved, everybody'll be jumping for joy.”

He then gave his Russian counterpart advice on what Putin should say to Mr Trump. 

“Yuri, here's what I would do. My recommendation,” Mr Witkoff told Mr Ushakov on Oct 14, according to a transcript reviewed and transcribed by Bloomberg.

“I would make the call and just reiterate that you congratulate the president on this achievement, that you supported it… that you respect that he is a man of peace and you're just, you're really glad to have seen it happen. So I would say that.

“I think from that it's going to be a really good call.”

At the time, Mr Trump was being widely praised for his efforts to end the war in Gaza. He had secured the release of the final hostages held by Hamas, and the day before, had addressed the Israeli Knesset.

“I think that very point our leaders could discuss,” Mr Ushakov replied, adding that Putin would hail Mr Trump as a “real peace man”.

Mr Witkoff said he had told Mr Trump, a long-time friend from their days in New York real estate, that “the Russian Federation has always wanted a peace deal”.

Trump's envoy then suggested that Ukraine would have to give up the partially occupied eastern Donetsk region – a longtime Russian demand – and “maybe a land swap somewhere”.

At the time, Mr Trump's frustration with Putin's refusal to negotiate had been growing.

Yet, after the two leaders' “very productive” two-and-a-half-hour call the day before Mr Zelensky's visit – which Mr Witkoff had suggested – a level of cordial relations appeared to be restored.

Mr Trump even announced plans to meet Putin face to face in Budapest, although the summit never materialised.

The US president told reporters on Tuesday night that he hadn't heard the tape but called it “a very standard form of negotiation”.

“He's got to sell this to Ukraine, he's got to sell Ukraine to Russia,” the US president said. “That's what a dealmaker does.”

Asked if Mr Witkoff was too pro-Russian, he pivoted to the human cost of the war.

“Look, this war could go on for years, and Russia's got a lot more people, got a lot more soldiers, so I think if Ukraine can make a deal, it's a good thing.”

The original 28-point plan was widely accused of being a Kremlin wish list, granting Moscow the entire Donbas region which it has failed to conquer, banning Ukraine from joining Nato and dramatically cutting the size of its military.

It was reportedly drawn up by Mr Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Mr Trump's son-in-law, with Mr Dmitriev following days of negotiations in Miami without input from the Ukrainians.

Three sources familiar with the matter confirmed to Reuters that Mr Trump's peace plan drew heavily from a Russian-authored paper submitted to the Trump administration in October.

The paper, a non-official communication known as a “non-paper”, contained language that the Russian government had previously put forward at the negotiating table, including concessions that Ukraine had always rejected, including ceding a significant chunk of its territory in the east.

Mr Dmitriev, who is widely suspected of leaking the 28-point peace plan to the media, has called the transcript a “fake”.

On Tuesday, Mr Trump said the original plan had been “fine-tuned” following input from Moscow and Kyiv, and that there were a “few remaining points of disagreement” following negotiations that have whittled it down to 19 points.

He said he would send Mr Witkoff to meet Putin in Moscow to iron out the final stages of the peace deal.

“​​What you have is a conglomerate of policy violence, and it's deadly,” says Barber, who is organizing protests.

Protests have erupted in North Carolina after federal agents arrested 370 people in immigration raids. On Monday, Bishop William Barber and other religious leaders gathered in Charlotte to demand an end to ICE raids. “​​What you have is a conglomerate of policy violence, and it's deadly,” says Barber, who is organizing protests against ICE and Medicaid cuts across the country. Barber notes that 51,000 people may die from preventable deaths because of the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, according to research from the University of Pennsylvania and Yale. “This is not just about Democrat and Republican and left versus right. This is literally about life versus death.”

This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

In North Carolina, protests are continuing, as they're continuing around the country. In North Carolina, federal agents arrested 370 people in immigration raids. On Monday, Bishop Barber and other religious leaders gathered in Charlotte.

BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: So, they hit North Carolina with ICE raids, and they hit North Carolina with ICE raids right at the same time people are raising concerns about Medicaid and healthcare and racist voter redistricting. And some people think that that means what we have to do is go to the ICE raids and forget about the other things. But what we know in this movement is it all connects.

RELIGIOUS LEADERS: It all connects, yes.

AMY GOODMAN: That was Bishop William Barber speaking Monday in Charlotte, North Carolina, joining us now from North Carolina. He's president of Repairers of the Breach, national co-chair of Poor People's Campaign, founding director of the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale Divinity School.

We only have a few minutes, Bishop, but your agenda is a big one. Can you talk about the protests around immigration raids, and then what you're talking about when it comes to healthcare and other issues right now?

BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, thank you so much. Amy.

We had a Moral Monday in 20 states yesterday. And in North Carolina, we had two: one at 12:00, one at 7:00. And the focus is to connect the dots and to bring people out, of every different race, creed and color.

We were in Charlotte because the ICE raids came. We knew they were coming. People stood up, had been planning for months and waiting for it. We went there to deliver “Liberty Vans,” which is a concept through the Save America Movement. Steve Schmidt and others have come together. These vans, on public ground, travel constantly to film what ICE is doing, that news may not get a hold of, and to put it out there and also to document the trauma that people are going through.

But we also gathered hundreds of people right there in that church, and thousands online, who are saying that when you look at the ICE raids and then the raiding of Medicaid for millions of people, the raiding of food stamps for millions of people, and, in North Carolina, the raiding of our voting rights, what you have is a — is a conglomerate of policy violence, and it's deadly. It's deadly. It kills dreams. It kills hopes. It kills democracy. But also, we know 51,000 people are scheduled to — may die from preventable deaths because of what has happened in the Big Beautiful — big, ugly, destructive bill. And the reason, Amy, we keep raising that is because that same bill, that cut 16 million people's healthcare, 22 million people's food stamps, takes that cut and then puts $160 billion into ICE agents. They're hiring more agents with masks.

And we recognize that we have to connect this together, and we have to stand strong together, and it has to be a moral issue. We cannot let this merely be a issue between Democrats or Republicans. We had clergy from everywhere, as well as activists, as well as impacted people, on Monday night, who are determined for the long haul and who understand what policy murder, policy violence, policy destruction looks like, and why, in this moment, we must raise it like never before. And we're talking about long term. These Moral Mondays will continue. They began in the South in 10 states. Now they've spread to 20. And we're going to continue to raise it.

In fact, Amy, lastly, when we go, we're not only going with vans. We're going with caskets. We're literally taking caskets to the General Assembly, sometimes to the office of these congresspersons and senators, to say, “These policies are destructive to lives.” And we must make that case before America. This is not just about Democrat and Republican and left versus right. This is literally about life versus death.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Reverend Barber, in Chicago, everyone from the governor on down to all the community organizations finally succeeded in basically pushing ICE out of the city, at least temporarily. What's your sense of the kind of solidarities that are being built between Black and Brown communities in North Carolina right now?

BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, Black and Brown and white, you know, people are coming together. And I think it's important to say that — and Asian. We had Jewish, we had Muslim in the room. We had Christian in the room. You know, sometimes what happens is, pain that is caused by powerful politicians who forget that what they ought to be doing is picking up humanity rather than pulling down humanity, it actually has a reversal effect, and it makes people come together, because it's so blatant and so ugly, so harsh and so mean. And that's what we see happening.

And people are not believing that ICE has ever gone anywhere. They are saying they may go underground, they may stop for a minute, but just like what you see in Charlotte, the people that were planning there, even before we went down on Monday, they've been planning. They've been training. They've been getting ready. And that's what we're saying to cities and states and counties, in states all over the country: Get ready. Don't wait. Get ready now. And get ready by connecting the dots. Get ready by connecting the dots.

We must organize this pain, the same pain that is caused by millions of people losing healthcare, millions of people losing their food stamps, millions of people's voting rights being challenged, millions of people without living wages, and millions of immigrants being challenged and harmed and deported. We must connect all of that pain into a powerful movement.

And then, lastly, Amy, this is not new.

AMY GOODMAN: We have 10 seconds.

BISHOP WILLIAM BARBER II: Yeah. Well, the bottom line is, we also said this is not new. This has a deep American history. People have had to fight it for years, and it's our time now that we have to fight it. And we must do it together.

AMY GOODMAN: And as we move into this holiday weekend, people should remember, according to Feeding America, one in five children are going hungry in the United States. That's despite the government reopening. Bishop William Barber, president of Repairs of the Breach, national co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign, thanks so much for being with us.

Watch live from the scene as a fire spreads across seven high-rise apartment buildings in a Hong Kong housing complex, killing 13 people and leaving others trapped, according to the city's fire services.

HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's deadliest fire in years blazed through high-rise apartment buildings into the night Wednesday as the city's leader confirmed at least 36 people, including a firefighter, had died and another 279 people were reported missing.

Hundreds of residents were evacuated as the blaze spread across seven of the eight buildings in a housing complex in Tai Po district, a suburb in the New Territories. At least 29 others remained hospitalized. Bright flames and smoke shot out of windows as night fell. 

Investigators will be looking into factors including whether material on the exterior walls of high-rise buildings met fire resistance standards, as the rapid spread of the fire was unusual, authorities said.

Officials earlier said the fire started on the external scaffolding of one of the buildings, a 32-storey tower, and later spread to inside the building and then to nearby buildings, likely aided by windy conditions. 

“Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate” the fire and its cause, John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, said. The probe includes whether criminal elements are involved.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Wednesday expressed condolences to the firefighter who died and extended sympathies to the families of the victims, according to state broadcaster CCTV. He also urged efforts to minimize casualties and losses.




The fire at three of the buildings was “coming under control” shortly past midnight, according to the Fire Services Department.

The housing complex consisted of eight buildings with almost 2,000 apartments housing about 4,800 residents, including many elderly people. It was built in the 1980s and had recently been undergoing a major renovation.

Fire chiefs said high temperatures at the scene made it difficult for crews to mount rescue operations. A column of flames and thick smoke rose as the blaze spread quickly on bamboo scaffolding and construction netting that had been set up around the exterior of the buildings. About 900 people were evacuated to temporary shelters.

Authorities said that hundreds of firefighters, police officers and paramedics were deployed. Firefighters aimed water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks.

The blaze, which started mid-afternoon, was upgraded a level 5 alarm — the highest level of severity — as night fell. Authorities said that conditions remained very challenging for firefighters. 

“Debris and scaffolding of the affected buildings (is) falling down,” said Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of Fire Service operations. “The temperature inside the buildings concerned is very high. It's difficult for us to enter the building and go upstairs to conduct firefighting and rescue operations.”

The fire department said that it received “numerous” calls requesting assistance. It said some residents remained trapped as of Wednesday night.

Firefighters deployed more than 140 fire trucks and more than 60 ambulances to the scene.

The dead included a 37-year-old firefighter, while another received treatment for heat exhaustion, Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said.

District officials in Tai Po have opened temporary shelters for people left homeless by the fire.




“I've given up thinking about my property,” a resident who only provided her surname, Wu, told local TV station TVB. “Watching it burn like that was really frustrating.”

Tai Po is a suburban area in the New Territories, in the northern part of Hong Kong and near the border with the mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen.

Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though the government said earlier this year that it would start phasing it out for public projects because of safety concerns.

The fire is the deadliest in Hong Kong in years. In November 1996, 41 people died in a commercial building in Kowloon in a level 5 fire that lasted for around 20 hours.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Park Service said Tuesday it is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. parks each year an extra $100 to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents.

The announcement declaring “America-first entry fee policies” comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time.

The fee change will impact 11 national parks, including Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Yosemite, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior.

As part of the changes, which are set to take effect Jan. 1, foreign tourists will also see their annual parks pass price jump to $250, while U.S. residents will continue to be charged $80, according to the department's statement.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service “continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!”

A White House post on X laying out the increased fees ended with the phrase, “AMERICANS FIRST.”

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists.




“There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation – all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,” Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email.

The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018.

The money made off the new fees will help support the national parks, including with upgrading facilities for visitors and maintenance, according to the statement.

The “resident-only patriotic fee-free days” next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that “everyone, no matter their ZIP code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.”

Former White House chief information officer Theresa Payton joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how OpenTable is surveilling its users and Google's warning to VPN users about a recent security threat. 

Maybe you order sparkling water, start every meal with an appetizer or prefer dining right when the restaurant opens. You might not track these habits. OpenTable might.

Some restaurants are now seeing new AI-assisted tags about diners when they book a table. These tags can note drink patterns, spending levels, review habits and last-minute cancellations.

These insights surfaced after Kat Menter, a host at a Michelin-starred restaurant who posts about food under the name Eating Out Austin, spotted the new ""AI-assisted"" tags at work. She shared a look at the system in a TikTok video that quickly caught attention. Media outlets then confirmed the test with additional restaurants.

WOULD YOU EAT AT A RESTAURANT RUN BY AI?

OpenTable integrates with POS (Point of Sale) platforms such as Toast or Epos. These systems handle orders, payments and timing during a meal. When your contact details match your OpenTable account, the platform can connect your visit to your profile.

This can include arrival time, general order details, time spent and bill totals. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You do not need to book through OpenTable for this to happen. You only need an account and matching contact information.

Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them.

Restaurants have tracked guest preferences for years. Staff may note favorite dishes or preferred seating. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. This helps them shape a smooth visit.

OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. A single business dinner can mark someone as a high spender. Eating with friends who order cocktails can make a person look like a cocktail lover. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals.

THAT'S NOT A HUMAN TALKING TO YOU IN THE FAST FOOD DRIVE-THRU

OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like ""glass of cabernet"") to consistently categorize them as ""red wine,"" ""white wine,"" etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles.

The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences.

""Guest insights are the engine of personalization, allowing restaurants to optimize their service and deliver the kind of thoughtful hospitality that both benefits the business and offers a special experience for the diner,"" an OpenTable representative told CyberGuy. ""These insights come from a mix of sources — including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners — and are limited to non-confidential information.""

""They might help a server suggest a dish you'll love or recognize that you prefer a more relaxed dining pace,"" the representative said. ""We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. You're in charge of what data you share. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you've made in your privacy preferences.""

If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable then turns this into aggregated insights.

RESTAURANT INSIDERS SHARE THE SECRETS OF SNAGGING HARD-TO-GET RESERVATIONS

OpenTable reportedly shares insights across its broader restaurant network. This applies only where enabled and only for restaurants on the OpenTable Pro plan, and is a feature in Beta.

If you want more privacy, you can turn off the ""Point of sale information"" setting:

This stops your order history from contributing to future insights.

Your dining habits may move with you when you dine at restaurants that use OpenTable Pro.

This awareness helps you understand what your apps track. It also gives you the chance to adjust your privacy settings so you stay in control of your information.

BE ON HIGH ALERT IF YOU USE THIS POPULAR RESERVATION APP

Dining out should feel simple, yet today's tech adds a new layer to the experience. These AI-assisted tags give restaurants extra insight, but they also remind you how much of your behavior gets logged behind the scenes. By checking your privacy settings and turning off POS data sharing, you keep more control over what follows you from one meal to the next. Staying aware makes a big difference. It helps you enjoy your night out without wondering who's tracking your habits or how your data might appear on a screen. With a few quick choices, you can shape what restaurants see and keep your preferences truly personal.

“I'd rather my house not get firebombed.”

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

On Monday I spoke with a Republican member of Indiana's legislature who opposes President Donald Trump's push for the state to redraw its congressional map to gain two GOP seats and help the party hold its House majority in next year's midterm elections. Trump, with support from Indiana's Republican governor, Mike Braun, has vowed to back primary challengers against members of the GOP who are, for now, blocking the redistricting plan. The lawmaker I spoke with asked that I not publish his name. He isn't worried about Trump's political wrath; he doesn't plan to run for reelection. His fear of speaking out is much more personal: “I'd rather my house not get firebombed,” he told me by phone.

Such a worry is not as far-fetched as it might sound—not in an America that has seen an eruption of political violence over the past few years, and not in Indiana over the past few weeks. Republicans in the state have faced a wave of “swatting” incidents, in which a false call to emergency services draws a police response, for not endorsing the redistricting plan. (Braun said he and his family have also received threats.)

Indiana lawmakers have reported other apparent attempts at intimidation, including at least one bomb threat, as well as subtler forms of harassment. Not all of them have been made public. Earlier this month, the Republican I interviewed was returning home from an evening walk and saw a Domino's Pizza car parked out front. The delivery was under his name, with his home address, but he had not ordered it. The phone number that was given to the delivery driver was not his. The confirmation that no one in his family ordered it came when he asked the driver what was on the pizza: sausage and pepperoni. “We don't eat meat,” he told me with a laugh, “so none of us ordered that pizza.” When the lawmaker later called the number affiliated with the order, it went to the state police in Indianapolis. Hoax pizza deliveries have been a favored tactic of MAGA supporters who have tried to enforce loyalty to Trump and his agenda. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia reported a similar incident before she abruptly announced her resignation from Congress. “The whole idea is, We know who you are. We know where you live,” the Indiana lawmaker said. “They're trying to intimidate us.”

So far, Trump's heavy-handed pressure campaign and the anonymous harassment directed toward Indiana Republicans have not worked. The White House wants the state legislature to adopt a new congressional map that would make Republicans the favorites to win the two House seats currently held by Democrats. (Republicans already have the other seven.) Although a majority of the GOP-controlled general assembly reportedly backs the idea, the state Senate has balked. The senate initially flouted Braun's move to call a special session of the legislature next month to consider redistricting. Its president pro tempore, Rodric Bray, opposes redistricting and has said the proposal lacks the votes to pass, but he announced on Tuesday that the senate would return next month to render “a final decision” on the idea.

Indiana is only the latest red state to resist Trump's demand that it join a gerrymandering arms race against Democratic-led states like California. The administration launched this campaign over the summer by leaning on Republicans in the Texas legislature to approve a map that could wipe out as many as five Democratic-held seats in the state's House delegation. GOP lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina soon followed, but the redistricting effort has stalled elsewhere. Kansas Republicans announced earlier this month that they lacked the votes to enact a map that would eliminate a Democratic-leaning House seat in and around Kansas City.

In Ohio, Republicans struck a deal with Democrats that only marginally improves the GOP's chances of picking up two additional seats. Meanwhile, California voters earlier this month overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure to redraw the state's House map and hand Democrats as many as five new seats. Democrats in Virginia launched their own redistricting push that could yield the party multiple GOP-held seats. And last week, a federal judge ruled that the GOP's new Texas map was unconstitutional, throwing the party's biggest redistricting win into doubt. (The Supreme Court has paused the ruling while it considers whether to take the case.)

Read: ‘None of this is good for Republicans' 

Trump's drive to padlock the Republicans' House majority may be backfiring, and it could be Democrats who emerge from the gerrymandering war with more seats. As the administration's bravado has turned to desperation and anger, Trump has put even more pressure on Indiana Republicans to deliver. Vice President J. D. Vance traveled to the state last month to lobby lawmakers, and the president has been calling out individual legislators by name in his Truth Social feed.

Republicans hold a 40–10 supermajority in the Indiana Senate, so the aversion to Trump's push is not limited to a few renegade members. Several opponents have criticized the plan on the grounds that Indiana should not redraw its maps in the middle of the decade; the Constitution calls for reapportionment of representatives among the states to be done after the decennial Census. “I'm not inclined to ever redistrict mid-decade,” the lawmaker told me. He said he voted with other Republicans to enact the state's current congressional map after the 2020 Census. “What has changed from the Census five years ago that would lead us to redistrict today?” the legislator asked. “Nothing has changed.”

The president's purely political argument—“they could be depriving Republicans of a majority in the House,” he wrote of the idea's GOP critics in Indiana—isn't persuasive to this legislator. “Other states need to do what they want to do, but I don't think it makes sense for them to do it either.” The lawmaker said Republicans should be trying to win elections on the merits, not through gerrymandering: “If you're not confident enough in your policies that you think that it's going to have a negative impact on your politics, then maybe you need to be doing something different.”

This lawmaker was hardly alone among Republican opponents of Trump's redistricting push in Indiana who were reluctant to speak publicly. None of the critics I contacted over the past week would agree to an on-the-record interview. Supporters of the president's plan, by contrast, were less reticent. “It's not unconstitutional, it's not illegal, and it's not immoral,” Beau Baird, a GOP state representative, said of redistricting. Baird is also the Republican Party chair of Putnam County; his father, Jim Baird, has represented the area in Congress since 2019. The younger Baird told me that he wanted Republicans to draw a maximally favorable House map after the 2020 Census but that the party ended up favoring a less aggressive approach. He was initially hesitant to revisit the district lines in the middle of the decade, but he told me he came around to the idea pretty quickly. “I believe that it is important that we do it, and we do it now,” Baird said.

Read: Donald Trump's plan to subvert the midterms is already under way

Indiana's entire GOP House delegation is publicly backing the redistricting effort, as is Senator Jim Banks. (The state's senior senator, Republican Todd Young, has said only that he “supports our state legislators and trusts their judgment” on the issue.) Representative Marlin Stutzman, a Republican in his second stint in Congress, justified the proposal to sweep Democrats entirely out of the state's delegation by pointing to New England, where not a single Republican across six states is serving in the House. “I would argue that the Democrats have been doing this much longer than Republicans have, and President Trump has just finally shown the Republican Party how to fight back and play the same game,” Stutzman told me.

Baird told me that when he recently spoke to a group of about 100 Republican constituents, the crowd initially seemed opposed to redistricting but emerged supportive after he made his argument in favor. Stutzman predicted that if redistricting were put before the voters—as Democrats in California did earlier this month—Hoosiers would endorse the idea. Other Republicans, however, say public opinion is running in the opposite direction.

In a statement earlier this month, State Senator Kyle Walker said he informally surveyed his constituents and found that 93 percent were against redistricting, leading him to oppose the plan. The lawmaker I spoke with asked an aide to tally up the emails and voicemails his office had received from constituents expressing a view on redistricting over the past few months. (The office did not actively solicit opinions on the issue.) The results floored him. Out of a total of nearly 400 constituents who called and wrote, just eight voiced support for redistricting; the rest were opposed.

It might seem that such strong public backing would embolden a politician to take a more forthright stand against their own party—especially one who does not plan to be on the ballot again. But police are still patrolling the streets around his house and neighborhood. The threat has not yet passed, and an elected state legislator still does not feel safe in publicly crossing the president. “It's a sad testament to our politics right now,” he told me.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Why Medicare price negotiations matter for Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, and other European pharma companies","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/26/why-medicare-price-cuts-matter-for-novo-nordisk-european-pharma.html","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 17:18:29 GMT","



Drug pricing has emerged as a key topic to watch for pharmaceutical companies and investors in 2025. As President Donald Trump pushes for lower medicine prices for Americans, the sector is facing additional pricing pressure from a Biden-era law called the Inflation Reduction Act.

The IRA, voted into law in 2022, allows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate prices for a number of drugs each year for patients in Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. It's now making waves also across the Atlantic. 

While these changes are taking place firmly in the U.S., pharmaceutical companies across the globe are finding themselves increasingly exposed to the American market. 

A number of European companies have announced sizeable U.S. investments to placate Trump and his aggressive tariff agenda, while AstraZeneca is moving toward another direct listing on the NYSE to tap into the deeper pockets of U.S. capital markets. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has cited a failure to deal with changes in the U.S. market as part of the reason for recent leadership changes.

Late Tuesday, the CMS announced newly negotiated prices for 15 blockbuster drugs from 2027, including Novo Nordisk's mega bestseller Ozempic which will see a 71% discount to its list price.

Among other European pharma giants, AstraZeneca's cancer drug Calquence will face a 40% discount, while GSK's lung disease medicines Trelegy and Breo with 73% and 83% discount, respectively. 

Overall, discounts ranged between 38% and 85%, with estimated savings of about $8.5 billion, 36% lower than recent annual spending.

""Whether through the Inflation Reduction Act or President Trump's Most Favored Nation policy, this is what serious, fair, and disciplined negotiation looks like,"" said CMS Deputy Administrator Chris Klomp in a statement. 

A GSK spokesperson said they were pleased with the agreement. ""We strongly believe in the value of both Trelegy and Breo and remain committed to working with CMS.""

Novo, on the other hand, was critical. ""We continue to have serious concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's impact on patients and remain opposed to government price setting,"" a spokesperson told CNBC in emailed comments. ""We have seen that government price setting has not translated to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and can lead to a loss of coverage for medications and higher insurance premiums,"" they added.

The U.S. is a key market for most large-cap pharma companies, mostly due to the significantly higher prices for branded medicines. In the first nine months of 2025, 56% of Novo's total sales originated in the U.S. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca logged 42% of product sales in the U.S. and GSK some 52%, over the same period.

Prescription drug prices are about three times higher in the U.S. compared to other wealthy countries, a 2024 report by RAND found.

""The [IRA price] cuts were a little higher than last year, which I think people were expecting,"" Barclays analyst Emily Field told CNBC. ""It doesn't seem like there was any surprises at all,"" she added. 

Muted shares also indicated that the outcome of the negotiations was largely expected. AstraZeneca and GSK rose less than 1% each in afternoon trading. 

Novo shares however, ended the day 4.7% higher. Semaglutide, sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, will from 2027 be priced at $274 for Medicare patients, down from a previous list price of $959. That said, Medicare plans already get large discounts on companies' list prices, but those rates aren't typically disclosed. 

CMS is due to publish its list of 15 drugs selected for negotiations for 2028 by February 1, 2026.

The IRA price negotiations are, however, not the main concern for companies, Field said, noting how it's becoming a better-understood and predictable process. ""What people are much more worried about is further directions that MFN could go… if they decide to do something different,"" she said. 

Trump has made it a priority to rein in U.S. drug costs and in May, signed an executive order to implement so-called Most Favored Nation pricing, meaning U.S. prices would be tied to lower ones paid abroad. 

Lower prices in the U.S. could have a dramatic effect on companies' top and bottom lines, but companies are finding ways to mitigate the impact by making deals with the Trump administration to voluntarily lower certain prices, as well as pledge investments in U.S. manufacturing to avoid tariffs. 

Earlier this month, Trump announced deals with Novo and rival Eli Lilly to slash prices of weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026, as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the TrumpRx.gov website. Under the agreement, starting doses of Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month and trend down to $245 per month over a two years.

While reduced pricing will hit sales, volume gains from opening up broad access for obesity drugs could offset that headwind, BMO analysts noted. 

Last week, Novo also announced it is lowering prices of Ozempic and Wegovy to $349 per month from $499 for patients paying out-of-pocket, following pressure from Trump. 

Other companies including AstraZeneca and U.S.-based Pfizer have also announced deals with the Trump administration to cut drug prices.

LONDON — European stocks ended Wednesday in positive territory amid rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in December. 

The pan-European Stoxx 600 finished the session almost 1.1% higher, with most sectors and major regional bourses in the green.

Regional indexes are following their counterparts on Wall Street and in the Asia-Pacific region higher amid expectations that the Fed will cut when it next meets on Dec. 9-10.

Markets are pricing in almost an 85% chance of a quarter percentage point cut by the central bank, according to the CME FedWatch tool. New York Fed President John Williams also said on Friday that there was room to lower rates ""in the near term.""

Global markets also got a boost after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that there was a ""very good chance"" that Trump could name a new Fed chair before Christmas.

While he said he was interviewing candidates, expectations are shifting toward White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, after Bloomberg reported he had emerged as a frontrunner for the job. Hassett is viewed as someone more likely to push for lower rates.

In the U.K., all eyes are on the Autumn Budget on Wednesday with Chancellor Rachel Reeves set to unveil her spending and taxation plans for the year ahead. There are widespread expectations that the finance minister will announce a raft of tax hikes as she tries to stick to self-imposed rules on spending and borrowing, and has a fiscal black hole to fill as a result. 

The country's fiscal watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility unexpectedly released its economic and fiscal forecasts ahead of the Autumn Budget, sending yields on British government debt see-sawing.

The benchmark 10-year gilt moved higher after falling as much 4 basis points following the release, but quicky reversed gains. It was last seen 2 basis point lower. Shorter-term gilts followed a similar pattern. 

Follow CNBC's Autumn Budget live blog throughout the day for all the latest news, comment and announcements. Chancellor Reeves delivered her budget statement around 12:30 p.m. London time.

U.K. banks also experienced sharp swings during the session, initially rising on the back of expectations they would be spared from extra taxes in the Autumn Budget, before selling off following the surprise early release of the budget details, and later closing in positive territory. 

Barclays finished the day 3% higher, Natwest advanced around 2%, and Lloyds gained 3.4%.

Reeves confirmed the introduction of a council tax charge on properties valued over £2 million ($6.63 million). British housing and construction names Persimmon fell almost 0.2%, Taylor Wimpey shed 1.7%, and The Berkeley Group fell almost 3%. Barratt Redrow climbed back into the green after an initial dip, later reversing course to finish the day down 0.4%.

Sterling gained on the dollar, moving 0.5% higher to trade at $1.323. 

European investors also monitored developments in U.S.-led negotiations on a Ukraine peace deal. On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said a deal was ""very close."" U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, Trump added, while U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll ""will be meeting with the Ukrainians.""

It came after reports emerged that Kyiv had accepted the reworked terms of the peace plan, originally drafted by the U.S. 

European defense stocks moved higher on Wednesday, with Germany's Rheinmetall closing 1.9% higher. 

Elsewhere, Novo Nordisk shares rose 4.7% after the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced the newly negotiated price for its bestseller drugs Ozempic and Wegovy from 2027. The new price for patients on Medicare will be $274, a 71% discount from its current list price.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC) fell close to 33% from its peak to around $84,000 amid a broader tech sell-off.

Strategy (MSTR) shares dropped 63% from their high as the company continues buying Bitcoin during the decline.

Strategy was excluded from the S&P 500 and may face exclusion from other indices during Bitcoin's downturn.

If you're thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here

There's a bit of a panic going on in the crypto markets, to say the least, with Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) and Ether (CRYPTO:ETH) both tumbling by a high double-digit percentage in the past month. With Bitcoin hovering around $84,000, there's concern that more pain could be in the cards as the technical picture gets a bit nastier. And if the broad tech sell-off drags its feet all the way into year's end and perhaps into some part of the new year, perhaps even the weekends could prove turbulent for the top crypto tokens.

Either way, it's been a nauseating ride for crypto investors, and as some of the plays on crypto assets also begin to fold, questions linger about Bitcoin's suitability as a replacement for risk-off assets such as gold. Though time will tell how the biggest bulls on cryptocurrencies, like Fundstrat's Tom Lee who's a big fan of Ether, adjust if the negative momentum persists over the coming weeks, I do think that it's always wise to be prepared for more downwards action as crypto markets navigate through a storm and perhaps a lengthy crypto winter, just in time for the holiday season.

Personally, I wouldn't brave the latest plunge in Bitcoin, now that the digital token has shed close to a third of its value in short order. While I would consider giving the largest crypto a second look, should they hit the $60,000-63,000 range, an area of strong support, given the 2024 consolidation channel as well as the two highs in 2021, investors shouldn't opt to invest any cash they wouldn't be willing to part with.

At the end of the day, cryptocurrencies are an incredibly volatile asset, to say the least. But, at the same time, volatility can work in both directions, with some of the biggest swings coming not all too far behind some of the worst implosions. Though there could be more room to the downside over the short- to medium-term, I wouldn't write off the asset class entirely, especially if the tech trade settles down and the risk appetite risks up, moving into bargain-hunting mode, rather than a rush to the exits.

After such a vicious sell-off, perhaps a name like Strategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) might be worth picking up if you're a believer in the longer-term future of Bitcoin and its ability to not only return to the $100,000 mark, but to power even higher.

Shares of Strategy, formerly known as Microstrategy, are down far more than Bitcoin, now off close to 63% from its peak. The crash has been quite severe, but if we are in for a turn at some point down the line, Strategy stock might have more room to rally, especially since the firm has been buying more Bitcoin on recent weakness.

For now, Strategy shares won't be going in the S&P 500. And it might face exclusion from other indices as well as Bitcoin enters one of its nasty declines. While Strategy will probably only turn the tide once Bitcoin sees relief, I view the name as one of the better ways to play a reversal. Perhaps next month, Bitcoin will reach a support level that would make buying the dip seem less reckless. In the meantime, I'd much rather turn to gold for stability amid volatility.

In prior pieces, I noted that gold would probably outperform cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, over the foreseeable future, especially as investors took more of a risk-off approach in response to the market pullback and fears of an AI bubble.

 

You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you'd be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Four reasons why Ethereum price remains bullish above $2,800","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:5afe3930a094b:0-four-reasons-why-ethereum-price-remains-bullish-above-2-800/","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 14:43:09 GMT","

Ether ETHUSD price is up 11% since plunging below the $3,000 mark on Nov. 22, reclaiming key support levels. Analysts say that increased demand from institutions, coupled with the end of quantitative tightening, could lead to a recovery toward $3,600 next.

Key takeaways:

Ethereum demand is recovering along with ETF inflows.

The end of the Fed's QT on Dec. 1 will unlock liquidity into crypto markets.

Ether's V-shaped chart pattern hints at a $3,600 target if key support holds.

Ether's apparent demand hits a 26-month high

Ethereum's Apparent Demand has remained positive despite the recent drawdown and has risen to its highest level since September 2024.

Apparent Demand is a metric that gauges Ether's market demand by measuring the difference between the daily ETH issuance and the change in inventory (supply that has been inactive for over one year. Positive values suggest rising demand.

Capriole Investment's Bitcoin Apparent Demand metric reveals that demand for Ether has increased sharply to 90,995 ETH on Nov. 26, from 37,990 ETH on Nov. 22.

Related: High percentage of Bitcoin, ETH, SOL held at a loss: Is it a bear market sign?

Increasing ETH demand amid drawdown signals aggressive accumulation on price dips, pointing to an imminent rebound. 

The last time demand was this high was in September 2023, when the price was hovering between $1,500 and $1,700 after a 25% drawdown. This was followed by a 165% rally to $4,100 in March 2024.

Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETF flows have flipped positive, recording inflows for three consecutive days, totaling $230.9 million. 

The reversal followed a punishing stretch from Nov. 11–20, when Ethereum funds shed a combined $1.28 billion, one of the longest and deepest red waves since the ETFs launched. 

Part of Ether's ability to sustain a recovery above the $2,800 support comes from expectations that increased demand and ETF inflows will provide tailwinds that will push the ETH price higher.

End of QT: History backs Ether's price rebound

The US Federal Reserve is expected to end Quantitative Tightening (QT) on Dec. 1, something that has historically preceded parabolic ETH rallies. 

When QT ends, liquidity returns to the market, and risk assets typically rebound.

“QT ends on Dec. 1 - it's a good time to zoom out and look at how crypto behaved the last time this happened,” crypto analysts Front Runners said in their latest post on X. 

An accompanying chart reveals that altcoins “actually outperformed $BTC after QT ended” in the previous cycle, the analysts wrote, adding: 

 

The chart above also shows that Bitcoin dominance topped immediately after QT and then continued to trend lower, forming a double top during the COVID-19 period before resuming its decline.

“The difference this time is that BTC is already below the 50W SMA, last cycle it only lost that level well after QT ended,” Front Runners added.

If history repeats, the end of QT will ignite a liquidity rotation that could propel altcoins, led by ETH, to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) in the coming months. 

The key cost basis area is around $2,800 

According to Ether's cost basis distribution data, investors acquired approximately 4.95 million ETH at an average cost of between $2,800 and $2,830, creating a potential support zone. 

This concentration suggests many investors may defend the price around this level, which could make this a launchpad for a rally. 

Analysts say ETH must hold this support at $2,800 for the bulls to regain their footing. 

“Ethereum is trading back at its big $2.8K level, which has acted as a strong support and resistance throughout this entire cycle,” said Daan Crypto Trades in a Monday X post, adding:

 

As Cointelegraph reported, a break and close below $2,800 could signal the start of the next leg of the downmove to $2,400 and then to the $2,100 level.

Ether's V-shaped chart pattern targets $3,600

From a technical perspective, Ether's price action has been forming a potential V-shaped chart pattern on the four-hour chart since early November, as shown below.

ETH now trades below a key supply zone between $3,000 and $3,500, where the 100-period and 200-period simple moving averages (SMAs) sit. 

Bulls need to push the price above this area to increase the chances of the price rising to the neckline at $3,650 and completing the V-shaped pattern. Such a move would represent a 26% price increase from the current levels. 

On the downside, the 50 SMA provided key support at $2,891, reinforcing the importance of this demand area, as mentioned earlier. 

Commenting on the ETH/BTC chart, Michael van de Poppe, founder of MN Capital, said that ETH was preparing for a strong upward move in the coming weeks.

This chart remains super interesting, as I think that we'll see a strong breakout upwards in the coming weeks for $ETH.

SpaceComputer, a startup that plans to use satellites to run secure computing for blockchains, has raised $10 million in a seed round, according to an announcement shared exclusively with The Defiant. The firm said the funds will be used to build an orbital network that can process blockchain operations securely from space.

The seed round was co-led by Maven11 and Lattice, with participation from Superscrypt, the Arbitrum Foundation, Nascent, Offchain Labs, Hashkey, and Chorus One, among others. Individual investors include Marc Weinstein, Jason Yanowitz, and Ameen Soleimani. This raise follows a pre-seed round led by Primitive Ventures earlier this year, the announcement notes.

The funding will be used to build and launch SpaceComputer's first satellites, as well as the secure computing hardware they carry. These satellites, called SpaceTEE units, will run secure blockchain and cryptography tasks from space, according to the press release.

The funding will also go toward building network software, setting up how the satellites work together, and offering new services like private computing and secure record-keeping.

The investment highlights growing interest in using novel approaches, like space technology, to advance blockchain infrastructure. By moving beyond traditional satellites, blockchain operations could become harder to mess with on Earth.

“The SpaceComputer project represents an optimistic, yet pragmatic cypherpunk ambition,” said co-founder Daniel Bar. “Space is open for business and we are rapidly entering an era where more and more applications include space based computation and communication layers.”

Bar added that the “importance and opportunity” of space for decentralized technologies is “undeniable.” 

Major financial institutions have also explored the potential of satellites for secure transactions. A few years ago, JPMorgan's digital asset arm tested what it called the “world's first bank-led tokenized value transfer in space.” The banking giant used a blockchain network deployed on low-Earth orbit  (LEO) satellites to execute smart-contract transactions.

These developments come as scientists grow extremely concerned with the expanding amount of space debris. In 2023, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) warned in a letter to Congress that debris from LEO satellites, like SpaceX's Starlink constellation, could pose a danger to people on the ground during reentry disposal.

A separate 2022 study claimed that Elon Musk's swarm of satellites is obstructing astronomers' telescope views.

SpaceComputer is known predominantly for testing satellites on SpaceX's Falcon 9 and releasing tools for developers to access computing from space. 

The company is currently working with researchers at the Technical University of Munich, Cornell Tech, and U.C. Santa Barbara to explore off-Earth computing for blockchain applications.

Share this article

UFC star Conor McGregor publicly blasted longtime rival Khabib Nurmagomedov after the retired champion dropped a series of papakha-inspired NFTs, digital versions of the traditional Dagestani hat he made famous during UFC fight nights.

Social media posts claimed the release generated around $4.4 million, and after the sale, Nurmagomedov deleted earlier posts promoting it.

McGregor immediately accused Nurmagomedov of running a “scam,” claiming he used his late father's name and Dagestani culture to take money from fans before wiping off promotional evidence. He called it “a shame and a stain” on Nurmagomedov's father's legacy.

“There is just no way good guy Khabib used his late father's name, as well as Dagestan's culture, to scam his fans and fire sell a bunch of digital NFTs online and then delete all of the content after they were sold, leaving his fans robbed of their money?” McGregor wrote.

Nurmagomedov fired back, calling McGregor an “absolute liar” and insisting the NFTs were legitimate “digital gifts” with real value, created to celebrate the Dagestani tradition. He said McGregor was trying to insult him years after losing their infamous 2018 fight.

McGregor also had his own history with crypto ventures.

The former UFC champion previously partnered with Real World Gaming DAO to launch a meme token called REAL, aiming to blend meme coin appeal with utility and transparent fundraising.

However, the presale fell short of its target, and the team eventually processed refunds for all bidders.

South Korea's largest crypto exchange is officially getting acquired—pending regulator approval—by one of the country's top tech giants.

Naver Financial agreed Wednesday to absorb Dunamu, operator of crypto exchange Upbit, in an all-stock deal valued at $10.29 billion. According to a related filing, the deal will see Naver issue 2.54 new shares for every share in Dunamu, as the company is absorbed.

That deal would see Dunamu's leadership become the largest shareholders in parent company Naver Financial, despite the crypto company being absorbed as a wholly owned subsidiary.

Both companies will continue to operate their existing businesses under the merger, according to Wednesday's filing. 

“In addition, they will review various restructuring plans to secure future growth engines through functional and organic cooperation between the two companies,” the outlined agreement said.

The deal, which has been hotly anticipated for months, would combine South Korea's largest crypto exchange with the nation's leading payments platform, in a moment when the digital assets economy and traditional finance are beginning to merge on the global stage.

Stablecoin-related plans are reportedly at center of the Dunamu-Naver merger, given both companies have ambitions in the exploding sector.

After the United States passed a landmark stablecoin bill in July legalizing the asset class, other nations have raced to embrace the currency-pegged digital tokens, which serve as a key connector between traditional economies and the crypto market.

In July, Dunamu revealed plans for a won-backed stablecoin issued by Naver. The company has also developed a layer-2 Ethereum network specifically designed for facilitating stablecoin transactions and retail payments.

The deal between both companies now must be approved by South Korean regulators, namely the country's Fair Trade Commission.

Mars Has Lightning, Scientists Prove

The presence of electrical activity has implications for surface chemistry, future human exploration and habitability on the Red Planet

Lightning on Mars likely arises from electrical charge built up by dust devils, scientists say.

For years scientists have suspected that Mars has lightning and electrical activity. A study now confirms it: particles in the dusty Martian atmosphere rub against one another, building up electrical charge that discharges in the form of lightning. Aside from Earth, lightning and electric activity were only known to occur on Saturn and Jupiter.

On Earth, wind-blown dust and sand particles can become electrified because of a process called triboelectrification, or the transfer of charge between two objects when they rub against each other, a result of friction. Mars's atmosphere has dust and sand and is prone to dust devils and dust storms. Some dust storms range over thousands of kilometers, making the likelihood of electrification high.

The research team analyzed 28 hours of microphone recordings captured by NASA's Perseverance rover over two Martian years, picking up electromagnetic signatures and acoustic signals typical of electrical activity, according to the study, which was published in Nature on November 26.

The scientists identified 55 electrical events, all but one of which occurred during periods when winds were in the top 30 percent over the two years. This pattern indicates that wind plays a crucial role in initiating electrical charge on Mars. Dust devil activity, the researchers say, is highly variable on the planet. The Perseverance readings were taken in the Jezero Crater, but other regions on Mars may get 20 times more dust devils.

This is the first time there has been convincing evidence that electrical activity on Mars is actually occurring, says Francis Nimmo, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who wasn't involved in the study. “Now there will be renewed interest in looking for it with other instruments, either orbiting spacecraft or radio telescopes on Earth,” Nimmo says.

The presence of electrical activity on Mars has implications for surface chemistry, future human exploration and habitability. For instance, it could affect dust dynamics and create an electrochemically reactive environment, enhancing oxidizing conditions that would affect the preservation of organic molecules and pose risks to equipment.

For example, Nimmo says, “lightning can create unusual chemicals, such as chlorine, which can react strongly with the surface soil on Mars.”

The researchers also reproduced the characteristic features of triboelectric discharges in a lab setup and observed them with a ground-based replica of Perseverance's SuperCam camera. “[This] is a good indication that their conclusions are robust,” Nimmo says.

In the future, dedicated instruments and improved atmospheric models could be deployed to further study and quantify electrical phenomena and their chemical consequences on Mars, the scientists say.

How Wild Turkeys Made a Comeback from Near Extinction

Wild turkeys once nearly disappeared, but today they're thriving.

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman.

For millions of Americans, Thanksgiving is simply not Thanksgiving without turkey. The bird is native to North America. And yet by the middle of last century, the most likely place to find one was on the dinner table.

A combination of deforestation, agricultural expansion and overhunting almost brought America's favorite gobblers to the brink of extinction in the wild. But these days, across the U.S., there are more than six million wild turkeys, up from a low in the 1930s that some observers estimated to be as few as roughly 30,000 birds.

Here to tell us more about the species conservation success story is Michael Chamberlain, National Wild Turkey Federation Distinguished Professor at the University of Georgia.

Thanks for taking the time to chat with me today, Michael.

Michael Chamberlain: Glad to talk to you.

Pierre-Louis: So I think when people think about charismatic critters, they think of bears or coyotes or wolves, and if they think about birds at all, they might think of eagles and hawks; they probably don't necessarily think of the turkey. Why have you dedicated your career to sort of studying the humble gobbler?

Chamberlain: Yeah, so I got an opportunity in graduate school to kind of pick the research project that I was working on, and one of the options was to work with wild turkeys, and I grew up, as a young person, hunting turkeys in the fall. And so I was really interested in them from that standpoint, but then, when I started doing field research involving turkeys, I became really fascinated with their behavior and how they function as a bird, and the rest is history—I've been studying turkeys ever since.

Pierre-Louis: You said you got really fascinated by their behavior. What are some of the fascinating things that they do that, you know, maybe most people don't know about or don't even really think about?

Chamberlain: Turkeys have a really complex social system. So when you see a group of turkeys—let's say there are 10 ...

Pierre-Louis: Mm-hmm.

Chamberlain: There's a very structured order to those 10 birds: there's a dominant bird, and then there's a No. 2 bird and a No. 3 bird and a No. 4 bird, and so on and so forth. So those are called dominance hierarchies. And that group of birds, their entire lives are dictated by that dominance structure.

And so that's why you constantly see turkeys kind of bickering with each other, they're chasing one another: because they're constantly testing those dominance hierarchies. And I think a lot of people don't realize how structured a turkey's life is, from—literally, from the day they hatch. They're constantly trying to one up each other and become the dominant bird.

Pierre-Louis: Are there perks to being the dominant bird?

Chamberlain: For sure. There's preferred access to foraging resources, so the dominant birds are going to—are going to, basically, push off subordinate birds and access food. The dominant birds are going to breed first and more often. So if you're a male and you're dominant, you're going to breed with more females than a subordinate bird.

And if you're a female, you're going to reproduce first, you're going to nest first because you're the dominant bird, and there's perks to that because the early bird gets the worm, so to speak. In the turkey world, if you produce a nest early, you're much more likely to be successful. And if you are successful, your poults, which are the young turkeys that hatch, they're much more likely to survive if they're hatched earlier.

So there are definitely perks to being dominant.

Pierre-Louis: So I used to live in the Boston area for a while, and in that area wild turkeys are kind of famously menaces, you know? You see them, like, on the street [Laughs] ...

Chamberlain: [Laughs.] Yeah.

Pierre-Louis: Attacking the city bus, holding up traffic. But there was a time when turkeys, despite being from North America, weren't quite so ubiquitous. Can you talk a little bit about the bird's decline and then their resurgence?

Chamberlain: So basically, turkeys have gone through this kind of full-circle recovery, if you will. So as the U.S. continent was settled, colonization occurred, turkey populations were really decimated by overharvest—in many ways, for subsistence, right? I mean, humans were trying to put food on the table. And at the same time we were clear-cutting a lot of the eastern forest of North America as colonization was occurring. And so you saw turkey populations really plummet until around the 1950s and '60s.

At that point you saw a shift where conservationists, wildlife agencies, nonprofits, they started focusing attention on restoring wild turkeys to their former, you know, range, and so what you saw was the trap and transfer of wild birds. Basically, people like me went into remaining populations of turkeys, we used nets to capture those wild birds, and then we translocated them to places where they had been extirpated, and turkey populations exploded in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s.

And now what you've kind of seen is a lot of populations, particularly in the Southeast and the Midwest, have declined over the last few decades, and, and there's a lot of reasons for that, and those reasons are quite complex, which is why I have a job.

They include everything from habitat loss to habitat degradation and fragmentation. We know there are disease issues with turkeys that are very complex. Predator populations, things that eat turkeys and their eggs, appear to be at apex levels now. Predators like coyotes and bobcats and raccoons, birds of prey, that were persecuted many decades ago, those populations have flourished now.

And so the factors that are influencing turkey populations are very different now than they were 40 or 50 years ago, and we've seen predictable declines because of that.

Pierre-Louis: I was reading something where—I think it was Massachusetts, in the 1950s, said that the bird was functionally extinct in the state at that point ...

Chamberlain: Uh-huh. That's right.

Pierre-Louis: And, and it's not anymore—you know, I can tell you. [Laughs.]

Chamberlain: Right, right.

Pierre-Louis: I think the town of Brookline in Massachusetts has made the turkey its unofficial, like, mascot; they sell turkey merch. As we go into the Thanksgiving season, as people are thinking about turkeys maybe more than they normally do throughout the rest of the year, is there hope for the turkey—or, like, like, where are we compared to where we were, say, in the '50s and, and the '40s?

Chamberlain: So what you're speaking to is—really just drives home how complex the issues facing turkeys are. Because you can literally go to places where, to your point, five or six decades ago, there were no turkeys, and now they are not only abundant; in some cases they're overabundant and creating problems for—you know, because of human-wildlife conflict.

And you can go to parts of the western U.S., where turkeys never occurred historically, and they're now thriving. Yet you can come back to parts of the turkey's—kind of the heart of their geographic range, which would be the Southeast and the Eastern U.S., and you see populations that have declined precipitously over the past few decades.

And so yes, that just kind of speaks to the complexity of how these populations are functioning, because you can literally go to suburban and urban areas now [Laughs] and find turkeys that are a real pain, you know, at times to deal with, and then you can go four or five counties away and find a completely different scenario at—you know, that's functioning on the landscape.

And that creates real challenges for management agencies because, even in a state as small as Massachusetts, you could have overabundant, problematic turkeys in, say, in the eastern part of the state, and then when you go to the western part of the state, where you're in rural areas, you see a completely different situation unfold. And that creates challenges.

Pierre-Louis: I'm based in New York City, and we're not yet at a point where we have turkeys in Midtown, but we do have turkeys in Staten Island, which I was surprised to learn [Laughs]; I don't spend a lot of time in Staten Island. I'm surprised that turkey—I mean, they're big birds. I'm actually surprised that they can function in cities and urban areas.

Chamberlain: They are incredibly adaptable as a species. And if you think about it from a turkey's perspective, I mean, really, they are wired to reproduce and survive, right, and so—to survive as long as they have a suitable place to sleep at night, because they typically roost above the ground at night. They do that because their night vision is quite poor and they want to avoid predators, so they sleep off the ground.

So as long as they can sleep off the ground, find adequate food and avoid predators, they can make it in a lot of different situations. And so if you think about a suburb or even a city, predators are functionally absent, right—except for human predators, and if they're not being hunted, and they can meet their resource requirements, they can sleep somewhere safe, and they can eat, they can do really well. And that's what you see in a lot of suburban and urban areas: turkeys are thriving—which is, to your point, is really interesting because they are, for a bird, they're quite large.

Pierre-Louis: As a hunter can you talk a little bit about how hunting factors into conservation, how we—hunters factor into even tracking turkey populations?

Chamberlain: Yes, hunters, at the core, are a primary driver of turkey conservation and have been since restoration started in the 1940s, '50s, '60s and beyond. The resources that hunters put into purchasing licenses, buying equipment to pursue turkeys and other species, those funds largely drive state agencies and the resources that can be put back into land-management and conservation efforts, so hunters are driving conservation efforts at the state level.

And I know people that would listen to this would potentially look at me and go, “Wait a minute, you study turkeys.” I've literally studied turkeys my entire career. I'm fascinated by them, and I've poured myself—everything I have into studying their behavior and trying to ensure that they're sustainable. “Well, how in the world could you possibly kill one?” Right? “How could you then go hunt that same bird and take its life?” And that is a paradox that is difficult for some people to understand.

But I believe, from my perspective, it offers me multiple lenses to see this bird through. I see this bird as a scientist and an academic, and I see this bird as an animal that I pursue, often—typically not successfully, but ...

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Chamberlain: They win more often than not. But that offers me multiple lenses that I would not otherwise have just as an academic or just as a hunter, and for that I feel blessed, and I'm appreciative.

Pierre-Louis: What about the populations in suburban areas, where, for obvious reasons, there generally isn't a lot of hunting going on?

Chamberlain: Yeah, and that—and this may sound coy and kind of off the cuff, but the problems that turkeys create in urban areas would largely go away if they were being hunted. For instance, if you come to where I live in Georgia, you will not find a turkey attacking a mailperson; you just will not find that. You will not find a turkey that is sitting on top of someone's car. They're doing that because there's no risk involved with their behavior. And if you do that in my area, you're probably not going to live, right?

And so there's a trade-off there, which creates, again, problems for agencies because you have these large kind of suburban and urban areas where hunting is either not legal or it's frowned upon or even not even practical—you know, you have situations where, perhaps, hunting is legal, but it's just not safe, it's not practical in particular suburban areas. And so the turkey essentially lives a risk-free life. And when they do that, that's when they start behaving badly [Laughs], if you will ...

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Chamberlain: Doing things that turkey in a rural area would not do.

Pierre-Louis: You know, given that it's Thanksgiving right around the corner, is there anything that you wanna say about the turkey that maybe people don't know about, that really kind of ties into the idea of the turkey and this big harvest festival that we do every year?

Chamberlain: If you have any interest in wild turkeys, right—not the store-bought thing that you eat at Thanksgiving, but if you have any interest in the wild bird, whether it's you see it occasionally, you interact with it—try to think about it more than just around Thanksgiving.

That's part of my objective as a scientist, and as active as I am on social media and all of the platforms that I use to advocate for science around the wild turkey, that's part of what I'm trying to accomplish. I'm trying to get people to think about the bird more than just at Thanksgiving. Because, to your point, that's when most people start logically thinking about turkey because that's the day—which is odd: that's the one day we eat turkey [Laughs], you know?

I would just say, you know, try to encourage yourself to think about the turkey more than just at Thanksgiving. And if you do, then—particularly, maybe, what science is being conducted on the turkey—you can go to WildTurkeyLab.com. That's a website that I maintain. It's a clearinghouse of information about wild turkeys. And I think you'll find a much greater appreciation for the wild turkey and the places that it calls home.

Pierre-Louis: Thank you so much for your time. This has been great.

Chamberlain: Absolutely. It was good talking to you.

Pierre-Louis: That's all for today's episode. We're taking Friday and Monday off from posting new episodes, but we'll be back in one week.

Stanford Medicine scientists report that giving mice both blood-forming stem cells and pancreatic islet cells from an immunologically mismatched donor either completely prevented or fully reversed Type 1 diabetes. In this disease, the body's own immune defenses mistakenly attack and destroy the insulin-producing islet cells in the pancreas.

None of the animals developed graft-versus-host disease, a condition in which the immune system arising from the donated blood stem cells attacks healthy tissue in the recipient, and the destruction of islet cells by the animals' original immune system came to a stop. After receiving the transplants, the mice no longer needed immune suppressive drugs or insulin at any point during the six-month study.

""The possibility of translating these findings into humans is very exciting,"" said Seung K. Kim, MD, PhD, the KM Mulberry Professor and a professor of developmental biology, gerontology, endocrinology and metabolism. ""The key steps in our study -- which result in animals with a hybrid immune system containing cells from both the donor and the recipient -- are already being used in the clinic for other conditions. We believe this approach will be transformative for people with Type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune diseases, as well as for those who need solid organ transplants.""

Kim, who directs the Stanford Diabetes Research Center and the Northern California Breakthrough T1D Center of Excellence, is the senior author of the study, which published online Nov. 18 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. Graduate and medical student Preksha Bhagchandani is the lead author of the research.

Building on earlier stem cell and islet work

The new results extend a 2022 study by Kim and his collaborators. In that earlier work, the researchers first triggered diabetes in mice by using toxins to destroy the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. They then used a gentle pre-transplant preparation involving immune-targeting antibodies and low-dose radiation, followed by a transplant of blood stem cells and islet cells from an unrelated donor, to restore blood sugar control.

In the latest study, the team set out to solve a more difficult challenge: preventing or curing diabetes driven by autoimmunity, where the immune system spontaneously targets and kills the body's own islet cells. In people, this form of the disease is known as Type 1 diabetes. Unlike the induced-diabetes model, where the main goal was to stop the recipient's immune system from rejecting donor islet cells, the new model involved transplanted islets that faced two problems at once. They were recognized as foreign tissue and were also targeted by an immune system already primed to attack islet cells from any source.

""Just like in human Type 1 diabetes, the diabetes that occurs in these mice results from an immune system that spontaneously attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in pancreatic islets,"" Kim said. ""We need to not only replace the islets that have been lost but also reset the recipient's immune system to prevent ongoing islet cell destruction. Creating a hybrid immune system accomplishes both goals.""

Unfortunately, the same biological traits that cause autoimmune diabetes in these mice also make them harder to prepare safely for a blood stem cell transplant.

Simple drug tweak enables full diabetes protection

The team found a relatively straightforward way around this problem. Bhagchandani and Stephan Ramos, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow and co-author of the study, added a medication commonly used to treat autoimmune diseases to the pre-transplant regimen that had been identified in 2022. With this adjusted protocol, followed by blood stem cell transplantation, the mice developed a hybrid immune system made up of cells from both donor and recipient and did not go on to develop Type 1 diabetes in 19 out of 19 cases. In a separate group of animals with long-standing Type 1 diabetes, nine out of nine were cured after receiving the combined blood stem cell and islet cell transplant.

Because the antibodies, drugs and low-dose radiation used in the mice are already part of standard clinical practice for blood stem cell transplantation, the researchers see moving this strategy toward trials in people with Type 1 diabetes as a realistic next step.

From kidney tolerance to hybrid immunity for diabetes

This new work builds on research led by the late Samuel Strober, MD, PhD, a professor of immunology and rheumatology, and his colleagues, including study co-author and professor of medicine Judith Shizuru, MD, PhD. Strober, Shizuru and other Stanford investigators had shown that a bone marrow transplant from a partially immunologically matched human donor could create a hybrid immune system in the recipient and allow long-term acceptance of a kidney transplant from the same donor. In some patients, they found that kidney function from the transplanted organ remained stable for decades without the need for ongoing drugs to prevent rejection.

Blood stem cell transplants are already used to treat cancers of the blood and immune system, including leukemia and lymphoma. However, in cancer care these procedures typically require high doses of chemotherapy and radiation to eliminate the original blood and immune system, which often causes serious side effects. Shizuru and colleagues have designed a safer, less intense way to prepare people with non-cancerous conditions such as Type 1 diabetes for donor blood stem cell transplantation, reducing bone marrow activity just enough to let donor blood stem cells settle in and grow.

""Based on many years of basic research by us and others, we know that blood stem cell transplants could also be beneficial for a wide range of autoimmune diseases,"" Shizuru said. ""The challenge has been to devise a more benign pre-treatment process, diminishing risk to the point that patients suffering from an autoimmune deficiency that may not be immediately life-threatening would feel comfortable undergoing the treatment.""

""Now we know that the donated blood stem cells re-educate the recipient animal's immune system to not only accept the donated islets, but also not attack its healthy tissues, including islets,"" Kim said. ""In turn, the donated blood stem cells and the immune system they produce learn to not attack the recipient's tissues, and graft-versus-host disease can be avoided.""

Future hurdles for Type 1 diabetes treatment

Although the mouse results are encouraging, significant obstacles remain before this strategy could be widely used to treat Type 1 diabetes. Pancreatic islets can currently be obtained only from deceased donors, and the blood stem cells need to come from the same individual as the islets. It is also uncertain whether the number of islet cells typically recovered from a single donor would always be sufficient to reverse established Type 1 diabetes.

The scientists are exploring ways to overcome these limitations. Possible solutions include producing large amounts of islet cells in the laboratory from pluripotent human stem cells or developing methods that help transplanted donor islets survive longer and function more efficiently after transplantation.

Beyond diabetes, Kim, Shizuru and their collaborators believe that the gentle pre-conditioning strategy they have developed could open the door to stem cell transplants for other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus and for non-cancerous blood disorders like sickle cell anemia (for which current blood stem cell transplant methods remain harsh), as well as for transplants involving mismatched solid organs.

""The ability to reset the immune system safely to permit durable organ replacement could rapidly lead to great medical advances,"" Kim said.

The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants T32 GM736543, R01 DK107507, R01 DK108817, U01 DK123743, P30 DK116074 and LAUNCH 1TL1DK139565-0), the Breakthrough T1D Northern California Center of Excellence, Stanford Bio-X, the Reid Family, the H.L.

Engineered immune cells are being used to successfully treat people with a range of debilitating autoimmune conditions, such as ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Researchers say positive results from around a dozen studies over the past three years suggest CAR-T-cell therapy could eventually be used to treat any disease in which the immune system attacks the body.

CAR-T-cell therapy exploits the immune system's T cells that fight off infection: these cells are collected from a person and tweaked to produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors. They are then reintroduced into the body to target antigens expressed by B cells, another type of immune cell. In autoimmune disorders, these B cells make antibodies that attack the body's own healthy tissues.

The use of the therapy for immune conditions has exploded since 2021, when a 20-year-old woman in Germany with severe lupus became the first person with an autoimmune disorder to be treated with CAR T cells1. Clinician–researcher David Simon, who was involved in that treatment2, says the CAR-T therapies have since entered phase I and II clinical trials for autoimmune conditions including systemic sclerosis, myositis and rheumatoid arthritis. Phase III trials are also under way for lupus and myasthenia gravis, a condition that causes weakness in the muscles that are used to breathe, swallow and see.

Simon, who focuses on rheumatoid arthritis at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin, says people in CAR-T-cell therapy trials for rheumatoid arthritis and lupus seem to be ‘cured'. “They lose their autoantibodies which trigger the disease, and they don't have any symptoms any more,” he adds. “This is something totally new which we didn't observe before.”

CAR-T-cell therapy has become a routine treatment for several types of cancer since it was first approved to treat blood cancers in 2017.

Ulcerative colitis, a condition that affects the colon and causes stomach pain, ulcers and bloody diarrhoea, is one of the latest diseases in which CAR-T-cell therapy has shown promise.

In September, gastroenterologist Markus Neurath and his colleagues at the University Hospital Erlangen in Germany, reported using CAR T cells to treat a 21-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis3. After the treatment, she showed signs of remission that persisted for 14 weeks, no longer needed medication and could return to work. “The result was quite amazing,” adds Neurath. His team plans to test the treatment in a few more people before proceeding to a controlled clinical trial involving many individuals.

Earlier this year, Bing Du, an immunologist at East China Normal University in Shanghai, and his team published the results of a CAR-T pilot study using immune cells from a donor to treat drug-resistant lupus4. Donor-derived cells could act like a generic version of CAR-T treatment that could be mass-produced, cutting manufacturing time and lowering costs5. Last year, Du was also involved in a world-first study of bioengineered and modified immune cells from a donor for the treatment of two rare and severe autoimmune diseases6.

As part of the latest study, four women with a form of lupus that affects multiple organs received chemotherapy to reduce levels of their white blood cells, followed by an infusion of donor-derived CAR T cells. After three months, the women no longer experienced symptoms such as arthritis, swelling of blood vessels and alopecia, and one was in remission and no longer needed any medication. The other three women received low-dose steroids as a maintenance therapy.

The results of the trial were “much better than we could imagine”, says Du, and might be due to CAR T cells triggering the total depletion of dysfunctional B cells that attack the body's tissues. “The immune system had to reset not only B cells, but also the rest of the immune system,” he adds, potentially allowing new, healthy B cells to replace the dysfunctional cells.

The University of Washington is powering up its vision for a brighter, more sustainable future with a newly completed solar canopy installed in a sprawling parking lot north of Husky Stadium.

The 84-kilowatt solar array is paired with Level 2 EV charging that can accommodate 20 vehicles simultaneously. The $3.7 million project includes electrical infrastructure to support the future installation of panels capable of nearly 30 times more power generation — up to 2.5 megawatts. That's enough capacity to power roughly 2,000 homes.

The solar canopy is a pilot project supporting the UW's goals to cut its carbon footprint, said Mark Huppert, interim director of UW Transportation Services. 

“Located on the site of the former Montlake landfill, the pilot demonstrates how the land can be put to work to achieve more sustainable outcomes,” Huppert said via email.

Trinity Energy, a Seattle-area clean energy company, partnered with the university on the project. 

“Generating solar power from a parking lot may sound modest, but the strategic value is enormous,” said Darin Leonard, president of Trinity Energy, in a statement.

The installation is connected to electrical grids powering the City of Seattle and the UW's campus. The ability to generate energy onsite can curb the university's reliance on the utility grid while reducing the impacts of power outages and fluctuating electricity costs, Trinity noted.

The idea for the project grew out of a collaboration between the student organization UW Solar; Anne Eskridge, the retired director of UW Transportation Services; and Jan Whittington, director of the UW's Urban Infrastructure Lab. 

The university is currently drafting its 2050 Sustainability Action Plan, which includes the long-term expansion of the parking lot solar canopies. 

The UW Solar students “will continue to support the efforts to achieve the vision of a complete build-out,” Huppert said.  

The project was funded by UW Transportation Services, Seattle City Light and Washington state's Climate Commitment Act, administered through the Washington State Department of Commerce's electric vehicle charging program.

Artificial intelligence startup xAI, founded by Elon Musk, told city and county planners in Memphis last week that it plans to build a solar farm next to its Colossus data center — one of the world's largest facilities for training AI models.

The project would occupy 88 acres to the west and to the south of the data center. A 136-acre vacant lot owned by the developer that also owns the Colossus property currently borders the site. Given the proposed size, the solar farm would likely produce around 30 megawatts of electricity, only about 10% of the data center's estimated power use.

Musk's company has come under fire for operating over 400 megawatts of natural gas turbines without permits, according to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC). The legal organization, which is working with the NAACP, says that xAI has operated at least 35 turbines capable of emitting more than 2,000 tons of NOX pollution — nitrogen oxide emissions that contribute to smog and respiratory problems — annually.

The turbines have sparked fierce opposition from residents in nearby Boxtown, a predominantly Black community where researchers at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, found that peak nitrogen dioxide concentration levels increased by 79% in areas immediately surrounding the data center after xAI began operations. Community activists have reported increased asthma attacks and respiratory issues since the facility opened.

The AI company has said that it intends to use the turbines until it can secure additional power, but local officials gave xAI a permit to operate 15 turbines through January 2027.

In September, xAI said it would build a 100-megawatt solar farm nearby, which will be paired with 100 megawatts of grid-scale batteries to provide a 24/7 source of electricity.

The company hasn't disclosed the total cost of that project, but the solar farm's developer, Seven States Power Corporation, was awarded $439 million from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of that, $414 million is an interest-free loan.

The federal award is notable given that many clean energy grants and loans have been canceled by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy under the Trump administration. 

Meanwhile, xAI has added gas turbines in Mississippi to power its Colossus 2 data center. So far, 59 of them are on-site, and the company considers 18 of them temporary, meaning that regulators don't track their pollution.

The always-a-good-time Slush conference took place last week in Helsinki and, as always, it was a showcase of the growing power of the European ecosystem.

The Nordics, specifically, are having a moment, led this time around by Sweden's vibe-coding darling Lovable, often regarded as an example of the ecosystem's growing success. Other standout, albeit older names, include Klarna and Spotify.

On this week's Equity, we sat down with Dennis Green-Lieber, the founder of the AI company Propane, to talk about the booming success of the Nordic ecosystem. Green-Lieber is based in Denmark and has been building in the ecosystem for the past 15 years.

He chalked up the success of the ecosystem to a few things, including the region's social safety that lets young people take risks without fear of losing everything.  

“The newer founders, new generations, are being way more bullish and taking ownership,” he told Equity. “I have not seen, in my 15 years, anything [like] what's going on right now.”

It's becoming a hub for deep tech and AI, as one report put it, and is now valued at half a trillion dollars, with Nordic startups receiving a little more than $8 billion in venture investments in 2024. The government also plays a part in these companies, providing funding to startups, like Green-Lieber's, to help founders grow their companies.

In some ways, Green-Lieber agrees with others that the ecosystem is a few years behind — but, at the same time, “we're moving tremendously a lot faster,” he said.

We couldn't leave the conversation without talking about AI a little. When asked if we were in a bubble, Green-Lieber said he didn't know. “There's tons of opportunities which haven't been explored,” he said, adding that it's true that some people are just putting money in bad stuff, but “that's just the risk of venture capital.”

The software team at General Motors has now lost three top executives in the past month as the automaker — with its new chief product officer at the helm — combines its disparate technology businesses into one organization.

Baris Cetinok, senior vice president of software and services product management, is leaving the company effective December 12, the company confirmed to TechCrunch. CNBC was the first to report the departure.

Dave Richardson, senior vice president of software and services engineering, and Barak Turovsky, who was hired in March as head of AI at the automaker, have also left in the past month. Cetinok and Richardson joined GM in 2023. All three had deep tech experience, with stints at a variety of tech companies including Apple and Google.

The departures come several months after GM hired Sterling Anderson to a newly created chief product officer position. Anderson's role puts him in direct contact, and management, of nearly every vehicle development-related department at GM.

Anderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry who reports to GM President Mark Reuss, leads the vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. The aim of the position is to oversee the entire lifecycle of GM's portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. 

The departures are part of a restructuring within GM that's supposed to remove silos within the business and better integrate how software is developed and deployed in the company's cars, trucks, and SUVs. Instead of separate teams, each with overlapping roles, the plan is to integrate hardware and software engineering, AI capabilities, and global product into one organization, according to a series of statements covering each executive's departure. 

As Anderson reshapes the organization, he is also bringing in new talent. Cristian Mori, who has been at Symbiotic, Rivian, and Boston Dynamics over the past five years, has been hired into a new role to head up robotics. While GM has a team of manufacturing engineers that develops automation and robotics, there has never been a specific chief robotics role, which will fall under Anderson's organization.

GM hired Behrad Toghi, who previously worked at Apple, in October as AI lead. The company also hired Rashed Haq as its vice president of autonomous vehicles. Haq spent five years at Cruise, the self-driving vehicle company acquired and later shuttered by GM, as its head of AI and robotics.

Clinical trials are designed to treat a very specific subclass of individuals; pharmaceutical companies very carefully choose that subclass in an attempt to help ensure the clinical trials are successful, which is a combination of the following:- Positive, statistically-significant results.
- FDA approval with those results.
- Insurance companies willing to pay for the given treatment.
- A decent-sized addressable market.Examples of drugs/medical technologies later getting other indications: 
- Minoxidil was a drug that only later got its approval to be used as a hair loss treatment; there are currently clinical trials for a more ""advanced"" minoxidil oral pill for this use case. 
- Re: GLP-1s: Tirzepatide later got an indication that it effectively treats sleep apnea. There are very many other clinical trials ongoing for GLP-1s, but perhaps most recently, Semaglutide (ozempic) failed to show statistical significance as a treatment for Alzheimer's.
- The Galleri blood screening/test. The initial indication they are going for is folk who are at highest risk for cancer (I believe that's individuals between the ages of 50 and 70); however, that's not to say it would be bad for individuals younger or older. But, this is a way to help ensure the earliest product has a successful outcome.These are ones I know off the top of my head, but I suspect an LLM can give several more examples.

- Re: GLP-1s: Tirzepatide later got an indication that it effectively treats sleep apnea. There are very many other clinical trials ongoing for GLP-1s, but perhaps most recently, Semaglutide (ozempic) failed to show statistical significance as a treatment for Alzheimer's.

Nobody knows what migraine really is, so this isn't a surprise to them that GLP-1 may help, the main question is; why? So they have another data point proving that gut health has a direct correlation to the brain.Keep in mind that a lot of the benefits go away once patients come off GLP-1 and we have not seen any studies yet on what happens to people who come off it for long term effects. It may in fact make things even worse and for a lot of people, they may have to stay on it for the rest of their lives.

Beyond what others have commented already, especially on obesity and cardiovascular disease, I have to correct this specifically, because it is a very common and honestly understandable misunderstanding people have about these drugs.While only having appeared in the public consciousness comparatively recently, this class of drugs has been in use for two decades at this stage [0], showcasing a very solid safety profile with well established side-effects [1].Continued research is important, as is proper prescription and use under the care of a Medical Professional up-to-date on current day evidence based practices (as is the case with all interventions), but to have a proper discussion about these, we shouldn't spread myths such as this being ""quickly pushed"" out, as these have undergone the clinical trials and regulations established across multiple agencies from multiple governments [2].Again, it is understandable why these are considered rather new or appeared suddenly, especially if one doesn't take a look into their approval, but I don't see any evidence for them being rushed out or anything of the sort.[0] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK572151/[1] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5397288/[2] https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6667915/

Another example: low dose metformin is largely considered beneficial for most people, at least in a small way. But very few people who aren't diabetic take it, as the drawback of possible side effects outweighs the potential benefit for someone who doesn't have symptoms in the first place.Same thing here. Would it benefit you? Possibly. Do the risks of side effects outweigh that benefit for someone without symptoms? Also possibly.

The overwhelming benefits from GLP-1 are courtesy of weight loss and better blood sugar control. Get those two things under control, with or without GLP-1 drugs, and an enormous array of complications are made less likely.For people with healthy, ideal diets at an optimal weight and with good blood sugar control, there are only remote, hypothetical benefits. There is some evidence it reduces inflammation and might ward off neurodegenerative disorders, but those likely have more of a relationship with blood sugar spikes, and again lifestyle changes are more impactful.

  “We think that, by modulating cerebrospinal fluid pressure and reducing intracranial venous sinuses compression, these drugs produce a decrease in the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a key migraine-promoting peptide”, Dr Braca explained. “That would pose intracranial pressure control as a brand-new, pharmacologically targetable pathway.”

I'm not sure I understand what that means, but I wonder if this would work for people who are not obese?

What has helped, interestingly, is supplemented creatine HCl (she went with hcl because it's absorbed substantially faster than monohydrate). We've learned that depletion of neural ATP levels can result in an energy crisis which results in cortical spreading depression, which stimulates the release of CGRP. (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/spreading-...)She's found that a) daily supplementation of creatine has reduced her headache days, and b) an immediate dose of creatine upon onset of a headache frequently aborts or mitigates it. Her need for the gepants has dropped to a tiny fraction of what it was prior to starting creatine.She's tried everything under the sun, had all the scans, tried all the meds and procedures, and creatine and gepants are the only things she's found that have worked. She's not a placebo responder, and hasn't responded to about a zillion other therapies, so we're pretty sure it's not just placebo effect.

I started medication to treat the BP -- telmisartan and amlodipine -- and my BP dropped from 150+/120+ to 115/80. The migraines completely disappeared. I still infrequently get the visual aura that would traditionally precede a migraine, but nothing follows. I haven't had a migraine in the years I've had my BP under control.

The risks for serious physical illness, psychiatric conditions, and premature death are sharply elevated in people with eating disorders long after their initial diagnosis, a new study showed.

Risks for renal or liver failure, fractures, diabetes, heart failure, and death are highest within the first 12 months but persist for 5-10 years after diagnosis. Investigators said the findings point to the need for earlier detection, long-term follow-up, and an interdisciplinary approach to patient care.

“Eating disorders affect every major body system,” lead author Catharine Morgan, PhD, with The University of Manchester, Manchester, England, told Medscape Medical News. “Malnutrition, rapid weight change, and purging can cause long-term damage to the heart, kidneys, liver, and bones. At the same time, many people have underlying vulnerabilities — such as depression, anxiety, or difficulties coping with stress — that persist even after eating improves.”

The study was published online on November 18 in BMJ Medicine.

Eating disorders affect about 30 million people in the US — roughly 9% of the overall population — and have the second-highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness.

Despite an increase in global prevalence, investigators said eating disorders are widely understudied, and data on long-term effects is especially lacking.

Morgan and colleagues evaluated the short- and longer-term risks associated with eating disorders. They matched 24,709 people who received a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or other eating disorder between 1998 and 2018 with up to 20 control individuals without an eating disorder (n = 493,001).

Most (89%) participants in each group were women and two thirds were aged 10-24 years. Among those with eating disorders, about 15% had anorexia, 21% had bulimia, 5% had a binge eating disorder, and 60% had an unspecified eating disorder.

Median follow-up was 4 years, with more than 10 years of follow-up for 20% of all participants.

Within the first year after diagnosis, people with an eating disorder were six times more likely to develop renal failure and nearly seven times more likely to develop liver disease. These risks remained twofold to threefold higher after 5 years.

People with an eating disorder were also six times more likely to develop osteoporosis, twice as likely to suffer heart failure, and three times more likely to develop diabetes.

An eating disorder diagnosis also took a toll on mental health, with patients seven times more likely to have depression and more than nine times as likely to engage in self-harm in the first year following diagnosis. These risks persisted at 5 years, although at a lower level.

The risk for suicide was nearly 14 times higher in the first year after diagnosis and remained nearly threefold higher at 10 years.

The risk for premature death was also elevated in those with an eating disorder. In the first year, the risk for dying from any cause was more than fourfold higher than control individuals and was fivefold higher for unnatural deaths. After 5 years, these risks were still two and three times higher, respectively.

It's “essential” to raise awareness among healthcare providers about the lasting effects of eating disorders and the need for ongoing support, the authors wrote.

“Health services potentially need to treat eating disorders as long-term conditions,” Morgan told Medscape Medical News.

“That means regular physical health checks (heart, kidneys, liver, bone health, blood tests) for years after diagnosis; ongoing mental health monitoring, including screening for depression and self-harm; clear shared-care plans between GPs [general practitioner] and specialist services so nobody falls through gaps; potential rapid re-referral pathways if symptoms return; and extra support during high-risk periods, such as the first year after diagnosis and transitions between services,” Morgan said.

Despite the high prevalence of eating disorders, their consequences are “underrecognized,” Jennifer Couturier, MD, and Ethan Nella, MSc, with McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, pointed out in a linked editorial.

They noted that there has been “limited education given during medical training on the topic of eating disorders, and the current study emphasizes the importance of disseminating this knowledge to all healthcare professionals.”

“Medical education should place greater emphasis on the recognition and management of eating disorders, to equip primary care providers, specialists, and allied health professionals with the tools to identify early warning signs and monitor ongoing risks associated with eating disorders,” Couturier and Nella concluded.

This study had no commercial funding. Morgan, Couturier, and Nella had no relevant disclosures.

A history of concussion was associated with a 49% higher risk for motor vehicle crashes in adults than more benign injuries such as ankle sprains, with the risk rising to 124% after three concussions, a new population-based study showed.

“The risk of a motor vehicle crash after a concussion suggests current mitigating efforts are insufficient; however, driving cessation may be unreasonable since the risk also extends to patients as pedestrians,” the investigators of the study wrote.

“Further strategies might include temporarily reducing traffic exposure by avoiding high-speed trips during adverse late-night hours,” they added.

The study was led by Donald A. Redelmeier, MD, Sunnybrook Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on November 05 in BMJ Open.

Factors that predisposed patients to concussions may have also predisposed them to a traffic crash, preventing the establishment of causal inferences. Additionally, the study was limited by a lack of data on concussion severity, prior brain injuries during remote years, interval treatments, and traffic exposure. An at-fault analysis was also absent. Furthermore, diagnostic codes may have been inexact, and unmeasured confounding factors may have predisposed individuals to both concussions and motor vehicle crashes.

The study was supported by Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, which was funded by a grant from the Ontario Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Long-Term Care. The investigators reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) during cardiac surgery in patients with atrial fibrillation was associated with lower stroke-related disability and reduced risk for 30-day mortality and cardioembolic stroke than standard care, new research showed.

“Our findings support the recent guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association providing a strong recommendation for LAAO in patients with [atrial fibrillation] undergoing cardiac surgery, while providing a rationale for the inclusion of stroke severity as a secondary endpoint in ongoing clinical trials evaluating surgical or percutaneous LAAO for stroke prevention,” the investigators of the study wrote.

The study was led by Aristeidis H. Katsanos, MD, PhD, Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It was published online on November 17 in JAMA Neurology.

Limited information was provided in clinical and radiologic reports for stroke adjudication. The approach used to classify stroke etiologies may have oversimplified the complex mechanisms of ischemic stroke by not accounting for features of small vessel disease or large artery involvement. The study did not systematically collect and analyze data on acute treatment and secondary stroke prevention strategies. The mRS scores were only available at 7 days or discharge, potentially influenced by in-hospital management, creating uncertainties related to the impacts of long-term disability.

LAAOS III was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Canadian Stroke Prevention Intervention Network, Hamilton Health Sciences Research Institute, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, the Request for Applications Program-Research Strategic Initiatives of Hamilton Health Sciences, the Canadian Network and Centre for Trials Internationally, and McMaster University Surgical Associates. Several investigators reported having financial ties with various organizations, including pharmaceutical companies. Full details are provided in the original article.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease estimated to affect 5 million people worldwide, with a prevalence of 210 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in Spain, according to the Spanish Society of Internal Medicine. 

The cause of SLE remains unknown, and no curative treatment is available. However, structured self-care, consistent medication adherence, and healthy lifestyle habits help reduce disease activity and long-term complications.

Rheumatology specialists emphasized that “sun protection, infection prevention, smoking cessation, a Mediterranean-style diet, weight control, and both aerobic and resistance exercise support better disease stability.”

Speaking with Univadis Spain, part of the Medscape Professional Network, is Natalia Mena-Vázquez, PhD, from the UGC de Reumatología, Hospital Regional Universitario de Málaga, and Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Málaga, Málaga, Spain.

“In the joints [SLE] can cause joint pain or, in some cases, inflammation. Environmental factors may trigger disease activity but can also improve disease progression and treatment response. For all these reasons — both as potential triggers and as modifiers of disease course — an appropriate lifestyle is essential.”

She noted, “Self-care includes skin care, photoprotection, infection prevention, and regular physical activity.”

Eating a balanced diet, protecting oneself from the sun, exercising, and adhering to medical treatment are key to managing the disease. 

“Adherence to treatment and correct medication management are very important. Many patients who do poorly sometimes take medication incorrectly. That is why we monitor adherence with surveys and nursing consultations, and during medical visits, we ask extensively about treatment intake, stressing that it must be done correctly,” said Mena-Vázquez.

The prevention of infection is another important measure. “We recommend that patients keep vaccinations up to date to avoid infections. When attending crowded places where there is a risk for contagion, such as a hospital emergency department, they should wear a mask,” she said.

Daily broad-spectrum sunscreen with sun protection factor 50 is recommended. “In summer, patients should use hats and avoid the hours of strongest sunlight to prevent flares.” Smoking should be avoided because “tobacco triggers autoimmune disease and increases disease activity.”

“The Mediterranean diet has been shown to improve disease control. A varied diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and lean proteins is recommended, while limiting ultraprocessed foods, sugars, and saturated fats, and maintaining good hydration. It is also important to avoid overweight and obesity because cardiovascular risk factors and the risk for cardiovascular disease are increased in these patients,” Mena-Vázquez said.

Physical activity is a core therapeutic strategy. “Physical exercise is fundamental,” stated Mena-Vázquez. “We recommend aerobic exercise, which mainly improves cardiovascular health because patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases have an increased risk for cardiovascular disease, and resistance exercises, which improve muscle condition, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis.”

Individuals with SLE have an increased risk for fractures due to impairments in bone quality and the effects of corticosteroid use, which reduce bone mass quality and quantity over time. “These patients may sustain fractures even with normal bone density because their bone quality is impaired. Resistance exercises aim to prevent this type of damage,” Mena-Vázquez said.

The recommended activities include brisk walking, tai chi, Pilates, and swimming. “High-impact sports are generally avoided to reduce trauma and joint damage. Exercises that are individual and low in contact are preferable,” she noted.

Mena-Vázquez reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

After a failed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO), subintimal tracking and reentry (STAR) with the definitive stenting staged at either 5-7 weeks or 12-14 weeks was similarly safe and successful. Earlier staging more often found the vessel open at the start but did not change outcomes.

""These data suggest that there is no evidence of better final success with early or late repeated procedures after the STAR technique, despite greater initial patency rates with earlier interventions, and that the timing can be dictated by patient preference,"" the researchers wrote.

""The trial also highlights that in its current construct, CTO PCI may require 2 procedures to ensure an optimal outcome in terms of both safety and efficacy, with the potential to avoid higher-risk strategies during the initial procedure,"" experts wrote in an editorial comment accompanying the journal article.

This study was led by Lorenzo Azzalini, MD, PhD, of University of Washington in Seattle. It was published online on November 26, 2025, in JACC.

The partial success rate in the late group was lower than expected, which probably reduced the power of the observed difference. The timing windows of the two groups were close, which may have limited contrast. The study did not assess long-term patency of the target vessel after the staged PCI.

Individuals who practiced eye washing had significantly reduced ocular symptoms of hay fever and improved quality-of-life (QOL) associated with ocular allergies, according to a new study. The study found that those in the eye-washing group maintained milder symptoms over time with more symptom-free days.

“Our results indicate that eye washing was associated with adequate safety and potentially favorable clinical outcomes for patients with hay fever and chronic impairment of QoL, particularly during peak pollen seasons,” the researchers reported.

The study was led by Ken Nagino, of the Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine in Tokyo, Japan. It was published online on November 20, 2025, in Scientific Reports.

The study population was limited to smartphone users with hay fever in Japan. The study period focused on February to May when cedar pollen, the major allergen in Japan, peaked. This may affect result generalizability to populations allergic to different types of pollen. Participants were identified solely through self-reported hay fever status without confirmation by clinical diagnosis. Data on the frequency, duration, and type of eyewash use were not collected in this study.

Clinician scientist, Center for Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany

International research exchanges are playing an increasingly important role in medicine, giving clinicians opportunities to build new skills, collaborate across borders, and experience different scientific cultures. In this interview with Coliquio, part of the Medscape Professional Network, Julia Hafner, MD, a German clinician scientist, reflected on her research stay in Paris and what physicians should know when planning a similar move.

Currently dividing her time between University Hospital Frankfurt and the Institut Cochin in Paris, a major biomedical research center affiliated with Université Paris Cité, Hafner described how she secured the position, what daily laboratory work entailed, and the administrative and cultural adjustments that shaped her experience.

How did you come to Paris?

I came to Paris through personal contacts I made during an international congress. After a presentation, I approached the principal investigator (PI) of the Paris laboratory directly and expressed my interest in her research. We stayed in contact afterward. In parallel, I independently applied for funding through the Clinician Scientist Program of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, [DFG]). Once the funding was approved, my stay in the lab was fully financed and could be arranged with the PI. A formal application was not necessary in this case.

What administrative issues should German physicians expect when moving to France?

The review of my documents by the French research institute went smoothly. The process primarily required proof of occupational safety compliance and insurance from my employer in Germany — a mandatory prerequisite — as well as documentation showing continuous income.

What language and cultural competencies are important in day-to-day lab work?

The working language in laboratories varies greatly. Some groups operate entirely in English — as was the case in my lab — while others work almost exclusively in French.

This largely depends on the nationality of the lab leadership and the makeup of the team. It is advisable to clarify expectations in advance. Complex or unfamiliar topics in an experimental research environment can be difficult to follow in French depending on one's proficiency.

However, language skills are less critical in the lab than they would be in direct patient care. With solid basic knowledge, some on-site adjustment, and preparation for key French technical terms, most clinicians can navigate the environment well.

Were there cultural differences you found notable compared with working in Germany?

Work culture in France can vary considerably between institutions and teams. In general, it tends to be somewhat more formal and hierarchical, particularly compared with Germany or English-speaking countries.

In our group, the atmosphere was strongly shaped by the PI. Since she was originally from the US, the environment was very open, warm, and informal. However, I also encountered French labs where interactions were more reserved. This demonstrates how strongly a team's culture depends on its leadership — something that holds true anywhere in the world.

Because decisions in France are often made centrally, administrative processes can feel unfamiliar at first. But with openness, respect for established structures, and some patience with bureaucracy, you adapt quickly.

What advice would you give colleagues planning a longer-term stay in France?

Solid language preparation is helpful, even though English is widely used in research settings. In everyday life in France, English is not always well understood, so basic French knowledge is essential for many situations.

I found the proximity to Germany and excellent train connections particularly convenient. Traveling between Paris and my home in Germany was easy, especially because the TGV (train à grande vitesse, France's high-speed train) is faster and more reliable than the German rail system.

French culture places strong emphasis on separating work and personal life. Lunch breaks and vacation time are taken seriously, and even in academic environments, people make full use of their free time. Depending on the length of your stay, however, you should be aware that building friendships with locals can be challenging. In my experience, French people tend to stay within their own circles — likely also for linguistic reasons, as English is often spoken reluctantly.

What does a realistic career path for doctors in French research look like, and how compatible is this with clinical work?

Unfortunately, I can only offer limited insight on this topic, as there was only one other physician in my lab group. From her experience, combining research and clinical duties in France was considered quite challenging. In addition to holding a regular contract at a university hospital, she also had a separate contract with the Institut Pasteur (a major French research institute), which funded her research work.

However, securing protected research time from her clinical employer was not always as straightforward as I am used to in Germany, although this can vary significantly depending on hospital management.

How do you assess the compatibility of family and career?

Since I went to Paris without my partner, I can only comment to a limited extent on family-related aspects. What I can say is that France generally offers very good childcare options, which can make balancing work and family life easier.

What role do interdisciplinary networks play in Paris, and how does one connect with them?

Interdisciplinary networks are always important in research, and this is equally true in Paris. There are extensive connections between AP-HP (Assistance Publique–Hôpitaux de Paris, the large public hospital system), the universities, and the city's research institutes.

The Institut Pasteur offers programs and collaborations with Université Paris Cité and Sorbonne University. The Institut Cochin, where I worked, is affiliated with Inserm (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research), CNRS (the National Center for Scientific Research), and Université Paris Cité.

In my case, the laboratory group was associated with both the Pasteur Institute and the Cochin Institute, which facilitated collaboration and access to both networks. Physicians from abroad are most likely to build connections through placements in laboratory groups affiliated with these institutions.

What three specific dos and don'ts would you give to German colleagues planning a research stay in France?

Do:

Don't:

Hafner is a clinician scientist at the Center for Infectious Diseases of the Department of Internal Medicine II, University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, and through August 2025 at the Institut Cochin in Paris. Her research focuses on the role of the microbiome in recurrent urinary tract infections, with the goal of identifying potential nonantibiotic therapeutic and preventive strategies.

What thoughts and feelings does Thanksgiving conjure? For many Americans, family and football are right up there. That's also the case for Green Bay Packers legend Antonio Freeman, who has now added the other kind of fútbol to his list. 

That's because his son, Alex Freeman, is now a breakout defender for the U.S. men's national team. And his recent performances for the USMNT have put the 21-year-old in the mix for a roster spot in next year's World Cup. 

It was just last week that Antonio bore witness to his son's ability while watching the USMNT take on Uruguay in both teams' final match of 2025. In that game in Tampa, Florida, Alex had a highlight moment when he skated past Ronald Araujo — one of the best defenders in global soccer — and scored his second goal of the night in the 5-1 rout

The elder Freeman, a Super Bowl XXXI champion and Packers Hall of Famer, celebrated alongside other parents and a few of his former teammates from a suite at Raymond James Stadium, home of the NFL's Buccaneers. But his mind went back three days earlier, near the end of the Americans' previous win against Paraguay, when the 6-foot-3 Alex rag-dolled three Paraguayan players during a late-game scuffle.

""I'd never heard Alex ever talk about him being in a fight,"" the elder Freeman told me in a phone interview. ""Now here I am, seeing him in the middle of a flat-out brawl.""

The incident ignited something in Alex, his father said, that manifested itself against Uruguay. Whatever the reason, it was a fitting capstone to 2025 for the youngster. Having just made a handful of appearances for Orlando City prior to this season, he earned the starting right back job under coach Oscar Pareja and performed so well that he then earned a callup to Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. squad for last summer's Concacaf Gold Cup.

A breakout turn in that tournament put Freeman on course to be one of Pochettino's choices for next summer's all-important World Cup, which will be both co-hosted by the U.S. and feature an unprecedented 48 teams – the largest field than any other edition in the 96-year history of the competition.

Alex Freeman's play for the U.S. this fall now has him on course to occupy a major role at the biggest event in sports. But hardly anybody foresaw Freeman's rise from MLS prospect to the highest level in the sport in less than a year. Pareja is one of the few. 

""It does not really surprise me,"" Pareja said of Freeman's breakneck ascent. ""Alex has shown a lot of consistency since we got him here in the academy.""

Still, Pareja saw something special in Freeman almost immediately. The former Colombian international and FC Dallas academy boss has a well-earned reputation for identifying young talent. While at FCD, he helped develop eventual World Cup participants Weston McKennie, Kellyn Acosta and Jesus Ferreira. So when Jesus Perez, Pochettino's top assistant, visited Pareja at the Lions training facility last spring, he suggested the USMNT take a close look at the kid with the famous dad. 

They did. Freeman caught a break when starting right back and 2022 World Cup alum Sergiño Dest, who had recently returned from ACL surgery, was given the summer off to further rehab his knee. Pochettino turned to Freeman. He has rewarded them handsomely.

""Our job and our duty is to see the projection of the player. And for that, we need to give them a chance and to see how they perform,"" Pochettino said after the historic win over Uruguay, the first time the Americans scored five goals versus a South American foe.

""We created a platform for him to show the quality, but the credit goes to him.""

Perez credits Orlando and its staff, too. Pareja, in turn, praised Freeman's academy coaches and those with Orlando's development team. And then there are the younger Freeman's all-world genetics.

Antonio said his son was a late bloomer and that his growth spurt did come until he was 15 or 16. Alex now stands an inch taller than his 6-foot-2 father. 

That physique had his high school's football coaches salivating. They were disappointed to learn that Alex's mom forbade him from playing the gridiron version early on. But his world-class athleticism has translated onto the soccer pitch – which was on full display against Araujo, a veteran of the Spanish titans Barcelona.

""He's was always telling me and his mom that he wanted to dribble on guys,"" Antonio said. ""Being a right fullback, he rarely gets an opportunity to get that isolation. Watching him just ease through the defense — it was just an amazing display of athletic ability, the way he dropped his hips, and was able to change directions. I was really, really impressed. And found out that he did it against one of the best defenders in the world? That was like icing on the cake.""

And Alex is still only getting started.

A potentially life-changing 2026 will arrive fast. European teams figure to be lining up for his services as soon as the next transfer window opens in January. Yet for the next seven months, the World Cup is his first, second and third priority. That could mean staying put in MLS until after the star-making tournament, even if Orlando's nearly $20 million valuation is met by potential suitors this winter.

""I need to be in the best form for the World Cup,"" Alex told me last week on the eve of his breakout night in Tampa.  ""I'm comfortable in Orlando. I know I'll be able to play my game there, know the culture, staff, know everything I have to do. It depends on what I want to do and what I feel is best for me. If something happens, maybe I move. But the World Cup is coming. I need to be ready for the most important time in my life.""

Although father and son won't be able to spend this Thanksgiving together in person, both will be parked in front of a TV, watching their beloved Packers try to beat their division rivals Detroit Lions for the second time this season. And if all goes to plan, father will be following Alex and the USMNT across the country next summer at the World Cup, as the Americans attempt to make a deep run on home soil.

Beating Paraguay and Uruguay ""hopefully woke up our U.S. fans,"" Antonio said. ""They like that kind of feisty, that toughness, that grit on the field. We got some young guys and some older guys, a collaboration of great talent, and we're going to put our best out there at the World Cup and try to win it.""

Sebastian Berhalter epitomizes the energy and culture of the U.S. men's national team's Mauricio Pochettino era. Think about that. Berhalter is a player whose professional career is far from impressive. He's not a Europe-based player. He's hardly a front-facing star in MLS, even if he was a 2025 Best XI selection. Berhalter, though, in his limited opportunities under Pochettino and on a weekly basis for his club, has demonstrated a conviction to be part of the Argentine manager's culture transformation.

Advertisement

Take last Saturday night inside Vancouver's sold-out BC Place as the latest bit of evidence. LAFC had snatched momentum from the home team in second-half stoppage time, and it felt like Vancouver's wonderful season was slipping away. A pinpoint free kick from LAFC superstar Son Heung-min had tied the score at 2-2, completing a comeback from 2-0 down. In extra time, the Whitecaps were already down to 10 men and out of substitutions when resolute center back Belal Halbouni was forced off with a knee injury, zapping BC Place of its energy. But then there was Berhalter, barking at the home crowd and waving his arms with a contagious, primal energy.

Vancouver then survived the remainder of extra time with nine men, and before the penalty shootout, Berhalter whipped the crowd into a frenzy again. He would convert his spot kick and let out another cathartic scream before his side ultimately advanced to the Western Conference final for the first time.

Whether you believe that Berhalter has, as they say, that dog in him, or if he's more of a classic underdog, the 24-year-old is precisely what Pochettino wants from a national team player. Even more intriguing is the fact that Berhalter is the son of Pochettino's predecessor, Gregg Berhalter. It's a fascinating dynamic that may have only materialized because the U.S. had crashed out in the group stage of the 2024 Copa América. The elder Berhalter was subsequently fired. At that time, Sebastian was only beginning to establish himself with the Whitecaps. His pathway to the national team wasn't just unlikely, it was nonexistent. Firstly, because he was not playing at a level that would warrant a national team call-up, and secondly, and perhaps more difficult to navigate, would have been the prospect of nepotism.

Berhalter would not have been able to justify calling up his son during his nearly six-year term as the national team head coach based on all evidence. Sebastian is a Columbus Crew academy product who couldn't break into the first team and establish himself within an MLS Cup-winning midfield. As the national team's player pool and play style began to take shape under Gregg Berhalter in 2021, Sebastian was struggling as a fringe player with Austin FC, an MLS expansion side.

Austin's sporting director at the time, Claudio Reyna, signed Sebastian on loan in March of 2021 and later declined his purchase option. While he was not a central figure in the public feud between the Berhalters and Reynas after the 2022 World Cup, Sebastian was quietly embroiled in it. These are all realities. Sebastian was closer to being rooted to an MLS bench than he was to any type of international glory.

Pochettino's arrival occurred on a parallel timeline to Sebastian Berhalter starting to play the best soccer of his career. After a trade from Austin to Vancouver in 2022, for just $50,000 in general allocation money, he is now a valuable member of a team that is one game away from an MLS Cup final berth. Thomas Müller may be the Whitecaps' main attraction, but Berhalter is the proverbial heart and soul of the team.

And as Pochettino quickly established that no U.S. player had a guaranteed spot on the national team, a door for Berhalter opened. The Argentine manager, who took the U.S. job after stints with Espanyol, Tottenham, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, was uninterested in coddling star players. Pochettino wanted to build a culture that tore down player hierarchies and catering to individual desires in favor of the team.

“We didn't see the desperation,” Pochettino told Andrés Cantor and Fútbol de Primera. Pochettino's answer came during a segment where he and Cantor discussed how players from around the world view the national team as the pinnacle of their professional lives, and that no call-up was to be taken for granted.

“But in the end, that mindset that they had — which is not the players' fault — is, ‘Well, they are friendly matches,” Pochettino said. “'I'm going to play, but I'm not going to risk getting injured, I'm not going to stick my foot in. I'm not going to run an extra meter or put in an effort, because if I get injured, then I can't play again.' In the end, that [mindset] is not felt in any other national team. And here, I think that is one thing that we have been able to change.”

It's worth revisiting Pochettino's responsibilities before he was introduced as the U.S. manager in September of 2024. He had replaced Thomas Tuchel at PSG and inherited a team with Hollywood appeal, in which Lionel Messi played alongside Kylian Mbappé and Neymar. Pochettino's PSG project was one that combined the highest of expectations, both domestically and in the Champions League, with the difficult task of managing some of global football's biggest personalities. Chelsea was another experiment in man management, high-priced talent and little margin for error.

With that foundation, Pochettino accepted the U.S. job with the task of fixing a team culture that had gotten too comfortable; where complacency began to undermine the bigger objectives.

“With Argentina or with France, with Spain, the goal is always to increase your chance of being in the next call-up,” Pochettino told Cantor. “What happened is that (in the U.S.) the idea had settled that certain players already had their position secured. It implies that they already take it for granted that there is a secured spot at the World Cup. So these are those things that sometimes I don't understand.”

So, yes, Pochettino's squad lists over 22 matches have been favorable to MLS players like Sebastian Berhalter. One surefire way to put pressure on the U.S.'s European contingent of players is to use the performances of undervalued and unsung professionals. It was the perfect situation for players like Diego Luna, Max Arfsten and Cristian Roldan. And Berhalter fits the mold.

“It's just that the cradle of world football, the world champions, are somewhere else,” Pochettino said. “They are not here. Here they are champions of basketball, of football, of hockey. Not soccer. Changing that is very difficult.”

With Vancouver, Berhalter understands what ownership and accountability feel like. He's a team leader and one of the squad's driving forces. What's notable is that Berhalter has gradually improved in nine senior U.S. team appearances. He isn't a player who dazzles. His technical ability is good, not great. He is, however, a very coachable player (it helps being the son of a coach).

No one is expecting Berhalter, a box-to-box central midfielder, to outplay a seasoned international in the middle of the park next summer. But he has earned the chance to potentially represent his country at the World Cup by personifying what a baseline U.S. national team player should look like: someone that is gritty, overlooked and devoted to the badge.

The likes of Christian Pulisic, a star at AC Milan, may embody what American soccer fans hope every future U.S. international can be, but a player like Berhalter — a fire-breathing competitor with a chip on his shoulder, is a true representation of the American soccer warrior. Berhalter has minimized his lack of experience and physical limitations by becoming a dead-ball specialist. Free-kick efficiency is only possible through hours of repetition. It's not an innate characteristic. Berhalter has put in the work and now has a level of expertise that could see him carve out a place on Pochettino's 26-man squad come May.

In the U.S.'s 5-1 rout of Uruguay last week, Berhalter played the entire 90 minutes. He scored the game's first goal from a well-taken set-piece strike that curled into the top corner. He added a set-piece assist and finished with a passing rate of 88 percent (28/32 passes) against a formidable opponent. Barring an injury crisis in the U.S. midfield, Berhalter is a long shot to be in Pochettino's World Cup starting XI on June 12 in Los Angeles. But he's on pace to be there as an option. As Pochettino has made abundantly clear, to represent this country at a World Cup takes more than stature. Berhalter may have what it takes to earn the ultimate reward in 2026.

GOAL spoke to a number of former NCFC players, who outlined the harsh realities of a volatile league after being made redundant four days before a playoff game

The day North Carolina FC announced they would be halting operations at the end of the season hit one player's family particularly hard. 

Upon learning from her husband that everything their family had built in Cary, N.C., would come crashing to an end, the player's wife was immediately rushed to the hospital. She had terrible breakouts on her face and body. It was so bad that a doctor determined she needed steroids to remedy her symptoms.

This is the side of football that many don't get to see. And it was one of many reactions to the news that NCFC would, come the end of the season, no longer exist. On Nov. 3, the United Soccer League Players Association informed all 26 roster members of the club that they would not have an employer within a month. The news, officially announced by the team itself on Nov. 4 - four days before a home playoff game - made waves on social media. 

Yet more important than the debate over USL's future and its grandiose ambitions was the impact that this news had on real human lives. A club closing down might seem a minor casualty in a much wider soccer sphere, in which news cycles last minutes - at most. And USL franchises are smaller and more volatile than those in more well-off leagues. 

But for the players, staff members, and those on the inside, such an event is life-changing and potentially catastrophic for a football career. 

“The reaction was anger. Having a two-year deal gave balance and a belief of certainty. Then, we had that ripped out from under us so late in the season,” one NCFC player told GOAL.

It isn't fair to the thousands of paying fans who show up to games week in, week out - the season ticket holders who will suffer after watching their team fold. But there is also a devastating human cost of redundancy for the 26 on the roster. 

A handful of NCFC's players, speaking on the condition of anonymity, talked about their reactions to seeing their contracts voided. Some were on multi-year deals, while others were due to see their contract expire at the end of the season. But all have had their lives turned upside down in recent weeks, with few apparent solutions.

NCFC are not the first USL team to halt operations in recent years - 12 franchises have folded in the last decade. As the league expanded, this has become something of an unfortunate trend. Ownership groups have often gambled on markets without success. And due to a lack of long-term sustainability, some simply pull the plug. 

It's common for players to see this happening in real time. One player, who was part of Memphis 1901 before it folded in December 2024, admitted that he could see the news coming. 

“You don't wake up one morning to a press release,” he said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to have his identity protected. “It starts slowly with whispers in the locker room, uncertainty in staff meetings, small signs that something isn't right.” 

NCFC said their reason for ceasing operations was the franchise agreement ending, as well as an application to USL's new Division One league, set to come to USL in either 2027 or 2028. They were, in effect, closing their doors now to set themselves up for the future. 

The club itself reiterated that sentiment in an email. 

“We had a great 20 years, but we're aiming to make professional soccer sustainable here for the next 20 and beyond. There's an incredible soccer community in the Triangle, and this reset will give us the time and resources to connect better, understand more deeply, and best represent them when we kick off again in the future,” a club spokesperson told GOAL. 

The club has already applied for Division One status, and its application, like many, is under review. 

When asked about the club's decision, the USL declined to offer a comment. According to sources, there isn't an expectation that other clubs hoping to play USL Division One will make similar moves. The club, when asked about communications with the league itself, said they were unable to comment on behalf of the USL. 

The general sentiment from club executives around the league is one of anger and disappointment. The president of another USL Championship club, speaking anonymously, characterized NCFC's decision as a “betrayal of trust” and made clear that they don't wish for the club to be let back into the league. 

“It's embarrassing for NCFC to capitalize on Division One the way they have, especially before the playoffs,” they said. 

That same president also acknowledged that the decision comes at an inopportune time, given the league's recent success and big ambitions for the future. “It's disappointing at a time when there is so much happening around the league,” they added. 

The USL Players Association expressed similar frustration. 

“When a professional club shuts down, the players are always the ones left holding the bag. North Carolina FC is the 12th USL Championship club in the past decade to fold, and each time it happens, players are left with only two months of salary, immediate housing instability, and, for international players, real uncertainty over their immigration status,” Connor Tobin, Executive Director of the USLPA, said in a statement to GOAL.

One squad member, who has a wife and son, was ‘shocked and disappointed' to hear the news. He was supposed to be under contract for at least one more year - on a guaranteed salary. That deal, expected to sustain him for at least another season, has been shortened to just two months of compensation. He declined to answer if he felt optimistic about the chances of signing a new contract elsewhere. 

A second player who had spoken with GOAL took the news poorly, but wasn't entirely surprised. 

“I felt hurt, but honestly, I could see it happening beforehand,” he said. 

Another suggested that NCFC had been hinting that it would shut its doors for some time. The club's franchise agreement was due to expire at the end of the 2025 season, and a few players noticed that the lack of marketing from club leadership - which also owns the NWSL's North Carolina Courage - indicated that things might change. 

“I wasn't extremely shocked because of the lack of effort from the front office when it came to marketing the team,” he said. 

But more generally, the reality for those who put their trust in a club can be devastating. 

“A few had relocated their families just months earlier and signed year-long leases. Breaking those leases meant paying thousands of dollars they didn't have and forcing many to stay in a city without a team simply because leaving was financially impossible,” a former squad member of a different USL club told GOAL.

Part of the shock for the players was the timing of the announcement. 

The club revealed its decision four days before an Eastern Conference semifinal clash with Rhode Island FC - a game which NCFC hosted at WakeMed Soccer Park. Head coach and sporting director John Bradford was looped in on discussions around the timing of the announcement. 

The players, however, were baffled that the club chose a date so close to a crucial fixture. 

“I was more surprised and annoyed with the timing right before a home playoff game,” one said. 

Some players admitted that the news impacted their performance, or certainly the vibe around the team in the days before the game. 

“It affected the training in the week leading up. Time that could have been spent preparing was spent on HR meetings and other meetings,” one player said. 

One player who spoke with GOAL acknowledged that “team spirit took a hit,” but one insisted that they “focused valiantly on doing their best” given the circumstances. 

The club, meanwhile, praised the players' attitude in the week leading up to the game. “The players and staff were utmost professionals during the training sessions and the playoff match that followed the announcement, and we are incredibly proud of the effort and heart they showed in the conference semifinal,” an NCFC spokesperson told GOAL. 

They lost 2-0.

Yet the effects of that Nov. 4 decision extend far beyond the result itself. USL contracts are typically shorter than those in MLS or other leagues, leading to significant roster turnover. In the USL, it's common for players to be on one-year or two-year deals, creating constant movement from season to season. 

But finding work so late into the season, when most teams have already formulated their roster plans for the following year, can be immensely difficult. 

“The worst part is you're late to the free agent game. Most teams have spent a good chunk of their budget and roster spots already. You lose all the leverage that you may have had if you knew you'd be a free agent six months ago. And as a result, you have to take a bad deal or a deal you don't believe matches market value,” one player said. 

Another, previously employed by a different club that folded, acknowledged the same. 

“Contract status shapes the fallout,” they said. “Players out of contract can move on more quickly, but those with ‘guaranteed' deals often discover the guarantee is limited. In a league with modest wages, that adds up to four paychecks and a public signal that players from a folded club can now be acquired at a steep discount.”

The sentiment about finding a new club was generally pessimistic. Only one of the players GOAL spoke to said they were confident that they would seal a new deal with a new team. The club insisted they have worked with players to find new clubs. 

“As soon as the team's immediate future direction was finalized, our priority was to provide players and staff with timely, transparent information so they could prepare for 2026 and beyond,” a spokesperson said.

The USL Collective Bargaining Agreement currently has barriers in place to protect players when clubs close doors - although they are far from extensive. All teams are required to offer a minimum of two months' salary, with some players historically granted more. 

However, what is an act of good faith from the league can hold some players back. 

Tobin echoed that sentiment. 

“For most players, [two months] barely covers basic living costs, especially when next season's rosters across the professional landscape are already filling up,” the USLPA president said. 

The specifics of that may yet change. The USLPA, clubs, and league are currently engaged in tense negotiations about a new CBA, with the two sides at an impasse on hashing out an agreement to follow up on the original one, ratified in 2021. Conversations have occurred for over a year, and there is little optimism from the USLPA side that a deal can be reached before the Dec. 31 deadline. Players from FC Tulsa and Pittsburgh Riverhounds, which faced off in last week's USL Championship final, wore pregame shirts in protest of what they perceived as a lack of 'professional standards' from the league. USL didn't show the trophy presentation on its broadcast of the game in response.

""We really hit a wall this fall. There has not been a lot of progress,"" Tobin told GOAL. 

The USL declined to comment on the status of talks.

When the agreement expires on Dec. 31, existing guardrails will be removed.

All of the players who talked to GOAL said that they felt the USL, as an entity, has not supported them, with one pointing out that ‘the USLPA has been our main source of support.' 

Some felt the team itself had been particularly helpful. One player revealed that the club helped them stay in housing until the end of the year. Another said they were promised that the club would follow CBA rules by the book. 

The club itself has insisted that player welfare was ‘high priority.' It also pointed out to GOAL that they have made extra efforts to help out the players on both short and long-term contracts. Bradford held conversations with each player after the announcement, asking them where they hoped to play next, and helped energize talks over their future clubs with both agents and other franchises. Those efforts have continued, and the club is optimistic that its former players will find new homes. 

They also provided individual resource guides for each squad member, tailored to their specific needs, which were then disseminated at the time of the announcement.

“Guided by the USL's collective bargaining agreement, the cub met all requirements and went further by providing additional support for healthcare, housing, and individualized assistance during the transition. We also extended similar offerings to those not under guaranteed contracts for 2026,” a spokesperson said. The same spokesperson also highlighted the fact that ‘several' players have already penned new deals at other clubs next season.

However, for all of the progress made with some players joining new clubs, there are still several who have no options for 2026. And the reality is some might not have the opportunity to play at the same level - at the right team - again.

The true, real life, human impact of losing a job has been exposed here. And while North Carolina unfortunately aren't the first to fold - and might not be the last - but the fallout goes far beyond someone having to look elsewhere to kick a football. 

In the end, it's the human cost that lingers long after the club is gone.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Explore our soccer expert's Olympiacos vs Real Madrid predictions, pre Wednesday's 3pm ET Champions League clash (11/26).

Our betting expert expects an open game to produce goals for each team, with Ayoub El Kaabi and Jude Bellingham among the scorers.

Olympiacos know that they cannot settle for a tie in this match. They are going to need to start winning matches if they're to stand any chance of progressing. That should ensure plenty of attacking intent from the hosts, which may lead to a more open contest.

Their last two Champions League fixtures have seen both teams score. Four of their last six matches in all competitions have done likewise.

Olympiacos boss Jose Luis Mendilibar is certainly no stranger to this opposition. His Eibar side once famously stunned Real Madrid 3-0 in La Liga. In six of his last nine meetings with the Spanish giants, Mendilibar's teams have at least got on the scoresheet.

His direct approach should ensure a difficult night for the visiting defence. However, Olympiacos have conceded nine times across their last three European fixtures. Backing both teams to score appears to offer value.

The home side's main attacking threat is El Kaabi. The Moroccan is sure to lead the line, and he has frequently made his mark against the stronger European teams.

El Kaabi was pivotal to Olympiacos' stunning 2023/24 Conference League triumph. He scored five goals against Aston Villa in their semi-final tie. He also scored a penalty, having had a header ruled out, against Barcelona earlier in this campaign.

Real Madrid could be especially vulnerable to his pace and physicality in this game. That's because the visitors are likely to be missing centre-backs Eder Militao and Antonio Rudiger to injuries.

Militao has been a major loss for Los Blancos recently. They've allowed at least 1.2 xG in each of their last three matches. That will encourage El Kaabi, who is a good choice for an anytime goalscorer.

Kylian Mbappe has largely been Real Madrid's main attacking threat this season. However, his form has dipped slightly in recent weeks. That suggests there may be more value in backing another visiting player to score in this game.

Jude Bellingham is the most clear candidate. Alonso has spoken about the need for the Englishman to cover less ground and spend more time in dangerous areas. That has contributed to his increased goal threat.

The 22-year-old scored and assisted as Los Blancos twice fought back to level their clash with Elche at the weekend. He hit the target on three occasions in that game. Bellingham has also registered at least one shot on target in each of his last nine Real Madrid appearances.

He has scored in four of his last six matches for the Spanish giants. Backing Bellingham to score anytime with an implied probability of 34.5% seems to offer value here.

Despite favourable home fixtures against Pafos and PSV, Olympiacos have struggled to make an impact in this competition. They only managed to draw those games despite being dominant in periods.

Away defeats to Arsenal and Barcelona leave them outside the top 24. The Greeks have won their last two domestic fixtures, but they need to pull of a serious upset on Wednesday.

They might be catching Real Madrid at an opportune time. Xabi Alonso's side have gone three matches without a win in all competitions.

Their latest result was a 2-2 tie at Elche on Sunday, while their last Champions League game ended in a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool. However, Los Blancos remain in a strong position in Europe, having already secured nine points.

Olympiacos expected lineup: Tzolakis, Rodinei, Retsos, Pirola, Ortega, Mouzakitis, García, Martins, Chiquinho, Podence, El Kaabi

Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Huijsen, Asencio, Valverde, Camavinga, Guler, Vinicius, Bellingham, Brahim, Mbappe","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

With only seven months until the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Neymar has suffered a meniscus injury in his left knee and is expected to miss the rest of the season for Santos.

The Brazil international just recently returned from a hamstring injury and made four consecutive appearances for the São Paulo club before complaining of discomfort in his knee following Santos' 1–1 draw with Mirassol on Wednesday, Nov. 19. 

Neymar then sat out of Monday's 1-1 draw at Internacional as a precaution, but what he and Santos hoped would be a minor injury is now a more serious issue plaguing the same knee that needed surgery to repair an ACL tear and a torn meniscus back in 2023.

The latest injury is the forward's fourth setback since joining Santos in January. Neymar made 25 appearances and scored seven goals in his second stint with his boyhood club, but he will not be able to help Juan Pablo Vojvoda's side in its final three games of the season, per ESPN.

Santos currently sit 17th in Brazil's Serie A with 38 points from 35 matches. Atop the relegation zone, the club is just one point away from safety, making their upcoming matches all the more important. Without Neymar, though, the Brazilian outfit will have to dig deep to stay in the top flight.

During the November international break, Brazil national team boss Carlo Ancelotti challenged Neymar to stay healthy and return to full match fitness if he wanted to represent the Seleção in the United States, Canada and Mexico next summer.

“I thought Neymar was just a topic in Brazil, but I see it's a global issue,” Ancelotti said ahead of his side's 1–1 draw with Tunisia. “Fortunately, he recovered from his injury. Now he has six months to play.

“Neymar is on the list of players who could be at the World Cup. Now he has six months to make the final list. We just have to observe him and other players to avoid making mistakes in the final selection.”

Another injury is the last thing Neymar needed in his pursuit of earning a place in Brazil's squad for the 2026 World Cup. Ancelotti has yet to call up the Seleção's all-time leading goalscorer since he took over in May, and now, the Italian manager will only have more doubts of the forward's fitness.

For the first time in World Cup history, FIFA have weighted the draw to ensure that the four highest ranked nations will not be able to meet until the semifinals, should they win their respective groups.

Spain (first), Argentina (second), France (third) and England (fourth) make up the leading quartet of qualified nations and will be subjected to FIFA's new regulations to modify December's draw. 

In the same vein as major tennis tournaments, Spain and Argentina—as the two top seeds—are guaranteed to be drawn on opposite sides of the bracket, establishing that the reigning champions of Europe and South America will not face each other until the final, on the assumption that they both win their groups.

The same applies to France and England. Didier Deschamps's back-to-back finalists are projected to battle Spain in the semifinal while the Three Lions would theoretically go up against Lionel Messi's Argentina should the knockout stages adhere to FIFA's world rankings.

These unprecedented tweaks have consequences stretching beyond the leading quartet of countries.

As co-hosts, the U.S. men's national team (USMNT), Canada and Mexico have secured a spot in Pot 1, avoiding matchups with the nine highest ranked countries on the planet in the group stage.

There are still difficult opponents on the horizon—the USMNT could theoretically find themselves up against 2022 semifinalists Morocco, Erling Haaland's Norway and four-time champions Italy (should they qualify from the playoffs)—which will be determined on Dec. 5. However, the order of those potential opponents is already clear.

Rather than being assigned their opponents in a random order, which was traditionally the case, the World Cup's three co-hosts already know when they will be playing.

The USMNT and Mexico have been given the same fixture path. Both are set to begin their campaign against a Pot 3 side—which could be anyone from Norway to South Africa, with a Scott McTominay-inspired Scotland also in the mix—before taking on Pot 2. 

They finish the group stage against Pot 4, which should theoretically be the easiest opponent. However, FIFA's stipulation that all playoff teams will be thrust among the lowest ranked nations has thrown a spanner in the works. Given all of the co-hosts are from Concacaf, none can land Curaçao or Haiti, giving them an increased chance of being drawn against one of the four UEFA playoff winners, which could be any of 16 teams, including the likes of Italy, Denmark and Republic of Ireland.

Canada will face their Pot 4 team first, with their opponents ranked in reverse order as they are up against Pot 3 before finishing the group stage with their toughest Pot 2 foe.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Samir Nasri claims Mason Greenwood shouldn't be 'judged' on past rape allegations after being 'forgiven' by partner Harriet Robson","https://www.goal.com/en-om/lists/samir-nasri-claims-mason-greenwood-shouldn-t-be-judged-past-rape-allegations-forgiven-by-partner-harriet-robson/blt2bda22d4abbe6641","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 12:27:42 GMT","

Former Arsenal and Manchester City star Samir Nasri believes Mason Greenwood shouldn't be ""judged"" on his past rape allegations. The Marseille forward had charges of attempted rape, controlling and coercive behaviour, and assault dropped in February 2023, at which time he was still on the books at Manchester United.

Nearly six months after charges against the forward were dropped, Greenwood admitted to ""making mistakes"" as Man Utd confirmed he would not be reintegrated into the squad following their own internal investigation into his conduct away from the pitch. 

He said in August 2023, shortly before joining Getafe on a season-long loan: ""I want to start by saying I understand that people will judge me because of what they have seen and heard on social media, and I know people will think the worst. I was brought up to know that violence or abuse in any relationship is wrong, I did not do the things I was accused of, and in February I was cleared of all charges. However, I fully accept I made mistakes in my relationship, and I take my share of responsibility for the situations which led to the social media post. I am learning to understand my responsibilities to set a good example as a professional footballer, and I'm focused on the big responsibility of being a father, as well as a good partner. Today's decision has been part of a collaborative process between Manchester United, my family and me. The best decision for us all, is for me to continue my football career away from Old Trafford, where my presence will not be a distraction for the club. I thank the club for their support since I joined aged seven. There will always be a part of me which is United. I am enormously grateful to my family and all my loved ones for their support, and it is now for me to repay the trust those around me have shown. I intend to be a better footballer, but most importantly a good father, a better person, and to use my talents in a positive way on and off the pitch.""

United sold Greenwood to Marseille outright in the summer of 2024, and he has since become a key player for the club, while also welcoming two children with his partner, Harriet Robson. The topic of the ex-United man has sprung up again in light of Marseille hosting Newcastle United, a game the French side won 2-1 in the Champions League on Tuesday. Before that, former Marseille star Nasri gave his thoughts on the public perception of Greenwood, who was forced to rebuild his career abroad after the lengthy legal case.

He said on Canal+: ""If she (Harriet Robson) has forgiven him... who are we to judge? That's the point... If your wife has forgiven you, we can forgive you. If she hadn't forgiven him and he had been found guilty and had received that sentence in England, she would have said it was normal.""

Marseille boss Roberto De Zerbi has also come to the aid of the 24-year-old. The Italian called the forward a ""good person"", who paid a ""heavy price"" for what happened.

""I never delve into the players' private lives. But what I can say is that he's a good person. He paid a heavy price for what happened. He arrived in the right environment and behaved well. He has a very reserved personality. It saddens me what happened to him because I know a very different person from the one portrayed in England,"" said the former Brighton head coach. 

After a prolific season at Marseille last term, Greenwood is continuing to impress this season for the French giants. He has scored 11 goals and added four assists in 17 appearances and will hope to add to that when Marseille, who are second in Ligue 1, host Toulouse on Saturday. The ex-Red Devils man was linked with some top European clubs earlier this year, and while a big-money move may happen one day, for now, he will be focusing on delivering for De Zerbi's side - who are just two points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

F1 Academy: The Story of the 2025 Season

Doriane Pin's journey to the 2025 F1 Academy title

Former Renault F1 driver Jolyon Palmer breaks down Kimi Antonelli's race weekend under the Las Vegas lights.

Kimi Antonelli's weekend in Las Vegas was one of his best yet in F1, as he ended up on the podium having started from 17th position on the grid.

It was the kind of measured drive you'd have expected from some of his more experienced front-running rivals. He kept Oscar Piastri at bay late on and even extended his gap over Charles Leclerc to be able to absorb his five-second penalty without a position loss after the flag.

There were still lessons for him over the weekend though. He looked very quick in practice and has often shown this year that prior experience at a circuit is no guarantee of success for him – in fact he's actually gone better on tracks he has never been to, with limited track time.

Qualifying was tricky though. In a wet session on a track like Vegas there is a lot of mental capacity needed, as well as driving skill. Everyone fuels up for the session in these instances because you can never guarantee which lap will be your last and you can't afford to miss time sitting in the pits whilst others are improving.

Trying to find some clear space, keeping your tyres in the right window and learning more about the track conditions every single lap is tricky, as well as managing energy levels from the battery.

On a circuit with long straights like Vegas, it's important to know when your last lap is so you can top the battery up a bit more and deploy energy to give yourself a big advantage on that final attempt. Unfortunately for Kimi, a lock-up on his last lap meant he was left in the lurch as the track was at its best, and alongside Lewis Hamilton he was a shock loser of Q1.

The next error was creeping forward at the race start, which confused both driver and team as they couldn't see a reason for it. I suspect this is pretty simple though. The track slopes very gently at the back of the grid and you need to apply some brake pressure to stay still in the box.

While Mercedes saw that there was no slip on Kimi's clutch, it could be that as he applied circa 10,000RPM, the rising revs caused vibrations through the car enough to warrant a bit more brake pressure.

He obviously didn't feel it from the cockpit and it was such a minor transgression, but the rules are set in stone for start infringements, so a penalty was inevitable here, even if he gained nothing from it.

The rest of his race, though, was brilliant. While team mate George Russell further up the road was struggling a lot with his tyres, Antonelli managed to do almost the entire race on a set of hards and was even one of the fastest cars on the circuit at the end.

The actual wear was low in Vegas. The circuit energy is incredibly low – there aren't many fast corners to put load through the tyres and the temperatures are also the lowest of the season, so it's all about getting the tyres into the right window to avoid graining.

This happens when drivers push with tyres that aren't operating in the correct window and so the rubber moves around and balls up on the surface.

For Russell, he was chasing the race leader and paid a price for challenging too soon in both stints. Antonelli was more conservative for much of his long run, rising through the field as his competitors pitted. After a Lap 2 stop, it seemed inevitable he'd have to pit again, like Yuki Tsunoda, who opted for the same strategy as Kimi. But when the Italian rookie wound up the speed later on, the tyres were still there for him.

On top of that, he ended as one of only three drivers to lap underneath a 1m 34s second lap – along with the top two – underlining his raw pace. We also saw more of that steely composure he showed in Brazil as he kept a determined Oscar Piastri behind him on much fresher tyres.

Kimi has said that he had to really knuckle down this season after his second home race at Monza in September, when Toto Wolff publicly called his performance ‘underwhelming'.

There have probably been a couple of turning points for Antonelli in his topsy-turvy season. The summer break also seemed like a great reset. In Spa and Budapest Kimi looked drained and bereft of confidence – a critical commodity for a successful Formula 1 driver.

But after a couple of weeks of forced time off he was already delivering much better on one-lap pace after the summer, in Zandvoort and Monza, when his Qualifying efforts were much more on par with his team mate.

Sometimes in a blur of a long rookie season, a bit of time to collect your thoughts and have a breather can do a lot of good. When you are struggling, bouncing straight from race to race can be a big mental challenge, and that's how it looked for Kimi for much of the European season, as he made a litany of errors.

After Monza, it seems he has also managed to find better race pace and execution. He's now starting to put race weekends together better. We saw that throughout the Brazil Sprint weekend, then in Mexico he was very competitive and beat Russell in a Grand Prix for the first time too, and now he's backed it all up with a cracking race in a tricky Las Vegas GP.

If he can see out the season in this vein of form, that'll be a huge boost for F1's most talked about rookie in years, ahead of a first winter off and a complete reset in the regulations and pecking order next year – which many think could see Mercedes right back in the title hunt.

Paramount, Comcast and Netflix submitted bids just five days ago as the formal process kicks in to higher gear on Dec. 1. 


							By 

	Erik Hayden


Executive Editor, Business


	It's time to up the ante. After the first round of offers for Warner Bros. Discovery arrived, the David Zaslav-run studio giant has set the next deadline for the sweetened bids from suitors. 


	That next wave of multibillion-dollar offers is expected by December 1, a source confirms. That's only 11 days removed from the initial offers that were submitted by November 20. While the David Ellison-owned Paramount has pursued a full takeover of the Warner Bros. Discovery assets, both the Brian Roberts-run Comcast and the Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos-led Netflix have submitted bids.

	The latter two suitors are expected to be more interested in the studios and streaming businesses, rather than the linear TV properties, whereas Paramount may aim to acquire the whole company. “Look, what I would also say, as it relates to M&A in terms of our mindset, I think it's important to know that there's no must-haves for us,” said Ellison on a Nov. 10 earnings call as he rounded out the first 100 days of his Paramount ownership.  Bloomberg earlier reported the deadline for the second round of offers.

	The next bid marks the latest turn in a process that accelerated beginning in June when Warners formally unveiled a plan to split its studio business (Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO and HBO Max) from its global networks unit (CNN, TNT Sports, Discovery and streamer Discovery+) that's been diminished as cord-cutting eroded the Pay TV landscape.

	











	After word of Ellison's overtures leaked, the company formally put up a “For Sale” sign on Oct. 21, saying it received “unsolicited bids” from “multiple parties,” although the conventional wisdom has suggested that the son of Oracle owner Larry Ellison (current net worth: $257 billion) has the inside track. The younger Ellison only months ago in August closed an $8 billion merger for his Skydance Media to effectively take over the owner of Paramount Pictures, CBS, MTV and Paramount+. Adding Warner Bros. to New Paramount's stable of assets would create a formidable studio empire that also would remove another major player from the mix of buyers for film and TV projects. Creatives have been circumspect as the prospect of a Warner Bros. sale has moved ahead.


	At the time it was formally put up for sale, Warners itself indicated that it'd like to see its separation of its assets move forward, believing that the two companies would provide more value for shareholders when they're eventually sold in pieces. Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr., chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors, noted at the time, “We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value. That said, we determined taking these actions to broaden our scope is in the best interest of shareholders.”


	As of Warners' Nov. 6 earnings, Zaslav had declared the sale an “active process” but didn't name suitors, as the WBD board will evaluate its options as the process moves ahead. He added, “When you look at our films like Superman, Weapons and One Battle After Another, the global reach of HBO Max and the diversity of our networks offerings, we've managed to bring the best, most treasured traditions of Warner Bros. forward into a new era of entertainment and new media landscape.”

The Australian artist and allrounder hopes to make a splash with his latest project, the Beach Passport PSA.

Cody Simpson: pop star, elite swimmer, life saver.


	The Australian artist and allrounder hopes to make a splash with his latest project, a campaign that encourages Australians to become ocean-safe before they dive in this summer.


	Simpson, who earned a Billboard 200 top 10 album with Surfers Paradise, is the face of the Beach Passport PSA, which launched a year ago through Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) and the national airline Qantas.

	The beach safety exercise is a complimentary online training resource that, in its first season, organizers say, was completed by more than 37,000 beachgoers.

	“Growing up on the Gold Coast, the beach has always been my second home and surf lifesavers are the unsung heroes who keep us all safe,” says Simpson in a statement.


	The Beach Passport, he continues, “only takes 15 minutes and will give you the knowledge that could save your life or someone else's this summer season.”


	With over 198,000 members and more than 300 affiliated clubs, according to its latest data, SLSA is said to be the largest volunteer movement of its kind in the world.


	The not-for-profit was established in 1907, with a mission to keep Aussies safe in the water, a national pastime in these warmer months. Since formation, more than 715,000 people have been rescued by its surf lifesavers.  


	Simpson has been a dedicated Surf Life Saving volunteer and member of his local surf club, Northcliffe Surf Club, since childhood, and he's a medalist in a major competitive swimming, having collected gold as part of the Australian men's 4x100m freestyle relay team at the 2022 Commonwealth Games.  

	











	He came up short in his bid to qualify for the individual 100m butterfly and freestyle events for the 2024 Paris Olympics, but turned his disappointment into creativity with the publication of his first-ever kid's book, titled The Sea In Me, and the tease of “exciting projects.” He's also behind the eco-friendly fashion brand Prince Neptune.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Well, it's finally here: the last big opening of 2025. This morning, 20th Century Studios' James Cameron directed threequel Avatar: Fire and Ash arrived on tracking three weekends ahead of its Dec. 19 opening and it's looking pretty good with a $110M debut or $100M-$130M range. 


	You don't get to those numbers unless it's a four-quad movie, and Avatar: Fire and Ash is strong with men and women in first choice (mostly men, but also solid enough with women). Note, it's behind the first tracking first choice numbers of Avatar: Way of Water, which opened to $134.1M, and that's just fine. Note, unlike most Marvel Studios movies, Avatar movies are appointment viewing. Audiences seek out the best 3D, Imax and premium large format seats. There's no Easter Eggs going on ala a Marvel movie which require an immediate rush-out by fans.

Avatar: Way of Water‘s tracking indicated a $150M-$175M opening three years ago, but the sequel came in below that. What went wrong? Tracking was working off the gas and comparison to Sony/Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: No Way Home the holiday season prior which posted the second biggest domestic opening ever at $260.1M behind Avengers: Endgame ($357.1M). Note, for Avatar: Way of Water to come out and open to $134M, 13 years after the original movie's $77M opening — well, that was fantastic. Nothing to ding. When we're talking about the opening for Avatar: Fire and Ash, consider, Avatar: Way of Water‘s domestic start essentially the ceiling in regards to a first weekend comp.  

	










			Watch on Deadline		







Avatar: The Way of Water did a 5x multiple off its domestic opening for a final of $688.4M in U.S./Canada. And that's with a badass winter storm during its second weekend. Worldwide it was $2.34 billion, the third highest grossing movie ever. 


	During the press tour of Avatar: Way of Water earlier this fall, Cameron said he's not committing to a fourth Avatar movie, despite having footage in the can, until the success of the third movie is determined; that's because these movies cost a ton. Avatar: Way of Water was the most profitable Hollywood movie of 2022 earning well over half billion in the black. 


	The original Avatar did a crazy 10x multiple off its $77M U.S./Canada opening for a final of $785.2M. The combined franchise total from Avatar over two movies is $5.26 billion. Cameron owns the first (Avatar at $2.92 billion), third (Avatar: Way of Water) and fourth (Titanic at $2.26 billion) highest grossing movies of all-time at the global box office; a feat no other filmmaker can boast in the top ten movies of all-time. 


	The current 2025 domestic box office for the period of Jan. 1-through Sunday, Nov. 23 stands at $7.48 billion, +3% over the same frame in 2024. The Thanksgiving harvest of Zootopia 2 and Wicked: For Good will only propel business higher.

Guy Fieri is wheelchair-bound after he “slipped down a set of steps” while filming “Flavortown Food Fight.”

The Food Network star explained to Fox News Digital on Monday that “one foot went forward and the other foot got caught on the threshold” during his fall — which tore his quad muscle “in half.”

When the 57-year-old was rushed to the hospital, the doctor told Fieri he hadn't seen a comparable injury in the “biggest, thickest” part of the leg throughout his 20 years on the job.

“You normally tear that muscle at your tendon or the tendon tears off the bone, but this was right in the center of the whole quad muscle and it exploded,” Fieri noted.

The chef was ushered straight into surgery to ensure his muscles didn't “recede.”

At the time, “everybody [was] in town” for the show and 125 people were on set and “ready to go.”

Fieri recalled, “We figured out how to pivot through it and to have some creative filming techniques. But it's been a run.”

Since the accident, the restaurateur has been getting around with the help of crutches and a wheelchair.

“I have to stay off it,” Fieri told the outlet. “I can't walk on it for eight weeks.”

At that point, the Emmy winner will get a cast and undergo rehabilitation — which he wants to start “as fast as possible.”

He did not specify when the injury occurred, but did confirm that “it sucked” and was a “damper.”

His eldest son, Hunter, is taking the reins this Thanksgiving and hilariously texted Fieri that it's his “time to shine.”

The “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” star said his youngest son, Ryder, and nephew Jules also “know how to cook.”

Fieri said, “It's gonna be me quarterbacking from the wheelchair and telling them what to do. And we cook for about 40 people up here. So it's going to be … an adventure.”

He shares Hunter, 29, and Ryder, 19, with wife Lori Fieri, whom he wed in 1995, and has vowed not to leave them any inheritance unless they “get two degrees.”

Xochitl Gomez gushed over Robert Irwin's “Dancing With the Stars” win amid dating rumors.

The actress, who won the Season 32 Len Goodman Mirrorball Trophy, recorded the moment Irwin and his pro partner, Witney Carson, were revealed as this year's champions.

“I am so incredibly proud of you two!” the “Raven's Home” alum, 19, captioned the video of Irwin, 21, and Carson, 32, emotionally hugging onstage.

“What a season!” she added, alongside a heart emoji.

While Gomez had previously shared the number fans could text to vote for Irwin, who suffered an injury shortly before the show, she did the same for fellow competitors Alix Earle and Jordan Chiles.

Notably, photos surfaced hours earlier of the former Disney Channel star having a private meetup with Irwin on the “DWTS” lot.

Gomez brought the Season 34 winner a bouquet ahead of his win, and the duo laughed and chatted.

According to TMZ, the “Baby-Sitter's Club” star also “spent some time backstage” with Irwin's family members.

Reps for Irwin and Gomez have yet to respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

The pair sparked dating speculation earlier this month when they danced together during the show's 20th anniversary celebration.

Irwin gushed about having the “best time” working with Gomez, calling their routine “so much fun.”

He went on to tell the New York Times, in an interview published Sunday, that dating in the public eye is “challenging to navigate.”

Over the weekend, the zookeeper explained, “Anything you do will be on TikTok the next day.”

Irwin's last public relationship was with Rorie Buckey from 2022 to 2024.

Carson wrote via Instagram in September that viewers have been “flooding” her with “applications” to date Irwin.

“We are currently dancing our lives away so we are unable to respond,” she quipped — before pitching her dance partner for the next “Bachelor” season.

The following month, Irwin joked to Page Six that he wanted admirers to “keep [the messages] coming, saying, “I'm on the lookout, and it'll happen when it happens.”

His “Favorite Girl.”

Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey, put on a united front after the musician was accused of snubbing the model for her birthday.

In photos obtained by Page Six, the “Peaches” singer and the Rhode founder were spotted out and about in their white electric G Wagon in Los Angeles on Tuesday.

In the snaps, Justin, who was dressed in a pink hoodie, sat shotgun as his wife drove.

The pair appeared to be in the middle of a conversation as the pop star looked down at his phone.

The couple's outing came days after Hailey celebrated her 29th birthday over the weekend.

At the time, Justin had not publicly posted anything online about his wife's special day. However, the “Baby” crooner hasn't uploaded anything to his Instagram feed since Nov. 14.

While social media users initially believed Justin had skipped out on his wife's lavish birthday party, Hailey proved that her beau was in fact there.

On Monday, the billionaire beauty mogul shared a video of herself blowing out the candles on the “prettiest cake” as her loved ones looked on.

Justin, who was dressed in a pink tank top, could be seen in the background watching his wife with a smile on his face.

Hailey and the two-time Grammy winner have long battled split speculation since they secretly tied the knot in 2018.

Last year, the rumors ramped up last year after the August 2024 birth of their son, Jack.

Over the summer, an insider shared that Justin's newly released “Swag” album was reportedly to blame for the strain on his marriage.

“The intense focus and emotional toll of creating new music had put a strain on their marriage,” a source close to the couple told Us Weekly in August.

The insider explained that Justin gets “completely consumed and shuts everything else out” when he's creating new music in the studio.

It turned out to be a historic night for the Irwins! Fan-favorite Robert Irwin has officially won “Dancing with the Stars.” 

His sister Bindi Irwin marked the milestone with a loving message and a celebratory photo. “TWO MIRRORBALLS NOW CALL AUSTRALIA ZOO HOME!!!! Congratulations and all the love in the world to @robertirwinphotography and @witneycarson. What. A. Night,” she wrote.

The win arrives ten years after Bindi earned her own historic Mirrorball trophy during season 21 with Derek Hough. 

Now, Robert has added a second shining prize to the family's legacy. 

The siblings each made “DWTS” history in their own way, drawing global love as they honored their late father, Steve Irwin, through their performances.

Robert's victory capped a heated three-round, three-hour live finale in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening. The 21-year-old overcame a painful rib injury to defeat fellow finalists Jordan Chiles, Alix Earle, Dylan Efron, and Elaine Hendrix. 

His emotional season, which began with a visit to his father's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in August, made him a fan favorite from the start.

The unexpected elimination of frontrunner Whitney Leavitt the week before pushed the momentum even further in Robert's direction. By the final night, his win felt inevitable.

Robert delivered some of his best dances of the season during the finale. His judges' choice quickstep to “Are You Gonna Be My Girl” by Jet showed clean footwork and a strong frame. His freestyle, performed to Avicii's “The Nights” and Sam Sparro's “Black & Gold,” leaned into full-throttle choreography and explosive lifts. 

He also excelled in the “instant dance challenge,” where he and partner Witney Carson received their style and song only minutes before performing.

Despite entering the show with no dance background, Robert leaned into his natural charisma and physicality. He embraced the lighthearted moments, including ripping his shirt mid-salsa, while still honoring his family values and his father's legacy.

After taking the Mirrorball trophy, Robert said he is heading into an even busier chapter of life. “I go to New York and then straight to South Africa to film another show over there,” he told E! News. “And then, I'm back home.”

Witney chimed in that she will be with him soon. “Witney's coming down to Australia,” Robert said, as the dancer joked, “You're not getting rid of me that easy.”

Robert reflected on the meaning of the season. “I've been able to write my own legacy with Witney as we tell stories of positivity, vulnerability, passion and fun.” He also shared that this journey has been years in the making. 

A recently resurfaced 2015 video showed young Robert backstage during Bindi's winning season, saying he hoped to compete on the show someday.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","An Interview with Lawrence, Icon of the Pop Underground","https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/an-interview-with-lawrence-icon-of-the-pop-underground/","Wed, 26 Nov 2025 16:06:33 GMT","

Lawrence would be a living legend if he'd only ever released a single. Rivalling the Smiths's “How Soon Is Now” as a classic statement of maladjusted misery, Felt's 1985 song “Primitive Painters” topped the UK indie charts. “If we'd been on a major label, it would have gone Top 30,” says the surname-less singer ruefully.

Formed in 1980 in Birmingham, England, Felt released ten albums—one for every year of the decade—of delicately dreamy jangle, with Lawrence singing alternately poetic and funny-sad lyrics in a one-note speak-sing drone. And then, as he'd planned all along, Lawrence ended the band. The only thing that didn't go exactly to plan was the massive fame. “I imagined Felt would be really big and that when we split, it would be on the news, and you'd have people on TV with tears in their eyes.”

His next venture, Denim—a twist on the fabric-related name of Felt—couldn't have been more different. Where Felt drew on supercool sources like Velvet Underground and Television, Denim's sights were set on the pop mainstream, albeit the UK mainstream circa 1974. Bunched together with ‘90s nu-glam outfits like Pulp and Suede, Denim watched their peers make it big. But although they did get signed to a major label, Denim themselves were never summoned to appear on Top of the Pops, the UK's weekly chart run-down show.

Returning to the indie sector and former label Cherry Red, his next outfit was called Go-Kart Mozart, after the line in “Blinded By The Light” (the Manfred Mann's Earth Band hit version, not the Springsteen original, Lawrence emphasizes). But while the records were as clever and catchy as ever, his career seemed to dwindle into ever-decreasing circles.

Then something unexpected and marvelous happened: The singer became a legend precisely for underachievement and for dogged persistence in dreaming. First, there was a 2011 documentary, Lawrence of Belgravia, named after the exclusive and ultra-expensive area of central London where he somehow managed to live. The comeback climaxed last year with a best-selling biography Street-Level Superstar, for which writer Will Hodgkinson followed Lawrence around for a year, documenting the lifestyle of an impoverished rock genius living on £10 a day. Capping it all off, a well-known sculptor even made a statue of Lawrence.

Meanwhile, Lawrence's two albums in his latest guise, Mozart Estate—Pop-Up! Ker-Ching! and the Possibilities of Modern Shopping and the new Tower Block In A Jam Jar—feature some of his finest tunes and comic-depressive lyrics. In a strange, wonderful twist, the dream expressed in “Primitive Painters”—“I wish my life could be as strange as a conspiracy”—came true.

Lawrence: It's just the idea that I'm tramping around, this accessible figure. Like, “He's the Picasso of pop, what's he doing out here on the street?”

Corin Johnson, this respected sculptor, came to one of our shows. He said, “I've got this giant piece of marble, really expensive, that was gifted to me and I want to do something really special with it. I'd like to do you.” I had to pose for such a long time, in the freezing cold, because he doesn't have a fire in his studio. He was chipping away with a chisel, chit-chatting. It's strange seeing yourself emerge from this block of marble. Then I did the unveiling at the Fitzrovia Chapel. I pulled the shroud off it—everyone gasped. It looks exactly like me. It's beautiful, like a Caravaggio. It has a religious aura.

All these things, the documentary, the sculpture, and the book, they've enabled me to climb this imaginary ladder of fame.

I'd read about Marquee Moon without hearing it. NME put Television on its front cover, but inside there was no interview, just a long rave review. Then, a bit later, I turned the radio on one night in the middle of John Peel's show, and I heard this long song. I thought, “That's ‘Marquee Moon.'” I just knew. Afterwards, Peel said, “It reminds me of 1967.” I thought, “What are you on about? It's totally new.” When I got the album, I was even more convinced Peel didn't know what he was talking about. There's nothing old-fashioned about the record. Nothing '60s. It's the start of a new genre.

Cherry Red, our label, sent him a demo tape. Apparently, Verlaine said, “The songs just start and nothing happens.” My reaction was, “That's why we want him! To help us structure our music. Make suggestions.” I don't know why he didn't dig what we were doing—that endless, rolling sound, not many people were doing that then. I think he would have enjoyed working with Maurice Deebank, our lead guitarist, who was a great player and similar in style to Verlaine. When I met Maurice, I saw the potential—that we could actually have a band like Television. Funnily enough, Maurice didn't like Television! Still, I steered him into doing lots of solos.

We had this amplifier that reggae bands used; it had the cleanest sound. This amp had two modes, Rock Sound and Light Sound. One day, we were playing, and I flicked the switch to Light, and I said, “That's our sound.” Maurice liked it because you could hear every note. No distortion at all.

I was using the lyrics to paint a picture of an imaginary world. That we could live in, instead of the real world. I never read a newspaper. Never watched the TV news. I was completely enclosed in this world.

I was obsessed with American things. Kerouac. The Warhol scene. We used a poster for the London showing of Warhol's Chelsea Girls on our second album, The Splendour of Fear. America, and especially New York, was a different world. That's what Felt was all about. I was staying in, consuming all these books and records, and not being part of the real world. I didn't want a band that would have a massive following of ordinary kids on the street. I wanted to be really famous, but I didn't want ordinary people to buy my record. Crazy!

I bought a one-way ticket to New York in 1990. And it was like, “Wow, God, this is not happening. There's no scene.” Meanwhile, it's all suddenly happening in Manchester and London. Stone Roses seemed to be always on the cover of the music papers. So I decided to get back to England quickly. I was only in New York for four months but I got all nostalgic—and started thinking about the 1970s. I went to a pawn shop, bought a guitar, and then I wrote songs like “The Osmonds.” The whole Denim album was basically written in a studio flat on Sullivan Street.

I decided I was going to do the complete opposite of Felt. In Felt, we never talked to the audience, never interacted. But Denim, I thought, “We'll put on a show.” But I didn't want to play live until we had a hit. I was waiting until I had the budget to do a proper show. But we never had the hit single.

I felt like there must be loads of people like me who don't like early Bob Dylan or Jerry Lee Lewis—all that stuff you're supposed to feel reverential about. The song was me saying, “I'm not scared to admit I like middle-of-the-road pop.”

Lionel Bart is my hero. My generation, we all love Oliver!. When I started to read up on him, I thought, “Gosh, I feel pretty close to this guy.” Because I'm not a great musician, and he couldn't play piano properly. He wrote all his songs on the black notes.

A lawyer told us you'll have to change the title, as Poundland love going to court. But I wasn't making fun of the store—I love the place. Although they've started to have things that sell for £2, which made some people angry!

In 2005, at a time when I couldn't get arrested, Go-Kart Mozart did an album called Tearing Up the Album Chart. It only came out on CD, and if it's not on vinyl, it doesn't feel like a real release to me. But I always thought those songs were neglected.

This album is for people who read Street-Level Superstar and thought, “I really like that guy. I like the idea of what he's up to.”

I just never grew up. I still think I'm 15. I'm not interested in people my own age, like politicians. I'm interested in teenagers and what they get up to. This song is making fun of them because they think they are so tough. A guitarist I know worked as a social worker at a home for bad boys. He told me one time they went on a trip to the seaside and the kids, to get high, sprayed the deodorant Lynx on their tongues. They go crazy on it.

Actually, I had a great job in the early days of Felt, working in a theatre in Birmingham. I was what was called a cellar man, working in the bowels of the building. I actually think having a job and doing a band works really well at the start, because it focuses you. It really sharpens you in terms of how you use what time you have.

But all I have ever wanted to be is a professional musician. And I kind of am now, but it's taken me many, many years.

Tara Reid has filed a police report in Illinois after claiming her drink was drugged at a hotel bar outside of Chicago last weekend. The actress said she is “willing to prosecute” anyone involved in the alleged incident, which the Rosemont Police Department is investigating, Rolling Stone can confirm. 


	The police report offers Reid's most detailed account yet of what happened last Saturday, Nov. 22, before she wound up briefly hospitalized. Reid was in the Chicago area for a celebrity signing event, and the night before, she got a drink at the hotel bar. Reid said the lobby was full of people who were “supposedly YouTubers,” who “had their phones out and the whole thing felt suspicious, but I didn't know what was going on.” 


	After ordering a glass of wine at the bar, Reid said someone came up to her and introduced himself as a “very successful influencer and YouTuber,” who was with the group in the lobby. He sat next to her, they spoke, and when Reid said she was going to step out for a cigarette, the influencer said he would go with her.

	











	“We went out for a smoke, exchanged numbers, and came back, and there was a napkin over my drink,” Reid said, per the police report. “Then the last thing I remember was drinking that drink and seeing a couple sitting next to us. The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital around 8 hours or more later not knowing where I was or anything that happened. I completely blacked out with no recollection of anything.”

	Reid said her agent “somehow found what hospital” she'd been taken to and went to pick her up. She claimed the hospital told her she was “free to go” and did not give her “any release forms or discharge papers.” Reid's agent took her back to the hotel, where she got her bag and checked out.


	Reid claimed that the influencer she sat next to later texted her videos of her at the hotel after the alleged drugging (ostensibly referring to the footage obtained by TMZ that showed Reid slurring her words and sliding off a wheelchair, before a medical team took her out on a stretcher). Reid said she thought the influencer “was trying to extort, saying he could stop the videos going out.”

	The police report ended with her saying, the influencer “also told me I called security on him and he also confirmed that I only had one drink.” 


	Despite being hospitalized, Reid still attended the autograph event on Sunday, Nov. 23, where she posed with fans who'd bought tickets to meet her. An event organizer told Rolling Stone, “Even though she was late, she did come,” Adelstein says. “I did not hear one bad thing at all. She obviously was very polite and happy to everybody.”

Science is thrilling, especially when it relates to the universe. Years ago, NASA found a UFO-shaped galaxy, which has long been a mystery. The first thing they do when they find an extraterrestrial subject of this sort is to examine the globular clusters and stars. Just recently, another research was conducted on this galaxy, and the mystery that seemed hidden has now been solved. 

NASA UFO-shaped galaxy, otherwise known as Dragonfly44 (DF44), was first discovered in a deep survey of a Coma cluster, a cluster with several thousand galaxies. Scientists were wowed by the discovery because of the quantity of dark matter found in it, almost as much as that of the Milky Way. Recall that the Milky Way is equivalent to a billion solar masses. 

The galaxy was first discovered by an international group of astronomers using the world's most powerful telescopes. The scientists used W.M. Keck Observatory and the Gemini North Telescope (both on Maunakea, Hawaii), and the study was published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. This UFO-shaped galaxy came into the limelight when NASA found that it consists of more dark matter, more than usual, making it 99.9% invisible.

While it has been under the radar for decades because of its dim appearance, it finally emerged when the Telephoto Array pointed out a region of the sky in the constellation Coma. Scientists further discovered that the galaxy had fewer stars, such that it could go berserk if something wasn't holding it together.

Scientists found that the dark matter content in DF44 is much less than when it was first observed. While it competes with the size of the Milky Way, this galaxy only has a hundred million stars compared to the Milky Way's hundred thousand million stars. This estimation affirms that the former is a thousand times fewer. The group of astronomers suggested that it would have been quite a subject of attraction with 100 times as much dark matter as expected from the number of its stars, like this mysterious glowing frozen young star discovery.

It was further noted that the total number of globular clusters is around 20, and the ratio of dark matter to luminous matter is 300 to 1. The updated analysis confirmed that the galaxy holds an ideal number of clusters that any normal galaxy should have. While a previous study referred to Dragonfly44 as anomalous, a recent study emerged, eradicating errors and confirming that the dark matter content is much less than earlier findings. You can find the results in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society (MNRAS).

The mystery surrounding DF44 has now been solved, thanks to the international team of astronomers led by the Kapteyn Institute of the University of Groningen (the Netherlands). Other participants include scientists from the Instituto de Astrofísícal de Canarias (IAC) and the University of La Laguna (ULL). Kudos to Ignacio Trujillo and Michael A. Beasly, IAC researchers and co-authors of the study, for their commitment to analyzing the dark matter and stars within the galaxy.

Up until now, there have been no physical explanations for the relation between the number of globular clusters and the total mass of the galaxy. All conclusions are based on pure observations. Let's not forget that the dark matter of a galaxy can be determined by measuring the number of globular clusters in it. Some believe the relation has to do with the gas from which the clusters and stars have formed. It is now left for NASA to further research new galaxies and their composition, leading to this ejected supermassive black hole, racing through space.

Here's a look at some famous cold cases in South Jersey.

A police case becomes “cold” when all probative investigative leads available to the primary investigators are exhausted, and the case remains open and unsolved after a period of three years.

Cold Cases are reviewed to determine if newer technologies or forensic testing may produce any new potential leads.  Any potential lead discovered will be assigned to an investigator for a follow-up investigation.

I have limited the scope of this photo gallery to cold cases from Atlantic, Cape May, and Cumberland counties over the past sixty years. There are undoubtedly cold cases from these counties that aren't represented here, and if you know of one and you would like me to give it fresh attention, please reach out to me.

Unsolved murders from as recently as 2017 to as far back as the 1960s in Atlantic, Cape May, and Cumberland counties are represented with photos of the victims and some of the history of the cases.

All of these murder cases grabbed headlines and our attention at the time, but now they have largely become curiosities to the public and painful memories for living family members.

As awful as it is to lose a loved one to murder, in many respects, it's an even bigger burden to have a family member just disappear, never to be heard from again.

These families never experience the closure of knowing what happened to their loved one, whether they are alive or dead.

Decades later, if you search these missing people's names, you will still find websites and Facebook pages set up in the hope that someone with information about them may still come forward.

US special envoy Steve Witkoff and other officials involved in negotiations on resolving the Ukraine conflict will visit Moscow next week, Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov has confirmed.

Ushakov, who advises President Vladimir Putin on foreign affairs, mentioned the trip in remarks on a Bloomberg report, which quoted what it claimed were leaked phone calls Ushakov held with Witkoff and senior Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev.

The Russian official told journalist Pavel Zarubin he does not comment on confidential communications, declining to either confirm or deny the authenticity of the transcripts. Whoever leaked them apparently aims to harm Russian-US relations, Ushakov added, noting: “Somebody tapped, somebody leaked, but not us.”

Bloomberg claimed the purported discussion between Ushakov and Witkoff was the “genesis” of the 28-point US proposal on ending the Ukraine conflict, which was discussed with representatives from Kiev in Geneva last weekend. Supporters of Ukraine interpreted the transcripts as evidence that the plan was “Russian” and not American.

US President Donald Trump brushed off the allegations, saying Witkoff was engaged in “standard” mediation seeking to “sell” some sort of a compromise to both sides of the hostilities. Dmitriev dismissed the publication as “fake,” and stated that “warmongers are sad that their sad trick does not work” after Trump's reaction.

Ukrainian officials claim that they have convinced the US to alter its proposal in a way that respects Kiev's red lines. A member of Vladimir Zelensky's administration even asserted following the talks in Geneva that the initial plan, which was also leaked to the press, “no longer exists” in its original form.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described the “media hype” regarding the discussions as an attempt to derail Trump's efforts and “distort the plan.” He added that Moscow refused to engage in “megaphone diplomacy” and sought calm discussions of the issue behind closed doors.

Bitcoin climbed above $90,000 for the first time in almost a week, clawing back ground after a more than a month-long selloff, as a broad rally in risk assets and easing volatility gave traders room to push higher.

The advance, though modest, put higher levels back in focus, with digital assets moving in step with equities amid growing conviction that the Federal Reserve may soon resume cutting interest rates. BlackRock's US Bitcoin ETF attracted fresh inflows, snapping a streak of redemptions.

Over 1,000 Amazon employees have anonymously signed an open letter warning that the company's allegedly “all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development” could cause “staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” an internal advocacy group announced on Wednesday.

Four members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice tell WIRED that they began asking workers to sign the letter last month. After reaching their initial goal, the group published on Wednesday the job titles of the Amazon employees who signed and disclosed that more than 2,400 supporters from other organizations, including Google and Apple, have also joined in.

Backers inside Amazon include high-ranking engineers, senior product leaders, marketing managers, and warehouse staff spanning many divisions of the company. A senior engineering manager with over 20 years at Amazon says they signed because they believe a manufactured “race” to build the best AI has empowered executives to trample workers and the environment.

“The current generation of AI has become almost like a drug that companies like Amazon obsess over, use as a cover to lay people off, and use the savings to pay for data centers for AI products no one is paying for,” says the employee, who like others in this story, asked to remain anonymous because they feared retaliation from their bosses.

Amazon, along with other big tech companies, is in the midst of investing billions of dollars to construct new data centers to train and run generative AI systems. This includes tools helping workers write code and consumer-facing services such as Amazon's shopping chatbot, Rufus. It's easy to see why Amazon is pursuing AI. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy announced that Rufus was on track to increase Amazon's sales by $10 billion annually. It “is continuing to get better and better,” he said.

AI systems demand significant power, which has forced utility companies to turn to coal plants and other carbon-emitting sources of energy to support the data center boom. The open letter demands that Amazon abandon carbon fuel sources at its data centers, bar its AI technologies from being used to carry out surveillance and mass deportation, and stop forcing employees to use AI in their work. “We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis,” the letter states.

Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser says that the company remains committed to its goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. “We recognize that progress will not always be linear, but we remain focused on serving our customers better, faster, and with fewer emissions,” he says, repeating earlier company statements. Glasser didn't address employee concerns about internal AI tools or external uses of the technology.

The letter represents a rare instance of tech employee activism during a year rocked by President Donald Trump's return to power. His administration has rolled back labor protections, climate policies, and AI regulations. The measures have left some workers feeling uneasy about speaking out about what they perceive as unethical conduct by their employers. Many are also concerned about job security as automation threatens entry-level software engineering and marketing roles.

A number of organizations around the world have tried to advocate for a slowdown in AI development. In 2023, hundreds of prominent scientists petitioned the biggest AI companies to pause work on the technology for six months and evaluate potentially catastrophic harms stemming from it. The campaigns have generated scant success, and companies continue to rapidly release new, increasingly powerful AI models.

But despite the challenging political environment, members of the climate justice group at Amazon say they felt they had to try to combat potential harms from AI. Their strategy, in part, is to focus less on longer-term worries about AI that is more capable than humans, in favor of putting more emphasis on consequences they argue must be confronted now. Members say they are not against AI—in fact, they are optimistic about the technology, but want companies to take a more thoughtful approach to how they deploy it.

“It's not just about what will happen if they succeed in developing superintelligence,” says a decade-long veteran in Amazon's entertainment business. “What we're trying to say is, look, the costs we're paying now aren't worth it. We are in the few remaining years to avoid catastrophic warming.”

Rallying support for the open letter was more difficult than in previous years, workers say, because Amazon has increasingly restricted employees' ability to solicit people to sign petitions. The majority of signers for the new letter came from reaching out to colleagues outside of work, the organizers tell WIRED.

Orin Starn, an anthropologist at Duke University who spent two years undercover as an Amazon warehouse worker, says the moment is ripe for taking on the giant. “Many people have tired of brazen billionaire excess and a company with nothing more than cosmetic PR concern about climate change, AI, immigrant rights, and the lives of its own workers,” he says.

Two of the Amazon employees say executives are minimizing problems with the company's internal AI tools and glossing over how dissatisfied workers are with them.

Some engineers are under pressure to use AI to double their productivity or else risk losing their jobs, according to a software development engineer in Amazon's cloud computing division. But the engineer says that Amazon's tools for writing code and technical documentation aren't good enough to reach such ambitious targets. Another employee calls the AI outputs “slop.”

The open letter calls for Amazon to establish “ethical AI working groups” involving rank-and-file workers who would have a voice in how emerging technologies are used in their job duties. They also want a say in how AI might be used to automate aspects of their roles. Last month, a surge of workers began signing the letter after Amazon announced it would be cutting about 14,000 jobs to better meet the demands of the AI era. Amazon employed nearly 1.58 million people as of September, down from a peak of over 1.6 million at the end of 2021.

The climate justice group intentionally targeted reaching their signature milestone ahead of the Black Friday shopping bonanza, aiming to remind the public about the cost of the technology powering one of the world's biggest online shopping platforms. The group believes it can have an impact because labor unions, including in nursing, government, and education, have successfully fought to have a say over how AI is used in their fields.

The Amazon employee group, which formed in 2018, claims credit for influencing some of the company's environmental pledges through a series of walkouts, shareholder proposals, and petitions, including one in 2019 that drew over 8,700 employee signatures.

Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, says climate goals and projects were in the works long before the advocacy group emerged. What no one disputes, however, is the scale of the challenges ahead. The activists note that Amazon's emissions have grown about 35 percent since 2019, and they want a new detailed plan established to reach the company's goal of net-zero by 2040.

The activists say what they have received from Amazon recently is uninspiring. One of the employees says that several weeks ago, at a companywide meeting, an executive stated that demand for data centers would grow 10-fold by 2027. The executive went on to tout a new strategy for cutting water usage at the facilities by 9 percent. “That's such a drop in the bucket,” the worker says. “I would love to talk about the 10 times more energy part and where we are going to get that.”

Glasser, the Amazon spokesperson, says, “Amazon is already committed to powering our operations even more sustainably and investing in carbon-free energy.”

U.S. men's national team icons Tim Howard and Landon Donovan listed Sebastian Berhalter and Brenden Aaronson as players at risk of missing out at the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Sebastian Berhalter made his case for the USMNT roster after a goal and assist against Uruguay. His proficiency on set-pieces could be a valuable weapon for Mauricio Pochettino as well. Despite his performance, Howard and Donovan both acknowledged the reality that the Argentine could go in a different direction next summer.

“I think Sebastian, for me, has to be on the team ... but he's on the bubble,” Howard said on their Unfiltered Soccer podcast. “I'm putting him on the bubble, too. I think he's on the bubble leaning in, but he's on the bubble,” Donovan echoed.

Matt Turner, despite losing his starting job to Matt Freese, is on the team for them and likely serves as a backup if the tournament started tomorrow.

Leeds United's Brenden Aaronson was also labeled on the bubble, despite Howard flip-flopping a little. “I want to say bubble, but I think he's in. I got him in,” Howard began.

“You got him on the team?” Donovan replied.

“No I'm going to put on the bubble right now. You just talked me out of it with one random question,” Howard remarked. To Howard's credit, Aaronson is one of the most difficult players to predict at this point.

He played against Paraguay and Uruguay in November often getting into dangerous areas, but a lack of quality in the final third let him down. The 25-year-old has registered just one goal in 12 Premier League games this season. 

At the national team level, Aaronson scored one goal this year at the Concacaf Gold Cup. Before that, his last goal came on Sept. 13, 2023 in an international friendly against Oman. Given the attacking talent at Pochettino's disposal, Aaronson likely has to prove himself moving forward.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is reportedly prepared to rival close friend Xabi Alonso as the Gunners eyes a move for Real Madrid target Rodrigo Mendoza. The Elche wonderkid, who has a €20 million release clause, has attracted widespread interest from across Europe following his eye-catching performances in La Liga. Premier League giants Manchester City are also keen on signing the youngster.

Mendoza graduated from Elche's youth system and made his professional debut for the club in 2022. Last season, the midfielder featured in 21 league matches as Elche finished second in the Segunda Division and earned promotion to La Liga.

In the current campaign, Mendoza has appeared in nine La Liga matches, scoring once. His impressive performances in the centre of the park for Elche have caught the eyes of several top European clubs. 

According to The Telegraph, Arsenal are closely monitoring the progress of Mendoza at Elche and are prepared to join the race to sign the 20-year-old. The Gunners' recruitment specialists have kept a close eye on the Spanish youth international, who could consider triggering his €20m (£17.5m) release clause.

The Gunners, however, will face intense competition from Premier League rivals Manchester City, while La Liga giants Real Madrid have also shown strong interest in signing the Spaniard, who has often been compared to Barcelona and Spain playmaker Pedri.

Arteta is a childhood friend of Madrid boss Alonso and the two Spaniards have a very similar outlook towards football. The duo also battled it out for Martin Zubimendi in the summer, and he ultimately chose Arsenal over Madrid. Arteta also signed Piero Hincapie from Bayer Leverkusen after talking to Alonso, who lured Granit Xhaka to Bay Arena from Arsenal in 2023. 

Now, it seems the two friends will once again compete in the transfer market to secure a move for Mendoza.

Elche recognised Mendoza's talent last summer when they reportedly rejected a few offers from the Saudi Pro League for his services. In August, the Spanish club moved to secure his long-term future by offering him an improved contract, extending his stay until 2028. This new deal included the €20m release clause, which, while substantial, is considered ""negotiable"" and ""certainly affordable"" for top European clubs. 

Despite Elche's efforts to tie him down, the Telegraph report added that Mendoza is destined to leave the club next summer. He could also consider moving in January if any club triggers his release clause.

For now, the Premier League leaders are focused on the current season and will be up against Harry Kane's Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday. Ahead of facing one of Europe's best strikers, Gunners defender Jurrien Timber revealed Arteta's plan to stop the England captain as he said: ""That is not going to be easy, of course. I think he is an amazing striker, everyone knows that. He has so many qualities. He has been doing it for such a long time already, and now at Bayern Munich he has been one of the best players in the world. So, it is going to be a nice challenge for us as a team, as defenders, to stop him tomorrow. I think when you face an opposition with Harry Kane as the striker, he is a topic and you discuss him as defenders, because he is one of the dangerous players. It is the same with any other game, we discuss their players and the way they play. For tomorrow, it is the same.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
