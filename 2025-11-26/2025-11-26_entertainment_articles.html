                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Well, it's finally here: the last big opening of 2025. This morning, 20th Century Studios' James Cameron directed threequel Avatar: Fire and Ash arrived on tracking three weekends ahead of its Dec. 19 opening and it's looking pretty good with a $110M debut or $100M-$130M range. You don't get to those numbers unless it's a four-quad movie, and Avatar: Fire and Ash is strong with men and women in first choice (mostly men, but also solid enough with women). Note, it's behind the first tracking first choice numbers of Avatar: Way of Water, which opened to $134.1M, and that's just fine. Audiences seek out the best 3D, Imax and premium large format seats. There's no Easter Eggs going on ala a Marvel movie which require an immediate rush-out by fans. Avatar: Way of Water‘s tracking indicated a $150M-$175M opening three years ago, but the sequel came in below that. Tracking was working off the gas and comparison to Sony/Marvel Studios' Spider-Man: No Way Home the holiday season prior which posted the second biggest domestic opening ever at $260.1M behind Avengers: Endgame ($357.1M). Note, for Avatar: Way of Water to come out and open to $134M, 13 years after the original movie's $77M opening — well, that was fantastic. When we're talking about the opening for Avatar: Fire and Ash, consider, Avatar: Way of Water‘s domestic start essentially the ceiling in regards to a first weekend comp. And that's with a badass winter storm during its second weekend. Worldwide it was $2.34 billion, the third highest grossing movie ever. During the press tour of Avatar: Way of Water earlier this fall, Cameron said he's not committing to a fourth Avatar movie, despite having footage in the can, until the success of the third movie is determined; that's because these movies cost a ton. Avatar: Way of Water was the most profitable Hollywood movie of 2022 earning well over half billion in the black. The combined franchise total from Avatar over two movies is $5.26 billion. Cameron owns the first (Avatar at $2.92 billion), third (Avatar: Way of Water) and fourth (Titanic at $2.26 billion) highest grossing movies of all-time at the global box office; a feat no other filmmaker can boast in the top ten movies of all-time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tara Reid has filed a police report in Illinois after claiming her drink was drugged at a hotel bar outside of Chicago last weekend. The police report offers Reid's most detailed account yet of what happened last Saturday, Nov. 22, before she wound up briefly hospitalized. Reid said the lobby was full of people who were “supposedly YouTubers,” who “had their phones out and the whole thing felt suspicious, but I didn't know what was going on.” He sat next to her, they spoke, and when Reid said she was going to step out for a cigarette, the influencer said he would go with her. “We went out for a smoke, exchanged numbers, and came back, and there was a napkin over my drink,” Reid said, per the police report. “Then the last thing I remember was drinking that drink and seeing a couple sitting next to us. The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital around 8 hours or more later not knowing where I was or anything that happened. Reid claimed that the influencer she sat next to later texted her videos of her at the hotel after the alleged drugging (ostensibly referring to the footage obtained by TMZ that showed Reid slurring her words and sliding off a wheelchair, before a medical team took her out on a stretcher). LAPD Says Dead Teen Found in D4vd's Tesla an ‘Investigation Into Murder': Report Hear Bob Dylan Perform a Traditional Folk Ballad for the First Time in 34 Years The police report ended with her saying, the influencer “also told me I called security on him and he also confirmed that I only had one drink.” Despite being hospitalized, Reid still attended the autograph event on Sunday, Nov. 23, where she posed with fans who'd bought tickets to meet her.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It turned out to be a historic night for the Irwins! Fan-favorite Robert Irwin has officially won “Dancing with the Stars.” The win arrives ten years after Bindi earned her own historic Mirrorball trophy during season 21 with Derek Hough. Now, Robert has added a second shining prize to the family's legacy. Robert's victory capped a heated three-round, three-hour live finale in Los Angeles on Tuesday evening. The 21-year-old overcame a painful rib injury to defeat fellow finalists Jordan Chiles, Alix Earle, Dylan Efron, and Elaine Hendrix. His emotional season, which began with a visit to his father's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in August, made him a fan favorite from the start. By the final night, his win felt inevitable. His judges' choice quickstep to “Are You Gonna Be My Girl” by Jet showed clean footwork and a strong frame. His freestyle, performed to Avicii's “The Nights” and Sam Sparro's “Black & Gold,” leaned into full-throttle choreography and explosive lifts. He also excelled in the “instant dance challenge,” where he and partner Witney Carson received their style and song only minutes before performing. Despite entering the show with no dance background, Robert leaned into his natural charisma and physicality. After taking the Mirrorball trophy, Robert said he is heading into an even busier chapter of life. Witney chimed in that she will be with him soon. “Witney's coming down to Australia,” Robert said, as the dancer joked, “You're not getting rid of me that easy.” “I've been able to write my own legacy with Witney as we tell stories of positivity, vulnerability, passion and fun.” He also shared that this journey has been years in the making. A recently resurfaced 2015 video showed young Robert backstage during Bindi's winning season, saying he hoped to compete on the show someday.

Rogue Pictures and Inaugural Entertainment are set to release director Andre Gaines' psychological thriller in theaters nationwide Jan. 2, 2026, The Hollywood Reporter has exclusively learned.

Clay also deals with the potentially life-altering impact of a chance encounter with seductive Lula (Mara), whom he meets on a New York City subway ride. Benjamin Flaherty's Feature Doc 'Shuffle,' a SXSW Grand Jury Winner, Debuts Theatrical Trailer Gaines helmed the movie from a script he co-wrote with Qasim Basir that is based on Amiri Baraka's play Dutchman. “The Dutchman is a bold, electrifying adaptation that captures the raw power of Amiri Baraka's play with unflinching style and urgency — exactly the kind of provocative, conversation-starting cinema that audiences are starving for right now,” says Inaugural Entertainment founder Kevin Weisberg. “For Inaugural Entertainment it is the exact type of film we can't wait to put in theater.” Marc [Danon], Mike [Arrieta], Kevin and Ryan [Adams] have been champions of this film since day one, which means the world to me.

Cindy Crawford's former '90s runway rivals Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss have all served as ambassadors for the Barcelona-based label.

Across Brazil, people celebrated in bars and public squares that warm Carnival Sunday night as if the country had just won the World Cup. Only weeks later, “The Secret Agent”, directed by Kleber Mendonça Filho, took home Best Director and Best Actor (for Wagner Moura) at the Cannes Film Festival. By early 2025, a sense of rebirth permeated the industry. With three major international victories in a row — the Oscars, Cannes, and Berlin, where Gabriel Mascaro's “The Blue Trail” won the Grand Jury Prize — Brazilian cinema seemed to have rediscovered a long-awaited sense of stability. Yet as the year draws to a close, those red carpets and golden trophies haven't translated into greenlights for those working behind the cameras. The very system that made this resurgence possible is now stalling — and must be jump-started to deliver on the promise of a strong, steady industry symbolized by Salles' Oscar win. Oscar-nominated “I'm Still Here” producer Rodrigo Teixeira summed up the moment with both excitement and caution. “Brazilian cinema is enjoying an incredible level of visibility — maybe the best in decades — but that doesn't mean the system works,” he said. “We need to make films consistently, not just when the political winds blow our way.” Teixeira, who works across Brazil, Europe, and the United States, has a rare vantage point, knowing the inner workings of three production ecosystems. A study by the MPA (Motion Picture Association) and Oxford Economics found that Brazil's audiovisual industry now generates about R$ 70 billion a year (roughly $1.3 billion U.S.D.) and supported 608,970 jobs in 2024 — more than the country's automotive sector. Ana Paula Sousa, a journalist and film professor at ESPM-SP, noted that Brazil's model is unique in its scope. “No other Latin American country has such a comprehensive system, from screenwriting to distribution. The problem is that it's become too slow,” she said. Each step — project evaluation, funding approval, auditing — has piled up in endless bureaucratic queues, delaying production by years. “Many of the agency's most experienced professionals left during years of institutional dismantling, and the new teams are still finding their footing,” she explains. Some of the money is frozen due to budgetary or legal impasses. Meanwhile, producers are racking up costs and missing deadlines for international co-productions. Behind the award-season euphoria lies a stubborn math problem. A study presented at the Rio2C conference in April revealed that streaming platforms in Brazil earn more than R$ 75 billion annually, yet only a tiny fraction of that money returns to independent production. The long-debated VOD (video on demand) regulation bill aims to correct that imbalance. The bill, approved by Brazil's lower house in October, requires foreign streaming companies to contribute a percentage of their revenue to national productions. But compromises between government and corporations have diluted the intended impact. Industry estimates suggest that out of R$ 75 billion in total revenue, roughly R$ 1.4 billion should flow into the FSA — but after exemptions and deductions, the real number won't exceed R$ 185 million a year. “That's nowhere near enough for a market this size,” said Mauro Garcia, executive director of BRAVI, which represents more than 600 independent producers. That weakens the fund's public role and reduces room for truly independent production.” In other words, a law designed to democratize the market could end up reinforcing its inequalities, a side effect already seen in other countries. “No one wants to enter a market where the rules change every year,” Teixeira said. “Cinema depends on trust, not surprises.” That legal instability, combined with the slow pace of public funding, has created a paralyzing climate. Award-winning filmmakers return home to find a system incapable of supporting them. For mid-size producers — those without access to international funds — each new public grant cycle brings renewed hope, followed by years of waiting. “Brazil doesn't just need more money; it needs a reliable calendar. If calls for projects came out every April, producers could plan ahead. Right now, they live off rumors.” Teixeira agreed, calling it “an annual lottery with no draw date.” The situation worsens because many state and municipal funds depend on federal disbursements, creating a domino effect of delays. Small production companies often downsize or fold, shrinking the labor market. Paradoxically, it remains one of Brazil's fastest-growing sectors in revenue, as noted by the MPA and Oxford Economics. The market generates wealth but not stability; it's large and labor-intensive yet still precarious. While Congress debates VOD regulation and the restoration of the FSA, another challenge looms: rebuilding Brazil's film ecosystem after years of political dismantling and economic crisis. According to studies by Ancine, BRAVI, and Tela Viva, film production fell by roughly 80%, with shoots halted, funding calls suspended, and dozens of independent producers shutting down. Reports by UniCEUB (Brasília University Center) based on Ancine data recorded a 35.3% drop in film releases from 2019 to 2020, while trade publications estimated that around half of production companies laid off staff at the height of the crisis. Bolsonaro went further: on his first day in office, he abolished the ministry altogether, dismantled cultural councils, and froze audiovisual funds. One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said recent funding programs have prioritized identity-based criteria — race, gender, geography — without equally strong technical evaluation mechanisms. Brazil is striving to correct decades of invisibility for Black, Indigenous, and female filmmakers while trying to rebuild a bureaucracy that works. “Affirmative policies are essential, but they need structure and training behind them. Otherwise, we build inclusion without support.” That gap is what institutions like Projeto Paradiso, a nonprofit dedicated to developing Brazilian talent and screenwriting, aim to fill. “Our focus is on preparing professionals to engage with the global market,” said Josephine Bourgois, executive director of Projeto Paradiso. In just over five years, the initiative has supported more than 500 projects and scholarships, connecting young writers and producers with international programs. “It's not enough for Brazil to have great ideas,” she added. “Those ideas need to travel and be understood abroad.” Projeto Paradiso's work highlights that middle ground between public policy and market logic, a bridge in an otherwise fragmented ecosystem. “When there's a gap between funding cycles, professionals lose momentum,” Bourgois said. The metaphor neatly describes Brazil's current predicament: preventing its international momentum from fading while domestic gears still grind. Institutional reconstruction also runs through Ancine, now trying to rebuild its staff and credibility. In November, the agency announced a new calendar of funding calls and a plan to simplify accountability processes — steps producers see as positive, though still insufficient. “It takes more than political will,” said BRAVI's Garcia. Many public servants have left, and those who remain are overworked. What we need is regulatory intelligence and modern management.” Brazilian cinema knows this cycle of collapse and revival all too well. By the decade's end, Bruno Barreto's “Four Days in September,” Fábio Barreto's “O Quatrilho,” and Salles' “Central Station” were all Oscar nominees; Fernanda Montenegro, a national icon and Fernanda Torres' mother, earned a historic Best Actress nomination. In the early 2000s, Fernando Meirelles' “City of God” scored nominations for directing, screenplay, editing, and cinematography, cementing Brazil's global reputation. The “Retomada” was real — but full maturity still hasn't arrived. Since 2023, Brazil's Ministry of Culture has been working to rebuild audiovisual policy. Initiatives once discontinued, like the Reunião com o Setor dialogue series, have resumed, and there are ongoing efforts to decentralize production beyond Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Many pre-2020 projects remain on hold, and new funding lines are advancing at a crawl. Teixeira sees this moment as a chance to redefine priorities. The rise of FAST (free ad-supported streaming TV) channels — a trend discussed at this year's Rio2C — has opened new windows for Brazilian films and series on digital platforms. Even so, admissions remain below pre-pandemic levels, reflecting a slow transition from streaming consumption back to the big screen. Brazilian cinema closes 2025 with rare global visibility — and a domestic market still under reconstruction. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justin Bieber and his wife, Hailey, put on a united front after the musician was accused of snubbing the model for her birthday. In photos obtained by Page Six, the “Peaches” singer and the Rhode founder were spotted out and about in their white electric G Wagon in Los Angeles on Tuesday. At the time, Justin had not publicly posted anything online about his wife's special day. However, the “Baby” crooner hasn't uploaded anything to his Instagram feed since Nov. 14. While social media users initially believed Justin had skipped out on his wife's lavish birthday party, Hailey proved that her beau was in fact there.

Hailey and the two-time Grammy winner have long battled split speculation since they secretly tied the knot in 2018. Over the summer, an insider shared that Justin's newly released “Swag” album was reportedly to blame for the strain on his marriage. “The intense focus and emotional toll of creating new music had put a strain on their marriage,” a source close to the couple told Us Weekly in August. The insider explained that Justin gets “completely consumed and shuts everything else out” when he's creating new music in the studio.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>David Letterman threw his support behind Seth Meyers after the Late Night host became the latest talk show target of President Donald Trump. An incredulous Letterman then recalled his reaction to Trump's demand, quipping, “I thought, ‘This is just delightful. While Trump has lashed out at Meyers before, earlier this month, the president called on NBC to fire him in a post on Truth Social. Trump accused Meyers of “suffering from an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,” and insisted the comedian had “no talent.” Trump's post was notably shared by his FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, whose previous threats against ABC helped lead to Jimmy Kimmel's temporary suspension in September. Trump's post about Meyers appears to have had little impact. Meyers brushed off the jabs on his show, joking, “I'm also aware that being attacked by the president this weekend doesn't make me special in any way, shape or form. I was simply on the same shit list as Christopher Wray, James Comey, Indiana Republicans, Thomas Massie, Rand Paul, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and former President Joe Biden.” LAPD Says Dead Teen Found in D4vd's Tesla an ‘Investigation Into Murder': Report Hear Bob Dylan Perform a Traditional Folk Ballad for the First Time in 34 Years During the Kimmel debacle, Letterman said, “You can't go around firing somebody because you're fearful or trying to suck up to an authoritarian criminal administration in the Oval Office.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After the artist's successful Breezy Bowl World Tour, Anthony "Ant" Wilson talks about a new album and that anticipated "Verzuz" match with Usher. It was 20 years ago this week (Nov. 29) that 16-year-old Chris Brown vaulted onto the scene with his self-titled debut studio album and triple platinum-certified Hot 100 No. 1 “Run It!” And in celebrating that anniversary, Brown — under the guidance of manager Anthony “Ant” Wilson of Tycoon Music — has achieved various other career milestones during what's become an even more momentous year for the singer-songwriter. Brown kicked off 2025 with the best R&B album Grammy for his latest album 11:11 (Deluxe) — his second win in that category after 13 years. He's now closing out the year with two more nominations for the 2026 Grammy ceremony: best R&B song and best R&B performance for “It Depends” featuring Bryson Tiller, which peaked at No. Prior to that in 2024, Brown picked up his first RIAA Diamond-certified single for “No Guidance” featuring Drake. Of witnessing Brown's second Grammy win, Wilson — a 2025 R&B/Hip-Hop Power Players honoree — told Billboard in August, “Winning isn't everything, but it feels good. Between those Grammy bookends, Brown embarked on what's since been logged by Billboard Boxscore as his highest-grossing live outing to date, the Breezy Bowl XX World Tour. Accompanied by Tiller as a special guest through the run and Grammy-nominated artists Jhené Aiko and Summer Walker on select dates, Brown also welcomed pop-up performances along the way by Usher, 50 Cent, GloRilla, Tyga, Bow Wow, Sexyy Red and Davido during his three-hour, 56-song set. It's Brown's indefatigable energy and love of performing that Wilson first focused on strategically when he became the global star's manager 10 years ago after predecessors Tina Davis and Mike G. “We started off doing club and spot dates,” Wilson recalls. Wilson also created the annual Tycoon Music Festival. Presented this year in association with Live Nation and 313 Presents, the festival marked its sixth anniversary on April 19 at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. Headlined by Brown, the lineup also starred Skilla Baby, Fabolous, Gucci Mane and Wiz Khalifa with surprise appearances from Sexyy Red, G-Herbo, Payroll Giovanni and Tee Grizzley. Based in Las Vegas, as is Brown, Wilson recently spoke with Billboard about what's next on the drawing board for him and his superstar client. What's it like managing such a tireless artist as Brown? We don't sleep too much over here [laughs]. He's in that studio every day until we put out an album. And then the hard part before that is figuring out what songs are going to make the album. Chris also has a billion ideas about different things. She's a friend of mine as well. So I used to help out whenever she needed some assistance. Mike G was there too; we were all together then. But Chris is my brother first then it's business, I don't hope that he wins. So that's why there is no sleeping because I've got to make sure he does. I don't know if there's a blueprint on how to manage an artist. But there is one key thing: understanding the artist and the fans of that artist. Very few artists have made the successful transition from teen to adult star. Why has Brown been able to cross that bridge? He'll take less money just for the production to be what it is. He just wants [his performance] to stand out. Breezy XX was originally three and a half hours. We're going to run into overtime on every show. Like I said before, that's the hardest thing … trying to get things down to where we're both happy [laughs]. A new album coming before this year is out has been rumored given the 20th anniversary. I'll leave it open because he could wake up and say let's put it out next week. There are acting classes, and he's gearing up for that. I also think the Super Bowl would be a great place for him. Have there been any overtures on that front? How has it been navigating the negativity that he still encounters as you work to move his career forward? It's nothing that I'm not used to at this point. I just try to show improvement with work over the words, you know? I also think Chris' fans love him so much because they can relate. He's a real person who's gone through things that others have but he did it in front of the world. So I feel like that's his legacy: going through life with everyone else. I'm not saying no if it makes sense. Beyond your ownership of the Tycoon Festival, what other projects are you shepherding? I also work with 50 Cent in a company called the Green Light Gang. We're also going to build a production company in Shreveport, Louisiana. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Terri Irwin penned a heartfelt Instagram post following Robert Irwin's victory on Dancing with the Stars, the moment took on extra meaning. Her words captured more than pride — they conveyed a mother's joy, a family's legacy, and the powerful emotional resonance behind Robert earning the Mirrorball Trophy alongside his partner Witney Carson. With Robert and Witney's win, Terri's post became a celebration not just of dance, but of heritage, perseverance, and deep-rooted love. As confetti fell and music faded, Robert's win felt like a shared family triumph. Your passion, dedication, hard work, and kind heart got you to this point. Thank you to everyone who supported Robert through this journey, and made us realise that even a zookeeper can learn to dance. Days before the finale, Terri gave fans a preview of what was at stake: heart. In a post she shared via Instagram Reel, she reflected on Robert's childhood, describing him as “the boy full of wonder and adventure,” and called him “your father's son.” She wrote that when Robert danced “for the final time tomorrow,” she would be “holding a lifetime of love in my heart.” Robert's dances with Witney, especially during “Dedication Night,” became more than steps and music. They turned into a tribute to his mom's resilience, and a public acknowledgment of love, loss (for his late father, Steve Irwin), and the family threads that carry on. She admitted, “My body is feeling it right now, Robert's body is feeling it right now,” and that the pair felt like they were “kind of falling apart” from exhaustion. Her pride, love, and faith in Robert transformed what could have been just another win into something deeply human. Robert Irwin's Season 34 victory closed a circle for the family. He and Witney Carson were crowned champions after a tight finale, earning the coveted Mirrorball trophy. Terri's post reflected how much more the win meant when viewed against the Irwin family's history — not just in wildlife conservation, but in dance. This triumph echoes the earlier success of his older sister, Bindi Irwin, who won Season 21 of the same competition years ago. In her own career, Bindi turned the Mirrorball into a symbol of joy, resilience, and emotional openness — and now Robert carries that torch forward. Terri's emotional caption didn't just celebrate the present win — it honored a legacy of family strength, love, and shared achievement. For viewers, it's a powerful reminder that behind contestants and choreography are stories, roots, and real people carrying hope, grief, joy. For Terri, this moment offered public acknowledgment of her love and sacrifices — a validation that a family built on wilderness and compassion can gracefully step into the glitter of the ballroom.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warner Music Group, one of the major labels that sued AI song generator Suno last year for copyright infringement, has signed a licensing deal with the company. The new partnership, which settles their prior litigation, is designed to help Suno move toward a licensed model where users will pay to download songs made on its platform with artificial intelligence. According to the announcement, artists and songwriters will be compensated if they choose to opt in to AI deals, and will retain “full control” over how their music, likeness, and other copyrights are used. Suno has also acquired the concert listings Songkick, formerly owned by Warner, as part of the deal. Notably, the press release imagines a future where Suno launches “new, more advanced and licensed models,” but not fully licensed models, which would require mass industry cooperation. Litigation by Universal Music Group (UMG) and Sony Music Entertainment, the companies that filed the lawsuit against Suno alongside Warner, is ongoing. That suit accused Suno and a similar company, Udio, of training AI on major-label artists like Drake, Bruce Springsteen, and Green Day, saturating the market “with machine-generated content that will directly compete with, cheapen, and ultimately drown out” the originals. Last week, Klay became the first AI music startup to land licensing deals with all three major labels and their publishing arms.

Criterion Collection has just unveiled its 4K restoration of the classic erotic odyssey starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and it now looks better than ever, gloriously, at home. Though “Eyes Wide Shut” is very much one of IndieWire's favorite Christmas movies, we'll be unveiling over the Thanksgiving week conversations with director of photography Larry Smith, second unit cinematographer Malik Hassan Sayeed, editor Nigel Galt, set decorator Lisa Leone, and star and Kubrick mentee Todd Field, aka Nick Nightingale, blindfolded piano player to the sex-crazed elite. “Give up your inquiries, which are completely useless.” Related Stories ‘The Secret Agent' Review: Wagner Moura Tries to Leave History Behind in Kleber Mendonça Filho's Beautifully Remembered Period Thriller Chloé Zhao Knows How to Make You Cry: The ‘Hamnet' Director Digs Deep on Her Surefire Oscar Contender There are few, if any, people more qualified to comment on “Eyes Wide Shut” than Nigel Galt — the man who spent 15 months in a post-production room with Stanley Kubrick before the director's death. Kubrick died on March 7, days after he screened his working cut of the 1999 erotic mystery to Warner Bros. brass and the film's stars, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. By that time, Galt had been close with the Oscar-nominated filmmaker for nearly a decade and was one of his most trusted longtime collaborators. After first working for Kubrick as a sound editor on 1987's “Full Metal Jacket,” he had risen up through the ranks, eventually having a hand in the international re-releases of almost all of the auteur's films. And he was creatively involved on “Eyes Wide Shut” even before shootin, as Kubrick liked his opinion on sound, image, and even music. Galt was also the person most intimately involved in what happened to the movie between Kubrick's death and its July 1999 theatrical release. He not only oversaw the last-minute fixes, like adding final establishing shots, but also was tasked with navigating censorship of the orgy scene — you know, the one where Cruise's Dr. Bill Harford rides out in a taxi to an ominous mansion that plays hosts to a Boschian bacchanalia of masked, depraved sex. Despite demands and moral panic from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA, now known as the MPA), Galt refused to make cuts to the film in order to secure an R rating — resolute that Kubrick never would've permitted them. But it was Galt's idea, as he explained to IndieWire, to insert digital figures into the masquerade sequence to block certain instances of penetration and satisfy the censors. That censored sequence is now widely unavailable to the public, despite ending up in the version that was first released in theaters, when “Eyes Wide Shut” was rated R for “strong sexual content, nudity, language, and some drug-related material.” The new unrated Criterion release, supervised by director of photography Larry Smith, includes no such digital “hooded figures,” as Galt said, finally restoring the film to what Kubrick envisioned in the literal hours before his death. This interview has been edited for length. IndieWire: You spent 15 months with Kubrick in the edit bay after production finished on “Eyes Wide Shut,” but when did you come on the movie proper? Nigel Galt: I was on [“Eyes Wide Shut”] before shooting. I had to wait nine years, or eight years, but he was loyal to his word and phoned me up. I ended up being his go-to man to fix things on the old films. We would fix old foreign versions where optical [negatives] had gotten damaged or there were issues. I got involved in getting a new master of “2001” six-track, supervised it for him, and worked on “Clockwork Orange.” I've actually worked on every film he did in some form or another, so I knew I was going to do [“Eyes Wide Shut”], and I was on it a month before we started shooting. During shooting, I was looking after rushes, the dailies. I was on set most days, being around if he needed me, just doing anything editorial. But we did no editing during shooting. Walk me through what happened from Kubrick screening the movie for Warners up until his death. And he died the next night, on Saturday. In that last conversation, we just talked about the things that needed to be done, which were a few establishing shots we needed to put in. We had, at that point, just found the Ligeti piano piece, so that was a huge thing, because it's so important in the film. How does the Criterion release, which I know you haven't seen in full yet, compare to past home video versions and the prints that were in theaters in 1999? Stanley wasn't around to grade the film, so it was reliant on the experience of his contacts with the laboratory, people who'd worked with him at Deluxe on everything, going back to “Barry Lyndon” and “Clockwork Orange.” When it came to the DVD, it was a different matter, because it was effectively a new domain for a medium. The only difference with this new Criterion one is, I believe, Warners made a new 8K scan from the original neg. That is going to mean that what Larry just did in the regrade will have obvious benefits. Larry graded it on [the Criterion release] the way it should have been graded, which wasn't done before. After Warner Bros. saw the film, there were still changes to be made, and most significantly in demands to censor the orgy masquerade. The problem with Stanley dying is there was no plan B. Stanley and I had a conversation the night before he died, agreeing on everything that needed to be done to the picture, which was very little, because the only thing that was missing were some establishing shots that, when we were making the screening for New York, we just didn't have time to put them all in. But we knew what they were, so all I had to do was add in exterior shots of buildings, like Ziegler's [house], and that was it. Any idea of re-editing the film was never on the cards, because this is a Stanley Kubrick film. Who has the right to change it? We went off down a path I didn't agree with because they got obsessed about the nudity. They were so mundane and ridiculous about it. They had me make changes, and I had to do them because I was told to. You know when he walks through the orgy? Do you know what the MPAA said? He's fucking her up the ass.” I said, “He's taking her from behind!” [Laughs] This is the kind of ludicrousness. We had five screenings with the MPAA, and every time they kept trying to get us to take more out. And then it became clear that this was not going to happen. The premise was, as far as Warners was concerned, they only wanted one release of the film. So whose idea was it to insert these digital figures that block the onscreen sex? I'm trying to think, “How can we put the film out without changing a single frame of the cut?” They waived it all because Kubrick to them is Kurosawa, and they don't interfere in that kind of thing. What would Kubrick's reaction have been if he were alive at the time? As a hypothetical argument, knowing Stanley, he would have said to Warners, “Well, I'll either have to reshoot, or they have to accept it.” But he wouldn't have made cuts, because Stanley had final cut. This was one of the most remarkable things about working with him. What was it like working on “Eyes Wide Shut” with such a small crew? We had a crew of just 55 people. There were no delusions of grandeur if you worked with Stanley. How complicated was that orgy scene to film, and were you on the set for any of it? I never went on the set during it. He wouldn't let me on the set with too many pretty women. It was quite intense from what I know [but] it wasn't any more stressful or harder than anything else. Well, he may not be screaming at people, but he did drive Shelley Duvall to a nervous breakdown on “The Shining.” Apart from when he [chews out] Shelley Duvall, which is pretty brutal, he was a much more thoughtful person. He could be prone to reacting to things, but that wasn't his real raison d'être when he worked. What do you make of conspiracy theories about the movie, whether it was designed as a critique of Scientology or, as Roger Avary once claimed, a movie about child trafficking? Or a critique, even of, Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman's marriage? That's why he wanted a married couple. “Eyes Wide Shut” 4K is now available from Criterion Collection.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Prime Video series adaptation also stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Bobby Cannavale. In a first look from Prime Video at the forthcoming adaptation of Patricia Cornwell's best-selling novels (photos above and below), Kidman is seen starring in the forensic crime thriller that was developed and written for television by Liz Sarnoff (Barry, Lost). Jamie Lee Curtis, Bobby Cannavale, Simon Baker and Ariana DeBose round out the cast, along with Rosy McEwen, Amanda Righetti, Jake Cannavale and Hunter Parrish portraying younger versions of the characters. Here's the logline: “With skilled hands and an unnerving eye, unrelenting medical examiner Kay Scarpetta is determined to serve as the voice of the victims, unmask a serial killer and prove that her career-making case from 28 years prior isn't also her undoing. As Scarpetta pursues justice, she must navigate complicated relationships, including the fraught dynamic with her sister Dorothy Farinelli (Curtis), confront long-held professional and personal grudges, and face secrets that threaten to unravel everything she's built.” Over 120 million copies have been sold worldwide since the character's debut in 1990. The series is produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Blumhouse Television in association with Blossom Films, Comet Pictures, and P&S Projects. David Gordon Green directed five episodes and is executive producer alongside Amy Sayres.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Vince Gilligan first announced that he and Peter Gould were working on a Saul Goodman-focused Breaking Bad spin-off, they initially described their new project as a comedy. During the development process, that plan obviously changed. But it's not hard to see why Gilligan assumed he could go that route. It'd be a stretch to describe Pluribus as an out-and-out comedy. But the more time Carol spends alone, the more Gilligan and his team (including this week's credited screenwriter Ariel Levine and director Gordon Smith) seem to be taking lessons from Looney Tunes. There are moments in this week's “Got Milk” that play like a Jacques Tati film—or like Tex Avery's old MGM “The House Of Tomorrow” cartoon—where modern technology goes haywire, making life more complicated for some overwhelmed dope. Unable to cope any longer with Carol's surly, chaotic energy, they abandon Albuquerque, en masse, leaving behind only a skeletal drone army to respond to any requests Carol might have. The robots prove to be a poor substitute. The first sign that things won't go smoothly comes when Carol makes a call to the Joined around the same time we see them streaming out of Albuquerque in a convoy of cars and buses. The recorded message Carol gets on her phone is anything but. The voice on the line explains the situation, then thoughtfully adds, “Our feelings for you haven't changed, Carol; but after everything that's happened, we just need a little space.” For the rest of the episode, every time Carol calls, she has to sit through this entire answering machine recording with this same addendum. Carol's requests aren't handled all that well either. With the city emptied out and powered down, packs of wild dogs now roam freely through town, scavenging through the garbage. When a drone comes flying in to haul her trash bags away, it struggles with the weight, before getting tangled on a lamppost. Earlier in the episode, she records a video message for her fellow un-Joined, in which—after putting on a business-like jacket and making sure her booze bottles are out of the picture—she lays out what she's learned about “these afflicted people, these Others.” She also issues a warning, saying that if her peers are of the opinion that the collective is making the world better, they should relish that opinion, because, “It may be the last one you ever possess.” She insists that the Others translate her message for anyone who doesn't speak English and then send it to all concerned. “If you don't do it, I can't be held responsible for the biblically shitty mood in which I will no doubt find myself,” she says into the answering machine. Much as with last week's episode, the true cleverness of “Got Milk” comes not just from its wry gags but for how they fit together and push the plot forward. With no confirmation that anyone's listening or that anything she does matters, Carol begins relying on herself more, and the results are astonishing. I mean literally astonishing—as in Carol ends this episode with a look of astonishment on her face. When the wild dogs return and begin digging up Helen's grave—seen in a terrifying, jittery hand-held shot—Carol uses her purloined police car's siren to scare them off. The next day she picks up some concrete slabs at the hardware store, to make sure Helen's final resting place will remain undisturbed. But earlier, when Carol suffers through her trash mishap, she makes a more significant discovery: The dumpsters in her neighborhood are filled with used milk cartons. We never see the Joined eat, but they do drink milk pretty regularly. Carol tracks their milk supply to a local dairy, where she finds a warehouse full of sugary grains in heaping, heavy sacks. Then, in another example of Pluribus playing the “think along with Carol” game, we see her track the sacks containing the milk powder to a local pet-food packager, Agri-Jet. Inside the Agri-Jet warehouse—where it's bitterly cold—she sees something that makes her gasp in horror. We don't see what she sees, of course—just her reaction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly a decade after an anonymous Fast & Furious star called Dwayne Johnson a “candy ass,” turning the e La Familia into a “two Christmases” household, Vin Diesel, who many believe to be the “candy ass” sayer, has offered some unexpected praise of his former Fast co-star. In an Instagram post about The Smashing Machine, Diesel takes a moment to “celebrate Dwayne.” Despite the two having a complicated working relationship, Diesel had nothing but praise for Johnson in the post, writing, “People don't understand what it takes to uphold a global perception every single day. I remember asking our global family who they'd love to see me work with, and a woman named Jan left a comment saying her dream was for me to collaborate with Dwayne.” Jan's suggestion, according to Diesel, led to “one of the most dynamic pairings in cinema, two strong personalities who pushed each other and created something unforgettable.” Those two strong personalities were so combative, apparently, that they had to be separated, leading to a couple of weird shots in Fast 6 and Johnson's Fast spin-off, Hobbs & Shaw. But, Dielsel continues, “When he stepped into Hobbs, he did it with full commitment and left an indelible mark on Universal's character hall of fame.” Diesel is old friends with Smashing Machine subject, Mark Kerr, “one of the first friends” he made in Los Angeles, and who trained Diesel for the first XXX movie. “Mark Kerr is so deserving of this moment… and Dwayne really did it… He brought us back in time and shined doing it.” But for one glorious day in November, no one was a candy ass, and we all smelled what the Rock was cooking.
