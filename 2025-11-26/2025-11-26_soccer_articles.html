                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team icons Tim Howard and Landon Donovan listed Sebastian Berhalter and Brenden Aaronson as players at risk of missing out at the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Sebastian Berhalter made his case for the USMNT roster after a goal and assist against Uruguay. His proficiency on set-pieces could be a valuable weapon for Mauricio Pochettino as well. Despite his performance, Howard and Donovan both acknowledged the reality that the Argentine could go in a different direction next summer. “I'm putting him on the bubble, too. Matt Turner, despite losing his starting job to Matt Freese, is on the team for them and likely serves as a backup if the tournament started tomorrow. Why Malik Tillman Is USMNT's Key to Success at 2026 World Cup. Leeds United's Brenden Aaronson was also labeled on the bubble, despite Howard flip-flopping a little. “You got him on the team?” Donovan replied. “No I'm going to put on the bubble right now. You just talked me out of it with one random question,” Howard remarked. He played against Paraguay and Uruguay in November often getting into dangerous areas, but a lack of quality in the final third let him down. The 25-year-old has registered just one goal in 12 Premier League games this season. Before that, his last goal came on Sept. 13, 2023 in an international friendly against Oman. Given the attacking talent at Pochettino's disposal, Aaronson likely has to prove himself moving forward.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ilias Chair on the Day Everything Changed Berhalter, though, in his limited opportunities under Pochettino and on a weekly basis for his club, has demonstrated a conviction to be part of the Argentine manager's culture transformation. Take last Saturday night inside Vancouver's sold-out BC Place as the latest bit of evidence. LAFC had snatched momentum from the home team in second-half stoppage time, and it felt like Vancouver's wonderful season was slipping away. A pinpoint free kick from LAFC superstar Son Heung-min had tied the score at 2-2, completing a comeback from 2-0 down. In extra time, the Whitecaps were already down to 10 men and out of substitutions when resolute center back Belal Halbouni was forced off with a knee injury, zapping BC Place of its energy. But then there was Berhalter, barking at the home crowd and waving his arms with a contagious, primal energy. He would convert his spot kick and let out another cathartic scream before his side ultimately advanced to the Western Conference final for the first time. Whether you believe that Berhalter has, as they say, that dog in him, or if he's more of a classic underdog, the 24-year-old is precisely what Pochettino wants from a national team player. At that time, Sebastian was only beginning to establish himself with the Whitecaps. Firstly, because he was not playing at a level that would warrant a national team call-up, and secondly, and perhaps more difficult to navigate, would have been the prospect of nepotism. Berhalter would not have been able to justify calling up his son during his nearly six-year term as the national team head coach based on all evidence. Sebastian is a Columbus Crew academy product who couldn't break into the first team and establish himself within an MLS Cup-winning midfield. As the national team's player pool and play style began to take shape under Gregg Berhalter in 2021, Sebastian was struggling as a fringe player with Austin FC, an MLS expansion side. Austin's sporting director at the time, Claudio Reyna, signed Sebastian on loan in March of 2021 and later declined his purchase option. Pochettino's arrival occurred on a parallel timeline to Sebastian Berhalter starting to play the best soccer of his career. After a trade from Austin to Vancouver in 2022, for just $50,000 in general allocation money, he is now a valuable member of a team that is one game away from an MLS Cup final berth. And as Pochettino quickly established that no U.S. player had a guaranteed spot on the national team, a door for Berhalter opened. The Argentine manager, who took the U.S. job after stints with Espanyol, Tottenham, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, was uninterested in coddling star players. Pochettino wanted to build a culture that tore down player hierarchies and catering to individual desires in favor of the team. “We didn't see the desperation,” Pochettino told Andrés Cantor and Fútbol de Primera. Pochettino's answer came during a segment where he and Cantor discussed how players from around the world view the national team as the pinnacle of their professional lives, and that no call-up was to be taken for granted. “But in the end, that mindset that they had — which is not the players' fault — is, ‘Well, they are friendly matches,” Pochettino said. It's worth revisiting Pochettino's responsibilities before he was introduced as the U.S. manager in September of 2024. He had replaced Thomas Tuchel at PSG and inherited a team with Hollywood appeal, in which Lionel Messi played alongside Kylian Mbappé and Neymar. Pochettino's PSG project was one that combined the highest of expectations, both domestically and in the Champions League, with the difficult task of managing some of global football's biggest personalities. Chelsea was another experiment in man management, high-priced talent and little margin for error. With that foundation, Pochettino accepted the U.S. job with the task of fixing a team culture that had gotten too comfortable; where complacency began to undermine the bigger objectives. “What happened is that (in the U.S.) the idea had settled that certain players already had their position secured. It implies that they already take it for granted that there is a secured spot at the World Cup. So these are those things that sometimes I don't understand.” So, yes, Pochettino's squad lists over 22 matches have been favorable to MLS players like Sebastian Berhalter. One surefire way to put pressure on the U.S.'s European contingent of players is to use the performances of undervalued and unsung professionals. It was the perfect situation for players like Diego Luna, Max Arfsten and Cristian Roldan. With Vancouver, Berhalter understands what ownership and accountability feel like. He's a team leader and one of the squad's driving forces. What's notable is that Berhalter has gradually improved in nine senior U.S. team appearances. His technical ability is good, not great. No one is expecting Berhalter, a box-to-box central midfielder, to outplay a seasoned international in the middle of the park next summer. But he has earned the chance to potentially represent his country at the World Cup by personifying what a baseline U.S. national team player should look like: someone that is gritty, overlooked and devoted to the badge. Berhalter has minimized his lack of experience and physical limitations by becoming a dead-ball specialist. Free-kick efficiency is only possible through hours of repetition. Berhalter has put in the work and now has a level of expertise that could see him carve out a place on Pochettino's 26-man squad come May. But he's on pace to be there as an option. As Pochettino has made abundantly clear, to represent this country at a World Cup takes more than stature. Berhalter may have what it takes to earn the ultimate reward in 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For many Americans, family and football are right up there. That's also the case for Green Bay Packers legend Antonio Freeman, who has now added the other kind of fútbol to his list. That's because his son, Alex Freeman, is now a breakout defender for the U.S. men's national team. It was just last week that Antonio bore witness to his son's ability while watching the USMNT take on Uruguay in both teams' final match of 2025. The elder Freeman, a Super Bowl XXXI champion and Packers Hall of Famer, celebrated alongside other parents and a few of his former teammates from a suite at Raymond James Stadium, home of the NFL's Buccaneers. But his mind went back three days earlier, near the end of the Americans' previous win against Paraguay, when the 6-foot-3 Alex rag-dolled three Paraguayan players during a late-game scuffle. "I'd never heard Alex ever talk about him being in a fight," the elder Freeman told me in a phone interview. "Now here I am, seeing him in the middle of a flat-out brawl." The incident ignited something in Alex, his father said, that manifested itself against Uruguay. Having just made a handful of appearances for Orlando City prior to this season, he earned the starting right back job under coach Oscar Pareja and performed so well that he then earned a callup to Mauricio Pochettino's U.S. squad for last summer's Concacaf Gold Cup. A breakout turn in that tournament put Freeman on course to be one of Pochettino's choices for next summer's all-important World Cup, which will be both co-hosted by the U.S. and feature an unprecedented 48 teams – the largest field than any other edition in the 96-year history of the competition. Alex Freeman's play for the U.S. this fall now has him on course to occupy a major role at the biggest event in sports. But hardly anybody foresaw Freeman's rise from MLS prospect to the highest level in the sport in less than a year. "It does not really surprise me," Pareja said of Freeman's breakneck ascent. "Alex has shown a lot of consistency since we got him here in the academy." Alex Freeman has taken full advantage of his time with the USMNT. (Photo by Eston Parker/ISI Photos/ISI Photos via Getty Images) Still, Pareja saw something special in Freeman almost immediately. The former Colombian international and FC Dallas academy boss has a well-earned reputation for identifying young talent. While at FCD, he helped develop eventual World Cup participants Weston McKennie, Kellyn Acosta and Jesus Ferreira. Freeman caught a break when starting right back and 2022 World Cup alum Sergiño Dest, who had recently returned from ACL surgery, was given the summer off to further rehab his knee. And for that, we need to give them a chance and to see how they perform," Pochettino said after the historic win over Uruguay, the first time the Americans scored five goals versus a South American foe. Alex Freeman has certainly impressed USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino. Pareja, in turn, praised Freeman's academy coaches and those with Orlando's development team. And then there are the younger Freeman's all-world genetics. Antonio said his son was a late bloomer and that his growth spurt did come until he was 15 or 16. Alex now stands an inch taller than his 6-foot-2 father. That physique had his high school's football coaches salivating. They were disappointed to learn that Alex's mom forbade him from playing the gridiron version early on. But his world-class athleticism has translated onto the soccer pitch – which was on full display against Araujo, a veteran of the Spanish titans Barcelona. "Being a right fullback, he rarely gets an opportunity to get that isolation. Watching him just ease through the defense — it was just an amazing display of athletic ability, the way he dropped his hips, and was able to change directions. European teams figure to be lining up for his services as soon as the next transfer window opens in January. That could mean staying put in MLS until after the star-making tournament, even if Orlando's nearly $20 million valuation is met by potential suitors this winter. I need to be ready for the most important time in my life." Although father and son won't be able to spend this Thanksgiving together in person, both will be parked in front of a TV, watching their beloved Packers try to beat their division rivals Detroit Lions for the second time this season. Beating Paraguay and Uruguay "hopefully woke up our U.S. fans," Antonio said. We got some young guys and some older guys, a collaboration of great talent, and we're going to put our best out there at the World Cup and try to win it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For Mauricio Pochettino and soccer fans around the world, “The Beautiful Game” is one of passion and high drama. The former Argentina international, who spent much of his playing career in La Liga with Espanyol before coaching the likes of Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, and who is known for his passionate approach, recently told Andrés Cantor how he has realized that soccer is more “entertainment” than drama in the U.S. “It's like American football, baseball, basketball or hockey. So that already describes a little what the difference between football is. Not a little, it describes very graphically what soccer is to football.” “I would love to see my players playing with 70,000 people cheering,” Pochettino said post-game. “And for sure, if we feel proud about them, it would be amazing.” He, again, noted how soccer is seen as “entertainment” in the U.S. before calling on fans “to realize” their importance in the outcome of games. “I think that today, like against Guatemala, it's a thing in our country to see how important the fans are to be in the stadium, to stay with the team, to support, not only through Instagram, social media, or behind the TV,” he said. “It's to be here and translate the energy. And here I think it's time to realize that we need the fans. Thankfully for soccer fans, perhaps the USMNT's newfound passion on the field is something they can latch on to come the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be held across America, Mexico and Canada. The likes of Diego Luna, Cristian Roldan, and Sebastian Berhalter may not be the biggest names, but each brings fire, energy, and leadership that have perhaps lacked in previous rosters. Very much a reflection of their coach, this fiery attitude was on full display late in their recent 2-1 friendly win over Paraguay, when a scuffle between Alex Freeman and Diego Gómez provoked a full-out brawl between both sides, clearing the benches and resulting in Paraguay's Omar Alderete being sent off. These games are gritty and physical, I think this plays into our identity.” Now with under seven months to go until the World Cup, and with the USMNT undefeated in five games, four of which they have won, perhaps this new-look team, led by an ever-passionate Pochettino, can inspire a fresh approach from fans once the tournament kicks off in Mexico City.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States men's national team have qualified for 12 World Cups — 10 through he gauntlet of qualification and two more as hosts. This summer's World Cup makes it a dozen, and the expanded 48-team field, matches on home soil, and talent on the team and in the coaches' box have fans and the federation dreaming big. There are a couple of ways to slice this particular pie. The Americans finished in third place at the first ever World Cup, though that was a pretty primitive affair; The 1930 World Cup was a 16-nation tournament that from which 13 teams competed in part because one, Egypt, missed their boat due a storm. For one thing, it's literally the only knockout win the Yanks have at a tournament and it came against heated rivals Mexico. Sixteen nations qualified for the first World Cup, with two withdrawing and a third, Egypt, missing their ship when a storm delayed their connection. The Yanks were in a three-team group and rode four goals from Massachusetts' Bert Patenaude to the semifinals, where they lost to Argentina. All 16 teams made it to Italy for the second World Cup, and the tournament was played a single-elimination bracket tournament. World War II threw a long pause at the World Cup, and the Yanks failed to qualify in 1938 as they withdrew from their intercontinental playoff qualifier with the Dutch East Indies. They'd finish bottom of their group in 1950 but begin their baffling World Cup mastery of England by beating the Three Lions 1-0 on a goal from Joe Gaetjens. The Columbia University student from Haiti had declared his intention of becoming a U.S. citizen and was thus allowed to play. He'd later return to play for Haiti. 1954 qualifying: The Yanks beat Haiti twice but were beaten twice by Mexico as El Tri took the lone spot from what would become CONCACAF in 1961. 1958 qualifying: The U.S. went 0-4 against Canada and Mexico, finishing with a minus-16 goal differential. 1962 qualifying: A 3-3 home draw with Mexico did not see the scoring form continue in Mexico City, and El Tri won 3-0 to reach the second round. They took two of three points from Honduras (wins were worth two points and draws one) to finish second and bow out prior to the final round. The Yanks won 3-of-4 from Canada and Bermuda, losing in Toronto. 1974 qualifying: Bounced from Group 1, taking a point at home to Canada but losing their other three games. All three teams claimed four points with Mexico in first and both Canada and the Yanks boasting the same goal differential. A playoff in Haiti saw Canada smash the States 3-0. 1982 qualifying: Third again behind Canada and Mexico, eliminated even before beating El Tri in Fort Lauderdale for the final qualifier. Needed a draw or win vs Costa Rica in California to reach the World Cup, five days after drawing Los Ticos 1-1 in Alajuela. Beat Jamaica in the first round, then sealed their spot in Italy thanks to Paul Caligiuri's “Shot Heard Round the World” vs Trinidad and Tobago. This tournament is best left discussed by others. This was the year that minted thousands of passionate USMNT fans, as the Yanks surprised everyone by outlasting Deco's Portugal in the group opener and then knocked rivals Mexico out in the Round of 16. Torsten Frings handball to block Gregg Berhalter on the goal line was somehow not given as a penalty. Look it up if you haven't seen it, because you won't believe it could've been missed by a living, breathing, seeing human being (Yes, still mad). Momentum was neither maintained nor built upon. No, it wasn't an easy group. No, we do not want to talk about two goals in 270 minutes — one from Italy and one from Clint Dempsey. Sorry, we don't make the rules. Unbeaten in the group stage and through to the knockouts because of that Landon Donovan stoppage-time goal, the Americans went to extra time with Ghana in the Round of 16, and it's best we speak no more. We're not supposed to say Group of Death any more because people are uncomfortable with mortality, but oh boy. Revenge against Ghana required a late John Brooks winner, then Jurgen Klinsmann's Yanks looked set to go 2-0 all-time against Portugal at the World Cup when Silvestre Varela scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to force a 2-2 draw. Still, that was enough for a knockout round berth. Tim Howard's Matrix-like day was not enough. This team had so much talent and played with its food. A coaching change from Jurgen Klinsmann to Bruce Arena during qualification didn't stop them from losing at home to Costa Rica and drawing Honduras and Panama away. A blowout of Panama in Matchday 9 opened the door to the throne room if they could just beat Trinidad and Tobago's B team in Couva on October 10, 2017. Christian Pulisic, of course, then scored the lone goal against Iran and Berhalter's team were onto the Round of 16. Down 2-0 thanks to a nothing first half, the Yanks rallied to within one through sub Haji Wright and out-attempted the Dutch 18-11 but lost 3-1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the midst of his contract renewal talks, Real Madrid, the team that trained him, showed interest in signing him as a free agent at the end of his contract, which was set to expire in 2026. However, one detail caused a radical change, and he signed his renewal with the French team. According to Diario AS, Achraf Hakimi was approached by Real Madrid amid his contract renewal talks with PSG. However, the departure of Kylian Mbappe gave the French team a lot of salary cap space and allowed them to offer an irresistible salary and cornerstone role, which scuppered his return to the club where he started his career. Hakimi did not return to Real Madrid, yet he has never hidden his passion for the Spanish team. Despite this, he consistently shines at Paris Saint-Germain as a key player, earning him the African Ballon d'Or 2025 award. However, he failed to make much of an impact, playing only 17 games. In the mixed zone, legend Claude Makélélé asked the Moroccan how Los Blancos had let a player like him go, to which he replied: “It wasn't me who decided to leave Madrid. It was them who made that decision,” Hakimi said, via DAZN in July 2025. Salah, Hakimi and three other stars set to miss a significant part of the season due to the Africa Cup of Nations Although he excelled as a wing-back, his perceived lack of defensive commitment did not reportedly align with Zidane's plans. However, Achraf Hakimi has since developed into a complete player at Paris Saint-Germain, demonstrating Real Madrid that letting him leave was a clear mistake.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Explore our soccer expert's Olympiacos vs Real Madrid predictions, pre Wednesday's 3pm ET Champions League clash (11/26). Our betting expert expects an open game to produce goals for each team, with Ayoub El Kaabi and Jude Bellingham among the scorers. Olympiacos know that they cannot settle for a tie in this match. That should ensure plenty of attacking intent from the hosts, which may lead to a more open contest. Their last two Champions League fixtures have seen both teams score. Four of their last six matches in all competitions have done likewise. Olympiacos boss Jose Luis Mendilibar is certainly no stranger to this opposition. His Eibar side once famously stunned Real Madrid 3-0 in La Liga. His direct approach should ensure a difficult night for the visiting defence. However, Olympiacos have conceded nine times across their last three European fixtures. El Kaabi was pivotal to Olympiacos' stunning 2023/24 Conference League triumph. He scored five goals against Aston Villa in their semi-final tie. Real Madrid could be especially vulnerable to his pace and physicality in this game. They've allowed at least 1.2 xG in each of their last three matches. That will encourage El Kaabi, who is a good choice for an anytime goalscorer. Kylian Mbappe has largely been Real Madrid's main attacking threat this season. Bellingham has also registered at least one shot on target in each of his last nine Real Madrid appearances. He has scored in four of his last six matches for the Spanish giants. Despite favourable home fixtures against Pafos and PSV, Olympiacos have struggled to make an impact in this competition. They only managed to draw those games despite being dominant in periods. Away defeats to Arsenal and Barcelona leave them outside the top 24. The Greeks have won their last two domestic fixtures, but they need to pull of a serious upset on Wednesday. They might be catching Real Madrid at an opportune time. Xabi Alonso's side have gone three matches without a win in all competitions. Olympiacos expected lineup: Tzolakis, Rodinei, Retsos, Pirola, Ortega, Mouzakitis, García, Martins, Chiquinho, Podence, El Kaabi Real Madrid expected lineup: Courtois, Carreras, Huijsen, Asencio, Valverde, Camavinga, Guler, Vinicius, Bellingham, Brahim, Mbappe</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The usual regulations are clear: a player must be suspended for “at least three matches or an appropriate period for assault, including elbows, punches, kicks, bites, spitting, or blows to an opponent or a person other than a match official”. A choice described as "offensive to the public's intelligence" by The Guardian, given that CR7 has been expelled 12 times with his respective club teams. The same newspaper does not beat around the bush: "FIFA needs 2026 to be a commercial success in a nation that will require big names to embrace a sport that is not as popular as others". FIFA, moreover, was not exempt from criticism even during the summer Club World Cup, in which Messi's Inter Miami participated despite not having won the 2024 MLS Cup: which was won by LA Galaxy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just over a year since U.S. Soccer announced the technical staff additions to complement newly minted head coach Mauricio Pochettino, first assistant coach Jesús Pérez—who's been alongside Pochettino for nearly two decades—has sky-high expectations for the U.S. Men's National Team as it prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on home soil. "We are trying to be very efficient in possession, take advantage of set-pieces, penalties; those things that can define a short tournament,” Pérez added. There are different moments and examples of teams that did it, they made it, and then wherever football take us, that will be the final result, but we don't want to set any limit.” Pérez's unabashed belief in Pochettino's coaching philosophies and strategies stems from the pair's lengthy history together. The 54-year-old Barcelona native has been alongside Pochettino at each stop of the latter's managerial career, spending time with RCD Espanyol in his native Barcelona, Southampton FC, Tottenham Hotspur FC, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea FC. Even before joining forces with Pochettino in 2010, Pérez's football-first upbringing and desire to understand the athlete, both in and out of their respective element, helped develop his current coaching approach. Though there's nothing like football for Pérez, he's valued learning from other sports and especially appreciates watching the Olympics with its four-year cycle similar to the World Cup. “I was curious how to coach just one athlete,” Pérez explained. “I was able to plan a whole season for only one guy with multiple training sessions, power sessions, all those things. That background helped me understand, and that's why I'm a fan of the individual work, because I really believe a player can improve until he retires. Improvements both individually and collectively have been evident throughout Pochettino's first full year at the helm. Pérez credits the USMNT's recent run of form to Pochettino's desire focus less on who they are playing but rather how they are playing. “But when I say energetic, [I mean] a team that cares very little about the opponent, a team that is focused week in, week out to improve ourselves, knowing that in front [of us] we have different types of rivals. We want to be able to compete against another team, sometimes using different approaches, but not because we change the approach but because the opponent forces you. A team that is reactive can [challenge] us as well. We have a holistic approach to the game, and obviously the players' [mental] states and qualities will dictate what we can do more. That's why we care very little about the opponent. We want them to be focused on themselves and how we can be better in every single phase of the game.” “The most important thing is the players' state of mind, because whatever your mind is able to fight against in a short tournament will be very, very important,” Pérez said. We as a staff, we are going to be prepared to help them in between training sessions, in between matches, during the match, with every single proven strategy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo is now free to play at his sixth World Cup finals It raised eyebrows, but probably didn't come as a huge surprise. Cristiano Ronaldo is available to play for Portugal in their opening matches at the World Cup, despite his red card against the Republic of Ireland. Because Fifa decided to suspend for one year the final two matches of his suspension. Under Fifa's disciplinary code for violent conduct, Ronaldo should have received a three-match ban for elbowing Dara O'Shea during Portugal's 2-0 qualifying defeat earlier this month. Yet Fifa's disciplinary committee said it took into account that he had not received a red card in his other 225 international appearances. He served one match in the final qualifier against Armenia. So Ronaldo is free to join arch rival Lionel Messi at the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada next summer. There is a clause in the disciplinary code which effectively gives Fifa the right to cut or cancel any ban as it sees fit. And Article 25 states "the relevant Fifa judicial body may scale down the disciplinary measure to be imposed or even dispense with it entirely". There has not been a World Cup reprieve quite the same as Ronaldo's, where a three-match ban has remained in place but partially suspended. But there several other examples of Fifa looking kindly upon players, reducing their ban from the mandatory punishment. In 2014, France defender Laurent Koscielny was sent off for slapping Ukraine's Oleksandr Kucher in the first leg of the World Cup play-off. Like Ronaldo, Koscielny was automatically banned for his country's final qualifying fixture. Fifa gave him a one-game ban, meaning he could play the second match against Cameroon - a 4-0 win in which he scored twice. Towards the end of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, Netherlands midfielder Phillip Cocu was sent off for an alleged retaliatory elbow on an Albania player. Japan's Makoto Hasebe was sent off for an elbow at the end of qualifying for the 2010 World Cup, and like Cocu was given two matches. Likewise, Iran's Saeid Ezatolahi was sent off for bringing his boot down on the head of an opponent in their penultimate qualifier. In 2002, Mexico midfielder Jesus Arellano was given a three-match ban for violent conduct against Costa Rica. Arellano's ban was reduced and he only had to sit out their opener. Fifa to keep top seeds apart in World Cup draw 'It would be the biggest middle finger' - Chilwell eyes World Cup But Fifa decided to give James two games and she was able to return as a substitute in England's 1-0 final defeat by Spain. England also had success with Wayne Rooney's suspension for Euro 2012. The Manchester United striker was given a three-match ban for kicking Miodrag Dzudovic during a 2-2 draw with Montenegro in the final qualifier. There are a few cases, and players who are sent off in their last competitive game before the finals will always miss at least one game. At the 2006 World Cup, Germany striker Mike Hanke was very unlucky. Germany didn't have another competitive game for a whole year, as hosts of the 2006 World Cup, but Fifa stuck with the mandatory two-match ban. Hanke was still picked for the squad even though he was suspended, and made one 19-minute appearance - ironically in another third-place play-off - as Germany beat Portugal. Ecuador's Moises Caicedo and Argentina's Nicolas Otamendi will have to sit out the first game of next year's finals after being sent off for two bookable offences in their final qualifying matches. Miranda (Brazil) and Cristian Rodriguez (Uruguay) in 2010 were both omitted because they had suspensions to serve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Haiti's recent qualification for the FIFA World Cup—the first since 1974—has reignited a sense of pride and unity in a country grappling with years of instability, gang violence, political dysfunction and mass migration. CAP-HAÏTIEN — In a country weighed down by hunger, gang violence and political chaos, Haiti's qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup has sparked something rare: joy. For the first time in more than 50 years, the national football team's berth on the world stage has pierced through daily fear and exhaustion, offering a breath of unity and pride Haitians haven't felt in years. ​​At home, the qualification felt like a pain reliever. Michelet Jerôme, 42, often worries when his 8-year-old son heads to school in Port-au-Prince, a city largely controlled by gangs, but that anxiety has eased for a moment. “For once, I'm not so stressed out,” Jerôme said. “I was so happy, I spent the night tweeting and went to sleep at 3:00 a.m.” Jerôme told The Haitian Times. Long battered by disasters, dysfunction and despair, Haitians have had few national wins to rally around. Now, after Les Grenadiers clinched a long-awaited World Cup berth, football is filling that cultural void—giving Haitians everywhere something to celebrate. On Nov. 18 in Willemstad, Curaçao, Haiti secured its spot with a 2-0 win over Nicaragua. Goals from wingers Louicius Don Deedson and Ruben Providence sealed the victory, sparking celebrations from Port-au-Prince to the diaspora. Guns, here's how they buy it, my friend. The diaspora is a little guilty in selling guns. Jonas Gustave, a Youtuber who blogs about gang activities History & Current State taking back control “For the people stuck at home, it gives them value, makes them feel like they're not cursed,” James Beltis, a sociologist based in Port-au-Prince, said. “Qualifying makes them feel like they're here, things can get done, we're not dead,” Beltis added. “It's a breath of fresh air for the people. It makes them think about positive things instead of gangs, kidnappings, elections. It's more about something entertaining now, soccer, joy.” It's a similar sentiment in the diaspora, where people of Haitian descent often wake up to heartbreaking headlines from home — gang violence, natural disasters and political turmoil. “We're probably going through Haiti's darkest moment in history politically,” said Oz'mosis Amadeus, a self-employed marketing specialist based in Palm Beach County, Florida. “We were still able to get this done. It feels like we can see Haiti now, feels like regardless of anything going on we're going to be alright.” That historic moment in West Germany marked Haiti's brief emergence into the global spotlight. Haiti's roster was mostly composed of homegrown talent playing in local clubs, a different profile from today's squad, which draws heavily from the diaspora. Nevertheless, the Haiti National Football team left an impression. In their first game against Italy, fans cheered for them every time they touched the ball on June 15, 1974 at Olympiastadion in Munich. In its following game, Haiti suffered an embarrassing 7-0 loss to Poland on June 19, 1974. But the national team turned heads again in their last game, scoring against another powerhouse, Argentina, in a 4-1 loss on June 23, 1974. “We were very happy with our World Cup,” former Haitian midfielder Philippe Vorbe told FIFA. “Especially for amateur players from a far away little country in the Caribbean. It was wonderful for us and the memories of this experience will live forever.” Now, more than five decades later, the moment repeats itself—this time with a generation that has only known a country in crisis. The 2026 World Cup, hosted across the United States, Canada and Mexico, and set to kick off in June, will give Les Grenadiers a rare opportunity to celebrate their resilience and their football talent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Enzo Maresca's Chelsea team have just beaten Barcelona 3-0 at Stamford Bridge, and the coach should be very proud. His previous peak was perhaps the Club World Cup win against PSG back in July, and according to the Blues coach, that was all part of Chelsea's preparations for this: Last year, we were playing in the Conference League, and I said many times that for me personally, if you want to build a winning mentality, there is only one way. Because otherwise, if you don't win games, it's difficult to convince the players, guys, we are building a winning mentality. But when we don't win, it's difficult. And now we are trying to do exactly the same. For sure, the players are better players in this moment compared to last season, because we spent more time together.” Enzo Maresca also discussed the fact that his team kept a clean sheet against Barcelona, meaning they had broken a pretty impressive streak set by the Catalan side. The Blues were serenaded by their fans all night, and Estevao's performance in particular got him some amusing treatment from the supporters… Your email address will not be published.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As FIFA's expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup approaches, the organization's complex tournament draw is once again raising questions from fans trying to understand how teams are placed into groups. FIFA divides qualifying teams into four tiers, known as "pots," largely based on world rankings. Pot 2 includes additional top-ranked countries: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Japan and Switzerland. Pot 3 represents mid-tier nations, while Pot 4 includes lower-ranked teams and nations that have not yet qualified through playoff tournaments. From there, FIFA creates 12 World Cup groups, labeled A through L, with four teams in each. The host nations receive special placement and are assigned to predetermined groups rather than being drawn at random. By the end of the process, each group contains exactly one team from each pot. ZURICH, SWITZERLAND - OCTOBER 02: FIFA World Cup 2026 Official Match Ball at the Home of FIFA on October 02, 2025 in Zurich, Switzerland. After group play concludes, the top two teams from each group and the eight best third-place finishers will advance to a round of 32 teams. FIFA then uses another structured bracket to ensure the highest-ranked teams do not face each other in the early knockout rounds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spain, Argentina, France and England – the top four in descending order – are to be split into different brackets in the 48-team finals tournament, with the aim of preventing Spain from facing Argentina, or England from playing France, before a possible final. The bracketing will hold only if those teams win their groups next summer, and echo the placements awarded to tennis's top seeds in grand slam tournament draws. Fifa said the pathways would be drawn randomly, meaning it would not necessarily be Spain (No 1) v France (No 3) and Argentina v England. The group stage will comprise 12 groups of four teams. Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, US, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany. Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia. Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Côte d'Ivoire, Uzbekistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa. Fifa's rules dictate that in principle no team should face another side from the same confederation in the group stage but that is impossible for European teams, with Uefa providing 16 sides. This creates the prospect that England could be drawn against Scotland, who have been placed in pot three, or alternatively Wales or Northern Ireland shouldthey come through the playoffs. No more than two European teams will be in any group. This will determine who plays where and at what time. According to Fifa, this process will be undertaken “to ensure the best possible conditions for all teams while, where possible, enabling fans all over the world to watch their teams play live across different time zones”.</p>
