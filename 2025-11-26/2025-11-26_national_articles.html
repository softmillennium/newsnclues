                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Visitors watch a sunset on rock ledge near Taft Point in Yosemite National Park, Calif., Oct. 30, 2025. WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Park Service said Tuesday it is going to start charging the millions of international tourists who visit U.S. parks each year an extra $100 to enter some of the most popular sites, while leaving them out of fee-free days that will be reserved for American residents. The announcement declaring “America-first entry fee policies” comes as national parks deal with the strain of a major staff reduction and severe budget cuts, along with recovering from damage during the recent government shutdown and significant lost revenue due to fees not being collected during that time. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a post on the social platform X that the changes make sure U.S. taxpayers who support the park service “continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations!” Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel. The announcement follows a July executive order in which President Donald Trump directed the parks to increase entry fees for foreign tourists. “There's a lot to unpack in this announcement, including many questions on its implementation – all which NPCA will raise with the Department of Interior,” Kati Schmidt, a spokesperson for National Parks Conservation Association, said in an email. The U.S. Travel Association estimated that in 2018, national parks and monuments saw more than 14 million international visitors. Yellowstone reported that in 2024, nearly 15% of its visitors were from outside the country, which was down from 30% in 2018. The “resident-only patriotic fee-free days” next year include Veterans Day, which was one of the parks' eight free days open to everyone in 2025. The Department of the Interior had announced those days by saying they wanted to ensure that “everyone, no matter their ZIP code, can access and enjoy the benefits of green spaces and our public lands.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live from the scene as a fire spreads across seven high-rise apartment buildings in a Hong Kong housing complex, killing 13 people and leaving others trapped, according to the city's fire services. HONG KONG (AP) — Hong Kong's deadliest fire in years blazed through high-rise apartment buildings into the night Wednesday as the city's leader confirmed at least 36 people, including a firefighter, had died and another 279 people were reported missing. Hundreds of residents were evacuated as the blaze spread across seven of the eight buildings in a housing complex in Tai Po district, a suburb in the New Territories. Bright flames and smoke shot out of windows as night fell. Investigators will be looking into factors including whether material on the exterior walls of high-rise buildings met fire resistance standards, as the rapid spread of the fire was unusual, authorities said. “Police and the Fire Services Department have already set up a dedicated investigation team to investigate” the fire and its cause, John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, said. The probe includes whether criminal elements are involved. He also urged efforts to minimize casualties and losses. It was built in the 1980s and had recently been undergoing a major renovation. Firefighters work to extinguish a fire which broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a residential estate in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong's New Territories, Wednesday, Nov. 26 2025. Firefighters work to extinguish a fire which broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a residential estate in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong's New Territories, Wednesday, Nov. 26 2025. Fire chiefs said high temperatures at the scene made it difficult for crews to mount rescue operations. A column of flames and thick smoke rose as the blaze spread quickly on bamboo scaffolding and construction netting that had been set up around the exterior of the buildings. Authorities said that hundreds of firefighters, police officers and paramedics were deployed. Firefighters aimed water at the intense flames from high up on ladder trucks. The blaze, which started mid-afternoon, was upgraded a level 5 alarm — the highest level of severity — as night fell. Authorities said that conditions remained very challenging for firefighters. “Debris and scaffolding of the affected buildings (is) falling down,” said Derek Armstrong Chan, deputy director of Fire Service operations.

Smoke rises after a fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a residential estate in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong's New Territories on Wednesday, Nov. 26 2025. The fire department said that it received “numerous” calls requesting assistance. It said some residents remained trapped as of Wednesday night. The dead included a 37-year-old firefighter, while another received treatment for heat exhaustion, Director of Fire Services Andy Yeung said. District officials in Tai Po have opened temporary shelters for people left homeless by the fire. “I've given up thinking about my property,” a resident who only provided her surname, Wu, told local TV station TVB. “Watching it burn like that was really frustrating.” Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight in Hong Kong at building construction and renovation projects, though the government said earlier this year that it would start phasing it out for public projects because of safety concerns.</p>

Paul Skenes is getting rewarded for his historic performance. In just his second season in the big leagues, the Pittsburgh Pirates flamethrower led the majors with a 1.97 ERA while striking out 216 batters en route to a unanimous National League Cy Young Award victory. Skenes, who is not even eligible for arbitration yet, will receive a record $3.4 million from the pre-arbitration bonus pool that was created in 2022. Pittsburgh Pirates starting pitcher Paul Skenes reacts after striking out Cincinnati Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz to end the third inning at PNC Park. The $50 million pool was implemented in the newest collective bargaining agreement to reward top players who aren't yet arbitration eligible (no more than three years of MLB service). Skenes received $2.5 million alone for winning the Cy Young Award. He made more than $2 million last year for his unanimous Rookie of the Year performance despite not making his MLB debut until May 11. Skenes is under team control for the rest of this decade, but given the Pirates' history of not paying big-time players, his name has already been circulating in the rumor mill. Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes delivers against the Chicago Cubs in Pittsburgh, Sept. 16, 2025. Skenes was linked to the New York Yankees in a report from NJ Advance Media. More MLB records could be well on the way for Skenes, who is set to reach free agency at age 28. The largest deal ever given to a pitcher, both in dollars and years, is Yoshinobu Yamamoto's $325 million over 12 years with the Los Angeles Dodgers. At age 25, he received that deal before even throwing an MLB pitch, having won three consecutive MVP awards in Japan. Pittsburgh Pirates starting pitcher Paul Skenes celebrates with teammates after leaving the Marlins game at loanDepot Park in Miami, March 27, 2025. Ke'Bryan Hayes is second at $70 million, and before that, it was the $60 million given to Jason Kendall in 2000.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum speaks at her first state-of-the-nation address at the National Palace in Mexico City, Sept. 1, 2025. MEXICO CITY (AP) — Mexico unveiled plans Wednesday to build what it claims will be Latin America's most powerful supercomputer — a project the government says will help the country capitalize on the rapidly evolving uses of artificial intelligence and exponentially expand the country's computing capacity. Dubbed “Coatlicue” for the Mexica goddess considered the earth mother, the supercomputer would be seven times more powerful than the region's current leader in Brazil, José Merino, head of the Telecommunications and Digital Transformation Agency. President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her morning news briefing that the location for the project had not been decided yet, but construction will begin next year. “We're very excited,” said Sheinbaum, an academic and climate scientist. “It is going to allow Mexico to fully get in on the use of artificial intelligence and the processing of data that today we don't have the capacity to do.” Merino said that Mexico's most powerful supercomputer operates at 2.3 petaflops — a unit to measure computing speed, meaning it can perform one quadrillion operations per second. Coatlicue would have a capacity of 314 petaflops. Follow AP's coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america</p>

Israel has agreed to return 15 Palestinian bodies for each hostage returned. Israeli soldiers are seen during an army raid in the West Bank town of Tubas, Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025.

A makeshift tent camp for displaced Palestinians is seen through destruction in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip (AP) — Israel handed over the bodies of 15 Palestinians on Wednesday, a day after Hamas returned the remains of an Israeli hostage. This is the latest exchange as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire reached last month, whose first phase is winding down even as violence continues in Palestinian territories. The remains of two hostages, one Israeli and a Thai national who were abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel that ignited the war, are still to be returned. Turkish, Qatari and Egyptian mediators met in Cairo on Tuesday to discuss the second phase of the ceasefire. That is expected to include deploying an armed International Stabilization Force, tasked with ensuring the disarmament of Hamas, a key demand of Israel, and developing an international body to govern Gaza and oversee reconstruction. But major questions hang over nearly every part of the plan and the time frame for implementation of the fragile ceasefire that has held despite accusations of violations by both sides. Separately, Israel's military said Wednesday that it conducted airstrikes and a “broad counterterrorism operation” in the northern part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. It said the operation followed the killing of “three terrorists who took part in terror attacks against IDF soldiers and Israeli civilians.” So far, 345 bodies have been returned, said the Gaza Health Ministry. It is unclear if they were people killed in Israel during the Oct. 7 attack, Palestinian detainees who died in Israeli custody or bodies taken from Gaza by Israeli troops during the war. Israel's military said Or and his wife, Yonat Or, were killed by militants who overran their community of Kibbutz Be'eri on Oct. 7, 2023. Before they were killed, the couple evacuated two of their children, Alma and Noam, from their burning house through a window, said the Hostages Families Forum. The forum remembered Or as a devoted father and talented cheesemaker who spent years working at the Be'eri dairy, eventually managing it. Israeli troops opened fire Wednesday on a group of people in central Gaza, killing a Palestinian man and wounding at least two others, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the casualties. Israel's military said it did not have enough information about the incident to comment. Also Wednesday, the military said its troops targeted a group of six militants in the southern city of Rafah, killing one. Later on Wednesday, the military said troops had killed two “terrorists” – one a member of Islamic Jihad – who had approached the IDF in two separate incidents in southern Gaza. The Gaza Health Ministry said at least 69,775 Palestinians have been killed — 345 Palestinians since the ceasefire — and 170,863 injured in Israel's offensive in Gaza. It does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures, but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry is staffed by medical professionals and maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts. Ahmad Al-Asaad said the operation involved Apache helicopters and military vehicles, saying Tubas was essentially “cut off” by Israeli troops. Last week, Israel's prime minister met with top security officials to discuss a rising tide of Israeli settler violence in the West Bank, which Israel captured alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 war and Palestinians see as central to a future state. A few days earlier, Palestinian attackers stabbed an Israeli to death and wounded three more before being shot down by troops in the latest violence to rock the occupied territory. Turkey's intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin met in Cairo on Tuesday with Qatar's Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egypt's intelligence chief Hasan Reshat to discuss advancing to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, a Turkish security official said. Israel struck Lebanon's capital on Sunday, killing Hezbollah's chief of staff Haytham Tabtabai and warning the Iran-backed militant group not to rearm and rebuild.</p>

Julian Edelman joins Colin Cowherd to discuss Shedeur Sanders' first start in the NFL, the Kansas City Chiefs, and Drake Maye's MVP-like season with the New England Patriots. Kelce, 74, took to social media to praise his youngest son's play this season. "If anyone questions how good Travis is playing; through Week 10 he leads all tight ends in total yardage," Kelce posted on Instagram. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) looks on before the game against the Indianapolis Colts at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, on Nov. 23, 2025. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end was the NFL league leader among tight ends in total yards through Week 10, but fell to second after Week 12. Arizona Cardinals tight end Trey McBride leads all tight ends in both receptions (80) and yards (797). Kelce is second in the NFL among tight ends with 674 yards, with the Indianapolis Colts' rookie Tyler Warren just behind him with 662 yards. The 36-year-old has been resurgent for the Chiefs this season, as he has 54 catches and four touchdowns in addition to his 674 yards. The 10-time Pro Bowler already has more touchdowns than he did last season and, despite his diminished athleticism, has been a reliable target for Patrick Mahomes. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce (87) greets fans after the game against the Indianapolis Colts at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium on Nov. 23, 2025. The four-time All-Pro quickly quashed any retirement rumors last season, as shortly after the team's crushing Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, he announced his return. Last week, Kelce said he would let the Chiefs know his intentions to play in 2026 before NFL free agency begins in March 2026 to give the team ample time to plan their offseason. Kelce had four catches for 43 yards in the Chiefs' 23-20 win over the Colts on Sunday. Follow Fox News Digital's sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Brazilian mother of White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt‘s 11-year-old nephew has been arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for overstaying her visa by decades. Bruna Caroline Ferreria was formerly engaged to Michael Leavitt, the press secretary's brother. The pair has joint custody over their son, CNN reported. Ferreria has lived in the United States illegally since overstaying her visa in June 1999, and her attorney said she is a former recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. She was unable to renew her status during President Donald Trump's first term, the attorney added. The child has lived full-time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born and has never lived with his mother, they added. She was arrested while driving to pick up her son in New Hampshire, CNN reported. The spokesperson also noted Ferreria has a prior arrest for battery. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.” Rodrigues said Ferreira was brought to the U.S. as a child in December 1998. “My family is going through one of the most difficult moments of our lives, and we're reaching out with a humble plea for help,” Rodrigues wrote. “My sister, Bruna, was recently detained by immigration and is now fighting to stay in the country she has called home for nearly her entire life.” Rodrigues said Ferreira's absence has been “especially painful” for her son, “who needs his mother and hopes every single day that she'll be home in time for the holidays.” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin recently told the Associated Press that those under DACA “are not automatically protected from deportations,” and added that “DACA does not confer any form of legal status in this country.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump brushed off concerns about his special envoy Steve Witkoff's engagements with the Kremlin after a new phone call transcript provided rare insight into how the president's top negotiator advised his Russian counterpart. In the October 14 audio recording reviewed and transcribed by Bloomberg, Witkoff counsels top Russian foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov on how Russian President Vladimir Putin should approach a call with Trump. That's what a deal maker does,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One Tuesday evening when asked about the reported transcript of the call. And I would imagine he's saying the same thing to Ukraine, because each party has to give and take,” the president added. The transcript generated concern among some GOP Russia hawks on Capitol Hill who asserted that Witkoff was too much under Russia's spell. Rep. Don Bacon called for him to be fired. “For those who oppose the Russian invasion and want to see Ukraine prevail as a sovereign & democratic country, it is clear that Witkoff fully favors the Russians. He cannot be trusted to lead these negotiations. Would a Russian paid agent do less than he?” Bacon wrote on X. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick called it “a major problem. Trump, when asked if he was worried Witkoff was too “pro-Russian,” said the war could “go on for years,” adding, “Russia's got a lot more people – got a lot more soldiers. Others I would prefer not to comment on at all, as, for example, my conversations with Witkoff are confidential. No one!” he said in comments reported by Russian state media. Brett McGurk, a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under multiple presidents, said as a former negotiator his first thought was the call may have been leaked by a foreign intelligence service. McGurk added that it seemed like negotiators should regroup: “I just see this going sideways if not backwards.” According to Bloomberg's transcript of the call, Witkoff advised Ushakov to encourage his boss to congratulate Trump on a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas when the two leaders spoke. “President Putin congratulated me and the United States on the Great Accomplishment of Peace in the Middle East, something that, he said, has been dreamed of for centuries. Trump's call with Putin took place on October 16 and the two-and-a-half-hour conversation appeared to shift the US president's tone toward Russia after weeks of frustration with a lack of progress toward ending the war. Trump, who would later endorse a freeze in current battle lines as part of a peace settlement, grew frustrated and raised his voice multiple times, the officials said. Witkoff also floated the idea of putting together a “20-point peace proposal” during his call with Ushakov similar to his efforts in Gaza. That eventually led to a 28-point peace proposal that included many concessions to Russia, including Kyiv ceding territory, giving up ambitions to join NATO and limiting the size of its army. After high-level diplomatic talks between the US and Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland, and between the US and Russia in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, the contours of that plan have shifted. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday described the plan as a “living, breathing document.” Witkoff is now expected to travel to Moscow for additional negotiations as soon as next week, according to Trump, who told reporters that the envoy could also be joined by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Trump suggested he would be open to meeting with Zelensky and Putin, but not until the deal is final or in final stages.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you buy an annual membership, we'll give one to someone who can't afford access. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? What could you do with energy that's cheap, clean, and near unlimited? You could live in a home built to your precise needs that stays cozy and cool all year long. You could swim in a heated pool filled with ultra-pure recycled water. You could visit a nature preserve on land reclaimed from mines and farms, teeming with once-endangered animal life. You could plan every weekend outing for the next month, counting on reliable, far-reaching weather forecasts. And all of your garbage would break down into its constituent elements, destined to be reassembled into new shoes, cars, and refrigerators. It also includes upgrades to the power grid, new forms of energy storage, and increased efficiency. This investment has mostly been trumpeted as a way to help limit climate change. Humanity's collective deployment of clean energy and increasing efficiency so far has already helped take some of the worst-case scenarios off the table. However, climate change is a low political priority now. A more compelling case for clean energy is that it's often the best way to get cheap energy, and to get a lot of it. This suite of technologies is taking off around the world — not because of a carbon tax or even environmental concerns, but because clean energy is simply better at meeting the needs of a moment when energy appetites are growing. It's an approach that leads with prosperity and quality of life, while creating a more stable climate in the process. If we make it a priority to get more clean energy, that raises the interesting — and fun — question of what we should do with it. Cheap, clean, plentiful energy doesn't just help people save money on their power bills; it unlocks new industries, makes thorny political problems moot, and helps repair the planet. These use cases are important motivations for why the transition to clean energy needs to happen and how it can bring about a better world for all of us. We can exchange heat and electrons for just about anything on Earth. We can see this play out in the cost and quality of lighting, which, in the UK alone, dropped 99.9 percent since 1700, tracing how economies grew as people shifted from campfires, to kerosene lamps, to LED bulbs, and beyond. “It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter, will know of great periodic regional famines in the world only as matters of history, will travel effortlessly over the seas and under them and through the air with a minimum of danger and at great speeds, and will experience a lifespan far longer than ours, as disease yields and man comes to understand what causes him to age,” said Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, in 1954. “This is the forecast for an age of peace.” Nuclear power didn't make this dream come true. It did provide huge amounts of electricity, but its construction and operating costs rose as other energy sources got cheaper. Meanwhile, environmental activists and some policymakers shifted their energy strategy to conservation rather than expanding the pool of power. Yet, the prospect of producing energy in such vast quantities that its cost is a minor concern is still one that lures scientists, engineers, and investors. And the recent technology trends do give some observers hope that this dream is within reach. “Long-term, I think there's good reason to think that at least lots of places in the world will have much less expensive and more stable energy, especially once they've made the investment in the next generation infrastructure,” said Daniel Vermeer, a researcher at Duke University studying the future of energy. “And I think that's going to happen in a lot of places.” “I think we're looking at double the electricity production,” Vermeer said. So, in the best tradition of economic thought experiments, let's assume a can opener. If we vastly increase our energy supply from current levels, food and water are where we can get the most bang for the British Thermal Unit (BTU). “It's also where people will see benefits the fastest.” The fertilizer used to grow crops alone accounts for 5 percent of the world's greenhouse gases — more than aviation and shipping combined — and most fertilizers rely on natural gas as a feedstock. If we had the power and materials to produce more zero-emissions fertilizer, farmers could extract greater yields from the same amount of land. Otherwise, expanding farms will continue to devour forests and wildlands. The next generation of farming techniques could create similar yields on even smaller plots of land, allowing food to be produced year round, nearer to major population centers or even within them. One approach is vertical farming, where crops are grown vertically in controlled indoor environments instead of horizontally across fields. Many vertical farming techniques are already being used today. But with more cheap energy to run pumps, lights, and fans, we can scale this up further. Water is essential to all life as we know it, and we haven't been doing a great job of judiciously using it. And with average temperatures rising, many regions are poised to see more severe droughts. However, two-thirds of the world is covered in water, and widespread desalination would allow the world to tap into that vast, currently undrinkable supply. But, if there's a lot of cheap power on tap, then desalination could be a primary source of water for some communities, allowing freshwater rivers and aquifers to recharge. It would also resolve many of the political conflicts around water. Instead of raising cows or chickens, you could “brew” milk, eggs, or meat ingredients in fermentation tanks — just like the process of making beer. Companies are already selling animal-free dairy and egg proteins made this way. As renewable power becomes abundant, precision fermentation could scale up, feeding growing populations with a fraction of the land, water, and emissions of traditional agriculture Cultivating cells into whole steaks is starting to become possible, but it's an expensive and involved process. Already, there are seven states that have banned lab-grown meat. “Laboratory agriculture and producing things without animals is possible from a technical perspective, but we have to get a lot more sophisticated about how people make those decisions,” Toone said. Whether or not you're bullish on AI, it's clear that more of our jobs and lives hinge on access to computing power and storage. Right now, data centers are a big part of the story of growing electricity demand, and speculation about their future energy needs is already starting to drive up electricity prices for ordinary people. But with fewer energy constraints, more computing tools could become available to more people, and these resources can then be used to resolve some of our biggest energy and environmental challenges. “I, for one, have become completely convinced that it's necessary to win at AI for national security,” said Neil Chatterjee, a former commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Utilities can require tech firms to pay a deposit to for their future power needs so they don't over-inflate their needs. Operators of these facilities can shift energy-intensive tasks to low-demand periods, though this flexibility may be limited. Their size incentivizes efficient electricity use, and computing will likely grow more energy-efficient over time as the technology improves. AI can further accelerate the clean-energy transition by streamlining permitting applications for wind and solar projects, improving materials design, enhancing weather forecasting, and strengthening models of energy demand. Halting climate change thus means stopping these emissions entirely. And in the increasingly likely scenario where we overshoot our goal of limiting global average temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, it also means deliberately pulling carbon back out from the environment. It's not enough to simply produce more energy; the world needs negative greenhouse gas emissions. Humanity currently spews more than 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. At conventional coal and natural gas-fired power plants, carbon capture systems currently impose a large parasitic load, around a quarter of the generator's power output. That makes it hard to build a business case for carbon capture at fossil fuel power plants. But other industrial processes, like steel production, also emit carbon dioxide, and point-source capture can decarbonize this and other processes that don't currently have an easy zero-emissions alternative. We can also capture carbon dioxide straight from the air. There are already companies developing machines that can filter carbon from the atmosphere. Some businesses are also working on ways to pull carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater. Currently, it costs around $500 per ton to pull carbon dioxide out of the air. “Then societies have to become affluent enough that they're willing to do it and recognize the dangers caused by climate change,” Toone added. Another approach is enhanced weathering, which speeds up natural processes where rocks like limestone react with carbon dioxide in rainwater, forming a chemical bond that permanently locks it away. It's an important raw ingredient for chemicals and materials. This has the potential to become a trillion-dollar industry. Waste is a mounting problem, and many synthetic materials like plastics have no natural mechanisms that break them down, making them a problem that can last for generations. Recycling plastic materials has largely failed to live up to the promise, and the bulk of plastic waste ends up in landfills. Cheap fossil fuels have shrunk the world, allowing people to cross continents and oceans in hours rather than months. How we get around is now the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Four-wheeled vehicles already have a glide path to zero emissions with electrification. The tougher challenges are going to be electrifying or decarbonizing bigger vehicles like ships and airplanes. Right now, most container ships burn some of the cheapest and dirtiest fuels imaginable, but with abundant clean energy, they could draw on cleaner sources of power. These ships may be too big to run on batteries, but with much cheaper, clean electricity, shipping companies can generate hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, or synthetic versions of conventional fuels, moving cargo without the carbon footprint. Climate-friendly flying is still trying to get off the ground. Right now, there aren't any batteries that come anywhere close to the energy density of fossil fuels. Some airlines are deploying electric aircraft on shorter routes. However, without a breakthrough, long-haul flights will need to run on synthetic zero-emissions fuels, which demand vast quantities of low-cost energy. Or, they'll need a mechanism like direct air capture to offset their emissions. With even more energy, we can begin thinking about commercializing promising innovations that exist only in labs or are still on the drawing board. We already 3D print things, but scaling it is pricey and slow. Smarter, custom materials could make industrial printing faster, cleaner, and way less wasteful. Space that's closer — and cleaner Getting to orbit still takes a ton of energy, and today's rocket fuels leave a pretty heavy carbon footprint. Solar power that never sleeps Above the atmosphere, sunlight doesn't quit. Space-based solar collectors could soak up that uninterrupted energy and beam it back to Earth via microwaves. Become a spacefaring civilization And instead of dragging every nut and bolt off Earth, we could mine asteroids for the raw materials already floating out there. Even if we could realize all of the exciting potential of this clean energy-powered future, some new problems could emerge if we're not careful. First, there will be a big dislocation in the job market. There are almost 2 million people in the US working in coal, oil, and gas sectors — mining, building, transporting, and combusting these fuels. Additionally, “abundant” does not necessarily mean “equal” when it comes to energy. In the year 2025, there are still 685 million people in the world who don't have access to electricity, and there's no guarantee that increasing the global supply of energy will benefit them without concerted policies to match. Having more energy could also end up indulging people's worst impulses. Already, we've seen across much of the world that as fuels and electricity get cheaper, people end up driving bigger cars over longer distances, running their thermostats less efficiently, and eating more meat. Valerie Thomas, professor of industrial engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, noted that our recent history shows that we have not used the energy we already have in a judicious way. And in her work looking at some of the poorest populations in the world, Thomas said she found that the key limits to prosperity are often things like local corruption, a lack of prenatal care, not enough vaccines, political instability, and bad economic policies. That said, the world's poorest stand to gain the most from the transition to clean energy, not just for having more useful power in their lives but breathing in less pollution and having more economic autonomy. The post-energy abundance world is not one where every problem is solved, but it's one with greater prosperity, improved human welfare, and generally a more stable climate. The fossil fuel era, and much of human history, was governed by constraints. The age of clean energy is poised to be one that's more limited by imagination and choices, and the remaining solutions will be much more fun to implement.

Former White House chief information officer Theresa Payton joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how OpenTable is surveilling its users and Google's warning to VPN users about a recent security threat. Maybe you order sparkling water, start every meal with an appetizer or prefer dining right when the restaurant opens. Some restaurants are now seeing new AI-assisted tags about diners when they book a table. These tags can note drink patterns, spending levels, review habits and last-minute cancellations. These insights surfaced after Kat Menter, a host at a Michelin-starred restaurant who posts about food under the name Eating Out Austin, spotted the new "AI-assisted" tags at work. Media outlets then confirmed the test with additional restaurants. Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. The AI tags pull from reservation and POS data to highlight patterns like drink choices, spending ranges and dining habits across visits. OpenTable integrates with POS (Point of Sale) platforms such as Toast or Epos. These systems handle orders, payments and timing during a meal. Reporting shows that these items help OpenTable generate AI summaries of non-identifiable guest data when the restaurant uses a supported POS system and has enabled data sharing. You only need an account and matching contact information. Some users who pulled their data through OpenTable's privacy request form saw very limited information. Basic contact details and a list of past reservations were the main items. That suggests the insight level depends on which restaurants use POS integrations and how long they have used them. They may watch for frequent lateness or recurring celebrations. OpenTable's AI-summarized guest insights aim to offer a simplified version of these notes. They highlight drink categories, spending ranges or behavior patterns. However, Menter notes the tags can be off base. Because of this, Menter treats the tags as loose suggestions rather than reliable signals. OpenTable says the AI does not process personal guest data. Instead, it is employed for high-level classification and categorization of large, anonymized data sets. For instance, the AI analyzes various point-of-sale descriptions (like "glass of cabernet") to consistently categorize them as "red wine," "white wine," etc., without ever interacting with specific guest profiles. The platform says these insights can help staff suggest dishes or set a relaxed pace. OpenTable also says the use of POS information depends on the privacy settings you choose, and you can review, adjust or opt out of data sharing at any time. Still, the privacy policy uses broad terms like dining preferences. A TikTok video from a Michelin-starred restaurant host first revealed the AI-assisted diner tags now being tested in OpenTable's Pro tools. "These insights come from a mix of sources — including OpenTable, our restaurant partners, and POS partners — and are limited to non-confidential information." "We also share these insights across our network so restaurants can learn and improve the hospitality experience for everyone, not just individual guests. Through your OpenTable preferences and settings, you can review, adjust, or opt out of data sharing at any time. What we share with restaurants is guided by the choices you've made in your privacy preferences." If a diner is opted in, OpenTable shares your name, contact details, party size and special requests with the restaurant you book. The company also confirms that participating restaurants share POS data with OpenTable. This can include items ordered, bill totals and how long you stayed. OpenTable reportedly shares insights across its broader restaurant network. This applies only where enabled and only for restaurants on the OpenTable Pro plan, and is a feature in Beta. This stops your order history from contributing to future insights. This awareness helps you understand what your apps track. Take my quiz: How safe is your online security? Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. Diners can limit how much data contributes to these insights by turning off OpenTable's point-of-sale sharing setting in their account. Dining out should feel simple, yet today's tech adds a new layer to the experience. These AI-assisted tags give restaurants extra insight, but they also remind you how much of your behavior gets logged behind the scenes. By checking your privacy settings and turning off POS data sharing, you keep more control over what follows you from one meal to the next. With a few quick choices, you can shape what restaurants see and keep your preferences truly personal.

Chefs John McLemore and John McLemore II join 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to show how to deep-fry, smoke, or spatchcock grill a Thanksgiving turkey, plus brining tips and sides from their 'Gather & Grill' cookbook. Thanksgiving is a time of indulgence — so if you're looking to feel fuller with less food, what are your options for packing your meal with protein? Thanksgiving food doesn't need to throw off your weight-loss progress — or taste any less delicious — according to Stephen Campolo, a fitness trainer and weight-loss expert based in Naples, Florida. "The single best move you can make is simple: Start with protein and get full on turkey and ham first," Campolo told Fox News Digital. "Skip the bread basket and load your plate with at least 6 to 8 ounces of lean turkey, plus a solid portion of ham," he added. People should eat their protein "slowly and completely before even glancing at the sides," he also recommended. A fitness and weight-loss expert recommends loading your Thanksgiving plate with turkey or ham first to help curb overeating. "High-quality protein triggers satiety faster than any carb on the table," Campolo said. "Once your stomach registers 'enough,' those mashed potatoes, stuffing and rolls lose their power. You'll naturally take smaller portions — or skip them altogether — and still feel completely satisfied." A serving of lean turkey or ham may help reduce the urge to pile on heavy sides. But if you're abstaining from meat, a filling Thanksgiving meal doesn't need to be all ham and turkey. Plant-based proteins, such as lentils, can also enhance Thanksgiving meals, said Becky Geisel, owner of Bex Kitchen & Catering in New Jersey. "At Bex, we love incorporating lentils into sides like our popular lentil and cauliflower salad or lentil and butternut squash salad," Geisel told Fox News Digital. Seeds, especially pumpkin and chia, are easy to sprinkle into salads or roasted vegetable dishes for an extra boost of protein." The chef also emphasized greens such as broccoli, spinach and Brussels sprouts. "As a chef who focuses on whole foods and nutrition, I always remind people that Thanksgiving can be both indulgent and balanced," Geisel said. "It's all about creating dishes that nourish your body while celebrating flavor and tradition." Danielle Vauthy, a Washington-based professional chef at Hungryroot, also recommended combining protein with greens. Lentils, chickpeas and nuts can make plant-based meals more filling, a chef told Fox News Digital. "I love adding more protein to Thanksgiving with a simple yet refreshing protein-packed salad," Vauthy said. "It's easily made using cooked or canned chickpeas, shaved Brussels sprouts and fennel tossed in a light vinaigrette," she told Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Publicly, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has been highly critical of the six Democratic lawmakers who released a video last week urging military service members to disobey illegal orders, calling the lawmakers the “Seditious Six” and categorizing their message as “despicable, reckless, and false.” Hegseth has attacked Kelly by name, unlike the other lawmakers. He mocked Kelly for a picture of him in uniform — “you can't even display your uniform correctly” — and wrote that Kelly's “conduct brings discredit upon the armed forces and will be addressed appropriately.” Behind closed doors, Hegseth is weighing his options to punish Kelly for participating in the video, ones that range from reducing the retired US Navy captain's rank and pension to prosecuting him under military law, according to a source familiar with the matter. In Kelly, Hegseth sees a critic worth making an example of, and he could technically use the military justice system to do so, the source said. Unlike the other five Democrats who appeared in the video, Kelly is a military retiree — meaning he served long enough to receive a pension, and thus, is still beholden to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ, including its restrictions on free speech, legal experts told CNN. Kelly could be recalled to active service and court-martialed because of that status, but doing so over his role in the video would be extraordinary, legal experts said. That's because not only has the UCMJ mainly been used in recent years to prosecute former service members who commit crimes overseas outside of US civil jurisdiction, but also because Kelly is a US senator. Because everyone at the Defense Department works for Hegseth, VanLandingham noted, it's hard to see who could fairly convene a court to hear his case. A coalition of former and retired military judge advocates has also issued a rare joint statement warning that the Pentagon's effort to recall Kelly for UCMJ prosecution is partisan in nature, legally baseless and compromised by unlawful command influence. In his various public messages, Hegseth has suggested Kelly's comments violated several statutes of the UCMJ, which lays out legal requirements for those in the military, but they don't seem to cohere to a single theory of the case, legal experts said. The administration has argued that by emphasizing service members' duty to disobey unlawful orders, Kelly and the other lawmakers were inciting troops to disobey lawful orders. In the short term, Hegseth is deferring to his Navy secretary, who oversees the military branch Kelly served in, for advice — giving him a deadline of December 10 to provide his recommendations. “I am referring this, and any other related matters, for your review, consideration and disposition as you see fit,” Hegseth wrote in a memo to the Navy secretary, dated November 25. Hegseth has hinted at one option he is considering in response — to administratively reduce Kelly's rank — referring to him in a social media post as a “retired Navy Commander,” which is below the senator's rank of captain. Because Kelly was a senior officer who retired from the Navy, he is required to remain available for recall to the military by law. The other five lawmakers in the video, Sen. Elissa Slotkin and Reps. Jason Crow, Maggie Goodlander, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, are not eligible for recall to a military service. In its response, the administration has pointed to a number of legal provisions. But that law has not been used in the modern era and is widely viewed as a dead letter after a series of postwar Supreme Court decisions reinforcing free-speech protections, VanLandingham said. Other legal terms of art referenced by Hegseth in response to Kelly and the other lawmakers seem to match with provisions in the UCMJ criminalizing behavior against good order and discipline or which bring “discredit” upon the armed services. But using the Uniform Code of Military Justice to punish a sitting senator and retired Navy captain for something that, for private citizens, is protected as free speech, would mark a significant escalation by Hegseth. Lisa Murkowski and John Curtis defended their Democratic colleague after the Pentagon's announcement. “The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation,” she added. Curtis, a first-term senator from Utah, didn't directly reference the investigations into Kelly, but said on Tuesday evening he has “respect” for the Arizona Democrat and values his “friendship.” “I know him as someone whose career has been defined by service. His record as a combat naval aviator and NASA astronaut reflects his example of the discipline and dedication that are important for success,” Curtis wrote on X. Court-martialing Kelly is technically a viable option for Hegseth because three appellate courts have upheld that it's constitutional to court-martial retired service members, though there have been long-standing arguments from some legal scholars that this should not be the case. Among other things, the UCMJ places stiff limitations on free speech that some legal analysts believe are unconstitutional for people who are in every other way living as civilians. It could in theory allow the government to court-martial a Korean War veteran for saying something critical about the sitting president, for example. There are other problems, beyond the potential issue of Unlawful Command Influence, said Steve Vladeck, a professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center and a CNN legal analyst. For his part, Kelly has been defiant in response to Hegseth's threats, posting that he will not be intimidated or “silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.” CNN's Katie Bo Lillis, Pamela Brown and Alison Main contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>International tourists visiting popular national parks in the US next year will be required to pay additional fees and raised rates on annual passes, the US Department of the Interior announced Tuesday. In a statement hailing a new “resident-focused fee structure that puts American families first,” the department said as of January 1, 2026, the annual pass will cost non-US residents $250 to obtain, more than triple the standard $80 which US residents will continue to pay. “These policies ensure that US taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in the statement. The 15 least visited US national parks The rationale offered behind the new prices was summarized in a White House social media post stating: “AMERICANS OFFERED AFFORDABLE PRICES WHILE FOREIGNERS PAY MUCH MORE.” This announced price hike comes amid a decline in international tourism to the US, fueled by changes to tariff policies and crackdowns on immigration. The price increase also comes on the heels of the longest government shutdown in US history, which saw an already-depleted National Park Service struggle to upkeep some of nation's parks due to limited staffing and fewer resources. According to a recent estimate by the National Parks Conservation Association, parks lost roughly $41 million in uncollected entrance and recreation fees during the government shutdown. The Interior Department's statement also highlighted “resident-only patriotic fee-free days” for next year which includes Memorial Day, Fourth of July Independence Day weekend and June 14, “Flag Day/President Trump's birthday.” The launch of an upgraded booking system and better access for motorcyclists across the parks was also announced, described as “the most significant modernization of national park access in decades.” Other countries, including Egypt, Thailand and Cambodia, also charge higher entry fees for international tourists to visit national parks and attractions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) is continuing to speak out about his controversial remarks that drew the ire of President Donald Trump. The senator appeared on Tuesday's episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live! to discuss the fallout of a video Kelly made last week with five other members of Congress, encouraging military members and intelligence community personnel to reject “illegal orders.” Kelly, along with Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO), Rep. Maggie Goodlander (D-NH), Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-PA), and Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA), all emphasized that troops and intelligence community members “must refuse illegal orders.” No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution.” Kelly expressed shock and dismay that Trump would have a problem with their statement. I served 25 years in the United States Navy, you know. “I've almost gotten killed for this country, multiple times, almost shot down over Iraq and Kuwait, had a missile blow up next to my airplane,” Kelly said. “The president, when he says these things, there are consequences,” Kelly told Kimmel. “And by the way, isn't this the guy two months ago that said ‘we've got to stop this political violence issue? He didn't even make it to Thanksgiving.” “You can't keep track of this guy and what he says,” Kelly said, without addressing Trump by name or title. The conversation then turned to Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, who, on Tuesday, announced that he would open an investigation into Kelly's conduct. Kimmel mentioned it during the interview with Kelly. “And then you have Pete Hegseth, who runs the Department of War, is going to open an investigation into you, I assume, into your colleagues,” Kimmel said. I sat on the committee that ultimately had to confirm him, so I know a little bit about his background. He's totally unqualified,” Kelly added, without answering the question Kimmel asked him. Kelly continued to bash Hegseth instead of answering Kimmel's question about the announced FBI investigation or what sedition is. “Nothing against journalists, they play a very important role in our society,” Kelly said. And from what I can tell, and talking to some of my Republican colleagues, I mean, he just wants to please the president.” “And this is what he can do this week, he can go after me, under the Uniform Code of military justice, which is the law in the military,” Kelly added, while still not answering Kimmel's question about sedition.</p>
