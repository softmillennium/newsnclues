                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a new study in the journal Cell, researchers at Stanford University and Stockholm University have contributed to increased knowledge about gene regulation in human cells. How genes are turned on and off is crucial for the body's cells to have different functions. In this process, certain proteins, so-called transcription factors, find and recognize different binding sites on DNA in the body's cells to drive on or off signals. When this recognition goes wrong, it can give rise to many different types of diseases, such as cancer. Now a group of researchers at Stanford University and Stockholm University have studied in detail how DNA recognition works for one key transcription factor. "The most important result is that we show it is possible to understand the binding between this transcription factor and DNA in human cells, and that this behavior is consistent with what we measure in test tubes. That is an important basic science discovery", says Emil Marklund, assistant professor at the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at Stockholm University and SciLifeLab, who has participated in the study that is now published in the journal Cell. Transcription factor binding to DNA controls a lot in biology and causes the body's cells to have different functions, explains Emil Marklund: "It is this process that controls that, for example, a nerve cell in the brain has different gene expression than a cell in the immune system. When the binding goes wrong, it can give rise to a great many different types of diseases. Genetic studies show that more than half of all mutations linked to traits such as genetic diseases occur in DNA sequence regions where transcription factors bind." First author Julia Schaepe, a PhD student in the Greenleaf Lab at Stanford University, emphasizes broader impacts from the study's insights into how transcription factors read DNA: "We discovered that this transcription factor pays attention to much more of the DNA sequence surrounding its binding sites than previously thought. By combining precise measurements in both test tubes and human cells with physical models, we were able to build a more complete picture of how DNA recognition works and, therefore, how gene regulation is encoded by DNA."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this interview, News Medical-Life Sciences speaks with Lewis Irish, Sales Director at Monmouth Scientific, about the design and benefits of modular cleanrooms and how they support scalable, compliant environments across biomedical, life sciences, and manufacturing industries. My name is Lewis Irish, and I'm the Sales Director at Monmouth Scientific. I oversee our sales operations, working closely with clients across a wide range of industries to deliver modular cleanroom solutions that meet their evolving needs. At Monmouth Scientific, we design and supply modular cleanrooms for various sectors that require controlled environments. What sets our systems apart is their modularity, scalability, and adaptability. Unlike traditional fixed cleanrooms, our modular units are designed for quick reconfiguration and expansion. Our cleanrooms are designed to meet stringent ISO standards and can be seamlessly integrated into complex facilities. This flexibility makes them ideal for organisations seeking high-performance environments without compromising compliance or operational flow. Industries such as aerospace, electronics, and manufacturing operate in fast-paced environments. They often need to adjust for new production lines, evolving regulations, or upgraded equipment. Our modular cleanrooms are designed explicitly for that purpose. Clients can reconfigure or expand their cleanroom setup without interrupting production. It is about enabling innovation and agility without being restricted by infrastructure. We achieve this via pre-engineered panels, integrated service channels, and standardized connection systems. These components enable fast assembly, often in a fraction of the time required for traditional construction. These built-in design features enable easy adaptation of the cleanroom layout as operational needs evolve, with minimal disruption and downtime. Scalability is at the heart of our modular design. We use repeatable, high-quality components that can be extended as needed to create facilities covering hundreds of square metres. These expansions do not compromise airflow management or ISO classification. Our systems also include integrated monitoring solutions to ensure ongoing regulatory compliance across the entire space. Whether the client starts small or builds large from day one, performance remains consistent and verifiable. Walls, ceilings, and services can all be moved or expanded. As operations scale, production lines change, or larger equipment is introduced, the cleanroom can adapt with minimal cost and no major reconstruction. This means our clients can maintain ISO-class compliance throughout operational changes, avoiding costly rebuilds or lengthy downtimes. A notable example is our collaboration with WOMED, where we designed modular, ISO-classified cleanrooms to support essential processes while also accommodating future expansion. Our approach provides a clean environment and one that evolves with the organization, without compromising safety or standards. Our cleanrooms offer long-term value because they are not fixed assets. Panels, service channels, and modular elements can be reused when reconfiguring or relocating the space, which reduces material waste and capital expenditure. From a sustainability perspective, this significantly reduces environmental impact compared to traditional construction methods. Operational flexibility paired with resource efficiency is a win for both budgets and corporate sustainability goals. Clients regularly cite the speed of installation and flexibility as major advantages. We have helped clients deploy large-scale cleanrooms in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional methods, which in turn accelerates their time-to-market. As a result, their return on investment is often achieved much sooner, particularly when the modular design facilitates growth without needing costly extensions or downtime. In 2022, we installed a 14m x 5m ISO 8 Modular Cleanroom at their UK site. As their operations scaled, they needed more cleanroom space. This project is an excellent example of how our modular systems can grow with the client's needs while maintaining performance, compliance, and operational continuity. Lewis Irish is the Sales Director at Monmouth Scientific, a UK-based leader in the design and manufacture of modular cleanrooms and controlled environments. At Monmouth, he plays a pivotal role in aligning clients' operational goals with flexible, compliant cleanroom solutions, whether for research, production, or advanced manufacturing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article is based on a poster originally authored by Rachel Daniels, Yu Chen, Spencer Chiang, Tianfu Zhang and Yuehchun Hsieh. Gene and cell therapies rely heavily on culturing immune cells in vitro, a step that remains critical to their development. Due to the specialized and diverse nature of immune cells, such as T, NK, and macrophages, as well as subpopulations like γδT cells, each cell type requires its own customized media. Conventional, one-size-fits-all media are unable to effectively support the development of these therapies because each immune cell population has distinct metabolic requirements, cytokine dependencies, and activation pathways. In addition, specialized media for cell sub-populations are also not amenable when exploring different cell types. Lengthy optimization processes in cell culturing are often required to achieve changes to target immune cell types, for example, the modification of CAR-T therapies to CAR-NK ones. A recent study by ACROBiosystems has led to the development of a two-part medium comprising a universal basal medium alongside custom-formulated supplements that have been optimized and tailored for specified immune cell subpopulations. This novel approach allows the creation of adaptable, fine-tuned media tailored to accommodate the specific functional and biological needs of each cell type. This is enabled by systematically adjusting critical media components, including nutrients, growth factors, cytokines, and serum alternatives. Two different supplements have been developed to be paired with a universal basal medium: NK cells and γδT cells. This customizability resulted in improved efficiency within a range of cell types as part of immune cell therapy research. (A) Donor 1 and (B) Donor 2 human CBMCs were cultured using the Immune Cell Basal Medium with CelThera™ Immune Cell Supplement C. The resulting expansion fold exceeds 1,000 on Day 11 and can reach 10,000 on Day 19. Human CBMCs were cultured for 2 weeks using Immune Cell Basal Medium with CelThera™ Immune Cell Supplement C. Varying ratios of NKp44/NKG2D/CD69, all markers of activation, reveal significant levels of activation after the culturing process. Measurement of remaining target cells was performed after 7-AAD/CFSE staining and analyzed via ELISA. NK cells were used to evaluate cytotoxicity at several E:T ratios, revealing that more than 30 % of target cells were lysed at the lowest ratio, similar to control NK cells. (A) Expansion fold and (B) viability of γδT cells were evaluated from PBMCs cultured with Basal Medium, T cell Expansion Supplement, and GMP Immune Cell Supplement D. Expansion fold exceeds 3,600 with a viability of more than 90 % across the culture period. Cell population percentage of γδ2T after culturing using either phenol red or phenol red-free medium resulted in more than 80 %. After two weeks, a high percentage of γδ2T was achieved, using the addition of several supplements alongside the traditional basal medium, revealing the capability to tailor media to a specific subpopulation. The development of this universal basal medium paired with custom supplements represents an efficient and versatile solution for culturing diverse immune cell subpopulations. The approach described here supports the distinct biological and physiological requirements of each cell type by allowing the precise adjustment of nutrients, growth factors, cytokines, and serum alternatives. The method presented here has been shown to be highly effective, enabling the successful expansion of NK cells and γδT cells, resulting in 1,000- and 17,600-fold increases at high purity. This customizable media also streamlined the transition between different immune cell targets, lowering required optimization time and improving the scalability of gene and cell therapy research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article and associated images are based on a poster originally authored by Nermeen Ali, Heather Coleman, Azza Taher, Marwa Sarg and Noha Hilmy Elnagdi and presented at ELRIG Drug Discovery 2025 in affiliation with Ulster University, Cairo University, October 6 University, Al-Azhar University and Modern University for Technology and Information.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used to relieve pain and inflammation by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes involved in prostaglandin synthesis 1. However, NSAIDs can have many adverse effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding 2. Some examples of pyrazole derivatives, such as Deracoxib, Ramifenazone, and Pyraclonil, have been reported as potent NSAIDs.3 To rationally design, synthesize, and biologically evaluate a new series of pyrazole-pyrazoline derivatives as structural analogues of Celecoxib, Indomethacin, and Floctafenine. The aim is to develop selective COX-2 inhibitors possessing enhanced antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy and improved safety profiles. Novel pyrazole-pyrazoline derivatives were synthesized via the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction followed by condensation and cyclization steps to yield amide and ester analogues. Structures were confirmed using elemental analysis, IR, ¹H NMR, and MS spectroscopy. Anti-inflammatory activity was assessed by the carrageenan-induced paw oedema test, while analgesic activity was evaluated with the acetic acid-induced writhing test in rats. Molecular docking was performed on the COX-2 enzyme (PDB ID: 4Z0L) to evaluate binding interactions and rationalize biological results. Most of the newly synthesized derivatives showed significant anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities compared with Indomethacin. Docking studies revealed that compound 14b exhibited the strongest COX-2 binding affinity (-16.39 kcal/mol), forming key H-bonds with Arg120, Val349, and Ala527. The correlation between docking scores and in vivo activity supports their potential as selective COX-2 inhibitors Preparation of the pyrazole carboxylic acids 9a-f. Preparation of Floctafenine chalcone 21 and pyrazoline 22. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) evaluation demonstrated that extending the alkyl chain and incorporating amide or ester functionalities significantly enhanced the anti-inflammatory and analgesic profiles. Compounds 13b, 14b, and 15b with longer carbon chains exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity (28.6-30.9 % inhibition), whereas pyrazoline analogues 18 and 22 showed the highest analgesic response (up to 84.5 % inhibition). Cyclization to pyrazolines and fusion with a quinoline scaffold improved both potency and COX-2 selectivity.

To assess the in situ biodistribution of KLAS-PDT, MDC developed a workflow that integrated MSI and fluorescence microscopy for the identification of KLAS-PDT in preclinical models of melanoma. An algorithm developed during the data processing step enabled data integration, identification, and quantification of the KLAS-PDT therapeutic. Accumulation of KT-001 was observed from the five-minute time point using both IT and IV route. The distribution or AA matches the areas with remaining skin structure whereas HETE is localized in close proximity to regions with Rose Bengal. Similarly, other oxidized fatty acid species (shown in the table above), such as hydroxyl linoleic acid, hydroxy EPA, and dihydroxy EPA, were also detected with a similar distribution as HETE. All ions were putatively assigned according to their exact masses.

This analysis highlighted interleukin, TNF, and inflammation-associated pathways that were upregulated with treatment, as well as increased DNA damage repair, NO signaling, a decrease in matrix remodeling, and metastasis pathways in RB+ regions. Curio Seeker tiles comprise a monolayer of barcoded microparticles (beads) that contain poly(dT) sequences, allowing mRNA molecules from the tissue to hybridize. Gene expression is reconstructed spatially by using the bead barcode to map individual sequencing reads back to their original XY coordinate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The risks for serious physical illness, psychiatric conditions, and premature death are sharply elevated in people with eating disorders long after their initial diagnosis, a new study showed. Risks for renal or liver failure, fractures, diabetes, heart failure, and death are highest within the first 12 months but persist for 5-10 years after diagnosis. Investigators said the findings point to the need for earlier detection, long-term follow-up, and an interdisciplinary approach to patient care. “Eating disorders affect every major body system,” lead author Catharine Morgan, PhD, with The University of Manchester, Manchester, England, told Medscape Medical News. At the same time, many people have underlying vulnerabilities — such as depression, anxiety, or difficulties coping with stress — that persist even after eating improves.” The study was published online on November 18 in BMJ Medicine. Despite an increase in global prevalence, investigators said eating disorders are widely understudied, and data on long-term effects is especially lacking. They matched 24,709 people who received a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or other eating disorder between 1998 and 2018 with up to 20 control individuals without an eating disorder (n = 493,001). Within the first year after diagnosis, people with an eating disorder were six times more likely to develop renal failure and nearly seven times more likely to develop liver disease. These risks remained twofold to threefold higher after 5 years. An eating disorder diagnosis also took a toll on mental health, with patients seven times more likely to have depression and more than nine times as likely to engage in self-harm in the first year following diagnosis. The risk for suicide was nearly 14 times higher in the first year after diagnosis and remained nearly threefold higher at 10 years. The risk for premature death was also elevated in those with an eating disorder. In the first year, the risk for dying from any cause was more than fourfold higher than control individuals and was fivefold higher for unnatural deaths. After 5 years, these risks were still two and three times higher, respectively. “Health services potentially need to treat eating disorders as long-term conditions,” Morgan told Medscape Medical News. “That means regular physical health checks (heart, kidneys, liver, bone health, blood tests) for years after diagnosis; ongoing mental health monitoring, including screening for depression and self-harm; clear shared-care plans between GPs [general practitioner] and specialist services so nobody falls through gaps; potential rapid re-referral pathways if symptoms return; and extra support during high-risk periods, such as the first year after diagnosis and transitions between services,” Morgan said. Despite the high prevalence of eating disorders, their consequences are “underrecognized,” Jennifer Couturier, MD, and Ethan Nella, MSc, with McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, pointed out in a linked editorial.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>University of the Witwatersrand - Edson Mwebesa, Fellow at the Wits-based Sub-Saharan Africa Advanced Consortium for Biostatistics (SSACAB), knows children who died from late-diagnosed malaria. Malaria is also endemic across Africa, impacting all aspects of social and economic life. He focused on social and behavioral change messaging, an essential part of encouraging people to use insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). While messaging campaigns have been implemented in the media, hospitals, and schools, the question of whether these messages actually change behavior remains uncertain. Robust biostatistics methods used by African experts are set to change this. Mwebesa applied a quasi-experimental causal inference method, known as Propensity Score Matching, to investigate this phenomenon. This approach can measure, with precision, whether messaging actually changes behavior. Traditionally, measuring messaging impact relied on simple correlations and on counting how many people heard a message and whether they used a mosquito bed net. Those who heard or saw the messages might differ from those who did not, and thus, the use of mosquito nets might not be comparable between these groups. Those who hear malaria messages are often wealthier, more educated, or better connected, and these factors independently increase bed net use. This has made it difficult for policymakers to know whether expensive behavior-change campaigns genuinely deliver impact. Mwebesa measured the impact of messaging aimed at women in Uganda. In some districts, incidence rates over six-month periods have exceeded 500 cases per 1000 people, demonstrating how quickly the disease can spread in high-transmission settings. Beyond the clinical burden, malaria disrupts schooling, reduces productivity and places immense strain on household finances, particularly among poorer families. Understanding how to drive preventive behavior in this context is both a scientific and operational priority. In 2001, economists John Luke Gallup and Jeffrey Sachs, writing in The Intolerable Burden of Malaria, explained that reliable data on malaria incidence were lacking for many of the most severely affected countries. They constructed an indirect malaria index using historical risk maps, estimates of the proportion of falciparum malaria and population distribution data. Their work was pioneering but constrained by limited information, underscoring how weak data systems restricted the ability to study malaria's economic and social effects. They could not measure behavior or the effectiveness of prevention campaigns. What's most exciting, though, is how we are growing the capacity to analyse data using modern causal methods." Edson Mwebesa, Fellow at the Wits-based Sub-Saharan Africa Advanced Consortium for Biostatistics Institutions such as SSACAB have trained a new generation of African biostatisticians who can use advanced techniques to answer complex policy questions that were previously out of reach. Mwebesa used nationally representative data from the 2018–19 Malaria Indicator Survey and examined whether exposure to malaria messages increases the use of insecticide-treated nets among women of reproductive age and children under five in Uganda. The descriptive findings show that 37.6 per cent of women aged 15–49 and 37.9 per cent of caregivers of young children had been exposed to malaria prevention messages in the six months preceding the survey. Net use was higher but not universal: 69.3 per cent of women reported sleeping under an insecticide-treated net the night before the survey, as did 71.8 per cent of children under five. Mwebesa's use of propensity score matching paired each woman who was exposed to malaria messages with another woman who was not, but who shared similar characteristics, such as age, education level, wealth, household size, region, and urban or rural residence. "For years, people assumed that malaria messages influenced behavior, but this analysis shows, with causal evidence, exactly how much they matter. Among children, caregivers' exposure to messages increased ITN use by 4.3 percent. These differences, when applied nationally, translate into tens of thousands of additional protected households and reduced malaria direct and indirect costs. The study also identified which communication channels were major sources of malaria messages. Radio emerged as the dominant messaging channel, reaching roughly two-thirds of women and caregivers. Community health workers and interpersonal communication were also influential. Digital platforms were used far less frequently, suggesting an untapped potential. African biostatisticians are leading analyses that were impossible twenty years ago." Africa is no longer dependent on global assumptions or incomplete models. This, in turn, supports more efficient investments in communication campaigns, builds equity by identifying which groups are least reached and strengthens the effectiveness of malaria prevention efforts across the continent. African Statistics Day 2025 highlights the theme of leveraging innovations in data and statistics to promote a just, peaceful, inclusive and prosperous society for Africans. In the field of malaria prevention, this theme is particularly resonant.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dysfunctional breathing (DB) is frequently misdiagnosed or insufficiently treated, leading to a diminished quality of life and unnecessary medical intervention. While recent studies have focused on DB in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), its prevalence and contributing factors in the general population remain unclear. Additionally, tobacco use may exacerbate both respiratory symptoms and underlying comorbidities, while potentially contributing to DB. A team led by Osaka Metropolitan University researchers aimed to investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DB, as well as its associated factors. A cross-sectional Internet-based survey was conducted among 29,268 participants from the general Japanese population using the Nijmegen Questionnaire (NQ), a validated tool with high sensitivity and specificity for DB diagnosis. The findings indicated a DB prevalence of 11.0%. Notably, non-respiratory conditions such as epilepsy and cerebrovascular disease were also significantly correlated with DB. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that current tobacco use and respiratory comorbidities further increased DB prevalence. These findings suggest that DB is relatively common in primary healthcare settings, and exacerbated by tobacco use, particularly among individuals with respiratory comorbidities.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committees play a key role in evaluating the efficacy and safety of new drugs. They include open public hearing sessions, whereby patients, clinicians, and advocates share input. To assess the experiences and perspectives of public speakers, Mass General Brigham researchers reviewed minutes and transcripts from 161 FDA Human Drug Advisory Committee meetings held from 2015 to 2023 and found that most public speakers support drug approval - especially patients or family members with personal experience using the drug and those who reported conflicts of interest (COI). The study found 96% of meetings included public speakers. When assessing the 1,481 testimonies from 1,217 unique individuals, researchers discovered patients and family members accounted for the highest percentage of speaker testimonies (48%), followed by clinicians (21%), public health advocates who didn't come from organizations that represented specific diseases (13%), and patient advocates (10%). Overall, 82% of the speakers supported drug approval and 43% disclosed a COI, typically that they or the organization they represent have received financial support from a drug manufacturer. The authors note COI reporting is not mandatory and this number may be an underrepresentation. For most speaker types, the majority supported approval; the lone exception was that 72% of testimonies by public health advocates did not support drug approval. Support was highest among patients and family members with personal experience using the drug – often through clinical trials. The voices of patients and advocates are vital, but to ensure more balanced input, the FDA should seek contributions from a broader range of perspectives and strengthen efforts to monitor and mitigate conflicts of interest among public participants." Leah Rand, DPhil, lead author, research scientist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Mass General Brigham Department of Medicine The authors recommended more robust transparency measures, such as mandatory COI disclosures and methods to independently assess potential conflicts, such as through Open Payments platform for clinicians or organizations' tax filings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New imaging reveals how subtle lung changes may influence sleep and brain activity years after COVID, offering clues to why symptoms persist even when routine tests look normal. Study: Long COVID: lung pathophysiology and its relationship with cognitive dysfunction. In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers examined whether lung abnormalities are associated with cognitive symptoms and brain scans in people with long coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms, at an average of 32±5 months (range=24–43 months) after infection. Lower lung gas-exchange efficiency within the Long COVID-19 group was associated with worse sleep symptoms, poorer executive functioning, and higher cerebral perfusion, suggesting a potential lung–brain pathway contributing to persistent symptoms. Millions worldwide experience persistent symptoms, breathlessness, fatigue, exercise intolerance, and “brain fog” beyond three months after acute infection. Despite common respiratory complaints, conventional pulmonary tests often appear normal. Hyperpolarized xenon-129 (129Xe) MRI can sensitively measure regional ventilation and gas exchange, offering diagnostic value. Yet the connection between lung physiology and brain alterations remains insufficiently understood. Eligibility required a negative PCR test and either previous hospitalization, abnormal pulmonary tests, or chest CT abnormalities. People with active respiratory infections or other cardiopulmonary conditions were excluded. A subset who completed 129Xe MRI, brain MRI, and cognitive testing during the same session formed the core sample. Participants completed questionnaires assessing cognitive complaints, mood, fatigue, dyspnea, pain, and sleep. Brain MRI included structural imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and arterial spin labeling to quantify volumetrics, white matter hyperintensities, diffusion metrics, and cerebral perfusion. 129Xe MRI assessed ventilation defects and gas-exchange efficiency; healthy controls completed only the lung-imaging component. Age-adjusted partial correlations linked lung metrics to symptoms, cognition, and MRI measures. The final sample included 12 Long COVID-19 participants and 10 matched controls, nearly three years post-infection. Long COVID-19 participants frequently reported fatigue, dyspnea, headaches, and substantial cognitive concerns. Yet objective cognitive performance remained normal for all but one participant, who showed domain-specific deficits in executive function, processing speed, and language. Pulmonary function tests were normal for all but one individual, and no group differences emerged in 129Xe gas-exchange values. Even without group-level lung abnormalities, within-group associations were notable. Lower 129Xe gas-exchange ratios correlated with worse sleep disturbance, higher cerebral perfusion, and poorer executive functioning. Cerebral perfusion itself was strongly tied to sleep problems. Gas-exchange efficiency showed positive correlations with executive function and a trend with global cognitive scores; these persisted after adjusting for anxiety and depression. No associations emerged with subjective cognitive complaints, brain volumes, diffusion metrics, or white matter abnormalities after age adjustment. Findings suggest that impaired lung gas exchange may be associated with altered cerebral perfusion and sleep disruption, forming a potential physiological pathway that influences Long COVID-19 symptoms. The mismatch between subjective cognitive difficulties and normal objective cognition aligns with prior research and may reflect fluctuating deficits, heightened symptom awareness, or psychological factors. Strengths include a multimodal design integrating lung imaging, brain MRI, cognitive assessment, and symptom profiling. However, the small sample, partial imaging datasets, and lack of cognitive testing in controls limit generalizability. Age effects and broad composite scoring may obscure subtle deficits. Overall, the results highlight the interconnected nature of gas exchange, cerebral perfusion, and sleep disturbance in Long COVID-19, underscoring the need for larger, controlled studies with comprehensive brain and cognitive assessments to clarify mechanisms and inform targeted interventions.
