She knows the ins and outs and she's been able to prepare me for all the little crevices I might get into. Obviously, I've had to go through a lot on my own, but she knows how it feels when different things have happened to me, so it allows me to feel a little bit ahead of the game sometimes. If she had won her second round, we would have played each other and that would have been the match to secure the wild card.“She ended up losing one round early, but it was crazy to think of people watching that match had it happened, and if they knew what we were playing for. It would have been a completely different level of stakes and pressure. Still, I was very happy to secure it outright!”Though still ranked outside the Top 100, the guaranteed main-draw entry not only lengthens Mandlik's pre-season but also opens more opportunities to compete ahead of the first Grand Slam tournament of 2026.“When you have to play qualies, it's more difficult because you can't play that extra warm-up. You have to cut your pre-season shorter,” Mandlik explained. “So, having that main-draw date and knowing your schedule makes things much easier. “She ended up losing one round early, but it was crazy to think of people watching that match had it happened, and if they knew what we were playing for.

Mandlik's initial WTA breakthrough came in 2022, when she stunned Alison Riske-Amritraj and pushed then-No. 4 Paula Badosa to a third-set tiebreaker in San Jose. Managing stress has been crucial to Mandlik's resurgence, allowing her rediscover the form that first turned heads in 2022. A month later, she won her first Grand Slam main-draw match in at the US Open, shocking former Roland Garros semifinalist Tamara Zidansek.“In the past, I was more of an emotional player,” Mandlik recalled. It was kind of like a roller coaster in my mind. As I got more used to being on tour, breaking into the Top 100 and falling out, I've really figured out how to calm my mind and work through all the day-to-day things that let me play every day like it's the same.”Drawing experience from her mother, a five-time major champion and Hall of Famer, has also impacted her development. “In the past, I was more of an emotional player,” Mandlik recalled.
