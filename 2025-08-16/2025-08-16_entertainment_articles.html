                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although Brad Pitt is bringing back Cliff Booth for a sequel to Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino is sitting this one out as director. “I think me and David Fincher are the two best directors,” he said on The Church of Tarantino podcast. “So the idea that David Fincher actually wants to adapt my work, to me, shows a level of seriousness towards my work that I think needs to be taken into account.” After Deadline reported in April that Pitt and Se7en director Fincher got Tarantino's approval to use his script to make the sequel, which was originally set to be his final directorial outing, the cast has since added Pitt, Carla Gugino, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Elizabeth Debicki, Scott Caan, Corey Fogelmanis and JB Tadena. The movie is believed to have scored a $20 million California film-tax credit, and Pitt told Deadline filming would begin in July. In the same podcast, Tarantino also explained why he chose not to make The Movie Critic his 10th and final film. Can I take the most boring profession in the world and make it an interesting movie?” he said. “Every Tarantino title promises so much, except The Movie Critic.” Meanwhile, Tarantino is taking a break from filmmaking as he turns to theater, after telling Deadline he's “really juiced about live theater right now” at Sundance in January.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Actress Torrey DeVitto's life looks nothing like it did several years ago, and she couldn't be happier about it. Since then, DeVitto, 41, ended her relationship with former Chicago Cubs manager David Ross, met and married local business owner Jared LaPine, and the couple became first-time parents in November 2024. Reflecting on her complete life makeover, she hopes other women will be inspired to trust that it's never too late for dreams to come true. To share how much her life has changed in a few short years, DeVitto posted a photo to her Instagram Stories of herself standing under a big tree, wearing a white lace nightgown, salmon-colored cover-up, and green boots while holding her daughter, Lyle-Josephine Alina LaPine. DeVitto captioned the post, “If you would have told me 3 years ago I'd be married to my dream man and walking our trails with my baby and coffee most mornings in my ridiculous nightgown and farm boots, I would have told you…no way..where, how and when? “Yet here we are,” DeVitto continued, “and I'm in love and obsessed with this life we are building.” The actress, whose first Hallmark movie — “Best Christmas Party Ever” — aired in 2014 while she was still starring in “Pretty Little Liars,” per IMDb, noted in her caption that she hoped to inspire other women not to give up on their own dreams. “So many women talk to me about fear of timelines,” DeVitto wrote. In another August 15 Instagram Story, featuring a photo of DeVitto snuggling her infant, who was strapped into her baby carrier, the actress cutely wrote, “Do they make carriers for 18 years –? Looking back and addressing the year 2024, she wrote, “You turned me 40, turned me into a wifey and a Mom ❤️. There's no way you will ever be topped, but I am excited to see all the new adventures 2025 has to bring for me and my family of 3. Who knew at 40 I'd be walking into 2025 saying, ‘I'm just getting started. Captioning a June 12 photo taken at the beach while DeVitto was holding little Lyle-Josephine under an umbrella, Devitto wrote that she was fighting “against what society pressures me into thinking my post partum body and sleep deprived self should look like because building this dreamy life with my little family is all that matters. “Some days end with a gold star, other days feel like a big fat splat on the face,” she continued.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Guests at a hotel in Alaska found eight pages of documents from President Donald Trump's meetings Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a printer, NPR reported Saturday. On Friday, the two leaders walked a red carpet together, as they met to discuss a potential end to Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting ended abruptly without a Ukraine ceasefire deal. Trump told reporters it was “an extremely productive meeting,” but they “didn't get there.” “I think the meeting was a 10,” Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity. A “2:2” meeting took place among Trump; Steve Witkoff, special envoy for peace missions; Putin; and Yuri Ushakov, an aide to Putin for foreign policy and Putin's “America guru.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent were also involved, among others. The documents show that Trump planned to give Putin an “American bald eagle desk statue.” This document breach is reminiscent of when Trump administration officials added Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal chat where they discussed plans to bomb Yemen — though likely less embarrassing. Meeting organizers planned to serve filet mignon, halibut Olympia, and crème brûlée.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite reports of behind-the-scenes drama on Desperate Housewives, Jesse Metcalfe was just happy to be part of the neighborhood. “I was just happy to have a job,” he said on a recent panel, according to People. “I went through an entire pilot season, I didn't book anything, and I tested for Desperate Housewives, which was a recast, right at the end of that pilot season and ended up booking it.” Metcalfe said he was “very grateful” for his Season 1 series regular role of Gabrielle Solis' (Eva Longoria) young sidepiece, which he reprised a guest throughout the series. “I was just kind of riding the wave, you know, because that show really broke me and I had everything coming at me and I was just enjoying it,” he continued. “And I was like, I was oblivious to it, basically, you know, because I was just so thrilled to be on a show and just so in the moment.” Desperate Housewives starred Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Longoria and Nicollette Sheridan as five women — mostly friends — living on Wisteria Lane, who begin uncovering dark secrets after their neighbor Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) kills herself. In addition to reports of friction between the women, Sheridan filed a $20 million lawsuit against ABC and Cherry, alleging that he assaulted her and then fired her from the show when she reported it. Following Deadline's exclusive report, Kerry Washington confirmed in May that her Onyx Collective offshoot Wisteria Lane is in development, “inspired” by Desperate Housewives. Written by Natalie Chaidez, Wisteria Lane is described as a fun, sexy, darkly comedic soap/mystery in the vein of Desperate Housewives, set among a group of five very different friends and sometimes frenemies who all live on a picture-perfect cul de sac called Wisteria Lane.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift gave one of the most revealing and unguarded interviews of her two-decade career this week, and she did it completely on her own terms. Sean Kingston Sentenced to 3.5 Years in Prison for Wire Fraud Scheme Neil Young Leaves Facebook Over "Unconscionable" Policies for AI Chatbot Conversations With Children She doesn't have to lock a Rolling Stone cover, nor does she need to rub elbows at listening parties or meet and greets (one of which turned traumatic for the budding popstar in 2013). And given her track record on the awards circuit, she could reliably announce her newest era during a Grammys telecast or the VMAs or whenever she so chooses. She didn't even have to go through the likes of the new media guard, such as Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy. As some Swifties online wrote, she dropped the “interview voice.” Whether what we saw this week was the real Taylor Swift or yet another meticulously guarded layer for the world's savviest pop star is unclear. Never has Swift managed to grant so much of herself to the public while relinquishing so little of her own control. Has there ever been a pop culture figure as famous as Taylor Swift who's been less reliant on traditional media to share their message? Even beyond the bounds of a traditional journalistic interview, Swift still managed to reveal lots of news, from how she sent her brother and mother to negotiate with Shamrock Capital first for her masters, to her return to working with legendary songwriter Max Martin on her upcoming record. From a marketing level, the result was an overwhelming success. As Swift herself said on the podcast this week: “I'm always trying to figure out how to make music into more of an event. With 1.3 million live viewers, it was the most-viewed podcast premiere in YouTube history since the platform launched podcasts back in 2023. The episode itself already has over 15 million views in just two days. Agency over her legacy has been the throughline of Swift's 2025 thus far. “All of the music I've ever made… now belongs… to me,” Swift declared in a triumphant letter she posted on her website. And with that acquisition, she's beholden to no one. The master rights on every one of her 12 albums (and four Taylor's Version re-records) are hers alone, as are the drawings and journals from her childhood. She has long retained her publishing and runs her own management company, with most of her team acting as Swift's employees.With just under two months until The Life of a Showgirl will inevitably take over the world, we're still only at the beginning of the marketing whistles she'll ring to build the hype around her next era. But Swift has everything she needs all on her own. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After nearly 25 years, the “cautionary” aspect of The Wire is no longer seen as a dire warning to society to star Wendell Pierce. The Tony winner recently explained why the HBO show, which ran for five seasons from 2002 to '08, does not warrant a reboot as the show's societal themes are “demonstrated today” in real time. Explaining that the David Simon-created series about the police and drug dealers of Baltimore was “the cautionary tale that it was, the fact that it lets people know there's an ugly side of human nature,” Pierce noted, “We're seeing that demonstrated today.” “I mean as we stand here on wonderful beautiful Hollywood Boulevard, they have American secret police who raided MacArthur Park today with guns drawn on citizens for no reason,” he said. “That's why The Wire is so poignant. It was a canary in the mine then and it's a canary in the mine now. Pierce appeared in the acclaimed show's ensemble as veteran homicide detective William ‘Bunk' Moreland, starring throughout the five-season run.

NY Film Festival Adds Bruce Springsteen Biopic 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' as Spotlight Gala Hollywood Flashback: Brooke Shields' Jeans Ad Did Not Sit Well September delivers an anticipated Toronto International Film Festival world premiere for a big swing as a queer boxer in David Michod's biopic Christy, which she also produced, followed by Paul Feig's psychological thriller The Housemaid opposite Amanda Seyfried. But that's what happened after American Eagle dropped its “Sydney Has Great Jeans” campaign July 23. It was designed as an ambitious partnership that included print ads, 3D billboards (including one on the Sphere in Las Vegas), Snapchat lens technology that allowed users to interact with a digital Sweeney, and a limited run of the “Sydney Jean” with 100 percent of the net proceeds donated to a nonprofit of the star's choice. Within days, a handful of TikTok users took offense to a campaign clip that features Sweeney saying (with unique inflection), “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The users claimed it promoted eugenics or was a form of Nazi propaganda because Sweeney is white, blond-haired and blue-eyed. “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST' ad out there. She still hasn't said a word about the campaign or its backlash — allowing American Eagle's statement to stand on its own as the brand reiterated that it was just a slogan about jeans and nothing more — but she did return to Instagram on Wednesday to promote Americana with a carousel of artistic behind-the-scenes images for her 25.3 million followers. “A few years ago I filmed this little movie with some friends and now you get to meet Penny Jo,” posted Sweeney, seen in many of the images that also feature Paul Walter Hauser and pop star turned actress Halsey. But that night, she only posed for photos before quickly ducking inside without speaking to reporters. “The same brand five years ago would've apologized profusely and tried to move past it quickly. Instead, they stuck to their guns and stood by the campaign. Everyone was speaking about her, and she doesn't have to do anything.” But with a busy fall up ahead, she surely will have to speak at some point about her new films even if the first time she does field questions from the press is during a TIFF press conference. Asked how she should respond to the reveal about her voting record as a Republican, Miller said, again, she doesn't need to engage. It's totally appropriate for her to say, ‘I don't discuss my politics, that's personal. Reaching across the aisle today only helps to widen one's appeal, Miller said. Lucy Robertson, head of brand marketing at Buttermilk, an agency that specializes in creator marketing, said the American Eagle campaign felt like a “misstep” for Sweeney because rather than leveraging her as a creative partner who helped shape the narrative. “It uses her as a convenient ‘hook' to hang the campaign on, in this case, with a tone-deaf ‘good genes' message that quietly reinforces Eurocentric beauty ideals like white skin, blonde hair, blue eyes.” Robertson said that “real influence” in today's market comes from being “embedded in the creative ecosystem for the long-term” rather than just doing one-off endorsement deals. In that 14-month collaboration — set to be the first chapter of a multi-year partnership — she hasn't just starred in ads — she's co-designed the Cloudzone Moon sneaker, helped craft the visual story in the evocative ‘Be Every You' campaign, and shaped how her identity and movement translate into both product and storytelling,” Robertson explained of Sweeney's Euphoria co-star. “That level of integration deepens cultural currency where we've seen Sydney front multiple brand campaigns in a short space of time, the result can feel more transactional than transformative.” A well-placed legal source familiar with negotiating A-list brand deals says it may be too soon to tell whether the social media swirl will affect Sweeney's future partnerships and acting gigs. (Amid the American Eagle backlash, Baskin-Robbins disabled comments on its TikTok videos featuring Sweeney.) At a certain level of fame, too many product endorsements could dull one's A-list image, the source added, while others turn to international markets to keep cash flow coming in while avoiding being “everywhere” on their home turf. Matt Herbert, Chief Commercial Officer of brand tracking platform Tracksuit, tells The Hollywood Reporter that the reaction to AE's campaign “doesn't need to necessarily define AE, but it is about how they react from here on.” He cites Pepsi's controversial 2017 ad with Kendall Jenner that some called tone-deaf for using strikingly similar themes to Black Lives Matter protests. Tracksuit also found that brand awareness for another one of Sweeney's brand partnerships for Dr. Squatch saw that company boosted by three percentage points from August 2024 to July 2025. (Recall that the men's soap brand sold bars made with her actual bathwater due to popular demand.) The company also notes that “trendy” is a common theme associated with Laneige, Dr. Squatch and Miu Miu among survey respondents already familiar with all three brands. As for AE's bottom line, the company's next earnings report is Sept. 4, which could offer insight to how much of an impact, positive or negative, the controversy had on sales. Herbert notes that AE was “facing pretty big challenges over the past 18 months,” with brand awareness down by 6 percentage points from January 2024 to June 2025; and consideration, preference and usage declined by 5 percentage points. … any celebrity [endorsement or] brand activation is an attempt to drive relevance, which we know from looking at all of our tracking data.” That could mean even more eyes on Sweeney and her upcoming projects, which in Hollywood is always a good thing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After “General Hospital” star Tristan Rogers, who portrayed Robert Scorpio on the long-running soap, died at 79 on August 15, another soap star spoke out to say she's “heartbroken.” Rogers' cancer diagnosis was revealed just last month in a statement given by his publicist, Anthony Turk, to Soap Opera Digest. The statement also called it a challenging time for Rogers and his family. A portion also read, “Tristan sends his love to his fans and wants them to know how much he appreciates their loyalty and encouragement over the years.” Tristan appeared in 107 of the show's 114 episodes as Lex Martin, per his IMDb page. Evans praised her costar for contributing “charm, wit, and depth to every scene,” before declaring it “an honor” to have shared the screen with him. She finished her message by sending condolences to Rogers' family, friends, and fans before saying, “He will be deeply missed.” The Melbourne native appeared in 2022 on Maurice Benard's podcast “State of Mind,” where he shared some of his memories from growing up in Australia. “I had a really good childhood,” he said, despite the family living in what he called “a pretty lousy area at the time.” He joked, “Now, you couldn't get an outhouse there for less than $3 million.” The star went on, “My parents saved, and saved, and saved and bought our house in a really good area. He said he started a rock band with a group of friends, which lasted for around three years, but he eventually realized they “weren't gonna make any money.” He said the lack of funds led him to his acting journey, which began with commercial work at age 21.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Early on in My Undesirable Friends, filmmaker Julia Loktev's monumental and marathon-length chronicle of Russian journalists attempting to practice their trade in Putin‘s Russia, an interview subject is asked about totalitarian regimes. If you look at how such governments are portrayed in movies, the person notes, the idea is that everybody is noticeably suffocating as collective boot heels press down on their throats. That's not how it tends to work in the real world, however. There's an illusion of everything being perfectly fine on the surface, that life goes on as it always has for most of the population. You have cafes filled with chattering young people, and beautiful parks, and can have food delivered to your doorstep 24 hours a day. And then some notice that the water starts to seem just a little bit hotter… . A five-and-a-half hour portrait of what happens when the concept of a free press turns into a contradiction in terms, My Undesirable Friends follows a handful of female reporters who are trying to counteract the propaganda machine of their home country — and it will look extremely familiar to many folks who currently feel like they're in a state of war while life goes on all around them. She reached out to an old friend, Anya Nezmer, who worked for an online network called TV Rain and had been calling Putin out for years. The film follows Anya, the podcasters Sonya Groysman and Olga Churakova, online reporter Alesya Marokhovskaya, and several other members of a fourth-estate sorority considered to be a fifth column by the corrupt powers that be, with Lotkev tagging along as they try to get their message heard. Sometimes, they are joyous, bantering with coworkers in the start-up–style offices and telling stories at dinner parties. Other times, they wryly trade tips about avoiding arrest or what kind of underwear is best suited for surprise, early-morning interrogations conducted by cops pounding on doors. One subject, Ksenia Mironova, is barred from visiting her fiancé in prison, a fellow journalist who's facing a long sentence for reasons that remain murky. One of the benefits of Loktev letting her film leisurely unfurl over five separate but equally compelling hour-plus chapters is that you really get to know each of these women, experience the bond they have, bask in their personalities, and share their troubles. Taken out of context, My Undesirable Friends could be mistake for a hang-out ensemble movie, or a typical docuseries following around a disparate group of urbanites as they fight the good fight and figure themselves out over several months. Except the menace behind all of the exchanges involving a slow death by a thousand executive-order cuts, or how surveillance and harassment is a daily occurrence, or the manner of doublespeak used to tarnish them as both journalists and citizens, is ever-present.

But you'll notice that the full title of Loktev's extended verité paean to these heroes is My Undesirable Friends — Part 1: Last Air in Moscow. But you spend the proceeding four chapters fully knowing what awaits them. Even before the filmmaker's cameras catch the exact moment that Rain employees are told that special forces are showing up to take them into custody and they flee in panic, the sense of instability and dread is palpable. Life during wartime will make what came before seem positively calm. At one point, Anya jokes that October 2021 will seem like paradise to them a few years down the road. Speaking of which: When Loktev premiered her must-see magnum opus at the New York Film Festival this past October, the U.S. was a very different place than it is now. As the film begins its theatrical run at Film Forum in NYC — a run which, one hopes, is just the beginning for a long jaunt in theaters throughout the country, and sets up a stay on a streaming services that make it available to as many eyeballs as humanly possible — a lot of us feel like we are in state of war while everyone else is not. Regardless of political situations, this initial batch of My Undesirable Friends‘ dispatches from the frontlines would make for absolutely magnificent and undeniably moving viewing. It's a state of the nation address that, unfortunately, is addressing a nation far beyond the borders of its subjects' home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club staffers Danette Chavez, Saloni Gajjar, Drew Gillis, and Jacob Oller to sort through the wreckage in a Roundtable discussion to find out what exactly went wrong. Danette Chavez: We are gathered here to figure out what went wrong in And Just Like That…, both in season three and the show more broadly. Let's start at the end, with our thoughts on the finale, “Party Of One.” My reaction, to quote Carrie Bradshaw quoting Peggy Lee, was: Is that all there is? Drew Gillis: As a finale to the Carrie Bradshaw saga that we've been following for almost 27 years, it was ridiculously inadequate. But as a finale to AJLT, it was about what I expected. Jacob Oller: If the finale was supposed to be representative of AJLT, it's perfectly fitting. Truly devoted to the “go girl, give us nothing” message. The literal depiction of shit and piss in this final episode is proof enough. I am not entirely shocked by how frustrating this finale was, but I surprisingly enjoyed the post-Aidan episode (and the long overdue manner in which she dumps him). DC: Nothing was going to save this show, not even a whole other season, but there's no way this was the planned series closer, right? I know MPK et al. have little respect for viewers, returning and new, but this finale leaves ellipsis all over the place. JO: This didn't even feel like a planned episode. SG: No, I don't believe for a second that they planned to end it this way, even if the ultimate goal for AJLT was for Carrie to realize that it's okay to be alone (whenever it would conclude). I almost felt like they shoehorned that dancing bit at the end in a last-minute scramble. JO: The looming threats of grandmotherhood, marriage non-believers, being (gasp) alone…these are all clearly threads put out for another season, that everyone expected to get. DC: But Saloni, at least they answered the vital question of whether Carrie would learn to love Miranda's karaoke machine! DG: King claimed that it wasn't the planned ending, but that when this ending emerged in the writers' room, they realized it was as good a place to end the show as any, which could be true at this point. But on a series-wide level, it turns AJLT into the story of how Carrie goes from being happily married to apparently coming to terms with being a widow. Maybe that is in fact what they set out to do, but I have a hard time believing that was the story they set out to tell in 2020. The “alone” vs. “on my own” distinction made me scream, like pretty much everything in her novel. SG: The $1,500 karaoke machine is one of five things in that gigantic apartment. Yet, in this so-called planned closing episode, we didn't get a single conversation between the original trio of Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte. No mention of Samantha, either—but good for Kim Cattrall, I suppose. I feel like a conversation or a round of drinks between them was the least we deserved to see for our suffering. JO: That's such a good point; they were intentionally scattered all episode. DG: That's how the original show ended too, I think. But I did expect at least a text or mention of Samantha. DC: Not to give the show too much credit, but there were signs that Carrie would end up embracing being single. The series premiere established her as newly single (well, widowed), and season two also set her up for a long-distance relationship with zero chance of succeeding. I was struck by her statement to Charlotte, about how, in this chapter of her life, the potential for another relationship isn't as high as it used to be, so she has to figure out what life looks like when it's just her. DG: To Saloni's earlier point, I think the hollowness is especially frustrating because I thought the show handled Carrie's breakup with Aidan with surprising poignancy. SG: It rings hollow for many reasons, partly it's because they kept insisting on tying the whole thing to her terrible novel for some reason. None of these finale moments carried any heft, unlike when she processes what Aidan tells her about trust and that makes her reflect on where she is at in life/in this relationship and just how much she doesn't need him. DC: See, I thought the Duncan stuff was bad! At some point, MPK (or Sarah Jessica Parker) decided everyone would just fawn over Carrie—Patti LuPone, Jackie Hoffman, Julianne Nicholson's husband. SG: Ooh, Danette I would love to hear about why you thought the Duncan stuff was bad because, like Drew, I thought it was season three's and maybe even the show's strongest point, which is not saying much, but still. DC: I saw the Duncan storyline as a Berger do-over: Carrie sparks with a fellow writer, but one secure enough to let her have her success. Maybe it's because Duncan (played by Jonathan Cake) is supposed to be this serious biographer but he loses his mind over truly bad fiction writing. JO: To your point earlier, Danette, he's so rah-rah about Carrie that it becomes ridiculous. And that's before we even get to the worst of her fiction. SG: I agree that him praising Carrie's writing was laughably bad, but I was trying to see it as him looking at her through rose-colored glasses because they share a bond that it seems like he hasn't had before? I did totally see the chemistry between them though, particularly in episode 10 when they're both at the party and at home after that. DC: But the show insists that he appreciates her mind first and foremost! I used to love Aidan in the original series but after this he is really someone I never want to think about again. DC: Jacob, you came into this with the freshest set of eyes—you never watched SATC, right? So, why did you take a chance on AJLT? It seemed like every episode was an experiment in how bad a show they could possibly air. It was clear that the original characters had been pushed aside so that the creator could better air personal grievances about young people, demographics he didn't understand, etc. DG: For what it's worth, I do think AJLT improved over the course of its run. Season one felt almost like what I imagine an army boot camp to be like, where they deliberately break you down so they can remake you in their own image. Or maybe I had just been trained by that point to accept so little that I was willing to eat it up. I agree, however, that Charlotte was far and away the best part of this show. JO: I know just from being around folks who care that Miranda seems to have had some sort of head injury throughout this new series. She was always a self-centered person and a bad writer—the free-standing hyphen in place of closed em dash in her epilogue is her final crime, hopefully—but making her über-wealthy took away what few layers she had. I watched AJLT season three alongside The Gilded Age season three, and neither MPK nor Julian Fellowes knows how to write meaningful conflict anymore. JO: The pie-in-the-face resolution to Anthony's cold feet was very much some writers realizing they'd accidentally come up with some conflict they didn't want to deal with. Same with the co-worker flirtation and Miranda's kid's terrible baby mama and…. SG: I felt the same way about Seema and Adam's marriage conversation, one that they barely had with each other but individually had with Carrie. Seema's arc ties back into the portrayal of wealth that Danette brought up. Throughout the show, she's this fabulous and successful real-estate agent. Carrie even points out she takes on high-profile clients and can't help Miranda find a place. And then, she's also found a big, empty office space? I was personally invested in her character a lot but was continually disappointed in the many ways in which AJLT failed her, as well as its new characters, who often felt like an obtuse way to overcorrect SATC‘s criticisms about having mostly white leads. Her getting with a woo-woo dirtbag was fun, but moved so slowly that, again, conflict never really got a chance to come up. DG: To that point, Danette, I was wondering if getting rid of the narration from Carrie was the main thing that really ungrounded AJLT from SATC. The framing device of these all being stories for Carrie's column, I think, created some distance that allowed for a bit more suspension of disbelief. DC: Well, we have the time of death for this show—approximately 10:30 p.m. Eastern on August 14—now we just have to rule on the cause. What would you say killed the show, or your hope that it might eventually get back on track? SG: The show was DOA for me pretty much when it began, particularly with Carrie of all people not being able to say vagina on her podcast. But I think the true moment AJLT collapsed for me was when Carrie peed in a bottle after watching Miranda and Che in her kitchen. I knew then this show had no respect or care to meet these women we've known and loved at the place/age they are in right now. SG: There were brief moments I thought it would get back on the tracks, and there are things I enjoyed seeing, like Charlotte's evolution. (For me, she stayed somewhat true to her SATC character but also matured with time.) And it was lovely to watch Sarita Choudhury strut around on my screen. But I don't want to give AJLT more credit than that. JO: AJLT and its creators live on another planet that I would love to visit. Presenting the most homophobic Gen Z-er I've ever seen, overflowing a toilet filled with shit, and then name-dropping Michelle Obama all in the same episode. DC: For me, it was the fundamental misunderstanding of who Carrie Bradshaw was that kept the show from being able to see who she would become. She was a mess of contradictions in the original series, and while it's nice to think that she would have that sorted out in middle age, it's also bullshit. Carrie cyberstalking Natasha in AJLT season one rang truer for me than her waltzing through her big empty house to Barry White in “Party Of One.” JO: Do you think it's because the creator/showrunner has also been separated from reality thanks to time and wealth? SG: I have often wondered while watching, and I know SJP must be quite involved, but how different AJLT would've been had a woman helmed the show or if that would've been a more interesting, realistic lens through which we could see these women. I don't know if it's also because I read about how Candace Bushnell also felt disconnected to AJLT‘s version of Carrie. JO: It was maybe most curious about an aging man dealing with dick problems and children around him who were engaging with the world in ways he didn't understand. SG: AJLT also never understood how New York City is a character (cliché, I know, but it's true!). The Central Park fashion show in this weather made no sense whatsoever. And I think it's details like these that the creator maybe deemed unimportant that made it so easy to disregard the show overall. DG: I agree with that point about the city, Saloni. So much of the old show was just them walking around having conversations in the park, and it feels like so much of this version was in a manicured restaurant or café or apartment. DC: So, that's our finding: bad sex and no real city.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But the powers that gave us seemingly random casting decisions like “Jared Leto as Skeletor” or “Alison Brie as Evil-Lyn” turn out to have been holding back one last fun, borderline nonsensical surprise for us, as THR reports today that Kristen Wiig is voicing Roboto in the action-figure-based film. Roboto is one of those good-style robots you're always hearing about, with a functional heart that allows him to emotionally connect with his colleagues, and be mad at talking skeletons who are constantly causing trouble. We do not, off the top of our head, know why you'd cast Kristen Wiig in this particular part—for all the world, it feels like casting agents for the film were toying around with a random name generator—but we're guessing it'll be entirely a voice role, given that the original Roboto figure, released back in 1985, doesn't even seem to have a face. Wiig is, in addition to her other talents, a well-known voice actor, having starred in projects like Sausage Party and its TV spin-off as well as the Despicable Me franchise. She's currently on the hook for a second season of her live-action Apple TV+ show Palm Royale, but we're guessing that voicing the robot that works for He-Man's dad's head guard probably won't take too big a chunk out of her busy schedule.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This nervousness brought to you by news—coming out of The Hollywood Reporter‘s comics-focused Heat Vision newsletter—that Ryan Reynolds will reportedly now also be joining the film. Reynolds set off speculation that he'd be bringing Deadpool by to grace the movie with his box office-boosting presence earlier this week, posting a vandalized version of the Avengers logo to his Instagram. (To quote Heat Vision: “Something Deadpool would do.”) Now, that arbiter of all secret information in Hollywood—”sources say”—has confirmed that Reynolds will appear in the movie, maybe shoved into a corner somewhere, because Christ, there are a lot of people in this thing. Don't worry, though: Those same mysterious (but apparently omniscient) sources confirm we're not going to see Wade Wilson finally achieving his dream of becoming an Avenger himself when Doomsday‘s December 18, 2026 release date rolls around. None of this is exactly shocking, in any case: Make Bob Iger a billion dollars, and you get an invite up from the kids' table. All of this has to, of course, be taken a) with a grain of salt, and b) with the overall understanding that we have absolutely no clue what form pretty much anything in this film will take. (The Russos have suggested it'll be kind of divisive when it arrives; we're still suspecting it'll pull some pretty hefty reality-altering shenanigans, given how Robert Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom was chatting it up with cosmic baby Franklin Richards at the end of Fantastic Four: First Steps, and the fact that the Secret Wars comic being namechecked by the movie's sequel is all about Doom turning himself into a briefly-tenured god.) We might think it might be nice to keep some of this casting stuff more secretive, but we are not Ryan Reynolds' Instagram account manager.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michaels (whose real name is David Armstrong) alleges in the lawsuit that Geffen treated him as a “sexual commodity” for years, only to later leave him destitute and tossed aside “like a used object.” But the mogul argues on Wednesday (Aug. 13) that these claims are a “work of fiction” designed to “extort Geffen by publicly shaming him.” “Unfortunately for plaintiff, Geffen has the integrity, ability and strength to litigate this case in a court of law (rather than in the press) where plaintiff's fabricated claims cannot succeed.” No such promises were ever made, Geffen argues, and Michaels won't be able to corroborate his allegations with any written documentation or witnesses. All the other claims in Michaels' lawsuit are lies, too, according to Geffen's answering brief. If anything, says Geffen, Michaels was the one to take advantage of him by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars from the mogul's coffers on luxury clothing, cosmetics, extravagant vacations, cosmetic surgery, OnlyFans subscriptions and sex workers. And while Michaels' lawsuit claims Geffen plied him with drugs as a tool of coercion, Wednesday's court filing says this could not be further from the truth. “The allegations in the complaint that Geffen encouraged or even was aware of plaintiff's illicit drug habit are a pure fabrication,” writes Glaser. Plaintiff regularly used ketamine, cocaine and perhaps other illegal drugs. Michaels' attorneys did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday (Aug. 15). With a net worth reportedly over $9 billion, Geffen has long been one of the entertainment industry's wealthiest figures. According to Michaels' lawsuit, he and Geffen met in 2016 through the website SeekingArrangements.com. Michaels says Geffen initially paid him for sex, but that the relationship later evolved into a serious romantic partnership. Geffen cited irreconcilable differences to file for divorce this past May, and marriage dissolution proceedings are continuing to be litigated separately from the civil case that Michaels initiated in July.
