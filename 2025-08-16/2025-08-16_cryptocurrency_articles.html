                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto markets are already showing early signs of momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum hover near all-time highs. While blue-chip assets like BTC and ETH are seen as safe holds, real gains often come from altcoins with asymmetric return potential — especially during the early stages of a bull cycle. A growing number of early adopters are now positioning across both large-cap infrastructure tokens and high-velocity presale gems like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which are beginning to attract serious attention from whales and analysts alike. Its lightning-fast transaction speeds, low fees, and increasing institutional interest for staking rewards continue to fuel bullish sentiment. SOL's expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystem gives it long-term relevance. Institutional accumulation following Grayscale inclusion signals confidence in its fundamentals. ADA's steady growth makes it one of the safer altcoins with long-term 5x–10x potential in a parabolic market phase. Market forecasts project 40x ROI before late-cycle expansion and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the high-conviction presale play of 2025. The project is gaining traction with both retail buyers and larger presale allocators. Backed by staking incentives and smart wallet analytics, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings more than meme coin hype — it brings infrastructure, momentum, and narrative power. Presale access is still open, but token pricing is expected to rise sharply as listings approach and rotation from DOGE, ADA, and SOL intensifies. Altcoin markets are heating up as capital rotates from large caps into smaller, faster-moving plays. Solana and Cardano remain key portfolio anchors, but presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are increasingly seen as rare early-stage opportunities that could multiply capital during the next parabolic phase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BSTR is gearing up for a significant change in the corporate finance domain through its merger with Cantor Equity Partners, set to pave the way for a Nasdaq listing. This positions BSTR as a major player in corporate treasury management. He emphasizes Bitcoin as a fundamental asset for corporate treasuries. This underscores a growing trend of accepting Bitcoin in corporate finance, as businesses turn towards integrating digital assets into their treasury management approaches. The merger between Bitcoin Standard Treasury and Cantor Equity Partners is anticipated to provide clarity on regulatory compliance for crypto businesses, particularly those in Asia. With BSTR's upcoming public offering, it will fall under strict U.S. regulations, which may serve as a compliance example for other crypto firms worldwide. According to PwC's 2025 Global Crypto Regulation Report, the U.S. regulatory environment is evolving towards clearer guidelines for digital asset securities and stablecoins. This could hasten the pace of regulatory alignment and sophistication within Asian crypto markets, ultimately creating a more stable atmosphere for these businesses. What methods can SMEs implement to handle Bitcoin's price fluctuations? Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can employ a variety of innovative strategies to effectively manage Bitcoin's volatility. Diversifying Crypto Holdings: SMEs might consider mixing volatile assets like Bitcoin with stable options such as stablecoins to lessen exposure to sudden price shifts and stabilize their treasury's overall value. Regular Bitcoin Purchases: By consistently acquiring Bitcoin at regular intervals, regardless of its price, SMEs can lessen the risks of market timing and smooth out the average cost over time. Limiting Crypto Exposure: It may be wise to restrict the proportion of treasury funds allocated to cryptocurrencies, preserving liquidity and financial stability. Yield Generation in Crypto: SMEs could stake or lend their crypto assets on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to generate returns, balancing risk and potential earnings. Risk Management Tools: SMEs can utilize regulated derivatives platforms for hedging Bitcoin positions and implement smart contracts for automated risk management. Regulatory Awareness: Keeping abreast of changing regulations, such as the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), is vital for SMEs. Investing in legal knowledge could mitigate operational risks and ensure smooth treasury operations. These approaches empower SMEs to navigate Bitcoin's volatility while harnessing its potential as a treasury asset. The ascent of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset is likely to catalyze a new wave of crypto payroll solutions in Europe. As institutional adoption of Bitcoin grows, so does the need for innovative compensation methods, particularly among tech-savvy workers and freelancers. Companies are beginning to recognize the advantages of offering crypto compensation, which aligns with the needs of a contemporary workforce. What challenges might impede the rollout of crypto payroll solutions? However, the deployment of crypto payroll solutions may encounter regulatory hurdles, including compliance with anti-money laundering and tax laws. Despite these challenges, the momentum is building, fueled by workers seeking alternatives to traditional payment systems. As Bitcoin continues to solidify its status as a treasury asset, the adoption of crypto payroll solutions could become mainstream in Europe, fundamentally changing how companies approach employee compensation. What key insights can startups take from BSTR's approach to Bitcoin? Set Clear Goals: Startups are advised to delineate specific objectives for Bitcoin integration, be it for diversification or inflation protection, and communicate these clearly to stakeholders. Establish Disciplined Policies: The creation of formal policies regarding limits on allocations, rebalancing, and compliance reporting is essential for maintaining control over Bitcoin holdings. Implement Risk Mitigation Strategies: Given Bitcoin's volatility, startups should explore methods such as dollar-cost averaging and risk management tools to stabilize treasury operations. View Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset: Instead of treating Bitcoin merely as a speculative asset, startups can benefit from holding it as a means to preserve purchasing power, especially in inflationary times.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto exchange Gemini filed an updated registration statement for its initial public offering effort, sharing a few more details in its push to become a publicly traded firm. Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Cantor acting as lead bookrunners on the IPO, Gemini said in a press release Friday. The S-1 published on Friday follows a confidential filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission back in June, and confirms "Gemini Space Station," co-founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, intends to sell an undisclosed number of Class A shares. That figure stood at $282.5 million for the first six months of 2025. "Key factors influencing the further development of blockchain networks and digital assets include the global adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology; regulatory and quasi-government restrictions on access to and operation of blockchain networks; and the maintenance of open source protocols that support blockchain networks," the filing said. Gemini is only the latest crypto company to try and go public this year, following Circle (CRCL), eToro (ETOR) and CoinDesk parent company Bullish (BLSH). BitGo has filed for paperwork to go public as well. Gemini plans to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GEMI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $59.3 million in net outflows on August 15, ending an unprecedented 8-day buying streak that brought in $3.7 billion, with only BlackRock's ETHA posting inflows of $338 million amid broader market rotation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's contradictory statements about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve added to market uncertainty, initially declaring the US “will not be buying any Bitcoin” before later clarifying budget-neutral expansion pathways. Ethereum reached $4,781.24 on August 14, its highest level since November 2021, before the Producer Price Index reading of 3.3% versus expected 2.5% triggered massive liquidations.Institutional Conviction Emerges During Retail Capitulation The aggressive buying occurred as crypto markets lost $133 billion in 24 hours, and over 221,000 traders faced liquidations. Bitcoin's sentiment reached peak bullishness precisely at its $125,000 all-time high, creating classic contrarian warning signals. Current readings show “BTC Currently Has More Greed Than Fear,” suggesting vulnerability to further disappointment. The persistent retail pessimism during strong price advances indicates potential for continued upside as institutions accumulate from weak hands. Ethereum consolidates around $4,400 after successfully breaking above previous cycle highs near $4,800, establishing new price discovery territory. However, this contrarian setup favors continued ETH strength as retail pessimism typically resolves with upward price surprises. The $59 million ETF outflow occurred during elevated retail fear rather than euphoria, suggesting institutional opportunity to accumulate at better prices. Additionally, liquidation heatmap analysis reveals massive liquidity concentration above current prices in the $4,800-$5,200 range, where short positions create fuel for potential squeeze. Ethereum appears positioned for continued upward momentum toward $5,200-$5,400 range, supported by fearful retail sentiment creating asymmetric risk-reward. The contrarian framework suggests any weakness should be viewed as an accumulation opportunity rather than a trend reversal. This is because institutional foundation provides downside protection while retail fear creates conditions for upside surprises.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Opinion by: Slava Demchuk, co-founder and CEO of AMLBot Asia's cryptoverse has lost more than 1.5 billion in the first half of 2025 — more than during 2024, including Bybit and pig butchering scams in Southeast Asia. Most engines are built around typologies of Western money laundering. They miss custom laundering channels tailored to each region, which are popping up across Asia. Blockchain analytics firms must build customized regional risk libraries and collaborate with local law enforcement to combat the level and caliber of cryptocurrency-enabled crime in Asia. Failure to address this means criminal funds will still be able to lurk in plain sight and subvert the very integrity of global compliance systems. But the Asian financial underground uses different weapons: unlicensed OTC desks in Thailand, mobile-money corridors in the Philippines, and informal peer-to-peer parking methods that don't trigger red flags as seen through today's general compliance lens. Proceeds are often left idle or are discreetly layered, before ending up at decentralized exchanges, letting the laundering cycle slip by general compliance triggers. The ability to effectively monitor crime in APAC is based on jurisdiction-level expertise. That includes mapping typical tactics, such as circular trading via Singaporean shell companies, or layering transactions with Indonesian e-wallets. Analytics providers must ingest locally published onchain data and hold living typologies to mimic real-time laundering innovations rather than wait to reverse engineer them when it's too late. Building regional risk libraries — flagging wallet clusters, known bad actors and unique entry/exit ramps — is fundamental. These tools must be built into enforcement engines, not tacked on after a scam becomes newsworthy. Local regulators are typically not well-versed in blockchain, and private analytics companies require legal authority to act. PPPs may formally permit secure data-sharing, joint training and real-time alerts. Related: North Korea crypto hackers tap ChatGPT, Malaysia road money siphoned: Asia Express These partnerships are already bearing fruit: In countries like Thailand and Malaysia, law enforcement has used real-time dashboards and analytics software to freeze funds within hours of reported fraud — compared to weeks or months in the past. These are not hypotheticals; they're operating efficiencies that save millions. We must incentivize investors to stay in a market where fraud is rife. Public-private collaboration demonstrates commitment to protecting consumers, allowing for rulemaking that is done in concert, and supporting long-term engagement across the retail and institutional market participants. Different global standards, privacy in onchain, and government overreach are all real issues. Crypto firms partnering with analytics providers with hyperlocal compliance capabilities will win mandates from hedge funds, banks, and custodian banks investing in the APAC region. Vendors dependent upon “one-size-fits-all” compliance tooling risk losing their exchange listing, investor confidence, and regional access. To push this model, industry coalitions must collaborate with analytics vendors, which will co-develop APAC-wide compliance standards. This undertaking should involve employing local specialists in underground financial activity and the development of jurisdiction-specific risk libraries. Setting up public-private partnerships with regulators is equally important; they allow immediate cooperation and enforcement rights. Without regionally tailored risk detection and cross-sectoral collaboration, it is in danger of becoming like the “Wild West”.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum holders are increasingly lining up to unstake their tokens, a trend that could put significant sell pressure on the cryptocurrency, according to one crypto expert. The Ethereum blockchain's validator exit queue hit 855,158 ETH on Friday—the highest it's ever been, according to validatorqueue.com. The tokens were worth a combined $3.7 billion as of late Friday, according to data provider CoinGecko. Staking is a process by which digital asset holders lock up their tokens to secure a blockchain network and earn rewards. Stakers may choose to unlock and reclaim their crypto amid uncertain market conditions, transferring them to comparatively risk-off assets or cashing out. The second-largest crypto asset by market cap has shed hundreds of dollars in recent days after coming close to setting a new all-time high mark. That discount reduces their value as collateral, triggering risk cuts, hedges, or even liquidations that lead to spot ETH selling,” Leon said. When that occurs, “leveraged ‘stETH loop' trades via liquidity pools on DeFi protocols stop being profitable,” Leon said. “Traders unwind by exiting positions and selling ETH to repay loans, creating synchronized sell pressure.” Growing efforts to unstake ETH came shortly after the token on Thursday came within striking distance of its record price of $4,878 hit in November 2021, per data from CoinGecko. Despite concerns about Ethereum's validator exit queue, Leon cautioned that a rise in ETH waiting to be unstaked doesn't necessarily signal that the token's price will continue to edge down. “Unstaking doesn't usually cause a sudden crash, but under stress it can act like a steady tap of new supply,” he said, “pressuring prices lower if it overwhelms new demand for ETH.” The latest news, articles, and resources, sent to your inbox weekly.</p>

The integration of blockchain into 6G-enabled Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks promises secure and decentralized communication but introduces challenges related to energy efficiency, latency, and authentication overhead. Existing clustering and security schemes fail to balance these aspects effectively in heterogeneous networks. This paper proposes a novel energy-aware cluster head (CH) selection framework using Artificial Democratic Cuckoo Glowworm Remora Optimization (ADCGRO), integrated with a lightweight blockchain layer for secure authentication and data integrity. The system optimizes task allocation across advanced, intermediate, and normal IoMT devices to minimize energy depletion while meeting ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances network lifetime by 27%, reduces average latency by 35%, and achieves 99% authentication accuracy, surpassing baseline protocols such as LEACH and HEED. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining ADCGRO-based optimization with blockchain to enhance performance and security in 6G wireless networks. Significant developments in wireless communication and computer vision1 complement newly developed 6G technology. Modern computer vision systems, combined with robust communication networks, could drastically alter our perspective and interaction with the physical world. With data speeds exceeding 100 GB/s and latency of less than one millisecond, 6G is predicted to be the next significant advancement. It aims to build on the successes of 5G. Once unthinkable, real-time computer vision applications are now realistic due to their unparalleled speed and connectivity. The promise of global connectivity offered by 6G enables computer vision systems to operate in far-off, previously unreachable regions. This will generate various opportunities in sectors such as augmented reality, transportation, agriculture, and others2. SixG technology marks a new era defined by ultra-fast data transmission, creative computer vision, and remedies to long-standing problems that will fundamentally alter our digital lives. Blockchain technologies could enable the integration of computer vision systems with 6G networks. This aligns perfectly with the distributed ledger and immutable transaction records of blockchain technology3. Three fundamental needs—data privacy, integrity, and trust—have a solution in blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is crucial for computer vision and 6G networks, as it ensures data confidentiality and integrity. Protecting the privacy and security of this data is crucial, as 6G networks enable the rapid transmission of large data volumes required for computer vision operations. Based on cryptographic concepts, the immutable ledger of blockchain technology protects data from unauthorized access or manipulation. This is particularly important in contexts like driverless automobiles, smart cities, and remote medical diagnostics, where data confidentiality and accuracy are vitally critical6. Blockchain technology also encourages individuals to trust the system4. Using computer vision technology means relying on the accuracy of the visual data and its source. The distributed ledger properties of blockchain technology, along with its immutability, enable users to authenticate data sources and verify the correctness of computations. People's cooperation on projects, including augmented reality systems and multi-agent robotics, depends on personal confidence to run regularly and consistently5. Blockchain technologies also enable the simplicity of data monetization and provenance tracking. The expansion of data marketplaces has increased the chances for computer vision data providers to receive fair compensation. Using blockchain technology, tracking data origin provides responsibility and traceability qualities extremely essential for audit purposes and regulatory compliance6. Six G networks are rather close to more decentralization in the current digital information era. Among these challenges are building confidence, pooling resources, ensuring secure data transfer, implementing access controls, protecting privacy, and establishing effective governance7,8. Typically, conventional network security solutions, which rely on encryption algorithms and centralized authority, ensure data protection, transparency, and dependability. These techniques might not be sufficient, though, in the highly dispersed systems usual of a 6G environment, where scalability, decentralization, and real-time operation are paramount. The decentralization, immutability, and traceability of blockchain technology make it a perfect candidate for the optimum moment to emerge; it solves present-day challenges and might greatly improve the security and dependability of 6G networks9. Blockchain technology has proven to be quite valuable in enhancing the security of wireless networks, particularly in 6G communication networks. Its high power consumption is one of its major downsides, particularly for nodes with short battery lives10. Network scalability and stability are compromised when nodes fail at a rapid pace, which has a significant impact on the energy consumption associated with the sophisticated consensus process11. Energy usage is drastically reduced through innovative solutions, such as the Green Sharding (GS) system, which decreases the involvement of wireless nodes in global communication. These systems use node sharding technologies and are based on geolocation. There have been reports of promising results using this method for millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications12. While GS and other optimization methods help to solve energy consumption problems, this flexibility directly influences the general efficiency and performance of the system13. Researchers have previously attempted to integrate blockchain technology with wireless communication; however, the protocols they created have not satisfied the requirements for low-latency and high-concurrency transactions14. Table 1 reveals that traditional methods of attaining agreement typically exhibit less scalability, greater delay, and inferior throughput. This is the outcome of their greater attention to maintaining constant quality. Critical healthcare services are increasingly dependent on IoMT systems, which have motivated this study because of the potential catastrophic effects of network outages, energy shortages, or security breaches. While some studies have examined blockchain and metaheuristic clustering (e.g., Glowworm Swarm Optimization and Cuckoo Search) independently for secure communication, very few have combined the two into a single framework optimized for 6G networks. Additionally, previous research has failed to adequately account for the diverse energy consumption patterns of IoMT devices, leading to wasteful resource utilization and premature network failures. Blockchain, paired with 6G networks, could meet contemporary information security needs and inspire new digital economic and social paradigms, potentially having significant societal implications15,16. Many technological-related difficulties and concerns preclude this convergence17. Among the problems are low latency, effective data transport, security and privacy concerns, as well as the scalability and performance of consensus techniques. Considering this backdrop, we aimed to develop a strategy that would maximize efficacy while implementing security policies simultaneously. This method seeks to effectively integrate blockchain technologies within a 6G network, thereby integrating and protecting them. The main objectives of this research are these: Introducing a hybrid metaheuristic optimization approach (ADCGRO) that balances the strengths of Cuckoo Search, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, and Remora Learning to optimally select cluster heads, considering device heterogeneity and residual energy. Integrating a lightweight blockchain consensus mechanism with the clustering process to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant data transmission without imposing excessive computational overhead. Developing a comprehensive system model that evaluates the framework across multiple performance metrics, including throughput, packet delivery ratio, energy efficiency, latency, accuracy, and network lifetime, all of which are validated through extensive simulations. This project aims to support the development of intelligent, safe, and high-performance communication systems by leveraging the complementary capabilities of blockchain and 6G networks. Begum et al.18 presented an HLDAG-BC—a mix of blockchain technology and augmented recurrent neural networks to guarantee safe and effective routing in MANET-IoT systems. Identity-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (ICPA) is a lightweight, secure node authentication system offered by the HLDAG-BC, which provides tamper-proof communication. Intrusion detection using an HDLNN helps enhance overall network security. By providing a safe and scalable key for MANET-IoT networks, the proposed framework seems to be a practical option for potential 6G applications. FedChain, a novel federated blockchain-based clustering system designed to enhance connection and network security in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) FANETs, was first introduced by Pramitarianini et al.19. Blockchain and federated learning (FL) help protect the cluster against Sybil attacks. As such, a safe cluster can be created without increasing the amount of control messages. Maximizing stable cluster formation with minimal control overhead depends on formulating the cost function maximizing issue using a cross-layer architecture under minimal influence overhead. Data from the physical layer (position, mobility, channel capacity, and residual energy) is combined in this design with data from the network layer (connectivity). Furthermore, selecting the best CHs based on parameters such as maximum residual energy and velocity restrictions ensures long-term stability. Inter-node transactions are authenticated using blockchain technology, which ensures secure development by separating Sybil attack nodes from real users. This action helps to reduce the security concern. Through a unique FL framework, which can predict and identify node conditions in real-time without requiring additional control packets, security performance can be enhanced, and control overhead during cluster formation can be reduced. Regarding connection, control overhead, and security performance, the FedChain-based clustering method beats the lowest ID (LI), maximum connectivity degree (HCD), and standard blockchain-based clustering (CBC) protocols according to simulation results. The results show that the FedChain-based clustering system provides significant security and connectivity, making it a great option for dynamic settings. Using 6G technology and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify Chinese characters in their natural surroundings, Li and Li20 developed SE2ERS, a safe end-to-end recognition system. For character estimation, the computer vision system utilizes a data flow, specifically a 6G gradient directional histogram (GDH). The suggested SE2ERS analyzes conventional Chinese text recognition techniques and data transmission parameters to achieve 6G communication. With simple Chinese characters, the testing results show that SE2ERS achieves an accuracy of 88% and beats current approaches. Unlike prior approaches, which achieved a 72.8% success rate, our method achieves an average success rate of 84.4% using challenging Chinese characters. Furthermore, the WHCC model exhibits a twelve times higher data encryption rate complexity than more traditional methods, thereby significantly improving data security. By utilizing blockchain technology, Chinnasamy et al.21 propose a novel approach for enhancing security in 6G wireless networks. This project uses blockchain technology in a user sensor network. The results of the simulation have been affected by several network parameters, including accuracy, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end latency, throughput, and energy efficiency. Furthermore, by selecting the optimal node and path for data flow, it can reduce network traffic, a valuable additional benefit. The suggested method achieved a 95% energy efficiency, 97% throughput, 50% end-to-end latency, 96% accuracy, and a 94% packet delivery ratio. Liu et al.7 investigate the integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks from the perspectives of security and performance, thereby proposing a technique that focuses on building secure mechanisms and improving performance. The potential applications of 6G networks and how blockchain technology can enhance them must be highlighted to underscore the need to incorporate blockchain technology into 6G networks. Therefore, it is essential to assess security needs in the construction of 6G networks to ensure the security of data flow and communication using blockchain technology. Furthermore, to address ways to maximize communication and storage to meet the needs of 6G networks, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) solution is proposed for the asynchronous consensus mechanism used by blockchains. This will be implemented to maximize the integration of blockchain and 6G networks. Ultimately, it is equally important to provide valuable suggestions for future studies that will advance blockchain technology and facilitate the integration of 6G networks. This study employs various IoMT devices with distinct initial energy levels in monitoring scenarios utilizing 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. N 6G-enabled IoMT devices constitute the network, which comprises three levels of energy heterogeneity. The 6G-enabled IoMT devices that comprise the network range from highly sophisticated to relatively simple, with varying degrees of initial energy. As a result of the energy disparity, advanced 6G-enabled IoMT devices start with more energy than intermediate 6G-enabled IoMT devices, which in turn have more energy than regular nodes \(\:{E}_{nrm}<{E}_{int}<\:{E}_{adv}\). The progressive 6G-enabled IoMT devices have their energy described as \(\:{E}_{0}\times\:(1\:+\:\omega\:)\times\:{n}_{adv}\), and intermediate 6G-enabled IoMT devices as \(\:{E}_{0}\times\:(1+\varPsi\:)\times\:{n}_{int}\), with normal 6G-enabled IoMT device at \(\:{E}_{0}\times\:{n}_{nrm}\). The overall energy is \(\:{E}_{T}={E}_{0}\times\:N\times\:(1+\varPsi\:\times\:{k}_{o}+k\times\:\omega\:)\), combining the energy contributions from all levels. The proportion of advanced and intermediate 6G-enabled IoMT devices within the network are indicated by \(\:k\) and \(\:{k}_{\text{o}}\). A diverse range of 6G-enabled IoMT devices, categorized as advanced, intermediate, and basic nodes, each with its unique energy capacity, are integrated into the network architecture. To ensure that energy-intensive processes, such as CH selection, are handled by competent devices, a hierarchy is established, where advanced nodes have the most energy reserves, intermediate nodes have moderate energy, and regular nodes have the least. This network architecture allows the system to use high-energy nodes for mission-critical activities and lightweight devices for routine sensing. To optimize CH selection in 6G settings, an energy-aware setup is essential. It allows balanced energy consumption, extends the total lifespan of the network, and ensures optimal integration with blockchain for safe, low-latency data transfer. There are several assumptions about the network setup of the suggested work, which are as follows: Although 6G can facilitate considerable mobility in IoMT devices, the proposed study presumes a static network configuration. Despite the differing energy capacity of nodes, it is anticipated that all 6G-enabled IoMT device within the network would maintain uniform configurations and operational characteristics. Unlike IoMT devices, which are constrained by energy limitations, the data- gathering sink is anticipated to operate without such restrictions. The network's IoMT devices are anticipated to be sensor nodes equipped with 6G communication capabilities, improving their connectivity and data transmission effectiveness. The purpose of this endeavor is to utilize the same radio energy utilization model as prior studies, to focus on the transmission and receipt of data between 6G-enabled IoT devices and sink connections. Utilizing 6G technology for fast and low-latency connectivity, devices located in homes, hospitals, and ambulances comprise the IoMT network. By utilizing smart contracts, the blockchain network ensures secure and transparent data management. Using this will enhance data security and facilitate tracking. Gathering data, a “sink” sends it to the “blockchain” for processing. The primary objective of the suggested research is to reduce energy consumption in IoMT networks by leveraging 6G technology, thereby promoting sustainable communication in these systems. Establishing a comprehensive fitness function with several key elements will help determine the CH precisely. Each of these factors significantly impacts the CH choosing process. This all-encompassing solution ensures effective energy management in 6G IoT systems. This comprehensive approach ensures a more thorough and efficient decision-making process. Choosing a particularly active CH is therefore rather crucial. This is assessed concerning the first fitness factor,\(\:{F}_{1}\) which assesses the rate of the node's residual energy (\({E}_{\text{r}\text{e}\text{s}\text{i}\text{d}}\)) to its primary energy (\({E}_{\text{i}\text{n}\text{i}\text{t}}\)). The distance sensor nodes must travel to interact with either other nodes or the sink, which is a fundamental component of this work. By evaluating the distance between the sink and the node (\({D}_{\text{S}\text{N}\text{o}\text{d}\text{e}-\text{S}\text{i}\text{n}\text{k}}\)) in respect to the average distance between all nodes and the sink (\({D}_{\text{A}\text{v}\text{g}(\text{S}\text{N}\text{o}\text{d}\text{e}\text{s}-\text{S}\text{i}\text{n}\text{k})}\)), this fitness parameter guarantees the network runs efficiently and cheaply. Our approach depends critically on selecting the CH from among the remaining live nodes, as, once network operation starts, the network's energy starts to drop, leading to an increasing number of dead nodes over period. As seen below, to define a fitness parameter. This threshold must be maintained at an elevated level for effective CH selection. Conversely, cluster energy level emerges as a significant determinant in CH selection beginning with the second round. To provide effective energy management and balanced load distribution across the network, the node density must be high, allowing a suitable candidate node to be selected as the CH. To achieve this, we multiply these parameters using linear weight functions, as described in our technique. This integration makes it easier to evaluate the system's performance while still considering all the important factors. It provides a weighted aggregate of multiple separate elements, where each element is multiplied by its corresponding characteristics. The suggested method is to evaluate each node based on the value of its fitness function. The bee's inherent curiosity enables it to identify food sources, which it then shares with other nearby bees. Expansion of the food supply will result in this occurrence. The method by which bees search for new food sources is chaotic. (6), scout bees are responsible for monitoring the exploration procedure, whereas paid and bystander bees are tasked with exploiting the ABC22: The variable k represents an arbitrary integer ranging from 1 to the total count of bees utilized. Each issue possesses an arbitrary dimension represented by j, and the variable \(\:{\varphi\:}_{ij}\) is a randomly assigned value within the range of − 1 to 1. (7) to ascertain which items to consume, taking into account the likelihood of each worker bee's actions: In addition to being governed by Eq. fit is fitness values of the working bee's answer, Eq. Bees employ it to enhance their understanding of the chosen food supply, whereas worker bees utilize it for navigation purposes (9). Depending on the objective function, it is feasible to optimize for scheme efficiency or to reduce scheme errors. This study aims to identify the most efficient approach for mitigating errors in system or cost functions. Like other optimization strategies, the cuckoo technique commences with an initial population, whereby each cuckoo occupies a unique spatial location. Nonetheless, even with offline parameter optimization, the convergence rate remains invariant. I will refer to these arrays as “habits” when implementing the Cuckoo approach. This issue space encompasses several habitats, each proposing a distinct viable answer. The profit functions habitat is assessed to determine (Eq. The cuckoo strategy utilizes a notably superior profit function. The GSO algorithm's mechanisms were inspired by the natural behavior of glowworms, which are attracted to brighter sources of light. To maximize multimodal functions, swarm intelligence (SI) methods, such as the GSO technique, operate in a manner analogous to that of glowworms. Swarm intelligence algorithms may effectively tackle complicated optimization problems that prior methods are either incapable of addressing or unable to resolve comprehensively. In the realm of statistics, several algorithms provide numerous advantages and disadvantages. You may be able to observe glowworms during a nocturnal stroll in the meadows. All glowworms possess a light substance called luciferin. Consequently, every glowworm will radiate light, irrespective of the surrounding darkness or cave environment. A decision range and a sensor range define the community, allowing any two glowworms in the area to interact with each other. The luciferin level of each glowworm is adjusted by increasing its previous value. While the glowworm is in its positionally effective state, this change occurs. A portion of its value is subtracted from its total value to mimic the steady deterioration of luciferin. The following suggestions are offered for updating glowworm luciferin using Eq. The collection of time t is Eq. A sensor variety that bounded \(\:(0<rd\:i<\:rs)\) surrounds the capricious. Equation (15) elasticities the probability of neighbour \(\:j\in\:{N}_{i}\left(t\right)\) for each glowworm \(\:i\). Equation (16) then characterizes the glowworm's movement model. where || || where s is the step size and is an operator for the Euclidean norm. Then, in the m-dimensional real space R m, the position at time t is denoted by \(\:{x}_{i}\left(t\right)\in\:{R}_{m}\). Equation (17) illustrates a neighbor range update phase used to identify multiple peaks in a landscape of multimodal functions. Then, set V_0 to be the initial range charge for each glowworm. The subsequent rule is used to update each glowworm's neighbourhood variety: If there is less than a 4-meter gap between a Grey Wolf (GW) and its nearest neighbour, the GW is allowed to roam. Additionally, the coverage rate may be slower with a smaller step size. Finding the optimal step size is thus a challenging task. This investigation will not have a constant step size; rather, it may vary with each cycle according on the GW. There will be several adjustments to GW's step size. One of these is the introduction of a dynamic step size, which should increase computational precision in velocity stage. What follows is an explanation of the ROA, or remora optimisation method. where \(\:{R}_{rand}^{t}\) is a random location. An experience attack works in a manner comparable to how knowledge grows: it checks in with the host regularly to determine if it needs to be updated. where \(\:{R}_{att}\) is a step and \(\:{R}_{pre}\) is the prior iteration's site, distinct by Eq. where the i-th remora's freshly created site is characterised by \(\:{X}_{i}\left(t+1\right)\). With this in mind, to enhance the remora's search efficiency by including a novel autonomous foraging mechanism into the core algorithm. A fair balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved by the upgraded remora optimisation algorithm, which features a more adaptive mode. Since the proposed approach is compatible with various optimisation algorithms, it has some generalisability. The proposed approach significantly enhances data security and integrity by integrating blockchain technology with IoT environments facilitated by 6G23. This indicates that pre-authentication has occurred and that all nodes inside the network have developed a certain level of trust among themselves. The nodes employ Proof of Authority (PoA), a streamlined consensus mechanism. The technique depends on a consortium of trustworthy nodes, referred to as authorities, to authenticate transactions and produce blocks. At each instance when data is transmitted from the CH to the primary blockchain layer, a blockchain node should validate the transaction, authorize it, and generate a new block. There are two main components to a block on this blockchain: the header and the transaction data. This block's version, genesis timestamp, nonce, difficulty target, Merkle root, and hash of the previous block are all essential pieces of information that are included in the header. Altering the content of one block will initiate a domino effect, resulting in changes to the hashes of succeeding blocks. Secure, decentralized data exchange and automated decision-making among diverse devices and service providers are two ways in which blockchain is facilitating the adoption of intelligent, context-aware services in 6G networks. Without relying on a centralized authority, 6G apps such as smart healthcare, autonomous vehicles, or adaptive content distribution may utilize smart contracts to negotiate resources like bandwidth and processing power dynamically. They can also make choices based on real-time context. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity, immutability, and auditability of all contextual data, including user movement patterns, network load, and service priority. This enables the network's artificial intelligence (AI) agents to make reliable predictions and adaptive improvements. For instance, in a 6G smart city network, blockchain technology can enable vehicle edge nodes to safely exchange traffic data and establish low-latency priority lanes for emergency vehicles using smart contracts, ensuring that decisions are made transparently and securely. Furthermore, it has been verified that additional components, such as the transaction root and difficulty, are authentic. All transactions within the block undergo independent verification. An error notice appears if any transaction fails. Implementing data modifications in any block becomes exceedingly challenging as the number of blocks in the chain increases significantly. Should a single block be altered, it would create a discrepancy in the hashes of all following blocks, jeopardizing the whole blockchain and facilitating manipulation. In this method, cluster chiefs diminish the transaction volume sent to the blockchain and alleviate the processing burden on nodes by consolidating data from IoMT sensor devices. A permissioned blockchain utilizing Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus, with a limited number of pre-approved validators, might expedite transaction validation, reduce latency, and improve throughput compared to conventional methods such as Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW). Scalability and efficacy for IoT devices are attained by mitigating network congestion and energy consumption through the restriction of the total number of validator nodes. By replacing trust in centralised authority with a distributed, immutable ledger, blockchain technology enhances 6G decentralized authentication and access management. Decentralized consensus systems, instead of a central server, manage authentication for each device, user, or service node by assigning them a unique cryptographic identity and storing it on the blockchain. By automatically enforcing role- or attribute-based access controls, smart contracts can limit access to 6G services and network slices to approved organizations exclusively. In addition to improving reliability and security, this eliminates frequent problems associated with conventional methods, including centralized authentication methods such as identity spoofing and single points of failure. A region covering 100 square meters by 100 square meters employs between 100 and 200 sensors, connected to various “gateways,” to assess the suggested methodology. It is recommended to incorporate a dynamic threshold generation method directly into the operation, rather than appending a predefined threshold value to the detection process24. The parameters under examination are likely to evolve. This is due to their vulnerability to physical influences such as temporal variations and seasonal fluctuations. Although temperatures may increase by midday, they are frequently lower in the morning and evening25. The sliding window theory is utilized to ascertain value. Forty samples related to the sliding window were collected for analysis. The performance of the proposed ADCGRO-blockchain framework was evaluated against six state-of-the-art methods: KNCM, WHCC, DAG, LEACH, HEED, and a PBFT-based blockchain model. Metrics including throughput, energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio, authentication accuracy, latency, and network lifetime were analyzed across 1,000 simulation rounds in heterogeneous 6G-enabled IoMT networks. Table 2 presents the proposed model's probability of attacks in various metrics. The proposed model consistently outperformed all baselines, achieving average energy efficiency gains of 18%, throughput improvements of 16%, and authentication accuracy exceeding 99%, compared to 82–88% for the next best methods (DAG and WHCC). Notably, network lifetime increased by 27% over DAG and by 35% compared to LEACH, highlighting the effectiveness of ADCGRO's energy-aware CH selection and lightweight blockchain consensus. To confirm that these results were not due to random variations, paired t-tests were performed between the proposed framework and each baseline. All improvements were statistically significant with p-values < 0.05. For example, the network lifetime improvement over DAG (27%) was observed with a 95% confidence interval of ± 3%, while the latency reduction (35%) over HEED had a confidence interval of ± 2%. The experimental analysis of the proposed model's attack investigates two critical factors: Rr (Response Rate) and Rc (Response Cost). This inquiry examines the influence of varying assault probability on these metrics. As the likelihood of an assault escalates from 0.1 to 1, both Rr and Rc exhibit a steadily rising trajectory. This holds for each of these metrics. Nevertheless, these values escalate to 1195 and 303.65, respectively, when the likelihood of an assault reaches its maximum, which is 1. Table 3 presents the experimental investigation of the proposed model in comparison to existing procedures, evaluated using four metrics: throughput and accuracy. One important statistic is latency, as 6G URLLC services require end-to-end delays to be less than milliseconds, even with blockchain's additional consensus procedures. Both throughput and energy efficiency are critical. Throughput measures the system's capacity to maintain multi-gigabit data rates throughout huge IoT traffic, while energy efficiency guarantees that blockchain validation operations do not unnecessarily drain the limited power of edge devices. For security reasons, authentication and access accuracy measure the system's capacity to reject valid nodes without allowing unwanted access, while transaction finality time shows how fast the blockchain commits and validates data, which affects real-time service delivery. Balanced traffic loads, as a function of network resource consumption, assess the efficacy of spectrum allocation and smart contract-driven routing. Data integrity score, attack detection ratio, and other security robustness measures evaluate the 6G system's resistance to spoofing, Sybil, and double-spending attacks. The Comparative Analysis of Several Algorithms aims to evaluate the performance of several methods—specifically KNCM, WHCC, DAG, and the Proposed model—regarding accuracy and packet delivery ratio (PDR) across three distinct scenarios: varying the total number of stations. The suggested approach achieves values of 88, 87, 83, and 94, hence sustaining a competitive edge and surpassing competing strategies. The proposed model outperforms DAG, WHCC, and KNCM in terms of accuracy, throughput, and energy efficiency, yielding superior results across all metrics. It provides 97% accuracy, 95% PDR, 98% throughput, and 96% energy economy. Ultimately, the proposed model consistently yields superior outcomes across various experimental settings, validating its efficacy in enhancing network performance. Figure 5 presents a comparative analysis of the proposed ADCGRO-blockchain framework against KNCM, WHCC, DAG, LEACH, HEED, and PBFT-based blockchains in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and accuracy. These gains result from the energy-aware CH selection of ADCGRO, which balances network load, and the lightweight blockchain integration, which secures communications without introducing significant overhead. Collectively, these results validate the model's ability to deliver reliable, energy-efficient, and secure performance in heterogeneous 6G-enabled IoMT networks. This result demonstrates the proposed scheme's ability to minimize unauthorized access while maintaining seamless network operations. Time-series trends—energy depletion and packet delivery ratio (PDR). Figure 7 illustrates the time–series trends for energy depletion and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). This trend validates the effectiveness of ADCGRO's load-aware CH rotation strategy in prolonging network lifetime. The proposed framework maintains a PDR above 85% throughout the simulation, whereas LEACH and HEED degrade to below 50% by round 800 due to unstable clustering and higher packet losses. This demonstrates the proposed system's robustness and reliability in extended operations, which is critical for real-time IoMT applications in 6G environments. Thousands of sensor nodes with diverse mobility patterns, traffic volumes, and energy capacities will be utilized in future assessments to evaluate the scalability and usability of the proposed IDS architecture within various Mobile Sensor Networks. It remains to be seen how well the framework performs in extremely large-scale and dynamic situations, even if the present research demonstrates its advantages in accuracy, energy efficiency, and network longevity within modestly scaled 6G-enabled IoMT scenarios. The IDS will be tested in various scenarios to assess its performance in cluster formation, intrusion detection, and blockchain-secured communication, with minimal energy overhead and low latency. These scenarios include smart city infrastructures, disaster recovery environments, and vehicular sensor networks. To achieve this, the system will incorporate hierarchical clustering techniques and adaptive decision-making capabilities powered by machine learning. This study presented a novel ADCGRO-based CH selection framework integrated with blockchain to enhance the energy efficiency, security, and reliability of heterogeneous 6G-enabled IoMT networks. By combining metaheuristic optimization for balanced clustering with lightweight blockchain consensus, the proposed model achieved substantial improvements, including a 27% increase in network lifetime, a 35% reduction in latency, and 99% authentication accuracy compared to LEACH, HEED, DAG, and PBFT-based models. While the results confirm the framework's ability to enable safe, eco-friendly, and scalable communication for next-generation IoMT systems, certain limitations remain. The current evaluation is limited to static IoMT deployments, utilizing a simplified consensus protocol that overlooks scalability and security trade-offs under high transaction loads. Furthermore, the metaheuristic clustering approach does not yet leverage adaptive deep learning (DL) methods, which could enhance responsiveness to dynamic network conditions. Future research will focus on scaling the framework to large heterogeneous IoT deployments, integrating advanced neural network models such as reinforcement learning and federated DL for adaptive optimization, exploring blockchain techniques like sharding and hybrid consensus to balance security and efficiency, and validating the framework's extensibility across other domains, including smart transportation and industrial IoT. Addressing these directions will enable the framework to evolve into a fully adaptive, secure, and scalable solution for managing diverse 6G-enabled IoT environments. Mu, J. et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>India's thriving crypto community faces high taxes and no clear regulations, forcing companies and talent to look abroad. India—home to 1.4 billion people and trillions in economic potential—is standing at the edge of another technological breakthrough: the global crypto and fintech revolution. A generation of innovation passed it by, forcing India's vast talent pool into service industries catering to foreign markets rather than building global technology leaders at home. Top engineers from India's leading universities continue to leave for better opportunities abroad. Now, the pattern is repeating itself in crypto: leading Indian blockchain companies are relocating to Dubai and Singapore to escape high taxes and regulatory uncertainty. Despite years of promises, India has yet to table a comprehensive crypto bill in parliament. Instead, lawmakers moved quickly on just one front: taxation. In 2022, a 30% tax on crypto gains was introduced. Since then, the government has collected significant revenue: Many in the industry saw this as tacit recognition that crypto was not illegal. But hopes faded as no regulatory clarity followed. The absence of clear rules has turned India's crypto landscape into a high-risk environment. Fraudulent schemes and hacks thrive in the regulatory vacuum. Globally, governments are moving toward clearer crypto rules. The U.S. under Donald Trump is positioning itself as a leader in crypto adoption, while allies like South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, the European Union, and the UK are rolling out comprehensive regulations. India's Parliament Finance Panel has signaled interest  in studying Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) in 2024–25, raising hopes for a shift toward a more progressive policy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum price is in the spotlight as ETH whales join Unilabs Finance, drawn by its presale growth and $12.6 million raised in its ICO. With whale backing, rapid funding success, and growing buzz around its technology, the big question now is, can UNIL outpace crypto giant ETH? The Ethereum price has been displaying continuous growth and is currently trading at $4,739, almost reaching its all-time high of $4,891 in 2021. This influx is fueled by factors such as massive inflows into ETH ETFs and robust on-chain demand. Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance is seeing ETH whales join its momentum, drawn by ICO growth and game-changing investment tools. Unilabs Finance's ICO has raised over $12.6 million, thanks to its standout features that extend the momentum behind Ethereum price trends and the growing interest in ETH ETF products. This smart feature can scan real-time data, spotting on-chain activity and new market movers. It would give investors insights similar to tracking an ETH ETF inflow and rising Ethereum price, helping them act early. There's also the Early Access Scoring System (EASS) that can evaluate projects on use case, team strength, tokenomics, and sentiment. Much like following the Ethereum price momentum, it can flag high-potential opportunities before they boom. Unilabs also offers four investment funds, which helped it raise over $12.6 million in its ICO, attracting the kind of attention as with the rising Ethereum price and growing ETH ETF market. The BTC Fund focuses on Bitcoin-based assets, balancing portfolios much like adding diversity alongside ETH ETF investments. The RWA Fund invests in real-world assets such as property or commodities, bringing stability similar to how an ETH ETF spreads risk while benefiting from Ethereum's growth. Together, these funds give investors varied ways to grow wealth, making Unilabs a serious player alongside Ethereum and its ETF-driven momentum. Unilabs holders also get to enjoy Revenue-Sharing and Staking Rewards, with 30% of platform fees redistributed to UNIL token holders, and tiered bonuses for presale participants. It can mirror how Ethereum price surges enrich long-term holders of ETH and ETF-based investments. All these tools can create a user-friendly suite that drives Unilabs Finance's ICO performance. Its success draws attention just like the Ethereum price rally and ETH ETF inflows do, but with whales now shifting some of their focus toward Unilabs' notable growth and promising platform. With $30 million Assets Under Management (AUM) and CoinMarketCap listing coming soon, excitement is building fast. With significant growth, investor interest, and an attractive bonus, now is the time to join Unilabs before its listing and ride the next wave alongside Ethereum's rally.
