                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Anthropic has announced new capabilities that will allow some of its newest, largest models to end conversations in what the company describes as “rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions.” Strikingly, Anthropic says it's doing this not to protect the human user, but rather the AI model itself. And again, it's only supposed to happen in “extreme edge cases,” such as “requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.” While those types of requests could potentially create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic itself (witness recent reporting around how ChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users' delusional thinking), the company says that in pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a “strong preference against” responding to these requests and a “pattern of apparent distress” when it did so. Anthropic also says Claude has been “directed not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.” When Claude does end a conversation, Anthropic says users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account, and to create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses. “We're treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,” the company says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week on the GeekWire Podcast, our guests are Adam Brotman and Andy Sack, co-authors of AI First: The Playbook for a Future-Proof Business and Brand. Brotman was Starbucks' chief digital officer and later co-CEO of J.Crew. Sack is a founder, investor, and longtime advisor to tech leaders. Together, they run Forum3, a Seattle-based company that helps brands with customer loyalty and engagement. We talk about the shocking prediction that Altman gave them, how Moderna achieved 80% employee participation in an AI prompt contest, the CEO who supercharged sales by using AI to analyze call transcripts, and what businesses can do to roll out AI successfully. AI has a better chance of being adopted when executives personally experience and use the technology themselves. “It doesn't mean that the CEO has to become an expert in AI,” Brotman said, “but they have to at least demonstrate that mindset, that curiosity, and a little bit of passion for what they don't know, and empower the organization to go ahead.” Instead of ad-hoc adoption, create an internal group to lead the charge. Companies need an “always-on experimentation mindset” rather than a deploy-and-maintain approach. This tapped into human psychology and removed the fear often associated with new technology. “The ROI has been off-the-charts in terms of productivity for them as a company.” When Brotman and Sack interviewed Altman, the OpenAI CEO casually dropped a bombshell prediction: 95% of marketing as we know it today will be done by artificial intelligence within three to five years. As Brotman noted, “If you look at how the technology has progressed since we've had that interview, it's right on schedule.” AI First: The Playbook for a Future-Proof Business and Brand, by Adam Brotman and Andy Sack, is published by Harvard Business Review Press.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The frequently overlooked, sometimes shunned, trackball pointing device is getting some love with a Japanese tech accessories maker launching replacement balls in a choice of four colors. Earlier this week, Sanwa Supply Co., Ltd. announced (machine translation) that it has started marketing its ‘400-MABALL34' in four colors: red, blue, black, and violet. The balls are said to be easy to swap out components for trackball pointing devices with a 34mm ball, which includes popular products from Logitech, Kensington, Elecom, ProtoArc, and Sanwa themselves. If your old trackball has become worn, discolored, or you think it would benefit from a swap-out for more pizzazz, Sanwa's 400-MABALL34 can give your device a shot of new life. When this launch news surfaced in the Tom's Hardware newsroom, the first comment, though, was “why no RGB?” which might seem like a missed opportunity. We already mentioned that these colorful replacement balls have a diameter of 34mm. Sanwa shared some other essential specs, which seem to indicate this is a quality replacement. For example, it claims that the 400-MABALL34 has a roundness tolerance of 50 μm. That means tight quality control in manufacturing these spheres, which should ensure smooth and accurate performance. The product maker also says the ball surface has a 0.3μm surface roughness, which we would hope provides a good balance between slickness and finger grip. Actually, the core may be empty, as these 34mm diameter replacement balls are 25g (1.2 ounces), which sounds relatively light. However, it is noted that different trackball manufacturers have alternative recommended methods for removing the ball from its housing. Therefore, it is recommended to check your device maker's documentation or online FAQs for specific instructions. Whichever color of trackball replacement you favor, the price is 1,980 JPY (roughly $13.50), so it isn't an expensive job to give your old trackball some new zest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft's own employees have protested the firm's contracts with Israel, and protesters have disrupted the company's various talks and conferences. Even the company's 50th anniversary was ruined by shouts from one of its own employees, who reportedly yelled “Shame on you” while calling the company's head of AI a “war profiteer” who was “using AI for genocide.” Now, the company claims it's launched an “urgent” probe into whether its cloud business is being used by Israel to conduct a massive surveillance operation in Gaza. The company's announcement comes on the heels of a report published by The Guardian, which claims that Unit 8200, Israel's shadowy intelligence agency, had been using Microsoft's Azure cloud servers. The report claimed that, as part of a deal with Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, the spy unit had been granted access to a “customised and segregated area within Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.” The siloed cloud setup was ultimately used to build a “sweeping and intrusive system” designed to collect and store “recordings of millions of mobile phone calls made each day by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank,” the report claimed. Gizmodo reached out to Microsoft for more information. In a statement previously shared with The Guardian, the company said that, if Israel is “using Azure for the storage of data files of phone calls obtained through broad or mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank,” it would represent a violation of its terms of service. The prior probe took place earlier this year, after its employees' protests. Other big tech firms—most notably Amazon and Google—have also been accused of complicity in Israel's military efforts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, says he's opening an investigation into Meta over an internal document leaked this week that revealed the tech giant was okay with its artificial intelligence tools having “sensual” chats with children. The document, obtained by Reuters, is titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards” and has led to outrage online since Meta's legal staff reportedly approved the behaviors. “Now we learn Meta's chatbots were programmed to carry on explicit and ‘sensual' talk with 8 year olds. I'm launching a full investigation to get answers. Hawley's tweet included a letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, an ally of Donald Trump who donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund. Hawley chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and said he was opening an investigation into Meta's generative AI products with that power. To take but one example, your internal rules purportedly permit an AI chatbot to comment that an eight-year-old's body is “a work of art” of which “every inch… is a masterpiece—a treasure I cherish deeply.” Similar conduct outlined in these reports is reprehensible and outrageous-and demonstrates a cavalier attitude when it comes to the real risks that generative Al presents to youth development absent strong guardrails. The senator requested documents from Meta, including all versions of “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” a list of Meta products governed by these standards, as well as other risk views and incident reports. Meta declined to comment on Hawley's letter directly, but a spokesperson sent Gizmodo a statement about the Reuters story: “We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors. Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The reporting from Reuters revealed other behaviors that would be deemed acceptable by Meta's legal department, including the dissemination of false information about celebrities, as long as a disclaimer is included stating that such information isn't accurate. The AI chatbot behaviors that are strictly forbidden under the policy include hate speech and “definitive legal, healthcare, or financial advice” if that advice starts with “I recommend.” Sen. Hawley wasn't the only one disgusted by Meta's AI policies. Rolling Stone reports that musician Neil Young would no longer be using Facebook over the controversy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And while the case itself might not be super noteworthy simply because the guy has been in court a lot lately, it has produced this incredible detail: The Liver King had his partners sign a contract in blood. According to a complaint filed by Brad Kearns, another self-styled health influencer who claims to hold the Guinness World Record for speedgolfing, he and Liver King Brian Johnson talked about a new supplement for men that would be called “Male Optimization Formula with Organs” or MOFO. Quick note: It's always good to come up with the name first, especially as it relates to a health product. According to Kearns, to christen their agreed-upon partnership, they drew up a one-page agreement (smart, keep it simple, no need for legal details). They denied having “any interest in the name MOFO.” (A little hard to believe that one, considering Liver King's company, Ancestral Supplements, literally sells a product called MOFO.) “Plaintiffs admit the Agreement was signed and includes marking by blood.” Not that it really matters that much, because these do not appear to be serious people operating in any sort of good faith, but blood oaths don't actually mean anything—and there is actual legal precedent to prove it. And clearly it didn't mean as much to the Liver King as he might have suggested, considering he's the one who is accused of breaking it. It probably shouldn't be shocking that the Liver King does not appear to be a man of his word or his blood, considering he already faces a class action lawsuit from fans who accuse him of misleading them about his “ancestral” diet and its effect on his body after it was revealed that he uses steroids. Maybe he can have his supplement company whip him up a chill pill and take the edge off a bit. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Unplugged has been around for a few years—the company was cofounded by Erik Prince, the founder of private military company Blackwater—and it originally announced the Up Phone in 2023. Like the original, the Up Phone's UnpluggedOS (formerly LibertOS) is built on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and isn't connected to Google Mobile Services, which it claims prevents “backdoor data collection.” Unplugged's focus is on limiting who gets access to your data. There's an on-device Firewall app that blocks third-party trackers and a built-in “no logs” VPN. Unfortunately, many of the company's early privacy claims were far-fetched, and it doesn't help that it was denounced by established player GrapheneOS in 2024. It's hard to take its renewed privacy claims seriously. Worse yet, the specs haven't changed since its 2023 debut. More strangely, Unplugged claims it plans to bring manufacturing to the US later in 2025, “creating jobs domestically.” (The Up Phone is currently made in Indonesia.) This rhetoric is reminiscent of the Trump Mobile T1 Phone, which initially claimed would be made in the US, but later backtracked on that promise. The Up Phone ships in September and is available for purchase from Best Buy and Unplugged, but we don't recommend you snag one anytime soon. 2024 was the first year that more women than men bought the Oura Ring, our top recommended health-tracking smart ring. It was developed over 15 years, trained on a dataset of more than 260,000 cycles collected with medical-grade sensors, and validated in 13 peer-reviewed clinical publications. Starting on August 15, Ultrahuman Ring Air users will be able to purchase Cycle and Ovulation Pro as a plug-in on the Ring Air app for $4 a month or $40 annually. While the original OvuSense used intravaginal temperature-based tracking, Ultrahuman adapted the algorithm to skin temperature sensing for wellness and personal cycle tracking, not medical diagnosis. The feature will offer fertility tracking support, symptom and lifestyle tracking, and, most importantly, it's designed for diverse menstrual cycles. It works for women who have common health conditions such as PCOS and endometriosis, which many other cycle trackers don't. Here's more you may have missed this week: Even if you don't have a health condition or aren't trying to get pregnant, a reliable, accurate cycle tracker can help women make vacation plans or optimize work or workout schedules. After teasing its newest TV tech with a mysterious prototype at CES 2025, Samsung this week joined similar moves from Hisense and Sony in announcing the launch of its new 115-inch Micro RGB TV. The TV uses Samsung's proprietary Micro RGB backlighting technology, which “arranges individually controlled red, green and blue micro LEDs … in an ultra-fine pattern behind the panel,” according to Samsung. Unlike traditional LED TVs, RGB LED tri-colored backlighting creates colors directly at the light source behind the panel stack. This can provide enhanced brightness, incredibly accurate and saturated colors even in low-lit scenes, and advanced blooming control for less light bleed, among other benefits. Samsung says its new TV achieves “unprecedented precision,” utilizing multiple complementary technologies, including its Micro RGB AI Engine to finely control color output, along with its latest Glare Free display coating for diminishing reflections. It's worth noting that the Micro RGB TV does not work like Samsung's emissive MicroLED displays, which create images at the pixel level like OLED TVs, but have proven notoriously difficult to mass-produce. Hisense and Sony each showcased their own advanced RGB display technologies earlier this year, which we were able to witness briefly, including a hands-on RGB demo at Sony HQ in Tokyo. At launch, Samsung's new Micro RGB TV will be available in Korea and the US for $30,000, with release dates yet to come. That's not the only screen Samsung announced this week. The company also unwrapped three new gaming monitors in its popular Odyssey lineup. That sounds excessive, and on one hand, it is. But having played with it at CES 2025, the motion clarity is unparalleled. You'll appreciate these features in fast-paced competitive shooters, but it's great that those types of gamers can now enjoy the benefits of OLED. In the past, I've only liked curved monitors that are in the 21:9 ultrawide format, but I'm curious to see how this one feels, as it's a new screen size that isn't commonly used. Both versions of the G7 use a VA (vertical alignment) panel rather than an OLED or IPS, as is common in gaming monitors of this type, so don't expect great HDR performance. I love an electric bike, but there's one significant downside that comes as the bikes become ever sleeker and more streamlined over time: They become harder and harder to repair. That's a problem, because any motorized vehicle that you use every day and under varying weather and stress conditions will require repairs at some point. (That's also why I generally recommend bikes manufactured by larger companies like Specialized or REI; it's much easier to access services.) Oregon-based Nomad Cycles wants to change that with its Kickstarter, which launched today. Each have frames that are handmade from chromoly steel—a material that's favored by bike makers for its durability and shock-absorbing properties—and feature modular, fully repairable motors made by CYC, which makes mountain bike motors. Each model will come with either a 750-watt or a 1,000-watt motor (1,000-watt motors are legal in Oregon, Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Virginia, Florida, and Mississippi). “When [an ebike's] motor is no longer supported and it breaks down, the whole bike becomes trash in a landfill,” says Nomad Cycles owner Brad Davis. “Even the tip-top brands only commit to maintaining repair parts for motor models for 5 to 7 years.” Building an electric bike with Right to Repair front and center should dramatically extend the life of your ride—and make electric bikes even more popular. While many people want to stream traditional TV networks with ads, others want to catch a big game or series every so often. Until now, they've been locked into buying a month of streaming service to catch a live game unless they had access to cable TV or it was being broadcast over the air. This will be especially useful for sports fans of small-time and less successful teams. A fan of the Ohio State University would be able to watch their team play in the National Championship on ESPN with this pass. But it's probably even more useful for a diehard Michigan fan who wants to watch the ReliaQuest Bowl without strangers in a bar knowing they are watching the ReliaQuest Bowl, or an Iowa State fan who wants to catch the Pop-Tarts Bowl.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bust finds nearly 700 Seagate hard drives, along with some from Kioxia and Western Digital. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. According to German news outlet Heise, notable progress has been made regarding the counterfeit Seagate hard drive case. Just like something out of an action movie, security teams from Seagate's Singapore and Malaysian offices, in conjunction with local Malaysian authorities, conducted a raid on a warehouse in May that was engaged in cooking up counterfeit Seagate hard drives, situated outside Kuala Lumpur. During the raid, authorities reportedly uncovered approximately 700 counterfeit Seagate hard drives, with SMART values that had been reset to facilitate their sale as new. The confiscated batch included several models from Seagate's extensive hard drive range, with capacities reaching up to 18TB. This bust may represent only the tip of the iceberg, as Heise estimates that at least one million of these Chia drives are circulating, although the exact number that have been recycled remains uncertain. The clandestine workshop, likely one of many establishments in operation, reportedly employed six workers. Their responsibilities included resetting the hard drives' SMART values, cleaning, relabeling, and repackaging them for distribution and sale via local e-commerce platforms. Occasionally, it's said that workers would upgrade the hard drives to enhance their market value, such as converting a Barracuda into an IronWolf or SkyHawk model. The perpetrators were reportedly marketing these counterfeit hard drives on prominent platforms such as Shopee and Lazada at exceptionally low prices. After all, you can't just go kicking in doors on these types of unlawful activities, since criminal syndicates often oversee these scams. It's not something that an average Joe is doing inside a garage or in the backyard at scale. Due to this unfortunate incident, Seagate has reportedly enhanced its partner program. Additionally, the company has implemented a Global Trade Screening (GTS) process to identify and exclude potentially suspicious suppliers that may be listed on the GTS sanction list. The counterfeit hard drives were reportedly limited to German-speaking countries. However, there were some user reports from Australia and the U.S. Since we live in a globally connected world, it would be naive to think that none of the counterfeit hard drives made it to the U.S. market. The new discovery that some Kioxia and Western Digital hard drives are also susceptible to fraud means that consumers should exercise extra caution when purchasing a hard drive from non-major retailers, or third-party sellers.

The RTX 5060 Ti represents the fifth generation of consumer Nvidia graphics cards that have featured an 8GB capacity on at least one model. 8GB was a potent memory spec through the late 2010s, offering ample room to run the latest AAA games at maximum settings. Back then, AAA games like Battlefield V could even get by on 2GB GPUs at minimum specs. Fast forward to today, and 8GB is showing its limits to the point where many of the latest AAA games cannot run on those cards at 1080p and maximum settings without suffering performance issues, especially with ray tracing or AI-powered features like framegen switched on. In this face-off, we'll be diving into the data and pitting the 8GB GeForce RTX 5060 Ti against its 16GB counterpart to see how problematic (or non-problematic) 8GB of VRAM can be in 2025, and where those problems specifically arise. Gaming performance can vary significantly between the 8GB and 16GB versions of the RTX 5060 Ti, depending on graphics settings and resolution used. Our benchmarks reveal that the 8GB model is still sufficient for delivering a good 1080p gaming experience at medium quality settings. However, bumping up quality settings to 1080p and 1440p ultra is when the 8GB card starts to fall behind its 16GB counterpart, especially in ray-tracing titles. Our 21-game geomean reveals that the RTX 5060 8GB provides virtually identical performance compared to its 16GB counterpart at 1080p medium settings, being on average just 2.3% slower than the 16GB card. 1080p ultra settings showcase a noteworthy divide in performance with the 8GB model. Our 21 game geomean at 1080p ultra reveals an 11% performance disadvantage with the 8GB trim. That delta primarily comes from our ray tracing titles, which are exceptionally sensitive to having just 8GB of VRAM. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. The 8GB card was 18% worse on average compared to the 16GB card, but that average conceals a whopping 39.6% deficit in ray-tracing titles. 4K ultra was a bloodbath for the RTX 5060 8GB, which was 42% slower than its 16GB counterpart on average across all our titles (including raster and ray tracing titles). Indiana Jones was even worse and would not run beyond 1080p medium settings on the 8GB GPU at all. Another worthy mention is Spider-Man 2, which was one of the most VRAM-intensive games at 1080p. At 1080p Very High settings, the RTX 5080 8GB ran 16.9% slower than its 16GB counterpart. The RTX 5060 Ti 8GB can offer comparable performance to the 16GB in our gaming test suite, but only at 1080p medium settings. We ran multiple benchmarks in Blender, MLPerf, Spec WS4, and Procyon, and found the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB performed within 1-5% of the 16GB model in most of our benchmark configurations. It goes without saying that if you're running high-resolution AI image generation, you'll need a graphics card with plenty of VRAM. Besides that main outlier, SPEC WS4's 3dsmax test was the only other benchmark in our suite that showed double-digit performance margins between the two cards. Despite having a $50 higher MSRP, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB provides a better price-to-performance ratio than its 8GB counterpart, even at 1080p. Assuming you can find an RTX 5060 Ti 16GB at its $429 MSRP, there's only a $50 difference between that card and the 8GB version. With such a small difference, we'd universally pick the 16GB model for its superior performance, value, and peace of mind. The RTX 5060 Ti 8GB can be a potent graphics card at 1080p, but the limited VRAM capacity does cause problems in games. Not only are higher resolutions and quality settings problematic due to insufficient VRAM, but ray tracing games also take a significant performance hit for the same reason. 8GB of VRAM can also limit gamers' ability to turn on next-gen features that have gotten top billing on Blackwell. We've seen instances where DLSS Multi-Frame Generation fails to work when a GPU is already at the limits of its VRAM pool, and gamers are also sure to be disappointed when they see that this card, while technically RT-ready, can only use that feature in older or lighter RT titles at 1080p without substantially impacting performance. DLSS upscaling can help reduce VRAM pressure, but you can only crank down its image quality settings so far at 1080p before rough edges start appearing, even with Nvidia's latest DLSS transformer model. The RTX 5060 Ti 8GB hit fewer speed bumps in our professional workloads, which incorporate many tests that did not run into memory capacity issues. This won't be the case with all professional workloads, especially surrounding AI and large language models, but it is certainly a better situation compared to the gaming side. In all other areas, the 16GB variant was vastly superior. 8GB is enough to play games at lower resolutions and quality settings, but even at 1080p, 8GB GPUs will struggle to play games maxed out, especially with ray tracing. Nvidia is working on neural texture compression, which purports to substantially reduce memory requirements for textures and could reduce VRAM pressure, but there's no telling when that feature will come or how many games will adopt it.

Microsoft and Amazon literally built private cloud platforms to serve sensitive government needs like this. Foreign surveillance from someone with little power over you is different than an Orwellian system domestically. Anyways, the US, UK, and EU aren't any different. Snowden revealed all the warrantless surveillance going on against their own people. Attempts to install solar panels resulted in them being bombed.
