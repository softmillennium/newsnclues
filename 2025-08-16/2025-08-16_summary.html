Vladimir Putin told Donald Trump that he would end the war if Ukraine surrenders the Donetsk region to Russia, The Telegraph can reveal.

The Russian president said he would make unspecified territorial concessions in Kyiv's favour in exchange for control over the mineral rich eastern oblast.

Reports suggested these concessions could be made in the tiny slivers of land Russia controls in Sumy and Kharkiv, while the frontlines in Ukraine's south would be frozen.

His demands were outlined by the US president in a call with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, and a group of European leaders following their meeting in Alaska.

The details of the peace summit in Anchorage will further fuel fears that Mr Zelensky will be pressured to cede territory and accept numerous Russian demands as part of Mr Trump's quick-fire attempt to end the war.

“Trump wants this done as soon as possible,” a European official told the Telegraph.

Mr Zelensky has made clear that he is not willing to discuss ceding territory that is not already controlled by Russian forces as part of any peace deal.

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney welcomed what he said was US openness to providing security guarantees to Ukraine under a peace deal to end Russia's war against Kyiv.

“Robust and credible security guarantees are essential to any just and lasting peace. I welcome the openness of the United States to providing security guarantees as part of Coalition of the Willing's efforts,” Mr Carney said in a statement.

A former US Nato representative has said it is “just not credible” that Ukraine could be offered the protection of Nato members without actually joining the organisation.

Reports emerged today that security guarantees for Ukraine were discussed in Alaska, which could see Ukraine's allies, including the US, promising to intervene if Russia decided to attack it again.

But, speaking to the BBC, former US Nato representative Ivo Daalder challenged the feasibility of the security plan.

“I don't believe that president Trump is willing to go to war against Russia to protect Ukraine,” he said, noting that none of the Nato members were willing to do so either when Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

“No one in Europe today trusts Donald Trump's US to defend them if they were attacked, and no-one in Ukraine is going to believe that unless and until they are the member of the one organisation that exists explicitly for that purpose,” he added.

The Ukrainian General Staff on Saturday said that Kyiv's troops have advanced up to two kilometres (1.2 miles), repelling Russian troops on the northern Sumy front.

US president Donald Trump backs a Russian proposal for Moscow to take full control of two Ukrainian regions and freeze the front line in two others which Moscow only partially controls, a source told AFP.

The source with knowledge of the matter said Vladimir Putin “de facto demands that Ukraine leave Donbas”, an area consisting of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions in eastern Ukraine.

“Trump is inclined to support it,” the source said.

A three-way summit Donald Trump has mooted with Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin could take place in Europe, Germany's leader suggested on Saturday.

“I think that such a three-way meeting will take place,” German chancellor Friedrich Merz said in an interview with TV networks NTV and RTL, according to an advance transcript AFP obtained.

“The date and place are still to be worked out. We have proposed that a place could be found in Europe,” he said.

The leaders of eight Nordic-Baltic nations said on Saturday that they remain steadfast in their support for Ukraine and to the efforts by Donald Trump to end the Russian aggression against Ukraine.

The leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said in a statement that achieving peace between Ukraine and Russia requires a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine.

“We welcome president Trump's statement that the US is prepared to participate in security guarantees. No limitations should be placed on Ukraine's armed forces or on its cooperation with other countries,” the statement said.

Russia's reaction to Donald Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska has been nothing short of jubilant, with Moscow celebrating the fact that the Russian leader met his US counterpart without making concessions and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump's ceasefire demands.

“The meeting proved that negotiations are possible without preconditions,” wrote the former president Dmitry Medvedev on Telegram. He added that the summit showed that talks could continue as Russia wages war in Ukraine.

Trump entered the high-stakes summit warning “I won't be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” and threatening “severe consequences” if Moscow refused to cooperate.

But after a three-hour meeting with the Russian side that yielded no tangible results, Trump shelved his threats and instead said the meeting was “extremely productive”, even as Putin clung to his maximalist demands for ending the war and announced no concessions on the battlefield, where Russian forces are consolidating key gains in eastern Ukraine.

 Putin on Friday demanded Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk and Luhansk as a condition for ending the war, but offered Trump a freeze along the remaining frontline, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks said.

Although Luhansk is almost entirely under Russian control, Ukraine still holds key parts of Donetsk, including the cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk and heavily fortified positions whose defence has cost tens of thousands of lives.

Putin told Trump that in exchange for Donetsk and Luhansk, he would halt further advances and freeze the frontline in the southern Ukrainian region of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, where Russian forces occupy significant areas.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has consistently rejected giving up territory and on Saturday European allies reaffirmed that Ukraine's borders must not be altered through force.

On Saturday morning, Trump also publicly dropped plans for an immediate ceasefire he had himself championed for months, instead embracing Putin's preferred path to ending the war: pushing through a far-reaching agreement before halting any fighting.

“It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.

All in all, the view from Moscow is that Putin appears to have gained the upper hand.

“Putin gave Trump nothing, but still got everything he wanted. Trump finally listened to his demands,” said a member of the Russian foreign policy establishment, speaking on condition of anonymity.

In his remarks after the meeting in Alaska, Putin gave little indication of softening his stance, repeating that Moscow wanted the “root causes” of the conflict addressed – Kremlin shorthand for demands to demilitarise Ukraine, restrict its domestic politics and block its path to Nato.

No economic incentives offered by Trump's team seemed to sway Putin – the economic delegations meeting was even scrapped – with observers stressing he would always prioritise the war in Ukraine over whatever financial gains peace might unlock.

Trump admitted there were still “one or two pretty significant items” left to resolve with Putin, but most worryingly for Kyiv, he ramped up pressure on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling Fox News host Sean Hannity: “Now, it's really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done.”

These comments were quickly seized upon in Moscow.

“Both sides directly placed responsibility for achieving future results in negotiations on ending military actions on Kyiv and Europe,” Medvedev, now the deputy chair of Russia's security council, wrote.

Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said: “Trump now appears to be shifting much of the responsibility on to Kyiv and Europe. Ukraine is likely to face increased pressure from the US to begin substantive discussions of Putin's conditions.”

She added that Trump was “once again clearly charmed and impressed by his interlocutor”, referring to the warm body language and effusive compliments the US president directed at Putin.

The key question is how far Trump will press Zelenskyy, who is due to meet him in Washington on Monday, to accept a deal on Putin's terms and whether European allies can once again steer Trump on to a different course.

“Trump clearly did not fully accept the settlement plan that Putin is promoting,” cautioned Stanovaya.

For now, though, confidence runs high in Moscow.

“The tasks of the special military operation will be accomplished either by military or diplomatic means,” wrote a senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Klishas, on Telegram.

Officials close to Putin felt free to contradict Trump outright. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide who attended the Alaska meeting, said no talks had taken place about a three-way summit between Putin, Zelenskyy and Trump, directly rebutting Trump's claim to reporters that a meeting was in the works.

Russian state media and the Kremlin elite were already in high spirits as Trump rolled out the red carpet and treated Putin as an equal, despite the Russian leader being wanted by The Hague court for war crimes.

“Western media are on the verge of completely losing it,” wrote the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, as Putin landed in Alaska.

“For three years they told everyone Russia was isolated and today they saw a beautiful red carpet laid out for the Russian president in the US,” she added.

On Saturday morning, Russia's Channel One morning news bulletin highlighted the pomp of the summit, its international visibility, and the warm welcome for Putin, a striking contrast to his isolation by western leaders since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

“The red carpet and handshakes … are in all global publications and TV channels,” a presenter cheered, noting it was the first time Trump had met a visiting leader at the airport.

White House officials said it mentioned the abductions of Ukrainian children by Russian forces in occupied territory

Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from first lady Melania Trump to Russian leader Vladimir Putin raising the plight of Ukrainian and Russian children caught in the middle of the ongoing war between the two European countries, it was reported on Saturday.

The contents of the letter were unknown – but two Trump administration officials told Reuters that it mentioned the abductions of children resulting from the war that broke out after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

Putin was indicted by the international criminal court in 2023, and still faces arrest in 125 countries, for his alleged role in the war crime of abducting those children and transferring them from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.

Slovenian-born Melania Trump did not attend the peace summit between Trump and Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday.

But she has previously said that her ambition as US first lady was to be akin to Eleanor Roosevelt, who was known for her work advocating for children's rights and welfare during Franklin D Roosevelt's presidency.

Ukraine has called the abductions of tens of thousands of its children taken to Russia or Russian-occupied territory without the consent of family or guardians a war crime that meets the United Nations treaty definition of genocide.

The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, conveyed his gratitude to the US first lady on his call with Trump on Saturday, Ukraine's foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said on Saturday.

“During the conversation, President Zelenskyy also conveyed his gratitude to first lady Melania Trump for her sincere attention and efforts to bring forcibly deported Ukrainian kids back,” Sybiha said on X. “This is a true act of humanism.”

Ahead of Friday's summit, the White House stated that Russia's abduction of more than 20,000 Ukrainian children “remains a concern” for Trump seven months into his second presidency. Moscow has previously said it has been protecting vulnerable children from a war zone.

The issue returned to the headlines earlier in August, when the non-governmental organization Save Ukraine accused Russia of “state-sponsored child trafficking” after a group of administrators in Russia-controlled areas of Ukraine published an online catalogue of what they called Ukrainian orphans.

Organization head Mykola Kuleba said the database from the Russia-installed administration's education ministry in the Luhansk region contains data on 294 Ukrainian children under the age of 17 who have been separated from their parents.

Kuleba noted the website shows the names, photos, descriptions of personalities and hobbies of the children.

“Russia isn't even trying to hide it any more,” Kuleba said. “It's openly trafficking Ukrainian children.

“The way they describe our children is no different from a slave catalogue. This is real child trafficking in the 21st century, which the world must stop.”

After news of the first lady's letter was posted, the Bring Kids Back UA initiative expressed gratitude to Melania Trump for her concern. “Deep gratitude to [the first lady] for caring so profoundly about the fate of Ukraine's children. Each word of support brings them closer to their families, communities and home,” it said.

US lawmakers have demanded the return of Ukraine's children from Russia before any peace deal is agreed to and in July introduced a congressional resolution calling for their return.

Led by Texas Republican congressman Michael McCaul and New York Democrat Gregory Meeks, the resolution condemns Russia's abduction, forcible transfer and facilitation of the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. A US Senate version was introduced by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat.

Meeks said “the Russian military has cruelly abducted and illegally deported tens of thousands of Ukrainian children from their homeland”.

“These atrocities are not isolated incidents,” Meeks said. “They are the direct result of Putin's war of choice.”

Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu has ordered binding arbitration to put an end to a strike by Air Canada's flight attendants that has grounded flights and disrupted air travel for hundreds of thousands of people in Canada and overseas. 

The strike, which officially began just before 1 a.m. ET on Saturday, followed several days of silence at the negotiation table, after the carrier declared on Tuesday that negotiations with the Air Canada Component of CUPE had reached an impasse.

“I have exercised my authorities under Section 107 of the Canadian Labor Code to direct the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order the parties to resume and continue their operations and duties in order to secure industrial peace and protect the interests of Canada, Canadians and the economy,” Minister Hajdu told a news conference on Saturday. 

Ms. Hajdu said she has also ordered the Board to aid the two parties in reaching an agreement in binding arbitration.

The union accused the Liberal government of violating its Charter right to take job action. Ottawa's decision gives Air Canada AC-T “exactly what they want - hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation,” said Wesley Lesosky, President of the Air Canada Component of CUPE.

Mr. Lesosky and other CUPE representatives have accused Air Canada of stalling negotiations in anticipation of Ottawa quashing a strike.

Picket lines were active at airports across Canada on Saturday, including Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver, the union said.

Reacting to Ms. Hajdu's announcement, a group of picketers outside Toronto Pearson Airport started chanting “Patty Hajdu, shame on you” and “Forced to fly, we won't comply.”

In recent days, union representatives have said that the airline would not meet to negotiate, with the carrier stating that it had responded to each offer. The airline has been urging the federal government to intervene, while the union has said Ottawa should let the negotiations take place at the bargaining table.

The union issued a strike notice on Wednesday after the airline declared the two parties had reached an impasse. The airline responded with a lockout notice of its own that went into effect early Saturday morning.

What followed the next several days was a bitter back-and-forth between the two sides, with each blaming the other for failed negotiations and cherry-picking aspects of the offers on the table.

On Thursday, the carrier began winding down its operations in preparation for a full stoppage of its Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights.

Early Saturday morning, Air Canada said it had been reducing its schedule of about 700 daily flights since the strike notice on Wednesday and anticipated about 130,000 customers would be affected.

As of 8 p.m. ET Friday, about 623 flights had been cancelled and 100,100 people impacted by the then-coming strike, Air Canada said in a social-media post to X.

On Saturday, travellers in Toronto's Pearson Airport took turns waiting at the edge of a belted barricade blocking entrance to the Air Canada aisle of the airport to speak with airline representatives.

Air Canada said earlier this week that it would take about a week for the airline to resume global operations after instituting a full shutdown.


The union representing around 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants could go on strike as early as Aug. 16 after negotiations between the two sides reached an impasse, and the company has already begun to cancel flights.

Vladimir Putin winced as he realised, at least momentarily, that he was not in control.

No number of Russian agents armed with bulletproof suitcases could shield him from being pelted by the sorts of questions he had managed to avoid since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine.

Sitting next to Donald Trump in front of a blue wall emblazoned with “pursuing peace” ahead of their high-level talks in Alaska, the Russian despot was in unfamiliar territory.

As one reporter shouted, “Mr Putin, will you break your ceasefire?” it was clear he was not in a cocoon of Kremlin mouthpiece Russian media, but surrounded by US journalists determined to hold him to account.

His wry smile evaporated into one of alarm. He looked pleadingly to the left and furrowed his brow.

“Will you commit to not killing any more civilians?” another reporter yelled. Putin put his hands to his mouth and appeared to say something, before the press were swiftly removed.

The moment was a brief but stark reminder to the Russian leader that while Mr Trump may have rolled the red carpet out for him, he is a man with an International Criminal Court warrant for his arrest and on the sanctions lists of most Western governments.

After the room descended into a chaotic shouting match, the gaggle of reporters were ushered out.

It was then that Putin, Mr Trump and their advisers began highly-anticipated closed-door talks.

Less than an hour before, Putin had been met with a warm welcome as he stepped onto US soil for the first time in a decade.

At 11.08am local time, after Mr Trump had already descended the steps of Air Force One, Putin finally ventured out of his own aircraft and walked briskly down the stairs to join the US leader.

In a meeting such as this, every fine detail will have been negotiated – including which leader steps out of their aircraft first.

With grey skies and Alaskan mountains setting the scene behind them, the two men walked down respective red carpets and joined one another at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

In an overt display of warmth that was quickly criticised by US media, Mr Trump grinned and applauded as he waited for Putin to join him.

When the two were finally face-to-face, they engaged in a lengthy handshake as they exchanged pleasantries.

The images were some of the most extraordinary in recent diplomatic history.

In the 42 months since Russia launched its full-scale war in Ukraine, every Western leader has refused to meet Putin. Yet here was Mr Trump welcoming him.

Standing on the red carpet, having descended the steps of Air Force One a fraction before Putin, Mr Trump applauded the approaching Russian leader before shaking his hand and clasping his arm.

As the two men turned and walked towards a podium that read “Alaska 2025”, a five-ship formation flypast of a B-2 bomber flanked by F-22 Raptor fighters flew above their heads.

The spectacle appeared to take the Russian president by surprise, as he stopped momentarily to get a proper view of the planes overhead.

Standing on the raised platform quickly erected for this photo-op, the two men stood with their arms by their sides, both looking awkwardly rigid.

It was then that US journalists began firing the first of many questions at the Russian leader.

“Did you underestimate Ukraine?” one reporter shouted. Another asked if he would stop killing Ukrainian civilians. Putin pointed at his ear, suggesting that he could not hear.

It was at this moment that an apparent last-minute offer was made for the Russian president to ride to the summit venue alongside Mr Trump in the Beast, the US presidential limousine.

The two leaders had been due to be picked up separately on the tarmac after arriving on their respective flights.

Putin's “Aurus” limousine, complete with Russian number plates and a flag on its bonnet, had been waiting to ferry him to the talks.

But they both slipped into the eight-ton armoured car with only two security officials accompanying them in the front, raising suspicions in US media about the conversations that were had on the short drive across the military base.

As the car drove away, cameras captured Putin sporting a beaming smile and waving his hand to the crowds.

The ensuing chaotic press conference was held in the moments before the official talks, marking the first time that the leaders had come together for a face-to-face for a bilateral meeting in six years.

Mr Trump was flanked by Steve Witkoff, the Middle East envoy who has previously negotiated with Putin, and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.

Mr Rubio greeted Putin with a stern handshake, but appeared far more jovial with Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, with whom he has been holding regular phone calls.

While Mr Trump had initially planned to carry out discussions one-on-one, the president's team announced that the meeting had been changed to a three-on-three just hours before the meeting was set to take place.

The meeting lasted around three hours, half of the time that had been touted by Russian media outlets ahead of the gathering.

It was reported that a lunch between Putin and Mr Trump had also been cancelled, suggesting that their talks had gone badly.

The world's media was summoned to a press conference, with one question looming: would the US president appear alone?

If the meeting had gone poorly, Mr Trump had declared, he would not stand side-by-side with Putin and brief the press.

But as the seats in the auditorium filled up, two podiums remained on stage, and a Russian speaker sound checked the lectern reserved for Putin.

If the Russian leader had appeared slightly untethered at the beginning of the day, he was now back in control.

It was Putin, not Mr Trump, who began the press conference, a detail that even the Trump-loyal network, Fox News labelled as “really stunning”.

Putin said he wanted the war to end but that he was worried about Kyiv and European capitals “throwing a spanner in the works”.

No details of a ceasefire were provided, but Putin did offer Mr Trump something that he wanted: recognition that the war would not have started if he were president in 2022.

“Today when President Trump said that if he was the president back then there would be no war and I'm quite sure that it would indeed be so,” the Russian president said, translated to English for reporters in Alaska.

Mr Trump, stood at his presidential lectern, stared straight back, offering the slightest nods of approval in response.

For months, the US president has been telling anyone who would listen that he believes that the Russian army would not have invaded Ukraine if he had beaten Joe Biden and retained his place in the White House for a second consecutive term.

His Russian counterpart's willingness to acknowledge the dubious claim served as the vindication that the US president had been seeking.

It was an olive branch from Moscow reminiscent of their last meeting in Helsinki in 2018, when Putin, standing beside Mr Trump at a joint press conference, insisted that Russia had not interfered in his election victory.

Mr Trump described his counterpart's missive as “profound”, before heralding the talks as “productive”. However, he admitted that sticking points remained, “one the most significant”. He did not elaborate on what that was.

But some 12 hours after the press conference, details emerged of the talks that suggest Mr Trump did make some progress with Putin in those few hours.

During a call with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, and a group of European leaders following their meeting, Mr Trump outlined the demands Putin had made. 

A European official told The Telegraph the Russian despot said he would end the war if Ukraine surrenders the Donetsk region in exchange for unspecified territorial concessions. 

While Russia holds the majority of the Donetsk region, Ukraine is still in control of large swathes of the oblast, which makes up its main line of defences in the east.

This concession would give Russia, which already controls a significant amount of Ukraine's Luhansk region, control of the eastern Donbas.

Such territorial gains would give Russia an unabridged staging post for future attacks into the regions of Zaporzhia and Dnipropetrovsk in the direction of Kyiv.

It also prompts concerns that Mr Zelensky will be pressured to accept Putin's demands as part of Mr Trump's quick-fire attempt to end the war.

In one notable gear change, Mr Trump said the US would be ready to participate in “Article 5-style” security guarantees for Kyiv, referring to Nato's mutual defence clause.

It is the first time that the president has indicated he would join the Coalition of the Willing of European countries, led by the UK, France and Germany, planning to police any ceasefire agreement.

Putin also tabled a demand for “protections” for the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, which Mr Zelensky banned last year after accusing it of being complicit in Putin's war.

The move provided the Russian president with an excuse for his invasion, claiming that military action was taken to protect Russian speakers and culture in Ukraine.

On Monday, Mr Zelensky will fly to Washington to discuss Putin's list demands and Mr Trump's peace plans. The UK, France and Germany are planning to join the meeting.

The Alaska press conference had ended with no questions, helping Putin dodge the scrutiny that had made him squirm earlier that day.

If the Russian leader had been made to feel uncomfortable under the glare of dozens of broadcast cameras, he would now return the favour to his American friend. 

“Next time in Moscow,” Putin said, breaking into English for full effect.

“Ooh, that's an interesting one,” Mr Trump replied. “I don't know. I'll get a little heat on that one, but I could see it possibly happening.”

            An emboldened President Donald Trump is increasingly using his bully pulpit to stamp his imprint on Washington, DC — pushing the bounds of executive power to reshape a city that once snubbed him.
    


            Trump in his first seven months has sought extraordinary control over key cultural institutions, taking over leadership of the Kennedy Center and demanding changes to Smithsonian museums that align with his political beliefs. He's slashed the size of the federal workforce, moved to sell off government buildings and embarked on a pricey White House renovation that will make the world's most famous address more closely resemble another one of his private clubs.
    


            And in an unprecedented move triggered by his own gripes with DC government, Trump has taken control of the city's police force and sent a surge of federal law enforcement into streets.
    


            The moves reflect the president's long held desire to put his mark on the nation's capital and solidify his legacy in monumental ways before passing the MAGA torch onto a successor.
    


            White House officials and close allies of the president told CNN that Trump's decision to prioritize these actions boils down to one underlying point: He believes winning the 2024 election delivered him a mandate to impose his influence on a city he has long viewed as being captured by Democrats and liberal elites.
    


            “He is far more confident this term than when he first came to Washington. He is self-assured in his decisions, and he is far more willing to take risks,” a person close to Trump told CNN.
    


            One White House official put it this way: “After 2021, everyone counted him for dead,” adding that Trump won a series of legal cases and clawed his way back to the top. He now feels liberated.
    


            “A lot of what is driving his agenda stems from the fact he believes he was given a mandate in ‘24,” the official added. “Now he is enacting.”
    


            A key difference in Trump's second-term approach to DC stems from whom he surrounds himself with.
    


            During his first term, Trump deferred several decisions to the aides he placed in the West Wing, many of whom worked tirelessly to counteract what they viewed as him following through on his worst impulses. Struggling to manage the competing factions within his White House and broader GOP, he notably shied away from engaging with a city whose residents had roundly rejected him. (Trump won just 4% of the vote in DC in 2016, followed by 5% in 2020 and 7% in 2024.)
    


            Trump declined to participate in the traditional tentpole events of official Washington, like the Kennedy Center Honors and White House Correspondents Dinner. He rarely ventured off the White House grounds during the week — aside from some visits to his local Trump Hotel — and spent as many weekends as possible in the friendlier confines of his clubs in Florida and New Jersey.
    


            This time around, Trump has maintained his aversion to visiting the city's establishments, outside of a few trips to the Kennedy Center to discuss his planned changes to the building and its honorees. But from within the Oval Office, he's devoted increasing energy to putting his mark on the few square miles around him — urged on by a new set of staffers that, rather than acting as gatekeepers, have encouraged him to act on asserting his influence on Washington.
    


            “He's got loyal people around him now,” said one Trump adviser. “And he realizes the power that he has and the things that he can do.”
    


            Trump's decision to declare a crime emergency and federalize DC's police force is a prime example. The president previously considered invoking the Home Rule Act of 1973 during the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd, but had been convinced not to do so, a source familiar with his decision said.
    


            Yet when Trump weighed the idea again in recent weeks, his closest advisers, like his deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, argued doing so was his prerogative. The president's announcement on Monday, during which he vowed to “restore the city back to the gleaming capital that everybody wants it to be,” was a result of a long-simmering belief that the federal government was required to step in and clean up DC.
    


            Two White House officials told CNN that much of that belief stems from Trump's dismay while traveling in his motorcade and seeing homeless tents and graffiti scattered through the city. A day before announcing the crackdown, Trump posted a series of photos of homeless encampments and roadside debris on Truth Social that appeared to be taken from his motorcade as it sped by.
    


            The attempted carjacking of administration staffer Edward Coristine earlier this month provided additional justification, with Trump posting a photo of the bloodied Coristine as evidence that crime had spiraled out of control.
    


            But the president — who friends note rose to prominence in New York City during its crime surge in the 1980s and ‘90s — had also complained about those issues long before he retook office.
    


            “We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, D.C. and clean it up, renovate it, rebuild our capital city, so there's no longer a nightmare of murder and crime,” then-candidate Trump said during a campaign rally in Atlanta in August 2024.
    


            The surge of federal agents in DC triggered immediate backlash, with Democrats decrying it as an unprecedented power grab meant to distract from challenges that the White House is facing elsewhere. There are early signs, too, that Trump's hardline actions across the country are already wearing thin with some voters; a Pew Research Center poll released Thursday showed sharp declines in his approval rating among younger Americans and minorities.
    


            But Trump and his aides have leaned into the controversy, betting that it will benefit them with a broad base of voters who prioritize public safety — and feel that crime is on the rise in cities like DC, even if it's not reflected in the data.
    


            “I could see where federalizing the police ends up permanent,” said one person close to the White House, noting Democrats' early struggles to coalesce behind an effective response. “There's plenty more than can be done.”
    


            The president said Wednesday he wants Congressional Republicans to work on a crime bill that could extend his federal takeover of DC beyond the 30 days the Home Rule Act allows him. (Such a measure would be unlikely to pass the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to advance.)
    


            Trump and his allies have made a similar effort to take over and remake DC's cultural and historical institutions, casting their focus on the Kennedy Center and Smithsonian museums as part of a broader project to rid them of liberal bias and “wokeness.”
    


            While Trump during his first term only occasionally dipped into the culture war issues that have long animated the broader MAGA base, he's since made them core to his agenda — convinced that he can capitalize politically by presenting himself as a “common sense” bulwark against progressives who he sees as having taken over key institutions.
    


            “I think he's intuited the importance of the culture war,” said Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation who has written extensively in favor of overhauling cultural institutions. “Washington is full of places that need to be rescued from the clutches of the left.”
    


            When announcing the Kennedy Center's 2025 honorees on Wednesday, Trump made clear that he controlled the selection process.
    


            “I would say I was about 98% involved. They all went through me,” Trump said of the picks, which included country music star George Strait; actors Michael Crawford and Sylvester Stallone; singer Gloria Gaynor; and the rock band KISS.
    


            He added that throughout the process, “I turned down plenty. They were too woke, I had a couple of wokesters. … The Kennedy Center has everything. Look at the Academy Awards, it gets lousy ratings now, it's all woke. All they do is talk about how much they hate Trump. but nobody likes that. They don't watch anymore.”
    


            He also announced that he would be hosting the awards ceremony in December, relishing his chance to once again command a televised event nearly a decade after his reality television show, “The Apprentice,” went off the air.
    


            It was the latest assertion of authority over a once-bipartisan institution that has since become a partisan flashpoint. In recent months, Republican lawmakers have proposed renaming the Kennedy Center after Trump, and its opera house after first lady Melania Trump.
    


            Trump is also eager to oversee a series of milestone events during his second term.
    


            “We're going to do something that's going to be incredible. We're going to use the Kennedy Center as a big focus of it, and that's the 250th anniversary celebration that we're having,” Trump said, nodding to America's birthday in 2026, an event that the Trump administration has already spent months planning to mark the occasion.
    


            He also pointed to the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics, which will be hosted in the United States in 2026 and 2028, respectively, both of which are major feathers in Trump's cap for his presidential legacy.
    


            Indeed, Trump has increasingly fixated on the landmark events as key opportunities to cement his legacy and show off the US to the rest of the world, according to people who have spoken to him.
    


            The president in private conversations has repeatedly marveled at his luck, musing that he wouldn't have presided over America's 250th anniversary if he'd won reelection 2020 — even as he insists, without evidence, that race was rigged against him. And he has emphasized the need for DC to be a welcoming place for tourists during the 2026 celebration, at times suggesting that the push to reduce crime and “beautify” the city is linked to the event.
    


            “The president's crazy about America 250 — he's really focused on this,” said the person close to the White House, characterizing Trump's view as of DC as “in disrepair, which makes it a bummer to visit. And if you're going to get mugged while you're there, why would you come?”
    


            The White House also invoked the anniversary event in its letter to the Smithsonian Institution secretary pushing for DC museums to ensure they “reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define the American story.”
    


            That internal review — led by a trio of top White House officials — will examine exhibits and materials at eight Smithsonian museums to determine what should and shouldn't be displayed.
    


            It comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year of accusing the museums of having “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” that has “promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.”
    


            Vice President JD Vance, a leader among the conservative movement to retake cultural institutions from the left, was put in charge of stopping government spending on “exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values.”
    


            “We want the museums to treat our country fairly,” Trump said Thursday, pushing back on accusations that the administration is rewriting history to suit its political narrative.
    


            Beyond the museums, Trump also hopes to transform the city's actual landscape. He said Wednesday he wanted to “redo the grass with the finest grasses,” a topic he knows well from owning golf courses.
    


            “We're going to also fix up a place called Washington, DC,” he said. “We're going to make it so beautiful again.”

The Kremlin bragged about U.S. fighter jets escorting Russian President Vladimir Putin's plane from Alaska on Aug. 16, following his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.

"American fighter jets escorted the Russian president's plane on its way from Alaska to Russia," the Kremlin wrote on Telegram, sharing a video filmed from the aircraft.The Aug. 15 summit marked Putin's first visit to the U.S. since 2015 and a break from the international isolation imposed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. During the visit, Putin received a red-carpet welcome, which top Russian officials later celebrated on social media. Putin looked visibly uplifted during the trip.

The fighter jets seen in the video are U.S. F-35 supersonic stealth aircraft — the country's most advanced multirole fighters — produced by defense and aerospace giant Lockheed Martin. The "AK" tail code on the jets indicates they are based at U.S. Air Force installations in Alaska.

The Trump-Putin meeting did not yield any agreement to bring an end to Russia's war in Ukraine closer. Instead, the main outcome was widely seen as Moscow's break from international isolation — a significant win for Putin both domestically and internationally.

Since launching the full-scale invasion, Putin has faced international isolation, limiting his travel to close allies and regional partners such as China, Iran, and North Korea, while avoiding Western capitals entirely. His options became even more restricted after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him in March 2023 over the kidnapping of thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied territories. The U.S. is not among the 125 countries that are party to the ICC and was not obliged to arrest Putin on its territory.

Russia's reintegration into global diplomacy began after Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025.  Within weeks, the two leaders held their first phone call, ending the communication freeze imposed during Joe Biden's presidency.Trump praised the Aug. 15 meeting with Putin as a 10 out of 10, despite not reaching any peace agreements. He said he and Putin agreed on many points and made some headway toward a deal, including on territorial swaps and security guarantees for Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said he will meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Aug. 18 to discuss ending Russia's war in Ukraine, following a call between the two leaders on Aug. 16.

The joint statement by several European leaders was published on Aug. 16, shortly after their phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The fighter jets seen in the video are U.S. F-35 supersonic stealth aircraft — the country's most advanced multirole fighters.

The summit restored a "full-fledged mechanism for meetings" between the two presidents, without "ultimatums and threats," Deputy Chairman of Russia's Security Council Dmitry Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel on Aug. 16. 

Zelensky said he supports Trump's proposal for a trilateral meeting between Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, noting that the three leaders can cover the “key issues.”

"I think we're pretty close to a deal," Trump told Fox News, adding: "Ukraine has to agree to it. Maybe they'll say no."

Trump handed the letter to Putin during their nearly three-hour meeting on Aug. 15, two White House officials told Reuters.

The number includes 1,010 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day, according to the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces.





"Putin got his red carpet treatment with Trump, Trump got nothing. ... For the Ukrainians: nothing. For Europe: deeply disappointing."

After speaking with Putin, Trump said he didn't think sanctions on Russia were a necessary measure — despite the lack of ceasefire. 

"There's no deal until there's a deal," Trump said during a press conference after his meeting with Putin.

The two leaders began their meeting at the U.S. military Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage at around 11:30 a.m. local time.  The event will mark their first face-to-face talks of Trump's second term and their first meeting in six years, as well as Putin's first visit to U.S. soil in a decade.



Rozhkova, who started working at the central bank in 2015, has frequently spoken out in favor of the bank's independence from the executive branch and was one of the few top officials not controlled by the President's Office.

It cares for those with rare or life-threatening diseases, and has faced mass firings and the gutting of research.

The number of people receiving treatment at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center — the renowned research hospital that cares for patients with rare or life-threatening diseases — has tumbled under the second Trump administration, according to government documents and interviews with current and former NIH employees.

NIH documents viewed by KFF Health News show a pronounced decline in patients at the 200-bed hospital from February through April, a time that coincides with the Department of Health and Human Services' mass firings of government employees, the gutting of scientific research, and the administration's broad crackdown on immigration. The average number of patients being treated daily during that time hovered between 60 and 80, with the April numbers falling to the lower end of that range. By contrast, in October, about 80 patients a day on average were at the hospital.

The number of cancer clinical trial participants at the hospital as of July was down about 20% from last year, one NIH cancer scientist said. KFF Health News agreed not to identify the scientist and others who participated in this article who were not authorized to speak to the press and feared retaliation.

The numbers “really don't look too good,” Pius Aiyelawo, acting CEO of the clinical center, said during a May 23 meeting of the NIH Clinical Center Research Hospital Board.

As of April 30, the average number of patients in the hospital per day had declined by 5.7% from the same period a year ago.

Adults and children with cancer, people who need bone marrow transplants, and people with rare diseases or infections are among the patients who receive care at no charge at the NIH hospital, according to former officials. Clinicians there provide potentially lifesaving treatments as part of clinical trials, often to people who have run out of options.

Research at the hospital has also led to breakthroughs about cancer, traumatic brain injury, and AIDS, among other ailments. James Gilman, a physician who was CEO of the clinical center from 2017 until retiring in January, said the center has driven important advances against disease “that couldn't have happened anywhere else.”

Former officials said the drop in patients this year is a consequence of the upheaval the Trump administration has caused at the NIH, the world's largest public funder of scientific research.

Current and former employees say an exodus of clinicians, scientists, and other staffers has limited how many patients can be treated. Morale has tanked because of widespread firings and the administration's cancellation of grants that funded research into health disparities, vaccines, the health of LGBTQ+ people, and more. Contracts have been cut, and scientists have seen delays in getting essential supplies for clinical research.

“Every day seems to be some type of breaking point,” one NIH worker said.

During the May board meeting, a video of which KFF Health News viewed, Aiyelawo attributed the decrease in patients coming to the hospital to the departure of NIH investigators — the researchers on studies — and less patient recruitment. He also noted 11 recent departures of clinical center staffers. They included Christine Grady, a nurse who led the center's bioethics department and the wife of Anthony Fauci, the former head of the NIH's infectious diseases institute who became a lightning rod for conservatives during the covid pandemic.

HHS has fired more than 1,200 NIH employees this year as part of its purge of the federal workforce, but the true number of departures is almost certainly higher. Others have opted for early retirement or quit because they opposed the Trump administration's orders.

Gilman said the NIH hospital relies on a “very complex ecosystem and network to find patients who are not too sick” to potentially be enrolled in a clinical trial. When researchers leave, “those patients are lost,” he said.

The clinical center's 2025 annual report said there were roughly 1,500 research studies underway in 2024, including studies focused on cancer, infectious disease, heart and lung conditions, and blood disorders. Clinical trials accounted for about half.

The National Cancer Institute — which is the largest of the NIH's 27 institutes and has been crippled by cuts and chaos this year — typically has the most patients needing inpatient care, Gilman said.

“What has happened here since January has been a pretty traumatic time for that ecosystem,” he said, “and there are pieces of it that will take a long time to rebuild, if indeed they get a chance to rebuild.”

During the May board meeting, Aiyelawo said NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya “is very aware” that fewer people are getting treated at the hospital “and we're doing everything we can to be able to get those numbers up.”

The drop in patients this year isn't isolated to people needing inpatient care, NIH documents show. As of the end of April, outpatient visits were down 8.5% from the same period in the prior fiscal year. The number of new patients overall had declined by 6.7%, to about 3,370 people.

In response to questions, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote in an emailed statement that the clinical center “remains fully operational and continues to provide world-class clinical research and patient care. Every day, patients from across the country and around the globe come here to participate in cutting-edge studies that drive scientific discovery and improve health outcomes.”

“As the crown jewel of research and discovery, the Clinical Center is a top priority” under Bhattacharya's leadership, Nixon said. “We are committed to fully leveraging its capabilities as the nation's hub for clinical research innovation. Our focus remains on empowering the research community and advancing the critical mission of making medical breakthroughs possible right here on the NIH campus.”

Even before President Donald Trump began his second term, the hospital had struggled with lagging patient numbers. Before the pandemic, it averaged more than 110 patients daily. Those numbers plummeted starting in 2020, government documents show. During the 2022 fiscal year,  there were about 73 patients, on average, in the hospital per day.

While yearly figures have increased since then, they have not gone back to pre-pandemic levels. NIH documents show that the hospital saw an average of roughly 81 patients a day during fiscal 2024, which ended in September. Still, one NIH worker said: “This is a manufactured crisis. Covid was not.”

The federal government has also moved to tighten rules surrounding visitors from abroad, which likely limits how many people living in the U.S. without legal status would come to the NIH for care.

Before Trump, officials developed a new visitor policy for the NIH that required people who aren't U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to register online before arriving. But its implementation was delayed, Gilman said. It did not launch until late January, after President Joe Biden was no longer in office and around the time the Trump administration began its deportation operation.

The Department of Homeland Security has carried out widespread raids and arrests and allowed immigration authorities unprecedented access to various federal data sources — including tax information and Medicaid recipients' personal data — as part of its immigration enforcement efforts.

The clinical center's most recent annual report said around 600 patients in 2024 were from abroad.

Now “international patients are terrified to come,” said one recently departed clinician. “They don't know what will happen to them.”

Global activists aim to halt the Gaza genocide by interrupting the flow of arms to Israel.

After two years of continuous effort in research, agitation and direct action, the organizers of the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) celebrated a landmark organizing victory in late June. Their “Mask Off Maersk” campaign had sought to prove the complicity of the Danish freight-logistics titan A.P. Møller – Maersk A/S in the genocide in Gaza. 

Maersk, as it's generally known, was found by PYM to be contributing to the ongoing crimes against humanity in Gaza by shipping arms transfers to the perpetrating Israeli military; these shipments included critical parts for the F-35 fighters that have been used to bomb Gaza's civilian population. Aligning with the broad strategy of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, PYM organized to make a material difference by interrupting Israel's still-unfolding campaign of ethnic cleansing, mass displacement and, incontrovertibly, genocide.

PYM's efforts ultimately applied sufficient pressure to Maersk to enact real, meaningful change: the company agreed to halt its work providing commercial shipping for enterprises that operate in illegal Israeli settlements.

With this strategy, pro-Palestine activists are seeking to exploit the strategic weak point that is the global logistics apparatus. As the Israeli military, having reduced its aerial bombing, continues to prosecute a genocide by other means — manipulating an aid system that is insufficient by design, creating distribution sites that are veritable death traps, and intentionally proliferating forced starvation and deprivation alongside active murder — the world's most powerful nations and corporations continue to show up for duty as Israel's reliable accomplices — and, of course, as eager profiteers. Some, though, are more susceptible to subversion than others. 

The ability of the U.S. to blithely ignore international law, in service of abetting the supreme human crime of genocide, has thrown into relief the impunity enjoyed by the Global North in perpetrating even the most grievous legal and ethical violations. Despite the many measures taken to enact embargoes or other types of meaningful sanctions, leading global institutions have still proven unable to impose meaningful restraint on Israel and its main benefactor and arms dealer, our decaying superpower. Where the most vaunted chambers of international law have fallen short, it has been left to Palestinians themselves, and the vast and horrified publics worldwide that stand with them, to do all in their power to halt the genocidal machine.

Point of Intervention

Anti-genocide activists are doing all they can to slow the ever-mounting death toll. PYM is a globally distributed network of (not exclusively) young activists, many Palestinian themselves; their efforts have earned them a considerable following and a leading role in the cause. PYM's sense of urgency matches the ethical stakes: Their tone and moral seriousness, mocked by genocide deniers, has been so absent on cable television and the organs of the mainstream consensus.

PYM organizer Aisha Nazar, a lead coordinator of the Mask Off Maersk project, characterized the group's initial line of questioning in an interview with Truthout: “Where is the crack in the armor of genocide? Where can we be the wedge that forces it open?” 

Their answer proved tactically savvy. It's much easier, after all, to sway a shipping company to wind down a controversial part of its business, a mere fraction — as a logistics business would have many other clients — than to somehow induce a full-fledged arms corporation to dissolve itself. And by targeting logistics lines rather than the original sites of arms producers, noted Nazar, “instead of going after one arms manufacturer, with this target, we are going after them all.”

“Instead of going after one arms manufacturer, with this target, we are going after them all.”

Initially, PYM organizers pursued research — detailed analyses of cargo manifests, bills of lading and other logistics minutiae were required to prove conclusively that the F-35 fighter jet parts that Maersk ships were indeed destined for Israeli military use. They found evidence that left Maersk's complicity beyond question. 

The company, researchers determined, was also contracted to transport goods from companies based in Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory — colonial intrusions deemed illegal by the UN and even, at times, the U.S. The UN's foremost human rights assembly, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), following Human Rights Council Resolution 31/36, maintains a database of commercial enterprises that are operating in these illegal settlements and are therefore complicit in infringements upon, per the UN, “the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of the Palestinian people.” Maersk, PYM researchers found, was contracting with settlement-based companies on the OHCHR list, some of which were also arms manufacturers.

The organizers released these findings publicly in a series of reports, compiling information that the company was not eager to publicize. PYM's attention then turned to running direct actions, which included protests, sit-ins, and facility shutdowns at Maersk offices in New York, Copenhagen, Rotterdam, and elsewhere over the first half of 2025. As Nazar described, PYM members showed up at Maersk and generally “flooded the streets, confronted our politicians, disrupted their events [and] mobilized to city council meetings to pressure our governments and elected officials to sanction Israel and cut off arms.”

Nazar pointed out that Maersk's globally distributed operation “allows us to employ a diverse set of tactics and demonstrates our movement's strength by consolidating internationally.” By identifying and pressing into service a wide array of potential allies, their protests were able to bring together everyone from “environmental groups, to the labor sector, to migrant justice advocates,” as well as members of Parliament, lawyers, and more. They also employed tactics that were gleaned from a range of struggles like “city divestment, campus boycott[s],” and organized labor.

Mask Off Maersk and its allies mobilized a pointed intervention in March 2025, when, via an online campaign, they successfully urged Maersk shareholders to bring forth a resolution about its complicity. The company dismissed their resolution, but the secrecy was broken; at the meeting, Nazar said, “Maersk was forced to admit [to its shareholders] that it does indeed ship military cargo to Israel.”

Those revelations led to legal challenges against Maersk from the Spanish government, a country that does have an embargo on Israel and has called for the rest of the European Union to follow suit. To avert inspection and investigation, the company elected to simply halt the use of the Spanish port of Algeciras by cargo ships en route to Israel. Then, in June, French dockworker unionists refused to work on Maersk's Israel-bound ships, forcing the company to further reroute arms shipments; a similar labor protest action took place in Morocco. 

Naturally, these inconvenient workarounds are costly for the company. PYM worked to ensure that the cost of Maersk's material support for genocide extended to their reputation, and their stock price. Clearly, Maersk corporate leaders must have rerun their cost/benefit analyses: in June, they acceded to a major demand, agreeing to halt commercial dealings with companies in Israeli settlements and promising that they would be “aligning [their] screening process with reference to UN standards.” 

Veteran investigative journalist and author of The Palestine Laboratory Antony Loewenstein told Truthout that PYM's approach was worth replicating, as they've located a vulnerable node in the global war materiel network.

“With every Western state refusing to impose any economic price on Israel for its endless genocide in Gaza,” Loewenstein remarked, “it's up to civil society to rise up.” He raised a historical example: “American dockworkers were central in the global fight against South African apartheid, and such people can again be a vital cog in stopping the shipment of weapons and defense equipment to Israel.”

Nazar has also noted that PYM's findings are “bolstering arms embargo laws and targeting the supply line to Zionism across Tunisia, Morocco, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain … A couple of volunteer researchers and youth organizers created diplomatic crises for one of the biggest shipping giants in the world; what this tells us is that an arms embargo is possible, and it is within our grasp.”

“With every Western state refusing to impose any economic price on Israel for its endless genocide in Gaza, it's up to civil society to rise up.”

PYM continues to center a “People's Arms Embargo” as a key demand, hoping to build upon the Maersk win to further thwart the lines of industry and logistics that fuel the military machine of genocide. They are not alone: Palestine Action, the British “direct action network,” conducts direct subterfuge against military equipment and arms contractors like Elbit Systems (acts for which the group is now under severe censure and suppression), while, as Truthout reported, groups like Jews For Racial & Economic Justice and Port Workers and Communities for Palestine have also sought ways to interrupt the operations of companies like Atlas Air, ZIM, All-Ways Forwarding and others involved, to various degrees, in the flow of arms. 

International Impotence

And yet why, we should ask, has it fallen to a small group of young activists to enforce the responsibilities of states under the 1948 Genocide Convention, not to mention numerous other strictures of international law? It's not as if nation-states haven't used legal and institutional means to register their dissent, even if that has not halted the unrestrained slaughter. In one notable example, South Africa has pursued a high-profile legal case charging Israel with genocide. And quite a few states, countries of the Global South in particular, have signaled substantial support for the patchwork of existing sanctions, embargoes, and arms limitations. Recently, at the Emergency Ministerial Conference on Palestine, convened by the Hague Group in Bogota, Colombia, in July, a dozen countries agreed to enforce arms transfer limitations. 

However, even the grander declarations of dissent have not always been matched by sustained material action aimed at slowing the unfolding of a genocide, and the rulings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) have so far more closely resembled symbolic gestures than legal enforcement. Such measures are not without worth — but hopes must be tempered. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already wanted for arrest by the International Criminal Court for egregious crimes against humanity, but it's not yet clear that he will ever face consequences of any sort, and several countries have also expressed their lack of interest in holding him accountable.

As Jake Romm wrote for The Baffler, the international human rights model as it stands is structurally limited by the primacy it affords to the treaty-making nation-state: “States are ultimately able to decide whether they conform to [international laws] and the treaties on which they are based. All international human rights law thus … carries more or less persuasive power (but not coercive power) depending on the political moment.”

But the loftier ambitions of liberal internationalism tend to quickly run up against contrary prerogatives of capital and power. In this contest, it is clear which party is most often the victor. Between 2013 and 2023, Israel received more than 65 percent of its weaponry from the U.S., approximately 30 percent from Germany, and almost all of the remaining 5 percent from Italy. The genocide could not continue without U.S. largesse. This state of affairs, of course, leaves arms-exporting countries in the position of greatest leverage — though there are certainly other avenues that Israel's powerful Western allies or other foreign critics could pursue. 

In one telling example, a Dutch appeals court ruled in a landmark decision that the Netherlands must stop exporting F-35 parts to Israel. Yet, unfortunately, it seems compliance has been won merely in letter and not spirit; the Dutch state is now shipping the parts to the U.S., which subsequently sends them straight to the Israeli military. A wider ban on other arms exports was also rejected by Dutch courts.

“Volunteer researchers and youth organizers created diplomatic crises for one of the biggest shipping giants in the world; what this tells us is that an arms embargo is possible, and it is within our grasp.”

The international armature of capitalist allies' mutually reinforcing power, epitomized by the United States and its unflinching defense of its client state, have proved immune to even some of the harshest judgments of the liberal international order. In turn, U.S. unaccountability and flouting of the law reveal the fundamental hollowness of that order: a framework of justice based largely on rhetoric, bereft of economic considerations. This framework also unduly constrains the legal right to armed resistance to national entities alone. Likewise, the moral space of international human rights is invariably warped and compromised by contradictions that owe their existence to the messy allowances necessary to legitimize state-perpetrated traditional war.

It should be noted that the U.S. is equally cavalier about flouting its own standards. For one, the Leahy Law — which prevents arms transfers to countries engaged in gross human rights violations — clearly applies in this case. (The eponymous former Sen. Patrick Leahy himself agrees.) So, too, does the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which states, “No assistance may be provided … to the government of any country which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights[.]” 

Germany, for its role, has also faced internal calls for embargo and divestment from civil servants and academics, as well as legal challenges. Though it has at times slowed the passage of arms through its export review process in the course of legal review, Germany has been cagey at best with international courts. (Among other challenges, the nation of Nicaragua has charged Germany with Geneva Convention violations in the ICJ.) After a massive uptick, German weapons shipments have sunk back down “amid growing legal and political pressure domestically and internationally,” per Politico. Germany also recently announced a more widespread embargo — but there are signs its staunchly pro-Israel stance may be unchanged; as  the BDS movement has charged, Germany has claimed to be imposing a comparable ban before, and may well continue to issue arms licenses via loopholes, contra public assurances.

The United States has done, basically, the complete opposite of anything like a ban, escalating massive continual deliveries — although the Biden administration would have liked you to think it was far more doubting and hesitant. Incredibly, former President Joe Biden and his diplomats pretended to be locked in debate with Netanyahu: a callow effort to manipulate the public's perception in order to show far more U.S. reluctance (and moral backbone, it seems) than they ever really had. It was finally admitted by Biden staffers — after Kamala Harris lost — that at no point did the White House harbor the slightest intention of staying Israel's hand. And naturally, the Trump administration has gleefully taken up that mantle, promising even more repugnant catastrophes extending to the wholesale ethnic cleansing and appropriation of Gaza.

To be clear, the many efforts of nations and organizations to impede the slaughter have been far from worthless; at minimum, they have measured the true degree of the world's revulsion. But — with international law having run up against the immovable obstacle of the United States, which throws its weight around like a swaggering mob boss — it is everyday people who have broadened the boundaries of possibility and turned the world against a moral atrocity. It is the work of international organizers, and, most of all, Palestinians themselves — as journalists, or with their phones or their words — that have refused to let the world look away from this world-historical crime.

As Aisha Nazar said determinedly, “We know the truth. An arms embargo will not happen until the tidal wave of people power forces it to happen. We must enforce an arms embargo ourselves.”

It is safe to say that, when future generations reminisce on these events, the Palestinian people, PYM, and all those who saw this for what it was — those who full-throatedly condemned an utter evil and sought to put their bodies upon the gears and wheels of this odious machine, as Mario Savio famously put it — will be seen as figures of exemplary moral courage. Those who have posed gleefully with its top perpetrator, meanwhile, seem destined to be cast by history in a very different light.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            Ancient, fossilized teeth, uncovered during a decades-long archaeology project in northeastern Ethiopia, indicate that two different kinds of hominins, or human ancestors, lived in the same place between 2.6 million and 2.8 million years ago — and one of them may be a previously unknown species.
    


            The discovery provides a new glimpse into the complex web of human evolution. Ten of the teeth, found between 2018 and 2020, belong to the genus Australopithecus, an ancient human relative. Meanwhile, three teeth, found in 2015, belong to the genus Homo, which includes modern humans, or Homo sapiens. The results were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.
    


            Such an overlapping of two hominins in the fossil record is rare, which had previously led scientists to believe that Homo appeared after Australopithecus, rather than the two being contemporaries.  Australopithecus species walked upright much like modern humans, but had relatively small brains, closer in size to those of apes. The emergence of Homo species, with their larger brains, is easy for people today to view as some sort of evolutionary upgrade on a path to modern humanity.
    


            But the coexistence of the two demonstrates that hominins developed, and lived, in multiple varieties at once. “This new research shows that the image many of us have in our minds of an ape to a Neanderthal to a modern human is not correct — evolution doesn't work like that,” said study coauthor Kaye Reed, research scientist and president's professor emerita at the Institute of Human Origins and emeritus professor at the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University, via email. “Here we have two hominin species that are together. And human evolution is not linear, it's a bushy tree, there are life forms that go extinct.”
    


How a 3.2-million-year-old human relative named Lucy walked



            Since 2002, Reed has been a codirector of the Ledi-Geraru Research Project, which is focused, in part, on searching for evidence of early Homo species. In 2015, the team announced the discovery of the oldest known Homo jawbone at 2.8 million years old. It has also searched for later evidence of Australopithecus afarensis, which first appeared 3.9 million years ago, but there is no sign of these ancient human relatives in the fossil record after 2.95 million years ago — suggesting they went extinct before Homo's first appearance.
    


            Australopithecus afarensis is best represented by the famed fossilized remains of Lucy, discovered in 1974 in Ethiopia. Lucy was shorter than an average human, reaching about 3.3 feet (1 meter) in height, had an apelike face and a brain about one-third the size of a human brain. Her fossil showcased a mixture of humanlike and apelike traits and provided proof that ancient human relatives walked upright 3.2 million years ago.
    


            When the team discovered the Australopithecus teeth during two separate digs in 2018 and 2020, it compared them with species such as afarensis and another hominin group known as garhi, but they didn't match up. Instead, the scientists believe the teeth belong to a previously unknown species of Australopithecus that walked the Earth after Lucy — and alongside an early Homo species.
    


            “Once we found Homo, I thought that was all we would find, and then one day on survey, we found the Australopithecus teeth,” Reed said. “What is most important, is that it shows again, that human evolution is not linear. There were species that went extinct; some were better adapted than others, and others interbred with us — we know this for Neanderthals for sure. So anytime that we have another piece to the puzzle of where we came from, it is important.”
    


            The teeth were found in Ethiopia's Afar region, a key place for researchers seeking answers about human evolution. A variety of preserved fossils have been found there as well as some of the earliest stone tools, Reed said.
    


            The Afar region is an active rifting environment — the tectonic plates beneath its earth are actively pulling apart and exposing older layers of sediment that shed light on almost 5 million years of evolution, Reed said.
    


            “The continent is quite literally unzipping there, which creates a lot of volcanism and tectonics,” said study coauthor Christopher Campisano, associate director and associate professor at the Institute of Human Origins and associate professor at the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State, in a video the school released. “At 2 1⁄2, 3 million years ago, these volcanoes spewed out ash that contain crystals called feldspars that allow us to date the eruptions that were happening on the landscape when they're deposited.”
    


Discovery of fossilized footprints reveals the moment two ancient human species crossed paths



            The Australopithecus teeth documented in the new study were dated to 2.63 million years ago, while the Homo teeth are from 2.59 million and 2.78 million years ago. But the team is cautious about identifying a species for any of the teeth until it has more data and more fossils.
    


            “We know what the teeth and mandible of the earliest Homo look like, but that's it,” said Brian Villmoare, lead study author and associate professor in the department of anthropology at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in a statement. “This emphasizes the critical importance of finding additional fossils to understand the differences between Australopithecus and Homo, and potentially how they were able to overlap in the fossil record at the same location.”
    


            The Australopithecus teeth broadly resembled those of the afarensis species in contour and the size of the molars, but features of the cusps and canine teeth had not been previously seen in afarensis or garhi teeth, Villmoare said. The teeth were also different in shape than those of any Homo species, or of the ancient human relative Paranthropus, known for its large teeth and chewing muscles.
    


            “Obviously these are only teeth,” Villmoare said, “but we are continuing field work in the hopes of recovering other parts of the anatomy that might increase resolution on the taxonomy.”
    


            Even just finding the teeth was a complicated task, according to Campisano.
    


            “You're looking at little teeth, quite literally, individual teeth that look just like a lot of other of the little pebbles spread on the landscape,” he said in the video. “And so, we have a great team of local Afars that are excellent fossil hunters. They've seen these things their entire lives walking around the landscape.”
    


            The new study is important because it provides insight into a time frame from 3 million to 2 million years ago, a mysterious period in human evolutionary studies, said Dr. Stephanie Melillo, paleoanthropologist and assistant professor at Mercyhurst University in Pennsylvania. Melillo was not involved in this research, but she has participated in the Woranso-Mille Paleontological Research Project in the Afar Triangle of Ethiopia.
    


            Part of the problem in learning about this stretch of prehistory is how ancient layers of dirt were deposited over the course of history in eastern Africa.
    


            “Erosion in rivers and lakes were at a low level and only a little bit of dirt was deposited in the Afar,” Melillo wrote in an email. “That deposited dirt contains the fossils — of our ancestors and all the animals that lived with us. When there is little deposition, there are few fossils.”
    


‘Dragon Man' DNA revelation puts a face to a mysterious group of ancient humans



            A key feature helping archaeologists to understand humanity's evolution are structural basins, or “bowls” on Earth's surface that naturally collect layers of sediment better than the surrounding landscape does — like the Turkana Basin stretching across southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya, Melillo said. Previous research has found evidence to suggest that Homo and Paranthropus coexisted there 1.5 million years ago.
    


            The new study focuses on the Afar Depression, a basin to the north of the Turkana.
    


            “This contribution by Villmoare and colleagues demonstrates that in the Afar there was also some other species around with Homo — but it isn't Paranthropus,” Melillo said. “Instead, they identify this ‘non-Homo' genus as Australopithecus. They do a very convincing job of demonstrating why the new fossils are not Paranthropus.”
    


            The study adds to growing evidence that Australopithecus was not roaming the Afar Depression alone, she said.
    


            When Australopithecus and Homo were alive, the Afar Region, now mostly a semidesert, had much more seasonal variation in rainfall than it does today, Reed said. Millions of years ago, the environment there was still dominated by a dry season, but it was interrupted by a brief wet season. Rivers that carried water across the landscape existed for only part of the year. Few trees grew near the river, and the environment nearby was largely wetlands and grasslands.
    


            “We have a fossil giraffe species that was eating grass, which probably indicates they were stressed as they eat trees and bushes almost every place else,” Reed said. “Were the hominins eating the same thing? We are trying to find out by examining isotopes in their teeth and microscopic scratches on their teeth.”
    


Stone tool discovery could offer new clue in mystery of ancient ‘hobbit' humans



            Understanding whether or not Homo and Australopithecus had the same food sources could paint a portrait of how our ancient ancestors shared or competed for resources, Reed said. The team also wants to try to identify which hominin made the stone tools found at the site.
    


            At the moment it's impossible to tell exactly how the two hominins coexisted, but Reed said she is hoping that future findings will provide more answers.
    


            “Whenever you have an exciting discovery, if you're a paleontologist, you always know that you need more information,” Reed said. “You need more fossils. More fossils will help us tell the story of what happened to our ancestors a long time ago — but because we're the survivors we know that it happened to us.”

WASHINGTON, August 16. /TASS/. Talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Alaska became an "excellent first step" in improving relations between Moscow and Washington and settling the Ukraine crisis with the easing of tensions being apparent, Peter Kuznick, director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University, told a TASS correspondent, commenting on the summit's results.

"Not only did the meeting not fail outright, as some hoped it would — especially most European leaders, US media, many Congressional representatives, and certain Ukrainian leaders — but both presidents indicated that they made progress and agreed on more than they disagreed on. They also indicated that they would meet again soon, which is positive," the political scientist said.

"I would say that, on balance, this is an excellent first step and I hope they follow up sooner rather than later with another meeting that leads to them hammering out a productive framework for ending the Ukraine War and going beyond that to ease global tensions and walk us back from the terrifying precipice of WWIII," Kuznick emphasized.

He stated that "it's great that the tensions that were so palpable during the Biden presidency have begun to ease and we're at least talking again. The Russia-Ukraine war is a disaster for everyone involved and the sooner it ends, the better for everyone. Getting the US and Russia, the world's two nuclear-armed behemoths, sitting down together and talking instead of making threats, is an enormous step in the right direction."

Additionally, Kuznick reiterated that the Alaska summit was attended by "businessmen and economic advisors," indicating that the sides are discussing "sanctions relief and joint economic development projects, including Arctic development and perhaps a Bering Strait tunnel connecting the two countries."

"I also thought it extremely encouraging that there seemed to be interest on both parts to work toward a new nuclear arms control treaty, especially with the New START treaty expiring in February," the expert concluded.

On August 15, a summit between Russia and the US took place at a military base in Alaska. The talks lasted more than three hours and included several formats: one-on-one in the American leader's limousine en route to the main venue and in a small group of "three on three." The Russian delegation included Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the US delegation included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.

Following the talks, Putin told the press that the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict was the main topic of the summit. The Russian leader also called for a new beginning in bilateral relations and a return to cooperation. He invited Trump to Moscow. For his part, the US president announced the progress achieved in the talks but noted that the two sides had not reached an agreement on everything.

The Emperor reiterated his strong desire to pass down memories of World War II in his address at the annual memorial ceremony for the war dead held in Tokyo on Friday.

“It is my sincere hope that we shall continue to pass down the memories of the sufferings endured during and after the war, and in unity of spirit, to seek peace and the happiness of the people in the future,” the Emperor said in his 90-second address.

Since his days as crown prince, the Emperor, who was born in the postwar era, has underscored the importance of conveying memories of the ravages of war to future generations.

During a press conference in February, he stated, “I have taken to heart the suffering of many people,” adding that “it is important to pass on the tragic experiences and history to the generations who do not know war.”

The Emperor and Empress have attended memorial services for the war dead in Japan and abroad this year.

In April, they visited the island battlefield of Iwoto, also known as Iwojima, in Ogasawara, which is administratively part of Tokyo.

In June, they visited Okinawa Prefecture with their daughter, Princess Aiko, and renewed their wishes for peace. They also visited Hiroshima, which was devastated by an atomic bomb.

In July, during a goodwill visit to Mongolia, they offered flowers and a moment of silent prayer at a monument for Japanese who died in internment camps.

During their visits, the Emperor particularly valued meeting with atomic bomb survivors and other people who had experienced the war, as well as young people who serve as “storytellers” passing on war survivors' memories of the war.

“This year's address captured the feelings the Emperor had during his visits,” said a senior official from the Imperial Household Agency who accompanied the Imperial couple on the series of visits.

The addresses at a memorial service have a history of being carefully crafted by Emperor Showa and the Emperor Emeritus after the war, each word imbued with their wishes for peace.

“The Emperor followed the framework of the addresses, inheriting the sentiments of Emperor Showa and the Emperor Emeritus to express sympathy for postwar hardships of the war-bereaved families and Japanese citizens by using the new expression, ‘the sufferings endured during and after the war,'” said Hideya Kawanishi, an associate professor at Nagoya University and an expert on the symbolic emperor system. “It shows the Emperor's thoughts on peace as an emperor born in the postwar era.”

The Emperor Emeritus and Empress Emerita observed a moment of silence while watching the national memorial ceremony for the war dead on television at their residence in Moto-Akasaka, Tokyo, on Friday.

Princess Aiko, the daughter of the Emperor and Empress, offered a silent prayer at the Imperial Palace, her residence.

BUENOS AIRES, August 16. /TASS/. The Alaska meeting between President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Donald Trump of the United States marks the failure of the European Union's attempts to secure international pressure on Moscow, Esteban Actis, professor at Argentina's National University of Rosario, said.

"No one will now be able to ask the leaders of the Global South questions because of their bilateral meetings with Putin. That said, it's a major defeat for Brussels and Europe, who sought to continue pressuring the international community to isolate Moscow. Another serious blow by Washington," he wrote on the X social platform.

According to the expert, the meeting means victory for Russia. "Apart from talks on ending the war, the Anchorage summit and the personal meeting between Putin and Trump highlight the political reconstruction of relations between Moscow and Washington. This is an important result achieved by Putin and the Russian delegation," the expert added.

The meeting between President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Donald Trump of the United States took place at a military base in Alaska on August 15. The meeting lasted over three hours, with the two leaders first holding a one-on-one conversation in a car on their way to the venue of the talks. Their closed-door negotiations also involved Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov, as well as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.

Putin told the media after the talks that the parties had focused on resolving the Ukraine conflict. The Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and going back to cooperation. Putin invited Trump to visit Moscow. The US leader, in turn, pointed to progress in the negotiation process but noted that the parties had not been able to agree on all issues.

On his way to Alaska to meet Vladimir Putin, president Trump told Fox News's Brett Baier that he wouldn't be happy if he left the summit without a ceasefire in Ukraine. “Now, I say this, and I have said it from the beginning: This is really setting the table today,” Trump said. “We're going to have another meeting, if things work out, which will be very soon, or we're not going to have any more meetings at all, maybe ever.” In short, Trump was well aware that anything could have happened in Alaska on Friday.

In the event, after nearly three hours of talks, Trump and Putin stepped up to their lecterns touting unspecified progress and calling their discussions very productive. Putin, in his typical monotone, referred to the meeting with the US president as “long overdue”, cast blame on the Biden administration for allowing US-Russia relations to deteriorate, and credited Trump for at least being willing to meet face-to-face. Putin laid it on thick, going so far as to confirm Trump's repeated assertions that the war in Ukraine would never have happened if he had still been holding court in the White House in February 2022.

Trump, a man who likes to hear himself talk, was noticeably subdued at the press conference and said very little. He consistently claimed progress on the major topics of discussion without telling us what those topics were. Ever the gracious host (unless your name is Volodymyr Zelensky), Trump returned Putin's flattery; the Russian leader, he commented, wanted peace in Ukraine as much as he did. Of course, there's very little evidence supporting that statement.

When all was said and done, there was no peace deal in Ukraine. Nothing on the conflict was settled. The immediate ceasefire that Trump, Zelensky and the Europeans hoped to squeeze out of the Russian strongman was nowhere to be found. On the big items, the summit failed.

But none of this should have been a surprise. Anybody who has been monitoring the three-and-a-half year war will tell you that neither Putin nor Zelensky is prepared to cede their maximum negotiating positions. The differences between Moscow and Kyiv remain unbridgeable at this point in time, so much so that many foreign policy analysts in the West were wondering why Trump even bothered to fly to Alaska in the first place.

Zelensky wants a ceasefire before real negotiations begin; Putin wants to fight and talk simultaneously. Zelensky doesn't want to cede any Ukrainian territory that Russia doesn't already occupy, and he most certainly won't recognise Russia's territorial gains; Putin wants Ukrainian forces to lay down their arms, withdraw and gift the entire Donbas region, as well as Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, to him on a silver platter. Zelensky wants Western security guarantees; Putin doesn't want any Western involvement in Ukraine's future defence at all. The divergences go on and on, and a single high-level meeting, particularly one to which Zelensky wasn't invited, was never going to resolve them.

As we await the readouts from the White House and anticipate what agreements, if any, were actually reached, Trump will be returning to Washington with mixed feelings. On the one hand, he can talk solace in the fact that his talks with Putin didn't break down, like the top-level diplomacy he instigated with North Korea's Kim Jong-un more than six years before. He may even be able to call this entire endeavour a win if further talks are scheduled in the future.

Meanwhile, the nervous nellies in Europe will be relieved that Trump didn't negotiate swaths of Ukraine away to the Russians, a concern that nagged Sir Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz to such an extent that an emergency summit with Trump was put in the calendar last Wednesday to talk him out of any moves he may have up his sleeve.

Trump, however, is probably also a bit peeved by the outcome. Although the Trump administration tried to set the bar low, the president himself also outlined his expectations for the summit: a ceasefire and, if all goes well, another meeting, this time with Zelensky in the room. Instead, he's leaving Alaska without the first item on his list and the second still up in the air. The fighting will go on as fiercely tomorrow as it did today.

The bottom line here is simple: Trump may aggrandise and boast about his remarkable dealmaking abilities, but on the war in Ukraine, he isn't the most important protagonist in the story. Trump can push, pressure, cajole and sweet-talk, but it's Zelensky and Putin who will determine when the killing stops. As the US intelligence community wrote in a threat assessment earlier this year, “both leaders for now probably still see the risks of a longer war as less than those of an unsatisfying settlement.”

Plenty has changed in the months since those words were published. But Trump's big attempt at peacemaking notwithstanding, that conclusion still holds true.

US president claims ‘great progress' with Russian leader although meeting in Alaska does not yield agreement to pause war. What we know on day 1,270

See all our Ukraine war coverage

Donald Trump has put the onus on Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to reach a ceasefire with Russia after the US leader held direct talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska on Friday. Trump said Zelenskyy and Putin were going to set up a meeting to try to reach a ceasefire to end the war in Ukraine. “Now, it's really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done,” Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity after his meeting with Putin. “And I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit. But it's up to President Zelenskyy … And if they'd like, I'll be at that next meeting.”

Trump said the direct talks with Putin on Friday did not yield an agreement to pause the war in Ukraine, though he claimed “great progress” during the nearly three-hour-long summit. “I believe we had a very productive meeting,” the US president said at a joint press conference with Putin after the talks. “There were many, many points that we agreed on.”

Putin, speaking through an interpreter, suggested the two leaders had hammered out “an understanding”. He said he expected Ukraine and its European allies to accept the results of the US-Russia negotiation constructively and not try to “disrupt the emerging progress”. The Russian leader agreed that Ukraine's security must be guaranteed – but also said that the “root causes” of the conflict must be resolved.

Zelenskyy said Russia was continuing to attack Ukraine ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, but claimed its attempt to “show strength” with a new assault in the east had failed. “On the day of the negotiations, they also kill people. And that says a lot,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram on Friday. “The war continues. It continues precisely because there is no order, nor any indication that Moscow is preparing to end this war.”

Ukraine said it had conducted a long-range drone attack on a supply ship that it claims was carrying drone components from Iran, hours before the Trump-Putin summit. Photographs showed a partially sunken cargo vessel at Olya, near Astrakhan, north of the Caspian Sea. Ukraine's military claimed credit for the attack and the overnight bombing of an oil refinery at Samara on the Volga River, deep inside Russia. Ukraine's general staff said the ship was “loaded with components” for Shahed-type drones “and ammunition from Iran”.

Russia launched a ballistic missile into Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region hours before the Trump-Putin summit, killing one person and wounding at least one other, and causing a fire. “A truck and a minibus were damaged in a hostile attack on the Dnipro district. A man was killed. Another person was injured,” the regional governor, Serhiy Lysak, said on Telegram. The city of Dnipro is a logistics hub for Ukrainian forces.

The Ukrainian military says it has retaken six villages in the east that Russia captured in a push this week. On Tuesday, Russia made a swift advance to the town of Dobropillia, piercing through Ukraine's defences. “The advance of the enemy was stopped by the forces of the 1st Corps of the National Guard of Ukraine (NGU) ‘Azov', together with adjacent and subordinate units, over the past three days,” Ukraine's general staff said. The town is now under constant Russian drone and shell fire.

Ukrainian military intelligence claimed that Russia is preparing to test its new nuclear-capable, nuclear-powered cruise missile and, if successful, plans to use the results to bolster its negotiating position with the west. Military intelligence spokesperson Andriy Yusov told Reuters that Moscow saw the test as diplomatic leverage. “Russia is preparing for another round of tests of the 9M730 Burevestnik,” his statement said. “The purpose of these tests is to validate scientific and technical solutions implemented by the missile. If successful, Russia will leverage the test results to defend its interests in negotiations.”

In Alaska, President Vladimir Putin walked on a red carpet, shook hands and exchanged smiles with his American counterpart. Donald Trump ended the summit praising their relationship and calling Russia “a big power ... No. 2 in the world,” albeit admitting they didn't reach a deal on ending the war in Ukraine.

By Saturday morning Moscow time, Trump appeared to have abandoned the idea of a ceasefire as a step toward peace — something he and Ukraine had pushed for months -– in favor of pursuing a full-fledged “Peace Agreement” to end the war, echoing a long-held Kremlin position. The “severe consequences” he threatened against Moscow for continuing hostilities were nowhere in sight. On Ukraine's battlefields, Russian troops slowly grinded on, with time on their side.

The hastily arranged Alaska summit “produced nothing for Mr. Trump and gave Mr. Putin most of what he was looking for,” said Laurie Bristow, a former British ambassador to Russia.




Putin's visit to Alaska was his first to the United States in 10 years and his first to a Western country since invading Ukraine in 2022 and plunging U.S.-Russia relations to the lowest point since the Cold War. Crippling sanctions followed, along with efforts to shun Russia on the global stage.

The International Criminal Court in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin on accusations of war crimes, casting a shadow on his foreign trips and contacts with other world leaders.

Trump's return to the White House appeared to upend all that. He warmly greeted Putin, even clapping for him, on a red carpet as U.S. warplanes flew overhead as the world watched.

The overflight was both “a show of power” and a gesture of welcome from the U.S. president to the Kremlin leader, “shown off to a friend,” said retired Col. Peer de Jong, a former aide to two French presidents and author of ”Putin, Lord of War.”

Russian officials and media revelled in the images of the pomp-filled reception Putin received in Alaska, which pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda described as signalling “utmost respect.” It called the meeting a “huge diplomatic victory” for Putin, whose forces will have time to make more territorial gains.

The reception contrasted starkly with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's March visit to the Oval Office, where Trump treated him like a “representative of a rogue state,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a member of the German parliament.

Putin has “broken out of international isolation,” returning to the world stage as one of two global leaders and “wasn't in the least challenged” by Trump, who ignored the arrest warrant for Putin from the ICC, Bristow told The Associated Press.

Putin “came to the Alaska summit with the principal goal of stalling any pressure on Russia to end the war,” said Neil Melvin, director of international security at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. “He will consider the summit outcome as mission accomplished.”

In recent months, Trump has pressed for a ceasefire, something Ukraine and its allies supported and insisted was a prerequisite for any peace talks. The Kremlin has pushed back, however, arguing it's not interested in a temporary truce -– only in a long-term peace agreement. 

Moscow's official demands for peace so far have remained nonstarter for Kyiv: It wants Ukraine to cede four regions that Russia only partially occupies, along with the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014. Ukraine also must renounce its bid to join NATO and shrink its military, the Kremlin says. 

After Alaska, Trump appeared to echo the Kremlin's position on a ceasefire, posting on social media that after he spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, “it was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.”

In a statement after the Trump call, the European leaders did not address whether a peace deal was preferable to a ceasefire. 

The summit took place a week after a deadline Trump gave the Kremlin to stop the war or face additional sanctions on its exports of oil in the form of secondary tariffs on countries buying it. 

Trump already imposed those tariffs on India, and if applied to others, Russian revenues “would probably be impacted very badly and very quickly,” said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy.

In the days before Alaska, Trump also threatened unspecified “very severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to stop the war. But whether those consequences will materialize remains unclear. Asked about that in a post-summit interview with Fox News Channel, Trump said he doesn't need “to think about that right now,” and suggested he might revisit the idea in “two weeks or three weeks or something.” 

In a statement after the summit, Putin claimed the two leaders had hammered out an “understanding” on Ukraine and warned Europe not to “torpedo the nascent progress.” But Trump said “there's no deal until there's a deal.”

In his Fox interview, Trump insisted the onus going forward might be on Zelenskyy “to get it done,” but said there would also be some involvement from European nations.

Zelenskyy will meet Trump at the White House on Monday. Both raised the possibility of a trilateral summit with Putin, but Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said it wasn't discussed in Alaska. The Kremlin has long maintained that Putin would only meet Zelenskyy in the final stages of peace talks.

“Trump now appears to be shifting responsibility towards Kyiv and Europe, while still keeping a role for himself,” Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center wrote on X.

Fiona Hill, a senior adviser on Russia to Trump during his first administration, told AP that he has met his match because “Putin is a much bigger bully.” 

Trump wants to be the negotiator of “a big real estate deal between Russia and Ukraine,” she said, but in his mind he can “apply real pressure” only to one side — Kyiv.

Hill said she expects Trump to tell Zelenskyy that “you're really going to have to make a deal” with Putin because Trump wants the conflict off his plate and is not prepared to put pressure on the Russian president.

Far from the summit venue and its backdrop saying “Pursuing Peace,” Russia continued to bombard Ukraine and make incremental advances on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front.

Russia fired a ballistic missile and 85 drones overnight. Ukraine shot down or intercepted 61 drones, its air force said. Front-line areas of Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk and Chernihiv were attacked.

Russia's Defense Ministry said it had taken control of the village of Kolodyazi in the Donetsk region, along with Vorone in the Dnipropetrovsk region. Ukraine did not comment on the claims. Russian forces are closing in on the strongholds of Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka in the Donetsk region, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2022 but still only partially controls.

“Unless Mr. Putin is absolutely convinced that he cannot win militarily, the fighting is not going to stop,” said Bristow, the former ambassador. “That's the big takeaway from the Anchorage summit.”

Live Updates


• Peace deal over ceasefire: US President Donald Trump said focusing immediately on a lasting peace deal is the best way to end the war in Ukraine, rather than starting with a ceasefire. It's a reversal of his own position and one that may align more with the view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met with Trump in Alaska yesterday.
    


• Zelensky to meet Trump: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he will now meet with the US president in Washington, DC, on Monday.
    


• More on yesterday's summit: Putin called the Alaska meeting “timely and very useful” in new comments today. According to sources, Trump told European officials after the summit that Putin wants all of the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region in exchange for freezing the current front lines.
    


• Security guarantees: Trump also discussed the possibility of NATO-esque security guarantees for Ukraine with European leaders, an official said. The Kremlin is likely to strongly oppose such guarantees.
    


            US President Donald Trump told European leaders he wants to arrange a trilateral summit between himself, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin by next Friday, and that he would get to work arranging the meeting if Monday's Oval Office talks with Zelensky go well.
    


            European officials expect at least one other leader from Europe will join those talks on Monday, but it wasn't yet clear who.
    


            US Vice President JD Vance will attend Monday's meeting between President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, a source familiar with the plans told CNN.
    


            The last time Zelensky was in the Oval Office in February, Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of a lack of gratitude, asking him, “Have you said thank you once?”
    


However, in May, Vance met Zelensky with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Italy. While reporters weren't invited to the meeting, afterward, Vance posted a photo of him and Zelensky smiling.
    


            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that US President Donald Trump is “creating the opportunity to end Russia's illegal war in Ukraine.”
    


            “Robust and credible security guarantees are essential to any just and lasting peace,” Carney said in a statement. “I welcome the openness of the United States to providing security guarantees as part of Coalition of the Willing's efforts.”
    


            During a call with European leaders after yesterday's Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump highlighted an Italian idea for a NATO-style security guarantee for Ukraine as part of a peace deal, according to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Reuters reports.
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin spelled out his demands for “land swaps” with Ukraine during his nearly three-hour summit with US President Donald Trump yesterday, including his insistence Ukraine gives up the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, according to European officials familiar with Trump's accounting of the meeting to his counterparts afterward.
    


            Putin said in exchange, he would be willing to freeze the current front lines in the rest of Ukraine — in the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — and agree to a promise not to attack Ukraine or other European nations again.
    


            But he didn't back away from a demand to eliminate what Russia calls the “root causes” of the war in Ukraine — code for reducing the size of Kyiv's military, abandoning its aspirations to join NATO and becoming a neutral state.
    


            The details of Putin's conditions emerged when Trump briefed European leaders on the talks as he was arriving back in Washington early this morning. Trump said he believed a deal could be reached quickly if Putin's conditions were met, and that he would discuss the matter with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Monday, the officials said.
    


            European leaders also said Trump voiced openness to providing US security guarantees for Ukraine once the war ends, though the specifics of what he's willing to provide remained unclear.
    


            Taken together, Trump's recounting of the meeting provided little optimism among European officials, though leaders' public responses to the summit were calibrated to avoid contradicting Trump.
    


            The White House didn't respond to requests for comment about the details of Trump's summit with Putin, and Trump said in an interview that he preferred to keep the specifics of the meeting private.
    


            Let's take a look ahead to next week, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC.
    


            CNN's Nick Paton Walsh breaks down some of the key issues the two leaders may discuss:
    


            There is currently “no motivation” for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his war in Ukraine now that his US counterpart Donald Trump has said he will hold off on imposing secondary sanctions on those who buy Russian oil, a prominent critic of the Russian leader told CNN.
    


            The United States and the European Union “have the power to make life really uncomfortable for Vladimir Putin” to get him to end the war, Bill Browder, a former top investor in Russia, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield.
    


            “We can make it uncomfortable for him militarily by providing more military aid to Ukraine,” he suggested. “Or we can make life very uncomfortable for him economically” by imposing secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil or confiscating frozen assets, Browder added.
    


                    “What I find so upsetting about the last 24 hours is, at least from the US perspective, there doesn't seem to be any plan to do that. And so why would Vladimir Putin do anything other than carry on with what he's said to be his maximal objectives?” he continued.
                





            The Russian leader's meeting with Trump was a “huge victory for Putin,” Browder said.
    


            “He's got exactly what he wants. He can carry on with his war, and there are to be no devastating sanctions, which means that there is no incentive for him to come to any kind of reasonable solution on this war,” he said.
    


            Russian state TV gave largely positive coverage of the summit between President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Alaska, celebrating the handshake between the two leaders and Putin's ride in the US presidential limousine.
    


            Kremlin officials have said the meeting is proof that Moscow is not as isolated on the world stage as Western leaders have argued.

            Just hours after getting back to the White House after his high-stakes meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, US President Donald Trump arrived at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, this morning at 11:52 a.m. ET.
    


            US President Donald Trump remains “bafflingly unwilling” to apply maximum economic pressure on Russia, despite such measures being his best bet to exert influence over the Kremlin, a finance and security expert said Saturday.
    


            Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute, said the “economic dimension” of yesterday's Trump-Putin summit is “probably where Trump had the most to offer.”
    


            Ahead of the meeting, Trump deployed a range of contradictory economic signals, Keatinge said, mixing “carrots” like investment deals and sanctions relief with “sticks,” such as heavier sanctions and more tariffs on Russia's oil trading partners.
    


            Despite these efforts, the status quo remains, with post-summit remarks offering no insight into whether Trump threatened further economic pressure during the Alaska meeting, Keatinge said in a statement.
    


            “All eyes will now turn back to the impending imposition of 25% tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil,” he said of the additional tariffs that Trump announced earlier this month as punishment for India's importing of Russian oil and gas.
    


                    “In short, with Russia's economy on the ropes, Trump remains bafflingly unwilling to apply the maximum economic pressure on Russia that would mean summits like those held yesterday are more likely to yield the success Donald Trump craves,” Keatinge added.
                





            The leaders of the Nordic-Baltic Eight issued a joint statement reaffirming their support for Ukraine, saying that “no decisions on Ukraine without Ukraine, and no decisions on Europe without Europe” should be made.
    


            “To achieve a just and lasting peace the next step must be together with Ukraine. Only Ukraine can make decisions concerning its future,” the statement said.
    


            The eight countries include Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden.
    


                    “Experience has shown that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin cannot be trusted,” it added. “Ultimately it is Russia's responsibility to end its blatant violations of international law. Russia's aggression and imperialist ambitions are the root causes of this war.”
                





            The statement welcomed news of President Donald Trump's discussions with European officials for Ukrainian security guarantees, saying that “no limitations should be placed on Ukraine's armed forces or on its cooperation with other countries” and that “Russia has no veto over Ukraine's pathway to the EU and NATO.”
    


            The leaders pledged to continue arming Ukraine and enhancing Europe's defenses, while warning they will keep strengthening sanctions and economic measures “as long as Russia continues its killing.”
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin said his meeting with US President Donald Trump in Alaska was “timely and very useful,” marking his first comments since appearing alongside Trump after Friday's summit.
    


                    “I would like to note right away that the visit was timely and very useful. We discussed practically all areas of our cooperation, but first and foremost, of course, we talked about a possible resolution of the Ukrainian crisis on a fair basis,” Putin said Saturday, according to the Kremlin.
                





            The Russian leader — noting that direct negotiations of this kind had not happened at this level “for a long time” — said Russia respected the position of the Trump administration with regard to the war in Ukraine.
    


                    “We naturally respect the position of the US administration, which sees the need for an immediate end to hostilities, and we would also like to see this happen. We would like to move towards resolving all issues by peaceful means,” Putin said. 
                





            “The conversation was very frank and substantive, and in my view, it brings us closer to the necessary decisions,” he added.
    


This post has been updated with additional comments from Putin.



            US President Donald Trump attempted to express friendly dominance with most of his body language seen yesterday at his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to behavioral analyst and body-language expert Chris Ulrich.
    


            He told CNN's Michael Smerconish this morning that the initial handshake moment between the two leaders was “a moment of opportunity for them to connect.”
    


                    “As they build rapport, they're smiling at each other. They're making eye contact as they're looking at each other. This is a moment of rapport-building and parity,” Ulrich said. “And even in those moments, keep in mind … the handshake is a negotiation, an ongoing signal for power. Here, Trump shows deference, followed by pulling the hand in and using these touch gestures to reestablish dominance as they walk down.”
                





            After Trump and Putin shook hands for about 10 seconds, they could be seen walking down the tarmac. By Trump walking down the middle, Ulrich says he was “showing he's in control, he's in command.”
    


            “There's Trump in the middle kind of holding court. He's talking to the president. He's talking to the adviser and him being in the middle. It's cordial. It's kind. They're open. They're not in each other's faces,” Ulrich said.
    


            Then, after the two had their closed-door discussion, Trump and Putin held a news briefing where they did not take questions.
    


            Standing behind the podium, Ulrich said their body language looked “very cordial.”
    


            “It's a calm moment between the two. It's a much different energy in the room,” he said.
    


See the moment the two leaders met below:



            As we reported earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will fly to Washington, DC, for a meeting with US President Donald Trump tomorrow.
    


            Inna Sovsun, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, pointed out in an interview with CNN's Polo Sandoval that Trump's reception of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska yesterday appeared to be in sharp contrast to his frosty Oval Office exchange with Zelensky earlier this year, when Trump castigated him for not demonstrating enough gratitude for American support.
    


            She also said Trump's “potential partnership” with Putin is a “very scary prospect for all of us.”
    


            “The whole mood of yesterday's summit has been juxtaposition against the meeting of Trump and President Zelensky in the Oval Office, right. The mood and the vibe of that meeting was very different,” she added.
    


Watch the videos below to compare Trump's interactions with the two world leaders: 



            A future security guarantee will be a “tough thing” to achieve with regard to the war in Ukraine even in the event of a ceasefire and negotiated peace deal, according to Mark Brzezinski, a former US ambassador to Poland.
    


                    “This has been such a bloody war that even if a ceasefire is put in place and a peace plan is negotiated, the sense that there must be retribution on both sides — Ukrainians for having been killed, Russians for having been killed — will continue,” Brzezinski told CNN's Michael Smerconish.
                





            Brzezinski said the number of people killed in the conflict so far means “payback will be on the minds of the Russians and Ukrainians for a while and so a security guarantee, in terms of how to see it through, will be a tough thing to do.”
    


            European leaders called for strong security guarantees for Ukraine on Saturday following US President Donald Trump's high-profile summit with Russia's Volodymyr Zelensky in Alaska.
    


For context: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the “openness” of the United States to provide security guarantees to Ukraine as part of any future peace deal. See here for our earlier reporting on their statements and here for our explainer on an Italian proposal for security guarantees for Ukraine “inspired by NATO's Article 5.”
    


            Russian President Vladimir Putin's final words at the Alaska summit were delivered with a smile, spoken in an unusual burst of English.
    


            “And next time in Moscow,” Putin said — no translation needed — in response to US President Donald Trump suggesting they would see each other again soon.
    


            He has a good command of the English language, according to the Kremlin itself.
    


            Back in 2017, the Kremlin said that Putin understands English “almost completely” and even corrects his interpreters, according to Russia's Izvestia newspaper.
    


            When he is “on the go,” Putin “most often speaks English, but when negotiations are conducted and when an official meeting is taking place, of course, he communicates through interpreters,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, the paper reported at the time.
    


            Using interpreters at high-level meetings allows leaders room for maneuver.
    


            For example, ahead of the talks with Trump, Putin seemingly did not understand or hear the uncomfortable questions shouted in English by the press about the war, none of which he addressed, making confused expressions instead.
    


            Asked whether he would “stop killing civilians,” Putin appeared to gesture that he couldn't hear the question.
    


            There are quite a few examples of the Russian leader showcasing his language skills outside of negotiation rooms. Read more here.



            Security guarantees for Kyiv — not disputes over land swaps and the future borders of Ukraine — represent the biggest obstacle to Russia agreeing to a peace deal, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Adm. James Stavridis said Saturday.
    


            In calls with European counterparts following his summit Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential for NATO-esque security guarantees as part of a prospective Russia-Ukraine peace deal.
    


            Stavridis said that will be a hard sell for the Kremlin, as Trump shifts his focus from achieving an initial ceasefire to pursuing a more sweeping peace agreement.
    


                    “Putin is going to fight with everything he's got to avoid a scenario in which Ukraine is actually free and democratic and isn't essentially a proxy or vessel for Moscow,” Stavridis told CNN's Michael Smerconish.
                





            “The borders, that's a deal, we can cut that,” Stavridis said. “But the issue that's gonna be the challenge are the security guarantees.”
    


More background: Despite the European push for US-backing of security guarantees for Ukraine being evocative of Article 5 of the NATO charter, a European official told CNN the guarantees would not entail NATO involvement.
    


            The conversations come as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with Trump on Monday at the White House.
    


            In a fresh post on X Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered battlefield updates as he warned of a possible uptick in Russian attacks over the coming days.
    


            This, he said, could be an attempt by Russia to garner more favourable political sway.
    


            “Based on the political and diplomatic situation around Ukraine, and knowing Russia's treachery, we anticipate that in the coming days the Russian army may try to increase pressure and strikes against Ukrainian positions in order to create more favorable political circumstances for talks with global actors,” the Ukrainian leader wrote.
    


            It comes after Russian leader Vladimir Putin held talks with US President Donald Trump in Alaska, which centered on ending the war. Trump has since floated the idea of further meetings, including a possible trilateral summit with Putin and Zelensky.
    


            Zelensky also noted Ukraine had “achieved successes” in some “extremely difficult” areas in Donetsk, a region in Ukraine's east, for the second day in a row.
    


            The map below shows the current situation on the ground in Ukraine.
    


            The French Presidency announced that the “coalition of the willing” — Ukraine's main European allies — will meet tomorrow, ahead of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's White House meeting on Monday.
    


            According to the Élysée Palace, the meeting tomorrow will be co-chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
    


            The meeting will be held by video conference and begin at 3 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET), the French Presidency said.
    


            It's set to be the second meeting in a week of the coalition, which was set up earlier this year to provide Ukraine with security guarantees in the event of a ceasefire.
    


            During US President Donald Trump's call with European leaders, Trump highlighted an Italian proposal for security guarantees for Ukraine “inspired by NATO's Article 5,” Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said, according to Reuters.
    


            A European official told CNN earlier that part of the conversations with Trump involved “Article 5-type” security guarantees for Ukraine, with European and US backing, in the event of a peace deal. The official added that there would be no NATO involvement in the guarantees.
    


What is NATO Article 5? It's the “collective defense” part of the alliance's treaty, which stipulates that an attack against one is considered an attack against all the allies and members will take mutual action.
    


            The US president has previously been dismissive of Kyiv's frequent calls for security guarantees — some way to ensure that Russia won't violate a ceasefire agreement or renew its offensive in Ukraine in a few years.
    


                    “If there are Article 5-style guarantees, that is a very big deal,” said Jill Dougherty, adjunct professor at Georgetown University and former CNN Moscow bureau chief, noting that the article itself is not an obligation. “It never obligates anybody, but the expectation is that they would protect Ukraine.”
                





            Dougherty also highlighted Putin's remark yesterday that “the security of Ukraine must be secured.”
    


            “That could be an indication that maybe (Putin) is working out something with the United States that, yes, he could say ‘never ever NATO membership for Ukraine, but yes, maybe we could have some type of American guarantee,'” Dougherty added.
    


            European powers have proposed a “reassurance force” for Ukraine, which they have said cannot work without a US “backstop,” but Trump has so far been reluctant to commit US forces or resources.
    


CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Kyiv contributed to this report.



            Yesterday's Trump-Putin summit in Alaska appeared favorable to the Kremlin despite being “completely under the control of the White House,” according to Michael Bociurkiw, a global affairs analyst and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council told CNN.
    


                    “You had a situation which was completely under the control of the White House but yet it seemed as if it was scripted by the Kremlin from beginning to end, especially that so-called press conference there,” Bociurkiw said CNN's Victor Blackwell.
                





            The summit saw Putin receive a red carpet welcome to the United States and a ride in “the Beast” – a horrific sight for many Ukrainians after three and a half years of war.
    


            Asked if Zelensky might be shoehorned into making an unfavorable deal for Ukraine on Monday, Bociurkiw said: “As for what's about to happen on Monday, I'm very, very nervous about it. I actually have a gut feeling, Victor, that Mr Zelensky is walking into another trap.”
    


            Earlier, US President Donald Trump confirmed he will meet with Zelensky in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon after the pair had a “long and substantive conversation” following Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Hundreds of West Virginia National Guard members will deploy across the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in the District of Columbia through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey, R-W.Va., announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 to nearby Washington at the Republican administration's request. They will arrive in the district along with equipment and specialized training services, his office said in a statement.

“West Virginia is proud to stand with President Trump in his effort to restore pride and beauty to our nation's capital,” Morrisey said. “The men and women of our National Guard represent the best of our state, and this mission reflects our shared commitment to a strong and secure America.”

The move comes as federal agents and National Guard troops have begun to appear across the heavily Democratic city after Trump's executive order Monday federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 D.C. National Guard troops.

By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, the administration is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office.

The West Virginia activation also suggests the administration sees the need for additional manpower, after the president personally played down the need for Washington to hire more police officers.




Maj. Gen. James Seward, West Virginia's adjutant general, said in a statement that members of the state's National Guard “stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region” and that the Guard's “unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking.”

Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country.

City leaders, who are obliged to cooperate with the president's order under the federal laws that direct the district's local governance, have sought to work with the administration though have bristled at the scope of the president's takeover.

On Friday the administration reversed course on an order that aimed to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as an “emergency police commissioner” after the district's top lawyer sued to contest. After a court hearing, Trump's attorney general, Pam Bond, issued a memo that directed the Metropolitan Police Department to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law. 

District officials say they are evaluating how to best comply.

In his order Monday, Trump declared an emergency due to the “city government's failure to maintain public order.” He said that impeded the “federal government's ability to operate efficiently to address the nation's broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.”

In a letter to city residents, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.” She added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy -– even when we don't have full access to it.”

BUNER, Pakistan (AP) — Flooding in a northwest Pakistani district has killed at least 220 people, officials said Saturday, as rescuers pulled 63 more bodies overnight from homes flattened by flash floods and landslides, with forecasts of more rain in the coming days.

One eyewitness, who escaped the deluges in Buner, described seeing floodwaters carrying hundreds of boulders and “tons of rocks” crashing down.

Hundreds of rescue workers are still searching for survivors in Buner, one of several places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where torrential rains and cloudbursts caused massive flooding on Friday, said Mohammad Suhail, a spokesman for the emergency services. Dozens of homes were swept away.

First responders have been trying to recover bodies from the worst-hit villages of Pir Baba and Malik Pura, where most of the fatalities were, said Kashif Qayyum, a deputy commissioner in Buner. 

Local police officer Imtiaz Khan, who narrowly escaped the deluges, said floodwaters carrying hundreds of boulders struck and flattened homes within minutes.

“A stream near Pir Baba village in Buner swelled without warning. At first, we thought it was a normal flash flood, but when tons of rocks came crashing down with the water, 60 to 70 houses were swept away in moments,” Khan told The Associated Press, adding that many bodies were left mutilated. 

“Our police station was washed away too and if we hadn't climbed to higher ground, we would not have survived,” Khan said.

Pakistan's Meteorological Department predicted torrential rains in the coming days and warned that monsoon activity was likely to intensify from Sunday onwards, including in the north and northwest.

Rescuers said they saw large swathes of Pir Baba village destroyed, wrecked homes, and giant rocks filling the streets as the water started to recede. 

“It was not just the floodwater, it was a flood of boulders as well, which we saw for the first time in our lives,” said Sultan Syed, 45, who suffered a broken arm.

Mohammad Khan, 53, said the floods “came so fast that many could not leave their homes.”

Most victims died before reaching the hospital, said Mohammad Tariq, a doctor in Buner. “Many among the dead were children and men, while women were away in the hills collecting firewood and grazing cattle.”

Pakistani leaders, including the prime minister and president, offered their condolences to the families of the dead and said they were praying for the speedy recovery of the injured.

The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, said efforts were underway to repair roads and other damaged infrastructure.

Pakistan has received higher-than-normal monsoon rainfall this year, which experts link to climate change, triggering floods and mudslides that have killed some 541 people since June 26, according to the National Disaster Management Authority.

Mourners attended mass funerals on Saturday, while authorities supplied tents and food to people in Buner. 

Local cleric Mufti Fazal had led funeral prayers at multiple locations since Friday morning. “Before yesterday's floods, the area was bustling with life. Now, there is grief and sorrow everywhere.”

Schoolteacher Suleman Khan lost 25 members of his extended family. He and his brother survived only because they were away from home when the floods hit his village Qadar Nagar.

In Pir Baba, mourners laid out the covered bodies of their loved ones on wooden bedframes or bore them aloft ahead of burials. In a hospital, paramedics placed blocks of ice next to the deceased or comforted the injured.

According to the provincial disaster management authority, at least 351 people have died in rain-related incidents this week across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the northern region of Gilgit-Baltistan. 

In India-controlled Kashmir, rescuers scoured the remote village of Chositi in the district of Kishtwar on Saturday, looking for dozens of missing people after it was hit by flash floods two days earlier, killing 60 and injuring some 150, about 50 in critical condition. 

Thursday's floods struck during an annual Hindu pilgrimage in the area. Authorities have rescued over 300 people, while some 4,000 pilgrims have been evacuated to safety. 

Such cloudbursts are increasingly common in India's Himalayan regions and Pakistan's northern areas, and experts have said climate change is a contributing factor.

Pakistani officials said rescuers since Thursday have evacuated more than 3,500 tourists trapped in flood-hit areas across the country.

Many travelers have ignored government warnings about avoiding vulnerable regions in the north and northwest.

Pakistan witnessed its worst-ever monsoon season in 2022. It killed more than 1,700 people and caused an estimated $40 billion in damage.

            West Virginia National Guard troops are now being sent to Washington, DC, in an escalation of President Donald Trump's efforts to federally take over law enforcement in the city.
    


            “At the request of the Trump administration, I have directed the @WVNationalGuard to support the President's initiative to make D.C. safe and beautiful. We are deploying 300-400 skilled personnel to the nation's capital, reflecting our commitment to a strong and secure America,” West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, said in an X post on Saturday.
    


            The efforts will be federally funded, and the state's National Guard will provide “mission-essential” equipment and training, according to a statement from the governor's office.
    


            A White House official said Saturday that the troops are a part of “Trump's ongoing effort to make DC safe and beautiful” and the “National Guard's role has not changed.” Its role in DC this week has, so far, not been to make arrests.
    


            “The National Guard will protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime,” the official said.
    


            CNN has reached out to the DC mayor's office for comment.
    


            The troops' deployment is an escalation of Trump's efforts to take federal control of the DC police department as he rails against crime in the capital. The president previously announced that he was deploying over 800 DC National Guard troops to the city and surging federal agents into the streets, but Saturday's move marks the first time National Guard troops outside of the city have been directed to support the Trump administration.
    


            “We stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region and contribute to the collective effort of making our nation's capital a clean and safe environment. The National Guard's unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking,” West Virginia Adjutant General  Jim Seward, who will command the deployment of the state's troops, said in a statement.
    


            The move comes amid scrutiny over the takeover in the nation's capital. Washington, DC, sued the Trump administration on Friday to block Attorney General Pam Bondi's Thursday directive for the city to accept an “emergency police commissioner,” acting Drug Enforcement Administration chief Terry Cole, and give him full control of the department during the federal takeover.
    


            Following a hearing in federal court, Bondi issued a new order Friday giving control of the Metropolitan Police Department back to its chief, Pamela Smith, in response to a judge's directive.
    


            Federal agents have been patrolling the city with local police and making arrests following Trump's order earlier this week declaring a crime emergency and federalizing DC's police. The order cited a public safety emergency after an assault on a former government worker.
    


            DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has repeatedly said she wants to make sure the federal law enforcement surge is useful to the city, though she struck a more adversarial tone during an event this week, calling Trump's police department takeover an “authoritarian push.”

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Greg Iles, the Mississippi author of the “Natchez Burning” trilogy and other works, has died. He was 65. 

Iles died Friday after a decades-long battle with the blood cancer multiple myeloma, his literary agent Dan Conaway posted Saturday on Facebook. 

Initially diagnosed with the incurable condition in 1996, he kept his illness private until completing his final novel, “Southern Man,” which was published in 2024.

Iles was born in Germany but moved to Natchez, Mississippi, with his family when he was just three years old and developed a deep connection with the region. Many of his stories are set in Mississippi, including the “Natchez Burning” trilogy, historical fiction suspense novels exploring race and class in the 1960s Jim Crow South. 

Conaway described Iles as “warm, funny, fearless, and completely sui generis.” 

“To be on the other end of the phone as he talked through character and plot, problem-solving on the fly, was to be witness to genius at work, plain and simple,” he wrote on Saturday. “As a writer he fused story-craft, bone-deep humanity, and a growing sense of moral and political responsibility with the ferocious precisions of a whirling dervish or a master watchmaker.”

In March 2011, Iles suffered a ruptured aorta and a partial leg amputation and spent eight days in a medically induced coma after another driver struck his car on Highway 61 near Natchez. He eventually recovered. 

Iles performed with the musical group The Rock Bottom Remainders along with popular authors Stephen King, Amy Tan and others.

The State Department announced on Saturday that it was halting all visitor visas to individuals from Gaza while it reviews the issuing process.

"All visitor visas for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days," a post on X from the State Department read.

Neither the State Department nor Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented on what triggered the sudden review.

ISRAEL SECURITY CABINET APPROVES PLAN TO OCCUPY GAZA CITY

In June, the Trump administration began cracking down on vetting for visa applicants. This involved the introduction of a "comprehensive and thorough" review of all applicants' "online presence."

"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision. The United States must be vigilant during the visa issuance process to ensure that those applying for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans and our national interests, and that all applicants credibly establish their eligibility for the visa sought, including that they intend to engage in activities consistent with the terms for their admission," the State Department said at the time.

3 EXCLUSIVE 'GOLDEN' VISA DESTINATIONS THAT AMERICA'S WEALTHIEST ARE EYEING

Earlier this month, France suspended evacuations from Gaza after a Palestinian student allegedly shared a social media post with an image of Adolf Hitler that called for killing Jews.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told France Info radio that the woman "must leave the country" and that she "has no place" in France.

"No evacuation of any kind will take place until we have drawn the necessary conclusions from this investigation," Barrot said in the interview. He also vowed there would be a probe into how the Palestinian woman was able to get a student visa.

The student, later identified as Nour Attaalah, left France for Qatar after the incident.

As of Jan. 1, 2025, the population in Gaza had dropped by 6% since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, according to Reuters, which cited the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS). The outlet noted that this includes approximately 100,000 Palestinians who fled the enclave.

Fox News Digital spoke to Just Facts President James Agresti about misleading narratives about crime in the nation's capital

Democrats across the country have been pushing back on President Trump's D.C. crime crackdown, citing statistics purportedly showing that crime in the nation's capital is down or even at historic lows, but an expert who spoke to Fox News Digital is pushing back on that narrative.

"These Democrats are citing statistics from the FBI, from its uniform crime report. And the problem with that is that they're portraying it as if it's a record of violent crime," Jim Agresti, president of the nonprofit research institute Just Facts, told Fox News Digital shortly after Trump announced he was sending federal resources to the nation's capital to confront crime in the city.

"But really what it is is a record of crimes that are reported to the police and then those of those crimes that get reported to the FBI. It's not a full record of all violent crimes, and this is a problem. And the FBI is very explicit about this when they present the data in their formal report every year, where they say, ‘Do not directly compare the data from year to year because there are differences in how frequently people report crimes and how frequently the FBI gets that data from the local police agencies.'"

While many prominent Democrats, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have insisted violent crime is at a 30-year low in the city, Agresti told Fox News Digital the "best way to understand the state of violent crime" in any jurisdiction is to look at the number of murders because it is a violent crime that is difficult to "sweep under the rug" because it "produces a dead body."

"When we look at the murder data for DC, we see that it is not a situation that is lower now than it's been in the last 30 years. Quite the opposite," Agresti explained. "It is currently 83% higher than it was at its low point a dozen years ago. So, there is a serious problem with serious crime, violent crime in D.C., and the city now, the nation's capital, has a murder rate that is five times the U.S. average."

The chances of a person facing a violent crime in Washington, D.C., have dropped in recent years, but the possibility of dying during such a crime has skyrocketed, data shows, Fox News Digital reported on Wednesday.

Lethality in D.C. jumped by a whopping 341% when compared to 2012 data, the study found, reporting that there were 13 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2012 and 57 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2024. 

Agresti explained that while many people operate with the belief that crime spiked across the country during and because of COVID, the issue actually began getting worse specifically when the Black Lives Matter rioting erupted.

"That makes a lot of sense," Agresti said. "Police were vilified. They pulled back out of fear of being hurt. People were talking about defunding the police, and there was overall mayhem in this country. So, that rise, by the way, that people blame on COVID actually didn't start with COVID, and it didn't appear in other countries. It happened here where we had these BLM riots."

Agresti told Fox News Digital there is a "clear connection" between crime in the United States and the "Defund the Police" movement and that most people don't grasp the "full extent" of the crime problem in this country.

"We had roughly 17,000 murders last year," Agresti explained. "Imagine if all of them made national news. At the current rate of murders in this county, roughly one in every 230 people in the United States will have their lives cut short by being murdered. That statistic is so unbelievable."

In addition to the "staggering" facts about murder, Agresti said data compiled by Just Facts shows one in 10 women in the United States are raped in the course of their lives. 

"Think about the horror of that, and beyond all this pain, suffering, death, there's also a financial cost to crime," Agresti said. "It's been quantified in a 2021 academic paper, and, bottom line, crime in all of its forms, pain, death, suffering, financial loss, activities we take to prevent crime, they amount to a cost on our US economy of roughly $40,000 per U.S. household."

Questions have also been raised about local crime stats from D.C. showing crime is down so far this year, with many pointing to news reports that a D.C. police commander was recently suspended for allegedly altering crime data.

Agresti said anyone can "cherry-pick" crime statistics to promote a specific agenda but that it is important to also realize that many crimes also go unreported due to various factors, including animosity toward police or the belief that calling the police won't yield results.

"The vast majority of crime goes unreported, and another phenomenon that's really, really disturbing is the amount of crimes that are solved," Agresti said. "It used to be in this country, in 1960, that 92% of all murders are solved. In 2023, that figure was down to 58%, meaning that 40-plus percent of people who committed murders got away with it, and they're out there to commit them again."

As of Thursday, 800 Trump-authorized National Guard troops were in Washington, D.C., supporting other federal law enforcement agencies with "monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities and officers, traffic control posts and area beautification," according to the State Department.

Trump's move to crack down on crime in the capital, which the White House says is happening at levels that dwarf capitals in other far more impoverished countries across the world, has sparked protests led by liberal activists and outrage from some elected Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.

"When politicians are saying, 'We don't have to worry about this, it's the lowest crime rate in 30 years,' they are abdicating their responsibility," Agresti told Fox News Digital. 

"The Declaration of Independence said that governments are instituted to protect the rights of people, including their life, their liberty and the pursuit of happiness. What we have right now is many politicians and governments who are doing an extremely poor job of that, and the pain and suffering is unbelievable. It's just so broad and so horrible."

The Republican Party has been able to repeal climate provisions enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act, the marquee legislation signed by President Joe Biden, but has left other parts of the landmark bill untouched three years on.  

Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law on Aug. 16, 2022, after Democrats passed it following months of negotiations between liberals and centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (WV).

The legislation was billed as addressing inflation, which at the time was soaring to the highest rates in decades. In reality, it authorized major new spending on initiatives long sought by Democrats. Most notably, it included hundreds of billions of dollars in funding for clean energy programs. Biden touted it as the “most significant legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis.” The bill also included major new healthcare provisions sought by Democrats, and was financed by tax hikes on corporations and investors.

The clean energy provisions of the bill, in particular, have been significantly repealed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 — a major blow to Biden's legislative legacy.

Other parts of the bill remain, and now appear to be firmly ensconced in federal law, at least for the near term. Here is the full rundown.

The OBBBA repeals more than $500 billion of IRA clean energy tax credits over the next decade, as well as billions for clean energy programs. The spending cuts helped offset other aspects of the Republican bill that add to the deficit, namely tax cuts and new spending on immigration enforcement and defense. 

Specifically, the bill eliminates credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles as well as up to $4,000 for used electric vehicles. The credits will now conclude at the end of September. The tax credits were intended to boost EV adoption, but the Trump administration has strongly opposed incentives or policies to increase the EV industry. 

The bill phased out tax credits for solar and wind energy, requiring projects to begin construction within one year or be operational by 2027 to be eligible for the production or investment tax credit. 

The Trump administration has heavily criticized both industries and last month directed the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the termination of the credits. The department issued new stringent regulations on Friday.

Many fiscal conservatives had sought a complete repeal of the clean energy tax credits. That goal was not met. For nuclear power, geothermal power, and hydropower — sources of energy valued by the Trump administration because they can provide “baseload” power that does not vary with the wind or sun — the IRA tax credits were untouched or have a longer phase-out period. The OBBBA also increased subsidies for biofuels.

The OBBBA also further departed from the clean-energy agenda by including provisions to increase domestic oil and gas development by mandating lease sales on federal lands and waters. Specifically, it would require two lease sales in the Gulf of America, formally known as the Gulf of America, and would also mandate quarterly lease sales onshore and sales in Alaska.

Overall, the course of federal energy policy has taken a dramatic turn.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has positioned the federal government to encourage investment in traditional fossil fuel projects,” James Bowe, a partner at King & Spalding who focuses on energy, said via email.

“One result of the [OBBBA] enactment and related changes in federal energy policy has been an upsurge in new natural gas and liquified natural gas project development, the revival of several large natural gas pipeline projects and a rush to develop new gas-fired generating facilities,” he added. “From the federal government's perspective, renewables are out, and oil, gas and even coal are now back in.”

The IRA created the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program, advancing the long-sought liberal goal of having the government negotiate prices for drugs it purchases. 

Although the drug pricing program is hated by the pharmaceutical industry and many conservatives, it has survived. The Trump administration appears to be using the negotiation authority until larger plans for lowering drug costs take shape.

The provision in the IRA gives the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator the authority to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies to set the prices for the most expensive prescription medications for the Medicare program that do not have other “bona fide” generics on the market. 

Last August, the Biden administration announced the negotiated prices for the 10 drugs selected during the first round of negotiations started in 2023. At the time, CMS estimated the new prices would save the Medicare program $6 billion annually. 

Those new prices, for drugs like heart medications Jardiance and Eliquis and Crohn's Disease drug Stelara, are set to take effect Jan. 1, 2026.

This January, the outgoing Biden CMS announced 15 new drugs up for negotiations with prices to take effect in 2027. That list included the Danish pharmaceutical juggernaut Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. 

Trump CMS administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz has not yet announced whether the prices for those 15 drugs have been negotiated yet. But, during his Senate confirmation hearing in March, he said that the negotiation program was the law of the land and that he would “defend it and use it.” 

The OBBBA did make changes to the program, but only at the margin. It clarified rules for so-called “orphan drugs” that treat one or more rare diseases. These orphan drugs are now fully exempt from the negotiation program, with the intention of encouraging pharmaceutical companies to invest in cures or treatments for rare diseases. 

More generally, though, the Trump administration has taken a heavy-handed approach to pressuring drugmakers to lower prices.

In May, Trump signed an executive order seeking to implement the “Most Favored Nation” policy, whereby the government pays prices for drugs that are tied to the prices paid by other countries, in an attempt to rectify the issue of American consumers shouldering the costs of research and development. 

If pharmaceutical companies do not voluntarily comply, the executive order gives Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. the authority to propose rules and restrictions on manufacturers and imports.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai told the Washington Examiner that the drug pricing reforms are inferior to the Most Favored Nation policy.

“After much fanfare, Joe Biden's Inflation ‘Reduction' Act barely lowered drug prices in the first round of negotiations and actually increased Medicare premiums in the meantime,” said Desai. “President Trump is focused on delivering what American patients really want – lower drug prices by ending foreign free loading off of American innovation.”

One major IRA provision that faces an uncertain future is its extension of additional Obamacare premium subsidies. The additional subsidies prevented premiums from rising significantly for many middle-income people who get insurance through the exchanges. If they expire, many families would face higher costs, and the ranks of the uninsured would rise by 3.8 million, a daunting political scenario for Republicans. A permanent expansion, though, would cost the government $383 billion over the next 10 years. Many fiscal conservatives oppose that spending.

Somewhat surprisingly — given that Republicans have control of the White House, the House, and the Senate — much of the tax hikes in the IRA have survived, although some have been altered or scaled back. 

The OBBBA included a permanent extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts for individuals. It also enacted new campaign-trail Trump proposals, such as eliminating taxes on tips and ending taxes on overtime pay. 

But the bill mostly kept the IRA tax hikes, with some changes, said Will McBride, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation.

The IRA created a corporate alternative minimum tax that mandated a 15% minimum tax for large corporations on their “book income” — that is, the income they report to investors, rather than what they report to the IRS. McBride said that the GOP bill only slightly tweaks that provision by providing a bit of a carveout for some companies in the oil and gas sector.

“It's a very small issue — it's less than a billion dollars over 10 years — so otherwise, the corporate alternative tax is fully in place,” McBride told the Washington Examiner.

The IRA also imposed a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. That was also untouched by the OBBBA. 

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE IN DC WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN

Also, the Republican reconciliation legislation didn't touch the $80 billion in new IRS funding that was granted by Democrats as part of the IRA. Still, other pieces of legislation have chiseled away at that $80 billion, and the funding is now about half of what it was when the IRA became law.

Tucked in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is language the Trump administration hopes will allow border officials to detain illegal immigrants indefinitely, as its authority to do so makes its way through the courts.

The law, passed by a GOP-controlled Congress in July, contained provisions that could allow the federal government to detain families through the duration of their court proceedings, something that has not been legally permissible since 1997, when a judge imposed what was known as the Flores settlement agreement that outlined detention regulations.

Trump administration officials have touted the BBB provision as a way to prevent families that cross the border from being automatically released into the United States, given a 20-day limit on keeping parents and children in federal custody. However, Democrats and immigrant advocates have raised serious concerns about prolonged detention and the impact on children in particular.

The Justice Department made a fresh effort to repeal the agreement earlier this year, arguing that legal and practical circumstances have changed since Trump failed to convince the courts in his first term. As of last Friday, a judge was still considering the merits of the case, while supporters of Flores say the GOP tax law does not override the agreement. 

Flores dates back to 1985, when the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law sued the government in a class-action lawsuit named after 15-year-old Jenny Lisette Flores, a girl from El Salvador who came over the southern border alone.

The lawsuit alleged that Flores was not housed separately from unrelated adults, did not receive adequate hygiene care, and was wrongly denied release to a family member.

In 1997, the court approved the Flores settlement agreement, which mandated protocols for how the federal agencies handle unaccompanied children.

Prior to this, border and immigration agencies did not have standards for detaining children. Under Flores, children would receive food, water, medical care, toilets and sinks, appropriate temperature controls within facilities, adequate adult supervision, and the ability to contact family.

Flores was intended as a temporary measure, according to the Congressional Research Service, and was to remain in effect until the government put forward regulations that the court would approve.

Protocols for the care of immigrant children changed during the George W. Bush administration after the Department of Homeland Security was created. Solo children would be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services for care, and families would be detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Central District of California Judge Dolly Gee, an Obama appointee, ruled in 2015 in Flores v. Johnson that children, whether unaccompanied or with family members, could not be held indefinitely and that they all had to be treated according to the terms of the 1997 settlement agreement.

At the request of the government, which wanted the ability to hold families temporarily to allow for the resolution of claims for asylum or removal, Gee allowed ICE to detain families for up to 20 days.

Central American families began to cross the southern border at record-high levels as cartels recognized that the families would not be detained more than 20 days, therefore helping facilitate their release into the country.

White House border czar Tom Homan told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday afternoon that Gee's decision was the “worst immigration decision in the history of this nation” because judges would not be able to hear claims in the 20-day period, which would force ICE to release families and hope they would show up to court years down the road.

“I said at the time, if they did that, you would see a surge of family units across this border like never seen before,” Homan said. “What happened? I was called a fear monger by the other side, but I was exactly right. Hundreds of thousands of families rushed across the border because they knew they would be released before they saw a judge.”

In May, the Trump administration filed a motion to terminate the Flores settlement, a move that the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law was quick to oppose on the basis that it could set children and their families up for abuse.

“Children who seek refuge in our country should be met with open arms — not imprisonment, deprivation, and abuse,” Sergio Perez, executive director of CHRCL, said in a statement. “The Trump Administration's move to dismiss this agreement … is another lawless step towards sacrificing accountability and human decency in favor of a political agenda that demonizes refugees.”

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, said the changes in the GOP megabill would benefit those involved and maintain order in the immigration process.

“The law requires that everyone who crosses illegally should be detained. So you shouldn't be able to be exempt from that because you brought your children on this dangerous journey and put them at risk. It's not inherently cruel or punitive to keep people in custody until their case is resolved,” said Vaughan, whose organization is nonpartisan but takes a stricter approach to immigration levels.

In particular, the law has provisions that appear to allow migrant parents and their children to be held at “family residential centers” for the duration of their court case. The bill also provided billions in extra resources to allow border officials to expand their detention capacity.

While indefinite detention is more likely to be applied to people who cross the border illegally, it could be imposed on families detained by ICE inside the country to face deportation proceedings, though that situation has been the exception and not the norm so far under the Trump administration.

“Say there's a family that has an asylum application and is denied, and they may — if the government thinks that they're not going to comply with the removal order — put them in a facility like this,” Vaughan said. “It would be almost like a repatriation center to hold them in case they don't show up.”

Vaughan maintained that since Congress was the one to pass legislation addressing Flores, it ought to override the court agreement.

“Congress has spoken on it, which under our constitutional system, is very powerful,” Vaughan said.

The American Immigration Council in Washington strongly criticized the language included in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, alleging it would “dismantle core legal protections for children.” The Council also recently stated that whether the bill's language overrules the Flores settlement “is still to be decided by courts.”

Neha Desai, managing director at the National Center for Youth Law, was insistent that the Flores settlement agreement was still in good standing.

“Nothing in the text of the reconciliation law supersedes the Flores Settlement's requirements, including the requirements that children detained in federal immigration custody be held in safe and sanitary conditions and expeditiously placed in licensed facilities,” Desai said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.

CLOSED PRISON IN TENNESSEE TO BE USED AS ICE DETENTION FACILITY

Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX), whose district is the largest one on the U.S.-Mexico border, was optimistic that ICE would have adequate facilities and accommodations if families ended up being detained beyond 20 days.

“I visited these facilities under both administrations, and I've never had a problem with ICE facilities,” Gonzales told CBS News's Face the Nation on Sunday. “They've always allowed me to view everything I wanted. I've taken pictures. I've done videos, I've talked, I've spoken to people that were there, and I think that's the important part, our government needs to be transparent to what's happening.”

            At parks, coffee shops, churches and government buildings around the country, hundreds of people are expected to gather today with a simple message: “Stop the Trump takeover.”
    


            The rallies are a bid to combat Republican-led plans to redraw congressional maps. The main event will take place in Texas, where a new congressional map backed by President Donald Trump that could net Republicans five additional seats in the 2026 midterm elections inspired the state's Democratic lawmakers to flee the state – preventing the quorum needed to vote.
    


            “Trump is terrified of the American people,” said the Texas for All Coalition, which is helping organize the events, in a news release. “He knows he can't win on his ideas, so he's trying to take Congress by hook or by crook – and he's doing it by silencing the voices of communities of color. We're not going to let that happen.”
    


            Organizers emphasized “a commitment to nonviolence” at all events in event page descriptions.
    


            Over 200 events are planned in 34 states, according to the event's official website. The Democratic National Committee is helping organize events, it announced in a news release.
    


            “From coast to coast, people will be showing up at their statehouses, city halls, and community spaces to make it clear – we see what Trump is doing, and we won't stand for it,” said the DNC.
    


            A swath of nonprofits and other organizations are also supporting the effort, including Planned Parenthood, the Working Families Party and Human Rights Campaign.
    


            Trump described the proposed Texas congressional map as a “very simple redrawing” at the White House. “We pick up five seats,” he added.
    


Texas Republicans call new special session for redistricting, this time with Democrats expected back



            But it doesn't end with Texas. Republican leaders in other states, too, have proposed changing their congressional maps ahead of next year's midterms.
    


            The White House is pushing Missouri legislators to consider a special session to redraw maps. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has floated the idea of changing his state's maps, and has said he thinks the Trump administration should give the state another seat. In Ohio, maps must be redrawn due to a quirk of state law – which may make the state's delegation even more Republican and carve up two Democratic seats, according to a report in June from CNN's Fredreka Schouten.
    


            Democratic lawmakers have announced their own plans to fight back, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who kicked off his own redistricting push on Thursday.
    


            Here's more on what we know about today's protests.
    


 Today's largest protest is slated to happen in Austin, Texas. Over 1,000 people have RSVPed for the event, which will start at the state's Capitol.
    


            “Texas is being used as a testing ground for extremist policies and partisan games that don't reflect our values,” reads the event page. “Thousands of Texans have shown up against the racially gerrymandered congressional map lawmakers are trying to force through in order to weaken the voting power of communities of color.”
    


            Former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, United Farm Workers cofounder Dolores Huerta, Democratic US Rep. Greg Casar and Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas are expected to speak, according to a news release from the Texas for All Coalition.
    


            Drag queen Brigitte Bandit and singer Gina Chavez are also expected to perform.
    


            Across Texas, events are also planned in Houston, Dallas, San Angelo, Tyler, McAllen, Conroe and Kingwood.

            Events and rallies are also scheduled in dozens of other states, both in Democratic strongholds and Republican-majority states. Local organizers are planning each city-specific event.
    


            In New York City, demonstrators are expected to gather in Central Park. In Washington, DC, where Trump has deployed the National Guard and declared a federal takeover of the local police department, organizers are painting banners and signs to place around the city.
    


            Protesters in Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina, plan to hold a “bridge brigade,” holding signs on 16 different bridges.
    


            Demonstrations are also planned in Cincinnati, Ohio; Sarasota, Florida; and Jefferson City, Missouri, among other cities. The planned events include rallies, teach-ins, banner drops and art-making at locations that include a bookstore in Jacksonville, Florida, and a Tesla showroom in Palo Alto, California.
    


            The demonstrations follow a string of other protests organized since Trump took office for the second time in January, including the “No Kings” protests in June and demonstrations against the president's deportation campaign in July.
    


            Drucilla Tigner, the executive director of statewide coalition Texas For All, said in a news release that the fight extends far past Texas.
    


            “Across Texas, and across the country, communities are speaking out in a united voice to call for an end to the Trump takeover,” she said. “Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn't end here. This isn't just about redistricting or one state's politics.”
    


            “It's about the future of our democracy.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District's police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law.

The order from Bondi came after officials in the nation's capital sued Friday to block President Donald Trump's takeover of the Washington police. The night before, his administration had escalated its intervention into the city's law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department, essentially placing the police force under the full control of the federal government.

The attorney general's new order represents a partial retreat for the Trump administration in the face of intense skepticism from a judge over the legality of Bondi's earlier directive. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities.

In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser.”

Mayor Muriel Bowser's office said late Friday that it was still evaluating how it can comply with the new Bondi order on immigration enforcement operations. The police department already eased some restrictions on cooperating with federal officials facilitating Trump's mass-deportation campaign but reaffirmed that it would follow the district's sanctuary city laws.




In a letter sent Friday night to D.C. citizens, Bowser wrote: “It has been an unsettling and unprecedented week in our city. Over the course of a week, the surge in federal law enforcement across D.C. has created waves of anxiety.” 




She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don't have full access to it.”

The legal battle was the latest evidence of the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department largely under the control of the Republican president's administration. Trump's takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week. 

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city's immigration and policing policies, the district's right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district's lawsuit. She indicated the law likely doesn't grant the Trump administration power to fully take over city police, but it probably does give the president more power than the city might like.

“The way I read the statute, the president can ask, the mayor must provide, but the president can't control,” said Reyes, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden. The judge pushed the two sides to make a compromise.

An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

The president has more power over the nation's capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he'd seek to extend it.

Bondi's Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Meanwhile, advocates in Washington were trying to advise immigrants on how to respond. Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said they're still parsing the legal aspects of the policies. 

“Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police,” Sanai said. “But now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise.”

Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation's capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they've seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city.

She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.”

ICE said in a post on X that their teams had arrested “several” people in Washington Friday. A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van.

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Friday night along the district's U Street, a popular nightlife corridor, an Associated Press photographer saw officers from the FBI, the DEA, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Park Police, U.S. Marshals and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!”

Democrats released a congressional map for California on Friday that could give them five more districts more favorable to Democrats.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has been pushing to redistrict California as President Donald Trump demanded Texas Republicans redraw the state's map mid-decade in an effort to hold on to the GOP's razor-thin House majority. 

California, as the most populous state, has the largest congressional delegation. Democrats currently hold 43 of the state's 52 House seats, and the new map could give Democrats a 48-4 advantage.

The proposed map would, in theory, cancel out any successful effort in Texas as Texas Republicans look to add five more GOP seats. 

“We anticipate these maps will completely neuter and neutralize what is happening in Texas,” Newsom said Thursday, adding he will only pursue the redistricting route if Republican-led states do the same. “There's still an exit ramp.”

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee released the proposed map, which will be introduced in the California state legislature on Monday.

“We will not stand by as Republicans attempt to rig the election in their favor and choose their voters,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Julie Merz said in a statement. “It's increasingly clear that Republicans will do anything to protect their narrow majority because they know they can't win on their disastrous legislative record, which has raised costs and rips away healthcare for millions, all to give the ultra-wealthy a tax break.”

According to the map, the districts currently held by Republican Reps. Ken Calvert, Kevin Kiley, and Doug LaMalfa would move from safe Republican districts to safe Democratic districts. Rep. David Valadao could also see more Democratic challengers in his close swing district, while Rep. Darrell Issa's district moves from safe Republican to lean Democratic.

The proposed map would also strengthen Democrats' hold over four toss-up seats currently held by Democrats, according to Politico.

The California constitution, however, requires a nonpartisan commission to draw its House seats. Newsom has said he and state lawmakers will put a ballot question to voters in a Nov. 4 special election to suspend that requirement for the next three federal elections. The independent commission would return after the 2030 census.

REDISTRICTING WARS THREATEN TO MAKE CONGRESS MORE PARTISAN

Texas Democratic lawmakers left the state earlier this month to deny Texas Republicans a quorum to vote on a new congressional map that would favor the GOP even more. 

Texas Republicans ended their special session Friday and called a new one hours later. The state legislature was forced to adjourn after failing to meet the minimum attendance threshold.

President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin said they reached an understanding on ending the war in Ukraine after meeting for about 2 1/2 hours in Alaska. But they offered no details on what they agreed and left without answering questions.

U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin did not reach a deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine after talks in Alaska on Friday, as the two leaders offered scant details on what was discussed but heaped praise on one another.

Putin said he and Trump had reached an “understanding” on Ukraine and warned Europe not to “torpedo the nascent progress.” But Trump said, “There's no deal until there's a deal” and said he plans to speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders soon.

The high-profile summit ended without an agreement to end, or even pause, the brutal conflict — the largest land war in Europe since 1945 — which has raged for more than three years.

Trump said in an interview for the Fox News Channel that he and Putin talked at length about many of the ways the U.S. president feels he's been wronged since he emerged on the political stage.

Trump said Putin validated his false assertion that the 2020 election had been “rigged” against the Republican, saying they agreed on the “dishonest” nature of using mail-in ballots.

“He said there's not a country in the world that uses it now,” Trump said Putin told him of the process.

Several times on Friday, Trump also mentioned “Russia, Russia, Russia,” a reference to allegations that Moscow interfered on his behalf in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Trump is passing the buck to the Ukrainian president, saying he will need to agree to do anything discussed today with Putin.

“Now it's really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done,” Trump told Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel.

Trump said he expects a meeting to take place between Putin and Zelenskyy and that he will perhaps join them,

He declined to discuss what he and Putin had agreed to and what remained outstanding, repeating that “it's not a done deal at all.”

Putin has previously said he's not against meeting Zelenskyy but that “certain conditions” must first be met. The Kremlin has said the two should only meet when there's a peace agreement on the table ready to be signed.

Asked by Sean Hannity of the Fox News Channel what advice he would give to Zelenskyy, Trump said he would recommend that the Ukrainian president “make a deal. Russia is a very big power.”

Noting of Ukraine that “maybe they will say no,” Trump went on to characterize his time with Putin as “a very warm meeting between two very important countries.”

Still without giving details, Trump said he feels the parties “are close to a deal, but I don't like saying it,” implying doing so would jinx the process.

In a post-summit interview with the Fox News Channel, Trump talked several times about ways Putin had complimented him.

Trump said Putin described the U.S. as “hot as a pistol.” The U.S. president also said it pleased him to hear Putin say — as Trump himself often does — that the Russia-Ukraine war would not have begun had the Republican, and not Democrat Joe Biden, been president.

Overall, Trump gave the summit, of which no precise details have been released, “a 10.”

Trump had said before the summit that he'd know in the first two minutes whether he and Putin could reach a deal to end the Russia-Ukraine war.

But Trump didn't give a direct answer when he was asked about the opening minutes of the meeting during a post-summit interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel.

Instead, Trump stressed that he's always had a “great relationship” with Putin and said they would have done things together if not for the U.S. investigation into Russian interference into Trump's election in 2016.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin and Trump made “comprehensive statements” after the talks so a decision was made not to take questions from journalists, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.

Putin and Trump made statements after the talks but left the room full of reporters without taking questions.

Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's envoy for investment and economic cooperation who was part of the Russian delegation in Alaska, described the summit as “definitely productive” in comments after the talks, shared with The Associated Press by his spokesperson.

Dmitriev said there were “lots of issues that we discussed” and “many” agreed upon, with more “to be agreed” upon in the future, although he didn't offer any details as to what issues he was referring to.

“It's very important that President Trump outlined a significant economic potential of cooperation between the U.S. and Russia, and we will continue building U.S.-Russia relations going forward, despite lots of resistance to this,” Dmitriev said.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov described the talks as “very positive,” according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. 

The agency quoted Peskov as saying that the summit allows Moscow and Washington to “continue to confidently move together along the path of searching for (Ukraine conflict) resolution options.”

After flying many hours to Alaska, and a nearly three-hour meeting with Putin, Trump departed in Air Force One from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

They rode to the summit together in the backseat of Trump's armored Cadillac and departed in separate cars afterward.

After leaving Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Putin traveled to Fort Richardson National Cemetery outside Anchorage to lay flowers at the graves of Soviet pilots, Russian media reported.

Addressing journalists after his meeting with Trump, Putin referenced the Alaska-Siberia air route, through which U.S. aircraft were delivered to the Soviet Union during World War II. 

“It was a dangerous and treacherous route over the vast emptiness of ice,” Putin said. “However, the pilots of both countries did everything they could for a common victory.”

Putin thanked Trump for the “friendly” tone of the conversation they had on Friday and said Russia and the United States should “turn the page and go back to cooperation.”

He praised Trump as someone who “has a clear idea of what he wants to achieve and sincerely cares about the prosperity of his country, and at the same time shows understanding that Russia's has its own national interests.”

“I expect that today's agreements will become a reference point not only for solving the Ukrainian problem, but will also mark the beginning of the restoration of businesslike, pragmatic relations between Russia and the U.S.,” Putin said.

Trump said there are “just a very few” issues to resolve, without providing any sense of what those issues might be.

“Some are not that significant,” Trump said. “One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there. We didn't get there, but we have a very good chance of getting there.”

The president said he's “always had a fantastic relationship” with Putin. He referenced the U.S. government investigations into Russia's support for his 2016 presidential campaign and repeated his claims of the U.S. economy being the “hottest” in the world.

Putin repeated Moscow's long-held position that it is “sincerely interested in putting an end” to the war in Ukraine, but for that to happen, “all the root causes of the crisis ... must be eliminated.”

“All of Russia's legitimate concerns must be taken into account, and a fair balance in the security sphere in Europe and the world as a whole must be restored,” Putin said.

He added that he agrees with Trump on ensuring Ukraine's security and said Moscow was “ready to work on this,” without offering details.

“I would like to hope that the understanding we have reached will allow us to get closer to that goal and open the way to peace in Ukraine,” Putin said, without elaborating on what the understanding was.

“We hope that Kyiv and the European capitals will perceive all of this in a constructive manner and will not create any obstacles or attempt to disrupt the nascent progress through provocation or behind-the-scenes intrigue,” the Russia leader added.

Trump has spoken repeatedly in recent days about wanting to have a second meeting after the Alaska summit.

As they wrapped their statements after the summit, Putin said to Trump in English, “Next time in Moscow.”

Trump responded, “I could see it possibly happening.”

Neither leader announced that a second meeting would be held before they left the room without answering questions from reporters.

After their nearly three-hour-long meeting, neither Trump nor Putin took questions from reporters after giving brief remarks. Putin said the two leaders had reached an “understanding,” but neither offered further details.

The U.S. president also said he would call European and NATO leaders to give them updates from his meeting with Putin.

Trump said “some great progress” was made in his bilateral meeting with the Russian president, saying “many points were agreed to,” with just a “very few” remaining.

Zelenskyy was not invited to the Alaska summit.

Trump has long claimed that Putin would never have invaded Ukraine if he had still been in the White House — and the Russian leader confirmed that argument at a news conference after their meeting.

Putin criticized former President Joe Biden without naming him and referenced Trump's argument about his presence being sufficient to stop the war.

“I can confirm that,” Putin said through a translator.

Speaking in Russian, the president said he had greeted Trump as “dear neighbor,” thankful to see him in good health.

Putin also said he and Trump “have very good, direct contact.”

As Putin spoke, Trump stood about 6 or 7 feet (1.8 or 2.1 meters) away from him, at his own podium.

Putin said the U.S. and Russia are close neighbors, separated by mere miles, so it made sense for the summit to be held in Alaska.

He said the talks were held “in a constructive and mutually respectful atmosphere,” and were “very thorough and useful.”

The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of department after a court hearing.

Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District's police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement “notwithstanding” city law.

Trump and Putin have ended their three-on-three talk after about 2 1/2 hours. They met behind closed doors with top advisers.

The U.S. Secret Service will conduct a routine active threat exercise at the White House complex Aug. 15 from approximately 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.

Members of the public may hear simulated gunfire and see increased law enforcement presence in and around the White House complex during the exercise, the Secret Service said in a statement.

No road closures will be in effect for this exercise, though select sidewalks near the complex will be closed. All exercises being conducted are routine and are not expected to significantly impact the public, according to the statement.

A top aide to Trump says the president, Putin and their aides are still meeting.

The aide, Dan Scavino, said Trump, Rubio and Witkoff are still behind closed doors with Putin and the Russian delegation. The meeting began around 3:30 p.m. ET.

The nation's capital and the Trump administration appear to be nearing a temporary agreement on the leadership of the city's police department.

Washington's top attorney, Brian Schwalb, told reporters he expects the U.S. to agree that the city police chief remains in charge of the department, at least for the coming days.

The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday after the city sued to block the federal government from putting a Trump administration official in charge of city police officers.

The federal judge overseeing the lawsuit said the law doesn't allow the federal government to name a new police chief, but the city can't completely keep them out either.

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes asked the two sides to hammer out a compromise but promised to issue a court order temporarily blocking the administration from naming a new chief if they couldn't agree.

Journalists spend a lot of time during big stories standing around waiting for news to happen.

Alaska has done its best to break up the monotony for television reporters and cameras crews who have been standing outside the main gate at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage this week ahead of Friday's summit.

On Wednesday, a young moose inside the base property came to the tall cyclone fence that is the base perimeter to catch a glimpse of the reporters before disappearing back into the forest.

On Thursday, a good-sized black bear was seen walking through a wooded area across the busy four-lane road outside the gates. Reporters could be heard yelling “Bear! Bear!” to warn others.

Wildlife is common on or near the base, located within the Municipality of Anchorage.

The sprawling municipality is an urban-wildlife interface that spreads across 1,961 square miles (5,079 square kilometers), an area slightly larger than the state of Rhode Island.

Anchorage is home to about 290,000 people, or about 40% of the state's population, and all kinds of wildlife, including an estimated 350 black bears, 65 brown bears and 1,600 moose.

The Kremlin shared two clips of Putin and Trump smiling and talking before the two world leaders began their sit-down meeting in Alaska, alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov.

Russian media outlets also shared images that appeared to show a bemused Putin raising his eyebrows in response to shouted questions from assembled reporters. At one point, Putin cupped his hands around his mouth and appeared to say something, although his voice could not be heard.

While Trump was meeting privately with his top aides and Putin, his political team sent out a fundraising email that said, “I'm meeting with Putin in Alaska!”

“It's a little chilly,” the fundraising pitch said. “THIS MEETING IS VERY HIGH STAKES for the world.”

It also said, “No one in the world knows how to make deals like me!” and encouraged people to donate, suggesting they start with $10.

It's because the former secretary of state said she'd nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize herself if he negotiates an end to Russia's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to give up territory.

“Well, that was very nice,” Trump said when asked about Clinton's comment during an in-flight interview with Fox News Channel. “I may have to start liking her again.”

Trump and Clinton were presidential rivals in 2016 and have had a contentious relationship. Trump has also been angling to be awarded the prestigious peace prize.

The full Fox News interview is set to air later Friday.

Interviewed by Bret Baier of Fox News Channel aboard Air Force One as he flew to Alaska, Trump said he'd like to walk away from the meeting with a ceasefire.

He also said he'd like a second meeting on Russia's war in Ukraine.

“I wouldn't be thrilled if I didn't get it,” Trump said of a halt to hostilities between the countries. He said everyone tells him he won't get a ceasefire until a second meeting.

“So, we'll see what happens. I'm going to be, I won't be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” he said.

The two leaders were seated in a room with their aides in front of a blue backdrop that had the words “Pursuing Peace” printed on it.

Trump and Putin were seated in the middle of the chair arranged in a horseshoe, with a small table between them with drinking glasses and paper.

They didn't take any questions but Trump said, “Thank you” to reporters who were briefly in the room.

The two leaders' motorcade made the short drive to a building on the base where they're expected to meet and hold a news conference later.

Both leaders got into the backseat of Trump's armored presidential limousine, chatting with each other and smiling as they got situated.

President Donald Trump greeted Russian leader Vladimir Putin at an air base in Alaska on Friday as a squadron of U.S. stealth military planes designed during the Cold War in part for use in a possible conflict with the Soviet Union flew overhead.

As Trump and Putin shook hands at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson outside Anchorage, F-22s and B2 bombers soared above. Neither plane entered active service until after the Cold War had ended but their design and development began during the 1970s and 1980s when the U.S.-Soviet rivalry was at its height.

The presence of the planes during the red carpet welcome afforded to Putin by summit host Trump may have been intended to remind the Russian leader of U.S. military might as the pair head in to talks focused on Russia's war with Ukraine.

Both leaders stood alongside each other, shaking hands again, appearing to exchange words and ignoring shouted questions from reporters on site.

The two men shook hands and smiled warmly as they greeted each other on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Russian state news agencies Tass and RIA Novosti reported Friday that President Vladimir Putin will use Aurus, a high-end Russian-made limousine, in Alaska. 

The agencies posted footage of a black limousine with Russian license plates and a small Russian flag attached to the hood driving around the tarmac.

Putin brought Aurus on foreign trips before, and even gifted one to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov will join the Russian leader during his “three-on-three” meeting with Trump, Rubio and Witkoff.

Lavrov and Ushakov took part in the first in-person Russia-US talks in February this year.

The Russian president hasn't been to the United States since a 2015 meeting at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on war crimes accusations for Putin in 2023. But the U.S. isn't a member of that global body, so officials are under no obligation to arrest him.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed, during a video address on Friday, his hope for a “strong position from the U.S.” ahead of talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

“Everyone wants an honest end to the war. Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to end the war, and we hope for a strong position from the U.S.,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader also stressed that Russia “is still killing people” despite the upcoming negotiations.

“The war continues and it continues precisely because there is no order, nor any signals from Moscow that it is preparing to end this war,” he added.

New Orleans mayor indicted over allegations of trying to hide relationship with bodyguard

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell was indicted Friday in what prosecutors called a yearslong scheme to hide a romantic relationship with her bodyguard, who is accused of being paid as if he was working even when they met alone in apartments and traveled to vineyards for wine tasting.

Cantrell faces charges of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, less than five months before she leaves office due to term limits. The first female mayor in New Orleans' 300-year history was elected twice but now becomes the city's first mayor to be charged while in office.

“Public corruption has crippled us for years and years,” Acting U.S. Attorney Michael Simpson said, referring to Louisiana's notorious history. “And this is extremely significant.”

Cantrell's bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, was already facing charges of wire fraud and making false statements. He has pleaded not guilty. A grand jury returned an 18-count indictment Friday that added Cantrell to the case.

They are accused of exchanging encrypted messages through WhatsApp to avoid detection and then deleting the conversations. The mayor and Vappie have said their relationship was strictly professional, but the indictment portrayed it as “personal and intimate.”




The City of New Orleans said in a statement that it was aware of the indictment and that the mayor's attorney is reviewing it. 

“Until his review is complete, the City will not comment further on this matter,” the statement said. 

Cantrell hasn't sent out a message on her official social media feed on X since July 15, when she said the city was experiencing historic declines in crime.

In a WhatsApp exchange, the indictment says, Vappie reminisced about accompanying Cantrell to Scotland in October 2021, saying that was “where it all started.”

Cantrell and Vappie used WhatsApp for more than 15,000 messages, including efforts to harass a citizen, delete evidence, make false statements to FBI agents, “and ultimately to commit perjury before a federal grand jury,” Simpson said.

They met in an apartment while Vappie claimed to be on duty, and she arranged for him to attend 14 trips, Simpson said. The trips, he added, were described by her as times “when they were truly alone.”

New Orleans taxpayers paid more than $70,000 for Vappie's travel, the prosecutor said. 

Authorities cited a September 2022 rendezvous on Martha's Vineyard, a trip Cantrell took instead of attending a conference in Miami. Vappie's travel to the island was covered by the city to attend a separate conference. “The times when we are truly (traveling) is what spoils me the most,” the mayor wrote to him that month.

Simpson said Cantrell lied in an affidavit that she activated a function on her phone that automatically deleted messages in 2021 when she really didn't activate that feature until December 2022, a month after the media began speculating on the pair's conduct.

When a private citizen took photos of them dining together and drinking wine, Cantrell filed a police report and sought a restraining order, Simpson said.

Vappie retired from the police department in 2024.

Cantrell and her remaining allies have said that she has been unfairly targeted as a Black woman and held to a different standard than male officials, her executive powers at City Hall sabotaged. Simpson, however, shook off claims that any of it played a role in the investigation.

“It's irrelevant that it's romance or that it's female,” he told reporters, adding that the allegations were “an incredible betrayal of people's confidence in their own government.”

Cantrell, a Democrat, has clashed with City Council members during a turbulent second term and survived a recall effort in 2022.

“This is a sad day for the people of New Orleans,” Monet Brignac, a spokesperson for City Council President JP Morrell, said as news of the indictment spread.

In 2014, former New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin was sentenced to 10 years in prison for bribery, money laundering, fraud and tax crimes. The charges stemmed from his two terms as mayor from 2002 to 2010. He was granted supervised release from prison in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

As she heads into her final months in office, Cantrell has alienated former confidants and supporters, and her civic profile has receded. Her early achievements were eclipsed by self-inflicted wounds and bitter feuds with a hostile city council, political observers say. The mayor's role has weakened following voter-approved changes to the city's charter meant to curb her authority.

Earlier this year, Cantrell said she has faced “very disrespectful, insulting, in some cases kind of unimaginable” treatment. Her husband, attorney Jason Cantrell, died in 2023.

President Donald Trump flew to Alaska on Friday to meet with President Vladimir Putin in the first US-Russia summit since 2021.

The last time the US-Russia participated in a summit was during former President Joe Biden's presidency and before Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.

President Trump said he would like to "see a ceasefire" between Russia and Ukraine and threatened "very severe consequences" for Russia if Putin does not agree to end the war after Friday's meeting.

Trump said he hopes to push for a second meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

President Donald Trump said Ukraine could possibly not agree to a deal with Russia because former President Joe Biden “handed out money like it was candy,” referring to the billions of dollars in military aid.

“I think we're pretty close to it. And look, Ukraine has agreed to it," Trump told Sean Hannity during a Friday appearance on “Hannity.” "Maybe they'll say no because Biden handed out money like it was candy. And Europe gave them a lot of money. You know, we gave $350 billion. Europe gave them much less, but still a lot. $100 billion.”

The United States has given Ukraine billions in military aid, weapons and training as Ukrainian forces continue to battle Russian's military.

Trump said he believed the deal was close to being agreed upon but that “so many things can happen.”

“But I think President Putin would like to solve the problem," he said. "And it was a problem that should have never happened.”

President Donald Trump
 is declining to reveal the main sticking points between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin on achieving a conclusive peace deal in Ukraine.

Trump met with Putin for almost three hours, saying they both agreed “on a lot of points.”

“There's one or two pretty significant items, but I think they can be reached,” Trump told Sean Hannity on “Hannity” from Anchorage, Alaska, where the summit meeting took place.

“Now it's really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done,” he added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin calls for increased engagement and economic cooperation with the United States

During the Alaska summit press conference, Putin was speaking to reporters when he called for both nations to build stronger economic relations, citing opportunities for growth for the Russian economy, in areas such as digital innovation and research and development.

Putin praised the renewed growth in bilateral trade
, citing an increase of 20%, and specifically referenced opportunities in the cement industry and the Arctic region.

He also relayed hope for greater political cooperation with the U.S. following years of fraught relations that escalated after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said President Donald Trump was right that there would have been no war in 2022 if he were in charge at the time.

Putin made his remarks during a joint press conference with Trump following their summit meeting in Alaska in an effort to end Russia's war in Ukraine.


The Russian leader said he had tried to convince the Biden administration about the situation in Ukraine in 2022 before noting that if Trump had occupied the White House at the time, there would have been no attack.

Trump has long blamed his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for not doing enough to prevent Russia's invasion of Ukraine.



Trump, Putin brief the media after meeting



President Donald Trump called the meeting with President Vladimir Putin “extremely productive” but added “there's no deal until there's a deal.”


“Many points were agreed to, there are just a few that are left,” Trump added. “We didn't get there but we have a very good chance of getting there.”

He said he was going to call up NATO allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the joint news conference with Putin and brief them about the inner workings of the meeting. Trump thanked Putin for  coming to Alaska, and Putin suggested their next meeting should be in Moscow.“That's an interesting one. I'll get a little heat on that one, but I, I could see it possibly happening.”

Neither president took questions from the media, and they did not provide any details of what they agreed to. Neither mentioned a ceasefire.

“We really made some great progress today. I've always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin.”





Top advisor to President Donald Trump,
 Dan Scavino, shared footage of the view Russian President Vladimir Putin had after joining Trump in the presidential limousine, known colloquially as "The Beast."

The footage shows The Beast passing by a row of military fighter jets that appeared to be F-35 Lightning II aircraft, which is primarily constructed by American defense contractor Lockheed Martin.

The meeting of the two leaders was also 
accompanied by a flyover from a B-2 stealth bomber flanked by four F-35 jets, which took place as he deplaned to join the summit at at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Republican Alaska gubernatorial candidate Bernadette Wilson celebrated President Donald Trump as the first president to appreciate Alaska's vast resources and how they will benefit the entire nation as he jets to the Last Frontier State to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

“President Trump is the first president in America's history who truly appreciates the richness of Alaska's resources and has the drive to unlock them. It is a refreshing change in direction from the Biden administration, which issued more sanctions against Alaska than the country of Iran,” Wilson said in comment provided to Fox News Digital ahead of Trump touching down in the state. 

“It is time for ‘American Oil on Alaskan Soil',” she said 

Trump is in Alaska on Friday for a highly-anticipated meeting with Putin to potentially negotiate a ceasefire agreement in the war in Ukraine that has raged since 2022. 

“Now, President Trump and President Putin convene in the state whose purchase from Russia was once referred to as ‘Seward's Folly' - a state that has the ability to fuel our great country through this century and beyond,” Wilson added. 

“If this is to be the Golden Age of America, then the history books will be filled with stories of American excellence powered by Alaskans' determination. I truly believe America's strength starts with Alaska, and as governor, I look forward to partnering with President Trump, who recognizes this potential.”

Wilson, a conservative Anchorage business owner, launched her gubernatorial campaign in May. 





Speculation swirled before President Donald Trump's meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over territory swaps, which could significantly alter the landscape of Ukraine as all three nations seek an end to the ongoing war ravaging that country.

Russia has claimed vast parts of Ukraine since 2014, when it annexed Crimea.

As of Friday, Russia has taken parts of Ukraine, including portions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the east. Both sides have sustained significant losses, but Moscow has recently made territorial gains.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected ceding any territory to Russia as part of a peace plan.

"Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier," Zelenskyy said on social media last week after Trump announced Friday's meeting.

In his announcement, Trump said "there'll be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both" Russia and Ukraine.

Meanwhile, Zelenskyy has called for an unconditional ceasefire to end the conflict.





Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, took to social media to slam President Donald Trump's "priorities" amid his summit taking place in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Martin posted a photo of Trump's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside an image of Putin riding in the president's limo with a smile on his face sitting next to Trump.

"Compare this to how Trump and Vance treated Zelensky in the Oval Office," the post with the photos was captioned. "This says everything about Trump's priorities."


Martin was seeking to juxtapose the two moments, the first from earlier this year in February when Zelenskyy came to the White House and the second from today's summit in Alaska. The infamous February meeting became headline news when the Ukrainian president got into a heated back-and-forth with Trump and others on national television from the Oval Office.

Friday's summit marks the first time the leaders from Russia and the United States have met in-person since the war in Ukraine began roughly three-and-a-half years ago.

As President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss a possible end to the war in Ukraine, two islands in the Bering Strait are a reminder of the connections between the United States and Moscow.

The Diomede Islands are separated by 2.5 miles of water and ice, though they are about 21 hours apart. Little Diomede, the smaller of the two, is part of the U.S.

Big Diomede is Russian. The island is uninhabited, except for a Russian border guard station, according to the BBC.


Little Diomede is home to around 80 residents who live in homes perched on the western shore, the news outlet reported.

In the winter, it's possible to walk across the sea from one island to the other.

In 1948, at the onset of the Cold War, the Soviet Union relocated Big Diomede's Indigenous residents to the Russian mainland, mostly in Siberia. Both the U.S. and the Soviet Union sealed the border, creating a boundary known as the "Ice Curtain".

Most Little Diomede residents have relatives in Russia who were relocated from Big Diomede.





As President Donald Trump greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin on the tarmac at Elmendorf Air Force Base, a B-2 stealth bomber flew overhead, flanked by four F-35 jets.


The dramatic arrival underscored the high-stakes nature of the leaders' Alaska summit, their first face-to-face meeting since Trump returned to office. Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a strategic U.S. military installation near Anchorage, was chosen for its security, remote location, and symbolic positioning between Russia and the continental United States.

U.S. onlookers described the moment as an “insane flex” — especially given the B-2 bomber's recent combat use. Just two months earlier, the stealth aircraft had delivered bunker-buster bombs on Iranian nuclear facilities during coordinated U.S. and Israeli strikes.“Absolutely incredible,” wrote one X user.

Another remarked, “Putin now knows what will be greeting him if he were to ever cross that line that should never be crossed.”


After the greeting, Putin entered “The Beast” with Trump. The presidential armored limousine passed rows of parked American fighter jets before heading to the summit site on base. Talks began around 3:30 p.m. ET, focusing on ending the war in Ukraine.

The base where President Donald Trump is meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday is the largest military installation in Alaska.

Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a remote base located just outside Anchorage, was created in 2010 as part of the merger of the Air Force's Elmendorf base and the U.S. Army's Fort Richardson. It covers more than 85,000 acres.

Key units based there include the 3rd Wing and the 673rd Air Base Wing for the Air Force, and the Army's 11th Airborne Division.

The base played a crucial role during the Cold War as it monitored the Soviet Union.

“Following World War II
, Elmendorf Field assumed an increasing role in defense of North America as the uncertain wartime relations between the United States and the Soviet Union deteriorated into the Cold War,” the joint base's website states.

The base boasts more than 32,000 people and accounts for approximately 10% of the local population, according to the U.S. military.

President Donald Trump said he may “have to start liking” Hillary Clinton again after she said she would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize if he is able to secure a deal between Russia and Ukraine.

Bret Baier interviewed Trump aboard Air Force One when he noted that Clinton said she would nominate Trump if he got the deal done and didn't capitulate to Russian President Vladimir Putin.


“Well, that was very nice,” Trump said. “I may have to start liking her again.”

Clinton appeared on the "Raging Moderates" podcast, when she said she would nominate Trump for the award if he could convince Putin to end his war against Ukraine and give back all the territory his forces took during the conflict.

"You know, look, if we could pull that off, if President Trump were the architect of that, I'd nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize," she said during the interview.





President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin greeted each other Friday ahead of their much-anticipated meeting.

The pair met on the tarmac at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska where they shook hands. The meeting between the pair is the first since Trump began his second term in office.

Russian Foreign Minister
 Sergey Lavrov was seen wearing a “CCCP” shirt upon arriving in Alaska on Friday.

Lavrov is part of the Russian delegation set to meet with President Trump and other U.S. leaders. The phrase “CCCP” is the Russian acronym for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).

On Telegram, Russian fashion bloggers identified the $120 sweatshirt as the work of Selsovet, a Chelyabinsk-based brand that specializes in “Soviet heritage” clothing, The Guardian reported.

“We never make predictions ahead of time,” Lavrov said. "We have solid arguments, we have our own clear and comprehensible position. We will present it here." 





Russian President Vladimir Putin stopped at a Russian memorial honoring Soviet-era cooperation with American forces during Word War II, ahead of his meeting in Alaska with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Putin also made other stops enroute to his meeting with Trump, including to a fish oil processing plant and a sports complex in Russia, according to the Moscow Times.

Putin and Trump are slated to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage starting at 11 a.m. Alaska Time, or 3 p.m. Eastern.

Russian troops have made gains inside Ukraine in recent days ahead of Friday's summit meeting in Alaska between U.S. and Russian leaders.

Russian forces recently breached Ukrainian lines in the country's industrial heartland of Donetsk. Despite the advance, analyst said that the breaches amounted to a limited success for Russia.

On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Putin
 wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that Kyiv still controls as part of a ceasefire deal.

Ukraine has rejected such a deal.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia continues to launch airstrikes against Ukraine despite Friday's upcoming meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump.


“On the day of negotiations, the Russians are killing as well. And that speaks volumes," Zelenskyy wrote on X in a post accompanied with a video message. "Recently, weʼve discussed with the U.S. and Europeans what can truly work. Everyone needs a just end to the war.”

In the video, the Ukrainian leader said security guarantees are needed to ensure a lasting peace on all sides of the conflict, which has resulted in losses for Ukraine and Russian forces.


“Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America," Zelenskyy said. "Everything will depend on this – the Russians factor in American strength. Make no mistake – strength.”

Not for the first time European leaders are waiting to see what comes from the latest discussion between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump as the leaders convene in Alaska on Friday.

“[There's] absolute distrust in any even the slightest idea that Putin wants peace, because he keeps On annihilating Ukraine,” Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene told Fox News Digital during her trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with Pentagon officials this week.


“Even now, when your president has clearly stated that he wants this war to end, and basically provides an opportunity for Putin to talk, still every single day and night, until those talks, he keeps bombing civilians,” she added. “He keeps annihilating Ukrainian land.”

Trump has yet to detail how he will respond should his meeting with Putin prove fruitless in advancing a path forward for a ceasefire, though he said on Wednesday there would be “very severe consequences.”

One day before his highly anticipated meeting with President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested he was open to reaching a nuclear deal with the United States.

Putin on Thursday praised the United States
 in televised remarks for making "sincere efforts" to end the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine, according to Reuters.

The Russian leader said the United States was "making, in [his] opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict."

Putin
 also mentioned the possibility of "agreements in the area of control over strategic offensive weapons."

Dmitry Peskov, a spokesperson for the Russian government, cautioned against making any predictions about the forthcoming summit, where the two countries' leaders are set to meet for the first time since 2021.

President Donald Trump has renewed calls for a territorial land swap between Russia and Ukraine — a move that could give Moscow control of resource-rich regions in the south and east. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected
 ceding any occupied territory.

Russia currently holds about one-fifth of Ukraine, including parts of Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Kherson, and Crimea.

David Salvo of the German Marshall Fund told Fox News Digital these areas contain “vast quantities of critical minerals and other key economic assets… like lithium, coal, and gas.”

The Institute for the Study of War warned that Russia could exploit rare-earth deposits and sell them to China, undermining a U.S.–Ukraine mineral deal signed in April. Salvo added that occupation of the Black Sea coast restricts Ukrainian exports and grants Moscow offshore gas reserves. Ukraine's agriculture sector, once 11% of GDP, has suffered $80 billion in losses since Russia's invasion.

The European Union made their position on President Donald Trump's "land swapping" push clear following a ministerial powwow on Monday, and told Fox News Digital, there should be no "concessions" until Russia agrees to stop its war.

"Russia has not agreed to a full and unconditional ceasefire, we should not even discuss any concessions," EU policy chief Kaja Kallas told Fox News Digital in a written statement. "It has never worked in the past with Russia, and will not work with Putin today.

"The sequencing of the steps is important," she added. "First an unconditional ceasefire with a strong monitoring system and ironclad security guarantees."

Trump has said he does not intend to discuss any deals or concessions during his meeting with Putin, despite concerns that arose this week following his comments regarding Ukrainian territory.

A senior ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin warned earlier this week that several countries would make “titanic efforts” to disrupt the forthcoming summit Friday between Putin and President Donald Trump in Alaska.

The warning came from Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's investment envoy, who said critics could try to sabotage the talks through diplomatic maneuvers or media provocations.

"Undoubtedly, a number of countries interested in continuing the conflict will make titanic efforts to disrupt the planned meeting between President Putin and President Trump," Dmitriev, wrote on Telegram on Saturday, referencing the Kremlin's ongoing war in Ukraine.

The meeting, at this stage, remains on schedule and is set to take place as part of a bilateral program at 3 p.m. ET.

Dmitriev, who is known for his key behind-the-scenes role in diplomacy, has often acted as an informal link between Moscow and Washington.

Speculation over the upcoming meeting with President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin
 has run rampant over the last week with some expressing concern the Alaska-based powwow could be more games by the Kremlin, while others have begun to draw comparisons to the 1985 breakthrough meeting with President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

While some comparisons can be drawn between the upcoming summit and the historic meeting in Geneva – which then led to the pair sitting down together two more times before the Cold War was finally brought to an end – there are "glaring" differences, warned experts. 


Putin and Gorbachev are vastly different statesmen, and so far Putin has shown no interest in ending his war ambitions, let alone altering the course he has set at home when it comes to the economy and government transparency, experts say. 

"They need to meet. We need to see the results of the meeting," Dan Hoffman, former CIA Moscow station chief, told Fox News Digital.

President Donald Trump
 today will hold a historic summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage, Alaska — the first U.S.-Russia meeting on American soil since June 2021. 

Trump calls it a “feel-out meeting,” aimed at gauging whether a ceasefire in Ukraine is possible early on. He acknowledged the talks carry risk, placing the odds of failure at 25%, but floated the idea of a follow-up summit involving Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy if things go well. 

Zelenskyy continues to insist any peace deal must include Ukraine. 

Meanwhile, Putin praised Trump's “sincere” and “energetic” efforts toward peace, suggesting the talks could touch on broader topics like economics and arms-control cooperation.

President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet in person on Friday for the first time in six years when they get together in Anchorage, Alaska. 

Here is a history of Trump's high-stakes interactions with Putin while being President of the United States: 

2015 – Early mutual admiration between Putin and Trump 

Mutual admiration was publicly brewing between Putin and Trump in late 2015 when Trump was running for his first term in office. 

In December that year, Putin described Trump as being the "absolute leader in the presidential race" and a "very outstanding person, talented, without any doubt." 


Trump later told supporters at a rally in Ohio that "It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond."

President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Alaska Friday, in what marks Putin's first trip to the U.S. in a decade.


Alaska was seen as a good in-between place for travel from Moscow and Washington, D.C., though it is notable that Putin opted to meet on U.S. soil rather than a neutral zone like Geneva, which is where Reagan and Gorbachev had their first meeting.

"They probably avoided Europe, because if they included Europe, then Europe would have demanded that they're actually at the table," Dan Hoffman, former CIA Moscow Station Chief, told Fox News Digital. "Probably your two choices were go to Russia
 — which Trump would never do — or invite him here.

"It also exposes the challenge that you can't solve this without Ukraine and without Europe," he added.

Trump has said he plans to get Russian and Ukrainian leadership in a room together next

Japanese town conducts a drill after recent bear attacks across the country.

A hiker in Japan was found dead on Friday after a brown bear reportedly attacked and dragged him into the bushes.

The man — believed to be in his 20s — was walking ahead of his friend along a Mount Rausu trail in Hokkaido, Japan, on Thursday when he was attacked by a brown bear, local outlet The Asahi Shimbun reported, citing police.

The victim shouted his friend's name, who after rushing to catch up, witnessed the man trying to fight off the brown bear, which then dragged him into the bushes, according to The Asahi Shimbun.

Six Senate Democrats on Friday released an open letter asking President Donald Trump to reconsider his decision to allow tech giants Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell AI semiconductor chips to China in exchange for 15% of revenue from the sales.

The letter — signed by Senators Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Christopher Coons, D-Del.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. — was in response to an Aug. 11 announcement by Trump that Nvidia and AMD would pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses.

"Our national security and military readiness relies upon American innovators inventing and producing the best technology in the world, and in maintaining that qualitative advantage in sensitive domains. The United States has historically been successful in maintaining and building that advantage because of, in part, our ability to deny adversaries access to those technologies," the letter states.

"The willingness displayed in this arrangement to 'negotiate' away America's competitive edge that is key to our national security in exchange for what is, in effect, a commission on a sale of AI-enabling technology to our main global competitor, is cause for serious alarm," the letter continues.

Senators also warned that selling advanced AI chips — specifically Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips — to China could help strengthen its military systems, a claim that Nvidia denies.

In a statement to CNBC, a Nvidia spokesperson said: "The H20 would not enhance anyone's military capabilities, but would have helped America attract the support of developers worldwide and win the AI race. Banning the H20 cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, without any benefit."

The letter from Senate Democrats also requests a detailed response from the administration by Friday, Aug. 22, regarding the current deal involving Nvidia and AMD, as well as any similar arrangements being made with other companies.

"We again urge your administration to quickly reverse course and abandon this reckless plan to trade away U.S. technology leadership," the letter states.

A request for comment from the White House and AMD was not immediately returned.

Despite Trump allowing chip sales to resume, it has already become clear that China isn't welcoming Nvidia back with open arms, instead urging tech companies to avoid buying U.S. companies' chips, according to a Bloomberg report.

"We're hearing that this is a hard mandate, and that [authorities are actually] stopping additional orders of H20s for some companies," Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst covering China semiconductors at Bernstein, told CNBC.

In a separate report, The Information said regulators in China have ordered major tech companies, including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, to suspend Nvidia chip purchases until a national security review is complete.

Activist Commentary: Engine Capital is an experienced activist investor led by Managing Partner Arnaud Ajdler. He is a former partner and senior managing director at Crescendo Partners. Engine's history is to send letters and/or nominate directors but settle rather quickly.

On Aug. 11, Engine sent a letter calling on Avantor's board to focus on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase stock. Engine noted that the company can alternatively consider a sale.

Avantor is a market leading distributor of life science tools and products for the life sciences and advanced technology industries. The company is comprised of two segments: laboratory solutions (LSS) (67% of revenue) and bioscience production (BPS) (33% of revenue). LSS is one of the three top life sciences distributors in the world (Thermo Fisher and Merck KGaA being the other two). 

BPS is a supplier of high-purity materials and is the leading supplier of medical-grade silicones. Despite being one of the few scaled global life science tool distribution platforms, the company has vastly underperformed. At its 2021 investor day, management projected earnings per share above $2 for 2025; and at its 2023 investor day, management targeted an EBITDA margin exceeding 20%. Now in 2025, these currently stand at 96 cents per share and 11.8%, respectively. Consequently, Avantor's share price has declined 53.96%, 59.69%, and 43.41% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, as of Engine's announcement Monday.

Engine believes that Avantor's significant underperformance is a consequence of self-inflicted mistakes rooted in a flawed leadership team and framework. A complex matrix organizational structure and resultant lack of accountability have led to mass leadership turnover, including Avantor's CEO, CFO and both segment leaders within the past three years, contributing to a dysfunctional decision-making process and inefficient employee structure. 

The biggest casualty of this rocky management team is LSS, which has lost significant profitability and market share to its peers. Specifically, poor capital allocation decisions have destroyed significant value. In 2020 and 2021, Avantor spent a total of $3.8 billion to acquire Ritter, Masterflex and RIM Bio – companies that were notably purchased during the peak of the pandemic when life sciences businesses were trading at exceptionally high multiples. Applying Avantor's next 12 months 10x multiple to the 28x average acquisition price implies over $2.4 billion in lost value on these acquisitions, contributing to the company's high leverage. 

On top of that, despite LSS's ongoing underperformance and the need for strong leadership, from June 2024 to April 2025, LSS was left without a leader due to a non-compete lawsuit involving the hiring of its new segment leader, underscoring the operational dysfunction that has been taking place at the company. 

But perhaps the nail in the coffin for this management team and board is that despite this cascading set of errors and the internal knowledge of these forecasted losses, they were still given a way out. In 2023, the company was approached by Ingersoll Rand to be acquired at an estimated $25-$28 per share, a 20%-35% premium of the share price at the time, yet the board inexplicably rebuffed this approach. Today, Avantor trades at just under $13 per share. 

Enter Engine, who has announced an approximately 3% position in Avantor and is urging the board to focus the organization on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase its own stock. 

Engine points out that Avantor's reported $6.8 billion in revenue was stretched across 6 million stock keeping units, while Thermo's peer segment achieves similar revenue with less than half the SKUs, indicating a large opportunity, specifically within LSS, to optimize the portfolio by concentrating purchases to improve inventory turns, rebates and margins. 

Divesting non-core assets is another way to optimize the portfolio. For BPS, certain facilities operate in periods of extended downtime, limiting growth. For LSS, subscale facilities in smaller geographies may be more valuable to a competitor, and the same goes for some of the assets purchased under Avantor's aforementioned acquisition spree. 

On the cost discipline side, Avantor's history of poor M&A and its low valuation should limit its accretive M&A opportunities, and while the company is on the path to reduce leverage below 3x, the market remains concerned that once this is achieved, they will simply resume this costly M&A strategy. Engine argues that free cash flow should instead be allocated evenly to share repurchases and debt reduction. 

Additionally, executive compensation is also a concern. In 2024, despite organic revenue declining by 2% and a 7% share price decline, the board awarded CEO Michael Stubblefield 110% of his target annual bonus, underscoring the need to align these management incentives with shareholder value creation. 

Engine believes that all of these changes would be best implemented with a comprehensive board refreshment. Adding directors with executive leadership, capital allocation, and distribution expertise to replace board members that have overseen years of value destruction, likely targeting chairman Jonathan Peacock specifically, should signal to the market the start of a new chapter. Engine believes that if these changes are properly implemented that Avantor shares would be worth between $22 and $26 per share by the end of 2027. 

As a secondary option, Engine suggests that if a standalone path does not appear viable then the board should consider selling the entire company or splitting LSS and BPS into separate entities. 

When Avantor acquired VWR, which is now the core of the LSS business, it was valued at about 12x EBITDA, or $6.5 billion, and BPS peers trade at a median of 17x EBITDA. Neither of these businesses' valuations correspond to what Avantor trades at, roughly 8x EBITDA, and it's possible that a strategic path could become the best way to unlock this value on a risk-adjusted basis. If this were to become the case, there is likely to be both private and strategic interest. New Mountain Capital previously owned Avantor prior to its IPO and still maintains an approximately 2% position. Strategics, like Ingersoll, would likely be interested as well, especially at a significant discount to what they once offered. Engine believes that Avantor could sell between $17 to $19 per share. 

Overall, Engine makes not only a compelling case that major change is needed at Avantor, but also a clear multipath plan forward. While some of these changes are already underway: a new CEO is set to start next week and management announced a $400 million cost-cutting initiative, the sheer volume of change required here is unlikely to occur by Engine's 2027 estimate. 

Engine's plan includes strengthening execution, instilling a culture of cost discipline, improving capital allocation, evaluating the company's portfolio, aligning executive compensation to shareholder value creation and refreshing the board. Engine's plan is the right one, but this is a company whose top line and operating margins have been in decline since 2022 and refreshing a board, instilling a new culture, reversing declining revenue and operating margins and evaluating and executing asset sales, many of which cannot be done simultaneously, is something that will likely take much longer than two years, particularly with the director nomination window not opening until Jan. 8. Moreover, the kind of change that Engine calls for here is generally not the kind of change that comes from an amicable settlement.

In this article

In 2014, Apple and Samsung were duking it out to rule the U.S. smartphone market. Samsung was selling devices with large screens, and iPhone fans were demanding a response.

It took Apple some time, but the company finally released the iPhone 6, breaking with previous iterations and giving consumers a large-screen option. The iPhone won.

But more than a decade later, recent smartphone sales and shipment figures signal that the Apple-Samsung fight has returned. And once again, it's all about the screen.

In the second quarter, shipments from Samsung surged in the U.S., with its market share rising from 23% to 31% from the prior period, according to data from Canalys. Apple's market share during the quarter declined to 49% from 56%.

Apple remains on top of the U.S. smartphone market, taking the majority of new smartphone sales in the U.S. It's often in second place around the world, but the recent slips points to turbulence for Apple for the first time in well over a decade.

That's one reason investors have sent Apple shares down 7.5% this year, underperforming all of the U.S. megacap tech companies other than Tesla. Samsung's stock, meanwhile, is up about 35% in 2025.

In July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung's catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge. 

The devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests.

One user posted a livestream that showed him bending the Z Fold 7 over 200,000 times in a row. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube.

In the past month, Samsung's premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company.

The market share numbers aren't just the result of user preferences. Much of the shift in shipment figures in the June quarter, analysts said, can be attributed to tariffs, which are causing "disruption" in the industry as smartphone makers use different strategies to minimize the impact on their business.

But Samsung's gains also reflect the company's ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung's second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone.

Samsung's Galaxy and Z phone lineup "stretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices," said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. "There is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot."

The iPhone has pretty much looked the same since 2017 — a rectangular piece of glass with a touchscreen on the front, and a few cameras on the back. These days, the company offers a series of four slates ranging from $829 to $1,599. Samsung and others are starting to go beyond the so-called candy bar shape and experimenting with new form factors.

Apple is expected to start doing the same — beginning with a potential launch next month of a slimmer iPhone that will compete with Samsung's Galaxy Edge.

"Apple is clearly betting that its 5.5mm Air model is going to lift its fortunes as testing suggests a strong desire for the new form factor," wrote Loop Capital managing director John Donovan in May.

JPMorgan Chase analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a report last month that Apple may release a folding phone next year to compete with Samsung's Z Fold.

"Investor focus has already turned to the 2026 fall launches with Apple expected to launch its first foldable iPhone as part of the iPhone 18 lineup in September 2026," Chatterjee wrote.

Trying new form factors offers Apple the opportunity to sell devices at higher prices, according to Bjorhovde.

Apple's most expensive phone, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, currently starts at $1,199 for 256GB of storage and can go up to $1,599 for a version with 1TB of storage. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which was announced last week, starts at $1,999 for the 256GB version and tops out at $2,419 for the 1TB version.

Chatterjee said he thinks Apple's version of a folding phone could start at $1,999. Apple declined to comment.

Samsung's first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. The initial launch was delayed after reviewers — including CNBC — discovered that the early devices would break along their folding crease.

But Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability.

"There really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device," said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America.

The South Korean company doesn't provide sales numbers, but Blackard said the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the latest version, had 25% more preorders than any previous Samsung folding phone and that sales are outpacing the device's predecessor by nearly 50%.

"Samsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation," said Bjorhovde. "Try to be ahead, show that something is different, and there's a certain halo effect from that."

According to Counterpoint Research, a firm that estimates smartphone sales to customers, Samsung's sell-through increased 16% during the June quarter, thanks to demand for high-end devices, including a "slight boost" from the slim S25 Edge.

The rise of artificial intelligence is also heralding new form factors for consumer electronics that could one day replace the iPhone.

OpenAI in May acquired the startup of former Apple design guru Jony Ive for $6.5 billion. The AI startup plans to develop the next generation of hardware, and other AI startups have released pins, pendants and glasses that rely on users' voice to control the devices.

Samsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google's Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI's ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can't get with Siri and Apple Intelligence.

Blackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google's circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they'd like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said.

On a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information.

"It's much more productive being able to go back and forth," Blackard said.

Investors have worried that Apple's AI delays, including its next-generation Siri that's now scheduled to come out next year, could start hurting sales. But many analysts say that Apple's brand loyalty and lock-in will give it a period of years before iPhone customers start defecting for competitors.

Chatterjee told CNBC that Apple's strategy with devices is to wait until a technology is ready for the mainstream before embracing it. That time may be now for foldable devices.

Apple has "never been about trying to be the first to market," Chatterjee said. "It's about being watchful, seeing a technology mature, knowing that there are no big roadblocks to that technology adoption, and then moving ahead."

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he did not immediately need to consider retaliatory tariffs on countries such as China for buying Russian oil but might have to "in two or three weeks."

Trump has threatened sanctions on Moscow and secondary sanctions on countries that buy its oil if no moves are made to end the war in Ukraine. China and India are the top two buyers of Russian oil.

The president last week imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing its continued imports of Russian oil.

However, Trump has not taken similar action against China.

He was asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity if he was now considering such action against Beijing after he and Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to produce an agreement to resolve or pause Moscow's war in Ukraine.

"Well, because of what happened today, I think I don't have to think about that," Trump said after his summit with Putin in Alaska.

"Now, I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don't have to think about that right now. I think, you know, the meeting went very well."

Chinese President Xi Jinping's slowing economy will suffer if Trump follows through on a promise to ramp up Russia-related sanctions and tariffs.

Xi and Trump are working on a trade deal that could lower tensions - and import taxes - between the world's two biggest economies. But China could be the biggest remaining target, outside of Russia, if Trump ramps up punitive measures.

The high-stakes summit on Friday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin did not result in a breakthrough, even as Trump described it as "productive," while Putin proposed another meeting in Moscow.

The White House had played down the talks — initially seen as an attempt at securing a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine — with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt calling the summit, "a listening exercise for the president." 

Following the Friday meeting Trump said, "There's no deal until there's a deal."

Ukraine was not part of the discussions, stoking concerns that a potential deal could have compromised the country's sovereignty. "Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America … A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side," President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X prior to the summit.

This was Putin's first visit to the U.S. in about a decade, with the Russian president stressing that it was a "hard time" for bilateral relations. The meeting was held in Alaska, which was once Russian territory.

"There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway," Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin. The leaders did not take any questions from the press.

Putin called the talks a "starting point," both for the resolution of the conflict with Kyiv as well as for improving relations with Washington, which he said had "fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War." 

Trump said Putin's observations were "profound," and added that he would talk to NATO and Zelenskyy to update them about the discussions with Russia. "It's ultimately up to them," he said.

"Many points were agreed to. There are just a very few that are left. Some are not that significant. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there," Trump said, without elaborating.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, multiple rounds of peace negotiations have taken place, but there has not been a breakthrough on ending hostilities.

In an interview with Fox News following the Friday summit, Trump asked Zelenskyy to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. "Gotta make a deal. Yeah. Look, Russia is a very big power, and they're not. They're great soldiers," he said.

Russian media outlets were upbeat Friday ahead of Putin's meeting with Trump, with the summit being seen as a win for Moscow. Commentary across Russian state news sites characterized the talks as a positive for Russia. The mood in Ukraine was somber amid apprehensions of the country losing some territory as part of a Trump-brokered deal.

Crypto markets are already showing early signs of momentum as Bitcoin and Ethereum hover near all-time highs. With altcoin season brewing beneath the surface, traders are aggressively seeking low-entry opportunities with high upside before prices break out. While blue-chip assets like BTC and ETH are seen as safe holds, real gains often come from altcoins with asymmetric return potential — especially during the early stages of a bull cycle.

A growing number of early adopters are now positioning across both large-cap infrastructure tokens and high-velocity presale gems like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which are beginning to attract serious attention from whales and analysts alike.


Solana has reclaimed the $200 mark and remains one of the most watched altcoins heading into Q4 2025. Its lightning-fast transaction speeds, low fees, and increasing institutional interest for staking rewards continue to fuel bullish sentiment.

SOL's expanding DeFi and NFT ecosystem gives it long-term relevance. With technicals pointing to a breakout range between $203 and $208, many traders are targeting a move toward $250 as market conditions improve. The upside from current levels could still deliver a 2x–4x, but longer-term forecasts place Solana in the $500–$600 range.

Cardano is staging a quiet comeback. Currently hovering around the $0.99–$1.01 range, ADA has jumped over 30% in the last month, driven by on-chain growth, Hydra upgrades, and strategic whale buys. The $1.08 target remains realistic in the short term, but if bullish pressure sustains, ADA could revisit its previous highs and even challenge the $3–$5 range.

Institutional accumulation following Grayscale inclusion signals confidence in its fundamentals. ADA's steady growth makes it one of the safer altcoins with long-term 5x–10x potential in a parabolic market phase.

Market forecasts project 40x ROI before late-cycle expansion and MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the high-conviction presale play of 2025. The project is gaining traction with both retail buyers and larger presale allocators.

Backed by staking incentives and smart wallet analytics, MAGACOIN FINANCE brings more than meme coin hype — it brings infrastructure, momentum, and narrative power. Presale access is still open, but token pricing is expected to rise sharply as listings approach and rotation from DOGE, ADA, and SOL intensifies.


Altcoin markets are heating up as capital rotates from large caps into smaller, faster-moving plays. Solana and Cardano remain key portfolio anchors, but presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE are increasingly seen as rare early-stage opportunities that could multiply capital during the next parabolic phase.

What is Bitcoin Standard Treasury (BSTR) planning with its merger with Cantor Equity Partners?

BSTR is gearing up for a significant change in the corporate finance domain through its merger with Cantor Equity Partners, set to pave the way for a Nasdaq listing. The aim here is to enhance BSTR's Bitcoin reserves, upping their total from 30,021 BTC to over 50,000 BTC. This positions BSTR as a major player in corporate treasury management. Adam Back, the CEO, has expressed the ambition to establish a global standard for sovereign-grade Bitcoin treasury solutions. He emphasizes Bitcoin as a fundamental asset for corporate treasuries.

Is this merger limited to just Bitcoin accumulation?

The merger isn't merely about hoarding Bitcoin. It reflects a broader realization among corporations about Bitcoin's viability as a long-term asset and a hedge against inflation. BSTR intends to harness capital markets to enable large-scale accumulation and utility for state and corporate treasuries. This underscores a growing trend of accepting Bitcoin in corporate finance, as businesses turn towards integrating digital assets into their treasury management approaches.

What does the merger mean for regulatory compliance for crypto firms?

The merger between Bitcoin Standard Treasury and Cantor Equity Partners is anticipated to provide clarity on regulatory compliance for crypto businesses, particularly those in Asia. With BSTR's upcoming public offering, it will fall under strict U.S. regulations, which may serve as a compliance example for other crypto firms worldwide. This public listing is likely to boost transparency and institutional credibility, pushing Asian crypto businesses to embrace higher compliance standards to draw in investments.

What does the evolving U.S. regulatory landscape indicate?

According to PwC's 2025 Global Crypto Regulation Report, the U.S. regulatory environment is evolving towards clearer guidelines for digital asset securities and stablecoins. To meet Nasdaq listing standards, BSTR will likely need to conform to these regulations, establishing a precedent that could be followed by Asian firms, especially those eyeing cross-border affiliations. This could hasten the pace of regulatory alignment and sophistication within Asian crypto markets, ultimately creating a more stable atmosphere for these businesses.

What methods can SMEs implement to handle Bitcoin's price fluctuations?

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) can employ a variety of innovative strategies to effectively manage Bitcoin's volatility. These include:

Diversifying Crypto Holdings: SMEs might consider mixing volatile assets like Bitcoin with stable options such as stablecoins to lessen exposure to sudden price shifts and stabilize their treasury's overall value.

Regular Bitcoin Purchases: By consistently acquiring Bitcoin at regular intervals, regardless of its price, SMEs can lessen the risks of market timing and smooth out the average cost over time.

Limiting Crypto Exposure: It may be wise to restrict the proportion of treasury funds allocated to cryptocurrencies, preserving liquidity and financial stability.

Yield Generation in Crypto: SMEs could stake or lend their crypto assets on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to generate returns, balancing risk and potential earnings.

Risk Management Tools: SMEs can utilize regulated derivatives platforms for hedging Bitcoin positions and implement smart contracts for automated risk management.

Regulatory Awareness: Keeping abreast of changing regulations, such as the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), is vital for SMEs. Investing in legal knowledge could mitigate operational risks and ensure smooth treasury operations.

These approaches empower SMEs to navigate Bitcoin's volatility while harnessing its potential as a treasury asset.

Will Bitcoin payroll solutions become commonplace in Europe?

The ascent of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset is likely to catalyze a new wave of crypto payroll solutions in Europe. As institutional adoption of Bitcoin grows, so does the need for innovative compensation methods, particularly among tech-savvy workers and freelancers. Companies are beginning to recognize the advantages of offering crypto compensation, which aligns with the needs of a contemporary workforce.

What challenges might impede the rollout of crypto payroll solutions?

However, the deployment of crypto payroll solutions may encounter regulatory hurdles, including compliance with anti-money laundering and tax laws. Despite these challenges, the momentum is building, fueled by workers seeking alternatives to traditional payment systems. The emergence of user-friendly crypto wallets and platforms tailored for SMEs and freelancers also supports this trend.

As Bitcoin continues to solidify its status as a treasury asset, the adoption of crypto payroll solutions could become mainstream in Europe, fundamentally changing how companies approach employee compensation.

What key insights can startups take from BSTR's approach to Bitcoin?

Startups stand to learn a great deal from Bitcoin Standard Treasury's method of incorporating Bitcoin into corporate finance. Here are some crucial takeaways:

Set Clear Goals: Startups are advised to delineate specific objectives for Bitcoin integration, be it for diversification or inflation protection, and communicate these clearly to stakeholders.

Establish Disciplined Policies: The creation of formal policies regarding limits on allocations, rebalancing, and compliance reporting is essential for maintaining control over Bitcoin holdings.

Implement Risk Mitigation Strategies: Given Bitcoin's volatility, startups should explore methods such as dollar-cost averaging and risk management tools to stabilize treasury operations.

Unlock Liquidity from Bitcoin: Startups can utilize Bitcoin as collateral for loans, providing liquidity without selling the asset and allowing them to maintain exposure to Bitcoin's potential gains.

View Bitcoin as a Reserve Asset: Instead of treating Bitcoin merely as a speculative asset, startups can benefit from holding it as a means to preserve purchasing power, especially in inflationary times.

Ensure Execution and Transparency: Effective integration requires disciplined execution, choosing trustworthy custodians, and upholding transparent accounting practices.

By embracing a strategic, disciplined, and transparent framework for Bitcoin integration, startups can elevate Bitcoin to a core treasury asset rather than a speculative side project, ultimately bolstering their financial resilience.

Crypto exchange Gemini filed an updated registration statement for its initial public offering effort, sharing a few more details in its push to become a publicly traded firm. 

Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Cantor acting as lead bookrunners on the IPO, Gemini said in a press release Friday.

Evercore ISI, Mizuho, Truist Securities, Cohen & Company Capital Markets, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Needham & Company and Rosenblatt are also acting as bookrunners, the company said. Academy Securities and AmeriVet Securities are acting as co-managers.

The S-1 published on Friday follows a confidential filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission back in June, and confirms "Gemini Space Station," co-founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, intends to sell an undisclosed number of Class A shares.

Gemini's filing indicated that it had generated total revenue of $142.2 million in 2024, up from $98.1 million the prior year. For the six months ending on June 30, 2025, the total revenue was $68.6 million, down from $74.3 million in the first six months of 2024. 

Its net loss in 2024 stood at $158.6 million, compared to $319.7 million in 2023. That figure stood at $282.5 million for the first six months of 2025. 

Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for 2024 stood at a loss of $13.2 million, and a loss of $113.5 million for the first half of 2025. 

Like other crypto firms, Gemini pointed to standard risks in the risk portion of the filing, including the general nature of blockchain networks and how banks and regulators view the industry. 

"Key factors influencing the further development of blockchain networks and digital assets include the global adoption of digital assets and blockchain technology; regulatory and quasi-government restrictions on access to and operation of blockchain networks; and the maintenance of open source protocols that support blockchain networks," the filing said. 

Gemini is only the latest crypto company to try and go public this year, following Circle (CRCL), eToro (ETOR) and CoinDesk parent company Bullish (BLSH). BitGo has filed for paperwork to go public as well. 

Gemini plans to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GEMI.

Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, said earlier this week the current backdrop represents the “best investment environment ever,” citing unusually favorable dynamics in both equity and bond markets.

Speaking on CNBC, Rieder described “extraordinary” technical conditions in equities, with trillions of dollars still parked in money market funds and robust corporate buybacks shrinking available supply. While valuations for the market's largest technology names remain elevated, he noted that earnings growth outside Tesla helped justify the multiples. “MAG-7 year-on-year growth is like 54%,” he said, adding that the pace makes the sector difficult to ignore.

On the bond side, Rieder highlighted the appeal of income. 

Investors can still build portfolios yielding between 6.5% and 7%, a level he described as highly attractive in a world where inflation has drifted below 3% on a core basis. He argued that while the Federal Reserve has room to cut rates — potentially starting as soon as September — current yields already offer investors solid returns.

Rieder also emphasized today's unusually subdued volatility. He described trading equity volatility, or “vol,” at levels near 9.5 to 10, which he called “crazy low.” Low volatility, he said, makes hedging against downside risk relatively cheap, giving investors what he called an “escape hatch” if conditions sour. “You don't actually have to take the downside risk,” Rieder said.

Still, Rieder cautioned that complacency is his biggest concern. With insurance in markets so inexpensive, he sees signs investors may be underestimating risks, particularly in credit spreads and other corners of fixed income.

On monetary policy, Rieder argued the Fed's rate hikes have done little to suppress inflation, given that large corporations rely less on borrowing to finance investment. 

The real drag, he said, has been on housing activity and lower-income households that depend more heavily on credit. Keeping rates too high, he warned, risks imposing excessive costs on the government and households without meaningful disinflation gains.

He believes the central bank could lower the funds rate by as much as 100 basis points over the coming year, a move he sees as unlikely to rekindle inflation given low structural volatility and rising productivity from advances in data, hyperscale computing and even space-related technologies. 

“There's something spectacular happening around productivity,” he said, calling it a once-in-a-generation dynamic.

For crypto investors, Rieder's comments reinforce a broader narrative: an environment with falling rates, ample liquidity, and low volatility could support renewed appetite for risk assets beyond equities. If his call proves correct, the same technical tailwinds driving stocks higher could spill into digital assets that thrive on excess cash and investor risk-taking.

Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $59.3 million in net outflows on August 15, ending an unprecedented 8-day buying streak that brought in $3.7 billion, with only BlackRock's ETHA posting inflows of $338 million amid broader market rotation. 

The outflows occurred despite Ethereum trading just 10.22% below its November 2021 all-time high and following a brutal $1.05 billion crypto liquidation event triggered by unexpectedly high US inflation data.Source: 

The reversal came after record-breaking institutional demand, with ETH ETFs drawing $1.02 billion in a single session earlier in the week, led by BlackRock's $640 million contribution. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's contradictory statements about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve added to market uncertainty, initially declaring the US “will not be buying any Bitcoin” before later clarifying budget-neutral expansion pathways.

Ethereum reached $4,781.24 on August 14, its highest level since November 2021, before the Producer Price Index reading of 3.3% versus expected 2.5% triggered massive liquidations.Institutional Conviction Emerges During Retail Capitulation

BlackRock executed a stunning $1 billion accumulation during the market selloff, purchasing 4,428 BTC worth $526 million and 105,900 ETH worth $488 million for its ETFs. 

The aggressive buying occurred as crypto markets lost $133 billion in 24 hours, and over 221,000 traders faced liquidations.

BitMine Immersion Technologies added another 106,485 ETH worth $470.51 million in 10 hours, bringing total holdings to 1.297 million ETH valued at $5.75 billion. 

A mysterious institution simultaneously withdrew 92,899 ETH worth $412 million from Kraken over four days, creating $882 million in combined institutional accumulation.

BlackRock accelerated ETH accumulation 15x faster than Bitcoin over 30 days, with ETH holdings growing 65% compared to 4% BTC growth. 

The asset manager's crypto holdings now total $100 billion, including $90.36 billion in Bitcoin and $15.07 billion in Ethereum.Market Structure Points to Continued Ethereum Strength

Social sentiment analysis revealed stark differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum positioning. 

Bitcoin's sentiment reached peak bullishness precisely at its $125,000 all-time high, creating classic contrarian warning signals. 

Current readings show “BTC Currently Has More Greed Than Fear,” suggesting vulnerability to further disappointment.

Ethereum sentiment remained fearful throughout its rally from $3,500 to over $4,800, with “Fear Way Above Greed” despite “significantly better performance over the past 3 months.” 

The persistent retail pessimism during strong price advances indicates potential for continued upside as institutions accumulate from weak hands.

Trading volumes favored ETH, with spot trading volume reaching 1.66 times Bitcoin's level last week, the highest since June 2017.Technical Analysis Supports Bullish Continuation

Ethereum consolidates around $4,400 after successfully breaking above previous cycle highs near $4,800, establishing new price discovery territory. 

The critical support level sits at $4,367, which represents former resistance that must hold as new support to validate the breakout.

Social sentiment analysis reveals Bitcoin reached peak bullishness at its $125,000 high while Ethereum maintains fearful sentiment despite outperformance.Source: 

However, this contrarian setup favors continued ETH strength as retail pessimism typically resolves with upward price surprises.

The $59 million ETF outflow occurred during elevated retail fear rather than euphoria, suggesting institutional opportunity to accumulate at better prices. 

Additionally, liquidation heatmap analysis reveals massive liquidity concentration above current prices in the $4,800-$5,200 range, where short positions create fuel for potential squeeze. 

 liquidity is piling up on top.SHORT SQUEEZE INCOMING! — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) 

Ethereum appears positioned for continued upward momentum toward $5,200-$5,400 range, supported by fearful retail sentiment creating asymmetric risk-reward. 

The contrarian framework suggests any weakness should be viewed as an accumulation opportunity rather than a trend reversal.

This is because institutional foundation provides downside protection while retail fear creates conditions for upside surprises.

Bitcoin Standard Treasury Co. (BSTR), a bitcoin BTC$117,814.84 treasury vehicle led by cryptography pioneer Adam Back, sees itself as a company with a mission to accelerate real-world bitcoin adoption.

But it might be setting out on another milestone: becoming one of the biggest corporate bitcoin holders. 

The company, which is preparing to go public on Nasdaq by merging with Cantor Equity Partners (CEPO), already has 30,021 BTC on its balance sheet, with plans to grow its stack beyond 50,000 coins.

This will set it on the path of potentially overtaking MARA Holdings (MARA) as the second-largest corporate holder of BTC behind Strategy. MARA has more than 50,600 BTC, according to bitcointreasuries.net. Strategy has just under 629,000.

Currently, MSTR, MARA, and BSTR collectively hold roughly 710,000 bitcoin, which represents about 3.38% of bitcoin's fixed supply of 21 million.

Unlike some corporate treasuries that sit on bitcoin passively, BSTR intends to use techniques that include selling puts to accumulate BTC at lower prices, using bitcoin-backed revolvers and placing collateral with regulated tri-party custodians.

“We're not interested in chasing DeFi yield or taking on counterparty risk we can't manage. This is about liquidity, security, and scale," Back said exclusively with CoinDesk. “Bitcoin was created as sound money and BSTR is being created to bring that same integrity to modern capital markets.”

The SPAC deal with Cantor combines, for the first time, traditional Wall Street financing with a bitcoin-denominated private placement of equity (PIPE). 

In addition to 25,000 BTC contributed by the company's founders, another 5,021 BTC will be raised from the bitcoin community. 

The company is also raising up to $1.5 billion in fiat financing, the largest PIPE ever announced alongside a bitcoin treasury SPAC merger. 

CEPO could add up to $200 million from its trust, subject to redemptions.

“By securing both fiat and bitcoin funding on day one, we are putting unprecedented firepower behind a single mission: maximizing bitcoin ownership per share while accelerating real-world bitcoin adoption,” Back said.

The in-kind PIPE allows investors to deliver BTC at closing and potentially capture upside before settlement. Back said the approach was designed to appeal to both crypto-native players and traditional managers seeking exposure without waiting for post-close market buys.

The firm's CIO Sean Bill, who previously helped a U.S. pension fund make one of the first institutional allocations to BTC, said the strategy resonated with traditional investors. "We're building the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) of Bitcoin, an actively managed Treasury that will pursue yield and alpha strategies, and strategic acquisitions within the Bitcoin ecosystem”.

“We're flipping the script on Wall Street as we seek to fuse Bitcoin into Finance and Capital Markets, unlike other Treasury companies we're not coming to Wall Street seeking fiat currency to buy Bitcoin, we're showing up with a 25,000 Bitcoin commitment and more importantly we issued the first ever Bitcoin in kind Equity PIPE in the United States, raising another 5,021 Bitcoins from OG Bitcoiners. We're brining the Bitcoin to Wall Street. We believe that the future of finance runs on Bitcoin”,” Bill told CoinDesk exclusively.

The leadership team sees BSTR as a bridge between the bitcoin ecosystem and institutional capital markets.

“We're bringing the traders, we're bringing the bitcoiners to Wall Street,” Back said, noting the potential for the U.S. market's liquidity to amplify the success of bitcoin-denominated convertibles that have already gained traction in Europe.

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, with the company trading under the reserved ticker BSTR. If the raise is fully subscribed, the launch could set a new scale record for corporate bitcoin treasuries and offer a template for others looking to merge sound money with modern market instruments.

 Without localized risk detection and public–private cooperation, illicit capital will continue to flow unchecked, and trust in the system will collapse. 

Opinion by: Slava Demchuk, co-founder and CEO of AMLBot

Asia's cryptoverse has lost more than 1.5 billion in the first half of 2025 — more than during 2024, including Bybit and pig butchering scams in Southeast Asia. Most engines are built around typologies of Western money laundering. They miss custom laundering channels tailored to each region, which are popping up across Asia.

Blockchain analytics firms must build customized regional risk libraries and collaborate with local law enforcement to combat the level and caliber of cryptocurrency-enabled crime in Asia. Failure to address this means criminal funds will still be able to lurk in plain sight and subvert the very integrity of global compliance systems.

The global risk engine most commonly targets mixers, tumblers and centralized on-ramps in North America and Europe. But the Asian financial underground uses different weapons: unlicensed OTC desks in Thailand, mobile-money corridors in the Philippines, and informal peer-to-peer parking methods that don't trigger red flags as seen through today's general compliance lens.

With the corresponding flows, these wallets build the wallet clusters and flow patterns that circumvent legacy detection rules. Proceeds are often left idle or are discreetly layered, before ending up at decentralized exchanges, letting the laundering cycle slip by general compliance triggers.

The ability to effectively monitor crime in APAC is based on jurisdiction-level expertise. That includes mapping typical tactics, such as circular trading via Singaporean shell companies, or layering transactions with Indonesian e-wallets. Analytics providers must ingest locally published onchain data and hold living typologies to mimic real-time laundering innovations rather than wait to reverse engineer them when it's too late.

Building regional risk libraries — flagging wallet clusters, known bad actors and unique entry/exit ramps — is fundamental. These tools must be built into enforcement engines, not tacked on after a scam becomes newsworthy.

Data alone doesn't stop crime. Local regulators are typically not well-versed in blockchain, and private analytics companies require legal authority to act. This is where public-private partnerships (PPPs) are crucial. PPPs may formally permit secure data-sharing, joint training and real-time alerts.

These partnerships are already bearing fruit: In countries like Thailand and Malaysia, law enforcement has used real-time dashboards and analytics software to freeze funds within hours of reported fraud — compared to weeks or months in the past. These are not hypotheticals; they're operating efficiencies that save millions.

Retail participation in crypto is booming in markets like Vietnam, Thailand and India, but that growth is exposed without enforcement confidence. We must incentivize investors to stay in a market where fraud is rife. Public-private collaboration demonstrates commitment to protecting consumers, allowing for rulemaking that is done in concert, and supporting long-term engagement across the retail and institutional market participants.

There are dangers in regional compliance, say the critics. Different global standards, privacy in onchain, and government overreach are all real issues. Privacy-preserving design — like short-term data retention, permissioned audit trails and the publication of enforcement reports — can protect user privacy and legal accountability.

Crypto firms partnering with analytics providers with hyperlocal compliance capabilities will win mandates from hedge funds, banks, and custodian banks investing in the APAC region. Institutions are looking for confidence in blockchain hygiene and proving that the vendors understand the terrain. Vendors dependent upon “one-size-fits-all” compliance tooling risk losing their exchange listing, investor confidence, and regional access. 

To push this model, industry coalitions must collaborate with analytics vendors, which will co-develop APAC-wide compliance standards. This undertaking should involve employing local specialists in underground financial activity and the development of jurisdiction-specific risk libraries. 

Setting up public-private partnerships with regulators is equally important; they allow immediate cooperation and enforcement rights. The pan-APAC compliance architecture should also include transparency through quarterly impact reports to assess the model's effectiveness in preventing money laundering across the region.

Asia stands at a crossroads. Without regionally tailored risk detection and cross-sectoral collaboration, it is in danger of becoming like the “Wild West”. However, with proper underpinnings, it could be a leader in constructing a compliant, innovation-focused crypto economy. Speaking the language of Asia's financial underground — and partnering with local enforcers — is the only way to regain trust and unlock the next chapter of growth.

Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, has made headlines with a $15.9 million investment in Ethereum and select altcoins, while completely avoiding Bitcoin. This is a significant shift that could impact the cryptocurrency landscape in ways we might not fully comprehend yet.

The fact that Hayes is putting such a hefty amount into Ethereum and altcoins instead of Bitcoin is interesting. It suggests that he sees something in these assets that he believes will outperform Bitcoin in the long run. Given his track record, this could be a sign that the altcoin market is maturing, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) and governance tokens.

He's not just buying random coins either. This is a calculated move towards assets that are currently in the spotlight. His choice underscores a growing belief in the potential of altcoins to deliver returns, especially during an altcoin rally.

The market is always watching what figures like Hayes are doing. His decision to bypass Bitcoin may prompt others to consider diversifying into altcoins as well. This could lead to more capital being allocated to Ethereum and its ilk, which in turn could affect prices and market dynamics.

We might also see a surge in the demand for B2B crypto payment platforms and crypto payroll solutions for startups. If more companies and investors are leaning towards altcoins, then businesses will likely need to pivot to meet this new demand.

However, just as the spotlight is shining brighter on altcoins, regulatory hurdles are on the horizon. The EU's MiCA regulation aims to create a framework for crypto-assets, but the diversity of altcoins complicates matters. Each altcoin has its own use case, making it tricky for regulators to impose a one-size-fits-all approach.

Compliance with MiCA will be key for altcoin issuers. They will need to adhere to anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations, which can be cumbersome and costly. This raises questions about whether the altcoin market can sustain itself in this climate.

We are also seeing a growing interest from institutional investors in altcoins. More capital is being allocated to Ethereum and other altcoins, which could provide much-needed liquidity and stability to the market. This might even lead to new financial products and investment opportunities centered around altcoins.

Startups in Asia, for instance, could benefit by incorporating blockchain technology and cryptocurrency services into their operations. Providing crypto payroll solutions and facilitating crypto contractor payments could attract a new customer base that is keen on altcoin investments.

Hayes's investment is a significant move that could change the game for cryptocurrency investments. As more investors look beyond Bitcoin, we may see shifts in market dynamics, regulatory issues, and institutional interest. While there are opportunities, there are also challenges ahead for those diving into the altcoin pool. Staying attuned to these trends will be vital for anyone involved in the crypto space.

 S&P Dow Jones Indices is exploring partnerships with major exchanges, custodians and DeFi protocols to launch tokenized versions of its benchmarks. 

S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI) is in discussions with major exchanges, custodians and DeFi protocols to license and list tokenized versions of its benchmarks, according to Stephanie Rowton, the firm's director of US equities.

Rowton told Cointelegraph that the index provider is taking a “strategic approach” to ensure tokenized S&P products are launched only on platforms that meet high standards for transparency, security and regulatory compliance.

“By establishing these types of relationships, we hope we can work together to participate in a robust infrastructure that supports the trading and accessibility of tokenized versions of our indexes, ultimately enhancing the investor experience,” she said.

The push into blockchain comes as institutional interest in tokenized financial products accelerates. S&P DJI entered the space earlier this year by licensing the S&P 500 for a tokenization initiative with Centrifuge, which uses official data to offer programmable index-tracking funds via smart contracts.

Rowton said the move has already generated “an uptick in curiosity and engagement” from both traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) market participants. “This interest reflects a broader market trend as investors increasingly seek innovative and efficient ways to interact with established financial products,” she added.

Rowton said the blockchain technology has a “transformative potential” in the financial markets. “As demand for digital assets grows, tokenization could play a crucial role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance,” Rowton noted.

She added that the S&P DJI's tokenization strategy aligns with the firm's mission to meet the needs of “a new generation of investors who are looking for innovative ways to engage with established benchmarks.”

Interest in tokenized index products is strongest among digitally native investors, including crypto and blockchain participants, as well as institutions seeking to diversify portfolios. Regionally, Europe, Asia and LatAm lead the charge.

Rowton also revealed that the company is evaluating opportunities to tokenize other flagship benchmarks such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and thematic indexes. “We recognize that different investor segments may have varying interests in specific indexes, and we will aim to respond to market demand accordingly,” she said.

Rowton said tokenized indexes would be “pivotal” in global markets by 2030, enhancing cross-border market access and liquidity. The technology could lower traditional investment barriers, while enabling new strategies that leverage DeFi features like fractional ownership and automated trading.

However, she pushed back on the notion that tokenization threatens S&P DJI's traditional licensing business. Instead, she described it as “a complementary innovation” that expands commercial opportunities and opens index investing to new audiences without compromising the integrity of the benchmarks.

Rowton's comments come as tokenized stocks continue to gain momentum, with market capitalization for blockchain-based financial products hitting $370 million by the end of July.

Last week, OpenEden partnered with BNY Mellon to manage and custody the assets behind its tokenized US Treasury product, TBILL, the first Moody's “A”-rated tokenized Treasury fund to use a global custodian.

Ethereum holders are increasingly lining up to unstake their tokens, a trend that could put significant sell pressure on the cryptocurrency, according to one crypto expert.

The Ethereum blockchain's validator exit queue hit 855,158 ETH on Friday—the highest it's ever been, according to validatorqueue.com. The tokens were worth a combined $3.7 billion as of late Friday, according to data provider CoinGecko.

Staking is a process by which digital asset holders lock up their tokens to secure a blockchain network and earn rewards. Stakers may choose to unlock and reclaim their crypto amid uncertain market conditions, transferring them to comparatively risk-off assets or cashing out.

The Ethereum networks limits the amount of ETH that can be unstaked at a given time. The limit is designed to maintain network stability by preventing mass validator exits, which could disrupt the blockchain's consensus mechanism. Currently, the queue is expected to take 15 days to clear.

The mounting queue of soon-to-be-unstaked ETH could be driving the asset's recent retracement, Bitwise Senior Investment Strategist Juan Leon told Decrypt. The second-largest crypto asset by market cap has shed hundreds of dollars in recent days after coming close to setting a new all-time high mark.

The unstaked Ethereum queue could negatively affect ETH's price, particularly if staked ETH trades at a discount to ETH, he explained.

“Tokens like stETH can trade at a discount. That discount reduces their value as collateral, triggering risk cuts, hedges, or even liquidations that lead to spot ETH selling,” Leon said.

He added that some trades may unwind as the unstaking queue grows, particularly if the cost to borrow ETH spikes.

When that occurs, “leveraged ‘stETH loop' trades via liquidity pools on DeFi protocols stop being profitable,” Leon said. “Traders unwind by exiting positions and selling ETH to repay loans, creating synchronized sell pressure.”

Growing efforts to unstake ETH came shortly after the token on Thursday came within striking distance of its record price of $4,878 hit in November 2021, per data from CoinGecko. Since then, the altcoin has retraced its gains, weighed down by growing geopolitical uncertainty and a hotter-than-expected producer-price-index report from the U.S.

Despite concerns about Ethereum's validator exit queue, Leon cautioned that a rise in ETH waiting to be unstaked doesn't necessarily signal that the token's price will continue to edge down.

“Unstaking doesn't usually cause a sudden crash, but under stress it can act like a steady tap of new supply,” he said, “pressuring prices lower if it overwhelms new demand for ETH.”

Oops, something went wrong

The cryptocurrency industry has a penchant for repeating the mistakes of the traditional finance industry, and the treasury company trend could be one such mistake, according to Zero Knowledge Group founder Austin Campbell.

Campbell told FINTECH.TV on Tuesday that the cryptocurrency treasury trend held an eerie resemblance to the mortgage-backed securities trend of the 2000s.

"There are these cycles when you see bubbles that start with very grounded forms of finance, where people can pay their cash flow and finance all the debt, no problem. And then you get into ones where basically they're just rolling debt to finance operations. And then you get into ones where price appreciation is the only way they remain solvent," Campbell said, citing economist Hyman Minsky‘s ideas on financial bubbles.

According to Campbell, many of the digital asset treasury firms are showing characteristics of the tail end of the bubble, where they need the underlying asset to keep appreciating to stay solvent.

"If you have a vehicle that needs to have price appreciation to continue to exist and function properly, eventually there's going to be a problem," he said.

Mortgaged-back securities were popular in the early 2000s as home prices kept appreciating, fueled by easy but risky loans in the form of subprime mortgages. The bubble started to burst in 2006 as home prices began to decline, and defaults on subprime loans piled up. This housing market collapse was one of the major drivers of the 2008 financial crisis.

While Campbell fears a similar crisis will unfold with cryptocurrency treasuries, he expects it to be more contained.

"Digital asset Treasury companies cannot crash the economy," he said. "They're not systemic enough."

Campbell's recent remarks echo recent warnings from Standard Chartered Global Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick. Kendrick told investors that several Bitcoin treasuries were at risk of selling off their holdings in a sharp market downturn, which could in turn further escalate the downturn.

Despite these concerns, new Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury firms continue to crop up every other day.

According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, 293 companies have Bitcoin on their balance sheet, with 15 of them joining the trend in the past 30 days. In total, these firms hold nearly 3.7 million BTC worth nearly $437 billion, according to the platform. MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR), the pioneer of the Bitcoin treasury movement, leads the pack with nearly 629,000 BTC worth over $74 billion at last look.

Comparatively, Blockworks data shows seven public companies with about 2.4 million ETH worth nearly $10 billion on their balance sheet. The Tom Lee-led Bitmine (NYSE:BMNR) tops the ranks with about 1.2 million ETH worth nearly $7 billion.

The integration of blockchain into 6G-enabled Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks promises secure and decentralized communication but introduces challenges related to energy efficiency, latency, and authentication overhead. Existing clustering and security schemes fail to balance these aspects effectively in heterogeneous networks. This paper proposes a novel energy-aware cluster head (CH) selection framework using Artificial Democratic Cuckoo Glowworm Remora Optimization (ADCGRO), integrated with a lightweight blockchain layer for secure authentication and data integrity. The system optimizes task allocation across advanced, intermediate, and normal IoMT devices to minimize energy depletion while meeting ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances network lifetime by 27%, reduces average latency by 35%, and achieves 99% authentication accuracy, surpassing baseline protocols such as LEACH and HEED. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining ADCGRO-based optimization with blockchain to enhance performance and security in 6G wireless networks.

Significant developments in wireless communication and computer vision1 complement newly developed 6G technology. Modern computer vision systems, combined with robust communication networks, could drastically alter our perspective and interaction with the physical world. With data speeds exceeding 100 GB/s and latency of less than one millisecond, 6G is predicted to be the next significant advancement. It aims to build on the successes of 5G. Once unthinkable, real-time computer vision applications are now realistic due to their unparalleled speed and connectivity. The promise of global connectivity offered by 6G enables computer vision systems to operate in far-off, previously unreachable regions. This will generate various opportunities in sectors such as augmented reality, transportation, agriculture, and others2. SixG technology marks a new era defined by ultra-fast data transmission, creative computer vision, and remedies to long-standing problems that will fundamentally alter our digital lives. Our actual experiences will pale compared to our dreams. Blockchain technologies could enable the integration of computer vision systems with 6G networks. This aligns perfectly with the distributed ledger and immutable transaction records of blockchain technology3. Three fundamental needs—data privacy, integrity, and trust—have a solution in blockchain technology.

Blockchain technology is crucial for computer vision and 6G networks, as it ensures data confidentiality and integrity. Protecting the privacy and security of this data is crucial, as 6G networks enable the rapid transmission of large data volumes required for computer vision operations. Based on cryptographic concepts, the immutable ledger of blockchain technology protects data from unauthorized access or manipulation. This is particularly important in contexts like driverless automobiles, smart cities, and remote medical diagnostics, where data confidentiality and accuracy are vitally critical6. Blockchain technology also encourages individuals to trust the system4. Using computer vision technology means relying on the accuracy of the visual data and its source. The distributed ledger properties of blockchain technology, along with its immutability, enable users to authenticate data sources and verify the correctness of computations. People's cooperation on projects, including augmented reality systems and multi-agent robotics, depends on personal confidence to run regularly and consistently5. Blockchain technologies also enable the simplicity of data monetization and provenance tracking.

Smart contracts and tokenization enable participants in the computer vision and 6G ecosystems to transact services or data in a fair, transparent, and efficient manner. The expansion of data marketplaces has increased the chances for computer vision data providers to receive fair compensation. Using blockchain technology, tracking data origin provides responsibility and traceability qualities extremely essential for audit purposes and regulatory compliance6. Six G networks are rather close to more decentralization in the current digital information era. Still, if we are to further this process, several significant obstacles have to be overcome. Among these challenges are building confidence, pooling resources, ensuring secure data transfer, implementing access controls, protecting privacy, and establishing effective governance7,8. Typically, conventional network security solutions, which rely on encryption algorithms and centralized authority, ensure data protection, transparency, and dependability. These techniques might not be sufficient, though, in the highly dispersed systems usual of a 6G environment, where scalability, decentralization, and real-time operation are paramount.

The decentralization, immutability, and traceability of blockchain technology make it a perfect candidate for the optimum moment to emerge; it solves present-day challenges and might greatly improve the security and dependability of 6G networks9. Blockchain technology has proven to be quite valuable in enhancing the security of wireless networks, particularly in 6G communication networks. Its high power consumption is one of its major downsides, particularly for nodes with short battery lives10. Network scalability and stability are compromised when nodes fail at a rapid pace, which has a significant impact on the energy consumption associated with the sophisticated consensus process11. Energy usage is drastically reduced through innovative solutions, such as the Green Sharding (GS) system, which decreases the involvement of wireless nodes in global communication. These systems use node sharding technologies and are based on geolocation. This addresses the primary issue. There have been reports of promising results using this method for millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications12. Several consensus mechanisms optimized for 6G scenarios are necessary for integrating blockchain with 6G networks.

While GS and other optimization methods help to solve energy consumption problems, this flexibility directly influences the general efficiency and performance of the system13. Researchers have previously attempted to integrate blockchain technology with wireless communication; however, the protocols they created have not satisfied the requirements for low-latency and high-concurrency transactions14. Table 1 reveals that traditional methods of attaining agreement typically exhibit less scalability, greater delay, and inferior throughput. This is the outcome of their greater attention to maintaining constant quality.

Critical healthcare services are increasingly dependent on IoMT systems, which have motivated this study because of the potential catastrophic effects of network outages, energy shortages, or security breaches. While some studies have examined blockchain and metaheuristic clustering (e.g., Glowworm Swarm Optimization and Cuckoo Search) independently for secure communication, very few have combined the two into a single framework optimized for 6G networks. Additionally, previous research has failed to adequately account for the diverse energy consumption patterns of IoMT devices, leading to wasteful resource utilization and premature network failures.

Blockchain, paired with 6G networks, could meet contemporary information security needs and inspire new digital economic and social paradigms, potentially having significant societal implications15,16. Many technological-related difficulties and concerns preclude this convergence17. Among the problems are low latency, effective data transport, security and privacy concerns, as well as the scalability and performance of consensus techniques. Considering this backdrop, we aimed to develop a strategy that would maximize efficacy while implementing security policies simultaneously. This method seeks to effectively integrate blockchain technologies within a 6G network, thereby integrating and protecting them. The main objectives of this research are these:

Introducing a hybrid metaheuristic optimization approach (ADCGRO) that balances the strengths of Cuckoo Search, Glowworm Swarm Optimization, and Remora Learning to optimally select cluster heads, considering device heterogeneity and residual energy.

Integrating a lightweight blockchain consensus mechanism with the clustering process to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant data transmission without imposing excessive computational overhead.

Developing a comprehensive system model that evaluates the framework across multiple performance metrics, including throughput, packet delivery ratio, energy efficiency, latency, accuracy, and network lifetime, all of which are validated through extensive simulations.

Simulations are necessary to assess the impact of the proposed security and optimization strategies on the network's overall performance, thereby determining the viability of integrating blockchain-6G in practical applications.

This project aims to support the development of intelligent, safe, and high-performance communication systems by leveraging the complementary capabilities of blockchain and 6G networks. The following sets up the next work with shadows: "Related works" section provides the literature review; "System model" section presents a comprehensive overview of the proposed approach; "Simulation settings" section examines the results; "Conclusions and future work" section ends with a last summary.

Begum et al.18 presented an HLDAG-BC—a mix of blockchain technology and augmented recurrent neural networks to guarantee safe and effective routing in MANET-IoT systems. Identity-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (ICPA) is a lightweight, secure node authentication system offered by the HLDAG-BC, which provides tamper-proof communication. The kernel neutrosophic c-means (KNCM) method helps the network's nodes to be generally classified. Using the red piranha optimization (RPO) approach helps one to choose the best CH. Finding the most effective routing path to improve dependability and lower latency falls to RERNN. Intrusion detection using an HDLNN helps enhance overall network security. By achieving a 31.35% improvement in packet delivery ratio, a 34.56% increase in throughput, a 30.29% reduction in latency, and a 28.67% increase in network lifespan, the recommended HLDAG-BC-RERNN strategy outperforms current approaches. By providing a safe and scalable key for MANET-IoT networks, the proposed framework seems to be a practical option for potential 6G applications. FedChain, a novel federated blockchain-based clustering system designed to enhance connection and network security in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) FANETs, was first introduced by Pramitarianini et al.19.

Blockchain and federated learning (FL) help protect the cluster against Sybil attacks. As such, a safe cluster can be created without increasing the amount of control messages. Maximizing stable cluster formation with minimal control overhead depends on formulating the cost function maximizing issue using a cross-layer architecture under minimal influence overhead. Data from the physical layer (position, mobility, channel capacity, and residual energy) is combined in this design with data from the network layer (connectivity). Furthermore, selecting the best CHs based on parameters such as maximum residual energy and velocity restrictions ensures long-term stability. Inter-node transactions are authenticated using blockchain technology, which ensures secure development by separating Sybil attack nodes from real users.

This action helps to reduce the security concern. Through a unique FL framework, which can predict and identify node conditions in real-time without requiring additional control packets, security performance can be enhanced, and control overhead during cluster formation can be reduced. Regarding connection, control overhead, and security performance, the FedChain-based clustering method beats the lowest ID (LI), maximum connectivity degree (HCD), and standard blockchain-based clustering (CBC) protocols according to simulation results. The results show that the FedChain-based clustering system provides significant security and connectivity, making it a great option for dynamic settings. Using 6G technology and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify Chinese characters in their natural surroundings, Li and Li20 developed SE2ERS, a safe end-to-end recognition system. Using the Weighted Hyperbolic Curve Cryptograph (WHCC), the proposed SE2ERS idea combines blockchain technology with the secure data transmission capabilities of the 6G network design.

For character estimation, the computer vision system utilizes a data flow, specifically a 6G gradient directional histogram (GDH). By utilizing WHCC and GDH, the SE2ERS concept facilitates the safe transmission of data within the 6G network. The suggested SE2ERS analyzes conventional Chinese text recognition techniques and data transmission parameters to achieve 6G communication. With simple Chinese characters, the testing results show that SE2ERS achieves an accuracy of 88% and beats current approaches. Unlike prior approaches, which achieved a 72.8% success rate, our method achieves an average success rate of 84.4% using challenging Chinese characters. Furthermore, the WHCC model exhibits a twelve times higher data encryption rate complexity than more traditional methods, thereby significantly improving data security. By utilizing blockchain technology, Chinnasamy et al.21 propose a novel approach for enhancing security in 6G wireless networks. This project uses blockchain technology in a user sensor network. The second phase involves utilizing artificial democratic optimization to complete the network optimization. The results of the simulation have been affected by several network parameters, including accuracy, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end latency, throughput, and energy efficiency.

Furthermore, by selecting the optimal node and path for data flow, it can reduce network traffic, a valuable additional benefit. The suggested method achieved a 95% energy efficiency, 97% throughput, 50% end-to-end latency, 96% accuracy, and a 94% packet delivery ratio. Liu et al.7 investigate the integration of blockchain technology with 6G networks from the perspectives of security and performance, thereby proposing a technique that focuses on building secure mechanisms and improving performance. The potential applications of 6G networks and how blockchain technology can enhance them must be highlighted to underscore the need to incorporate blockchain technology into 6G networks. Therefore, it is essential to assess security needs in the construction of 6G networks to ensure the security of data flow and communication using blockchain technology. Furthermore, to address ways to maximize communication and storage to meet the needs of 6G networks, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) solution is proposed for the asynchronous consensus mechanism used by blockchains. This will be implemented to maximize the integration of blockchain and 6G networks. Ultimately, it is equally important to provide valuable suggestions for future studies that will advance blockchain technology and facilitate the integration of 6G networks.

This study employs various IoMT devices with distinct initial energy levels in monitoring scenarios utilizing 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. N 6G-enabled IoMT devices constitute the network, which comprises three levels of energy heterogeneity. Furthermore, Fig. 1 illustrates the methodology of the proposed prototype.

The 6G-enabled IoMT devices that comprise the network range from highly sophisticated to relatively simple, with varying degrees of initial energy. As a result of the energy disparity, advanced 6G-enabled IoMT devices start with more energy than intermediate 6G-enabled IoMT devices, which in turn have more energy than regular nodes \(\:{E}_{nrm}<{E}_{int}<\:{E}_{adv}\). The overall number of every type of 6G-enabled IoMT devices is cutting-edge (\(\:{n}_{\text{a}\text{d}\text{v}}\)), intermediate (\(\:{n}_{\text{i}\text{n}\text{t}}\)), and normal (\(\:{n}_{\text{n}\text{r}\text{m}}\)) reflects a descending orders, with standard 6G-enabled IoMT devices being the most frequent, filling the inequality \(\:{n}_{nrm}>\:{n}_{int}>\:{n}_{adv}\). The first energy for every 6G-enabled IoMT device types are represented as E0, and the overall energy in the network is signified by \(\:{E}_{\text{t}}\). The progressive 6G-enabled IoMT devices have their energy described as \(\:{E}_{0}\times\:(1\:+\:\omega\:)\times\:{n}_{adv}\), and intermediate 6G-enabled IoMT devices as \(\:{E}_{0}\times\:(1+\varPsi\:)\times\:{n}_{int}\), with normal 6G-enabled IoMT device at \(\:{E}_{0}\times\:{n}_{nrm}\). Therefore, the aggregate energy of all 6G-enabled IoMT devices—advanced, intermediate, and normal—makes up the network's total energy \(\:{E}_{T}={E}_{adv}+{E}_{int}+{E}_{nrm}\). The overall energy is \(\:{E}_{T}={E}_{0}\times\:N\times\:(1+\varPsi\:\times\:{k}_{o}+k\times\:\omega\:)\), combining the energy contributions from all levels. The energy ratios \(\:\varPsi\:\) and \(\:\omega\:\) correspond to the energy fractions of the advanced and intermediate 6G-enabled IoMT device, correspondingly. The proportion of advanced and intermediate 6G-enabled IoMT devices within the network are indicated by \(\:k\) and \(\:{k}_{\text{o}}\). A diverse range of 6G-enabled IoMT devices, categorized as advanced, intermediate, and basic nodes, each with its unique energy capacity, are integrated into the network architecture. To ensure that energy-intensive processes, such as CH selection, are handled by competent devices, a hierarchy is established, where advanced nodes have the most energy reserves, intermediate nodes have moderate energy, and regular nodes have the least. Normal nodes are most numerous, followed by intermediate nodes, and advanced nodes make up the smallest group; this distribution also represents practical deployments. This network architecture allows the system to use high-energy nodes for mission-critical activities and lightweight devices for routine sensing. To optimize CH selection in 6G settings, an energy-aware setup is essential. It allows balanced energy consumption, extends the total lifespan of the network, and ensures optimal integration with blockchain for safe, low-latency data transfer.

Workflow of the research classical.

There are several assumptions about the network setup of the suggested work, which are as follows:

Although 6G can facilitate considerable mobility in IoMT devices, the proposed study presumes a static network configuration. In the context of network functioning, both the 6G-enabled IoMT devices and the data-gathering sink are considered stationary.

Despite the differing energy capacity of nodes, it is anticipated that all 6G-enabled IoMT device within the network would maintain uniform configurations and operational characteristics. This assumption facilitates the study and use of the proposed strategy.

Unlike IoMT devices, which are constrained by energy limitations, the data- gathering sink is anticipated to operate without such restrictions.

The network's IoMT devices are anticipated to be sensor nodes equipped with 6G communication capabilities, improving their connectivity and data transmission effectiveness.

The purpose of this endeavor is to utilize the same radio energy utilization model as prior studies, to focus on the transmission and receipt of data between 6G-enabled IoT devices and sink connections. Three elements define the architecture: the administrative domain, the network of the 6G-enabled IoMT, and the blockchain network. Utilizing 6G technology for fast and low-latency connectivity, devices located in homes, hospitals, and ambulances comprise the IoMT network. By utilizing smart contracts, the blockchain network ensures secure and transparent data management. Using this will enhance data security and facilitate tracking. Monitoring the network, the administrator ensures the domain achieves optimal performance and resolves any newly emerging issues. Gathering data, a “sink” sends it to the “blockchain” for processing. The IoT devices send their data to the sink. Monitoring the network and ensuring regulatory compliance helps the administrator keep the system running as intended.

The primary objective of the suggested research is to reduce energy consumption in IoMT networks by leveraging 6G technology, thereby promoting sustainable communication in these systems. Achieving this goal depends on the CH's performance in supervising the network's energy consumption. The ADCGRO method produces an ideal answer, which guides the choice of CH. Establishing a comprehensive fitness function with several key elements will help determine the CH precisely. Each of these factors significantly impacts the CH choosing process. This all-encompassing solution ensures effective energy management in 6G IoT systems. This work sought to integrate four different fitness metrics: residual energy, node-to-sink closeness, cluster energy, and remaining node energy levels. This comprehensive approach ensures a more thorough and efficient decision-making process.

residual energy

Residual energy is a crucial fitness parameter for the CH since its capacity to gather and forward data to the sink consumes more energy than that of the other nodes in the cluster. Choosing a particularly active CH is therefore rather crucial. The energy levels of the nodes will progressively decrease as the network operates, leaving a varying amount of energy remaining at the end of each round. This is assessed concerning the first fitness factor,\(\:{F}_{1}\)

which assesses the rate of the node's residual energy (\({E}_{\text{r}\text{e}\text{s}\text{i}\text{d}}\)) to its primary energy (\({E}_{\text{i}\text{n}\text{i}\text{t}}\)).

node and sink proximity

The distance sensor nodes must travel to interact with either other nodes or the sink, which is a fundamental component of this work. Especially in determining the CH, evaluating a node's proximity to the sink is crucial. Selecting CH, the node closest to the sink, will help to drastically lower energy use. By evaluating the distance between the sink and the node (\({D}_{\text{S}\text{N}\text{o}\text{d}\text{e}-\text{S}\text{i}\text{n}\text{k}}\)) in respect to the average distance between all nodes and the sink (\({D}_{\text{A}\text{v}\text{g}(\text{S}\text{N}\text{o}\text{d}\text{e}\text{s}-\text{S}\text{i}\text{n}\text{k})}\)), this fitness parameter guarantees the network runs efficiently and cheaply.

remaining energy levels of nodes

Our approach depends critically on selecting the CH from among the remaining live nodes, as, once network operation starts, the network's energy starts to drop, leading to an increasing number of dead nodes over period. As seen below, to define a fitness parameter.

This determines the amount of energy that persists in the network. This threshold must be maintained at an elevated level for effective CH selection. Thus, the most energy-efficient nodes will be selected, guaranteeing the network's operational continuity and durability.

cluster's energy

As the energy of the nodes within a cluster diminishes, the aggregate energy level of the cluster concurrently declines. The energy condition of the cluster housing the candidate node must be considered during the CH selection process for the network to operate effectively. This component is initially designated as 1 in the first round, as cluster formation transpires after the selection of the CH. Conversely, cluster energy level emerges as a significant determinant in CH selection beginning with the second round. To compute \(\:{F}_{4}\), the fifth fitness parameter, one must adhere to the following steps.

To provide effective energy management and balanced load distribution across the network, the node density must be high, allowing a suitable candidate node to be selected as the CH.

Our method involves combining multiple fitness criteria to convert a function into a single-objective one. To achieve this, we multiply these parameters using linear weight functions, as described in our technique. This integration makes it easier to evaluate the system's performance while still considering all the important factors.

where \(\:\alpha\:+\beta\:+\lambda\:+\delta\:=1\). It provides a weighted aggregate of multiple separate elements, where each element is multiplied by its corresponding characteristics. The suggested method is to evaluate each node based on the value of its fitness function. The node with the greatest fitness value upon completion of this calculation is designated as the CH.

Three separate groups constitute an artificial bee colony: onlooker bees, employed bees, and scout bees. The bee's inherent curiosity enables it to identify food sources, which it then shares with other nearby bees. Employing the information relayed by the foraging bee, the observer bee surveys its surroundings to locate a food source that better meets its needs. The observing bees will transition to scout bees and leave the food source when the food supply reaches a specific threshold. Expansion of the food supply will result in this occurrence. The method by which bees search for new food sources is chaotic. As per Eq. (6), scout bees are responsible for monitoring the exploration procedure, whereas paid and bystander bees are tasked with exploiting the ABC22:

The new location of the i-th worker bee is represented by \(\:{v}_{\text{i}}\), whereas the former position is indicated by \(\:{x}_{\text{i}}\). The variable k represents an arbitrary integer ranging from 1 to the total count of bees utilized. Each issue possesses an arbitrary dimension represented by j, and the variable \(\:{\varphi\:}_{ij}\) is a randomly assigned value within the range of − 1 to 1. The vigilant bee uses Eq. (7) to ascertain which items to consume, taking into account the likelihood of each worker bee's actions:

In addition to being governed by Eq. (8), fit represents the fitness values of the worker bee's answer.

fit is fitness values of the working bee's answer, Eq. (8) is utilized to regulate it.

Bees employ it to enhance their understanding of the chosen food supply, whereas worker bees utilize it for navigation purposes (9). The crucial decision in optimizing with the Cuckoo algorithm is the formulation of the goal function. Depending on the objective function, it is feasible to optimize for scheme efficiency or to reduce scheme errors. This study aims to identify the most efficient approach for mitigating errors in system or cost functions. The cost function (fc) may be computed using the following equations to calculate the integral of square error (ISE):

Like other optimization strategies, the cuckoo technique commences with an initial population, whereby each cuckoo occupies a unique spatial location. The optimization findings will get more accurate as the population of cuckoos rises. As the density of the cuckoo population increases, the convergence rate diminishes. Nonetheless, even with offline parameter optimization, the convergence rate remains invariant. Consequently, enumerating the cuckoos that will deposit eggs is the initial essential phase. The variables of the problem are presented using an array. I will refer to these arrays as “habits” when implementing the Cuckoo approach. This issue space encompasses several habitats, each proposing a distinct viable answer. The variable values pertinent to the situation must be encapsulated within an array. The “Habitat” array, an element of the cuckoo optimization process, serves this purpose. In addressing an optimization problem, the subsequent position of the habitat, indicated by the symbol Nvar, is determined by the cuckoo's current location, expressed as 1 * Nvar. Equation (11) defines these components.

The parameter values (\(\:{x}_{1},{x}_{2},{x}_{2},\dots\:,xNvar\)) each characterises the sum points. The profit functions habitat is assessed to determine (Eq. 12).

The cuckoo strategy utilizes a notably superior profit function. To incorporate this strategy into the minimization algorithm, it is essential to apply a negative sign to the cost function. The GSO algorithm's mechanisms were inspired by the natural behavior of glowworms, which are attracted to brighter sources of light. To maximize multimodal functions, swarm intelligence (SI) methods, such as the GSO technique, operate in a manner analogous to that of glowworms. Swarm intelligence algorithms may effectively tackle complicated optimization problems that prior methods are either incapable of addressing or unable to resolve comprehensively. The typical procedure is impractical. In the realm of statistics, several algorithms provide numerous advantages and disadvantages. You may be able to observe glowworms during a nocturnal stroll in the meadows. Throughout the night, these timeless beings shimmer exquisitely, illuminating the darkness. All glowworms possess a light substance called luciferin. Consequently, every glowworm will radiate light, irrespective of the surrounding darkness or cave environment. A decision range and a sensor range define the community, allowing any two glowworms in the area to interact with each other.

For the sake of reproduction and nutrition, glowworms relentlessly scour their environments for glowing luciferin. The function value that depends on the location of the glowworm has a substantial impact on the luciferin updating phase. The luciferin level of each glowworm is adjusted by increasing its previous value. While the glowworm is in its positionally effective state, this change occurs. A portion of its value is subtracted from its total value to mimic the steady deterioration of luciferin. The following suggestions are offered for updating glowworm luciferin using Eq. (13):

where \(\:\left(xi\right(t\left)\right)\) where li(t) is the luciferin level of glowworm i at time t, p is the decay constant (0 < p < 1), y is the constant, and is the value of the objective function at agent i's position at time t. The GSO principle dictates that the agent or glowworm will approach or encircle a neighbour with a higher luciferin level than its own. During this phase, the glowworm will also use the probabilistic approach given by Eq. (14) to travel to a neighbour with a higher intensity:

The collection of time t is Eq. (14). A sensor variety that bounded \(\:(0<rd\:i<\:rs)\) surrounds the capricious. Equation (15) elasticities the probability of neighbour \(\:j\in\:{N}_{i}\left(t\right)\) for each glowworm \(\:i\).

Equation (16) then characterizes the glowworm's movement model.

where || || where s is the step size and is an operator for the Euclidean norm. Then, in the m-dimensional real space R m, the position at time t is denoted by \(\:{x}_{i}\left(t\right)\in\:{R}_{m}\). Equation (17) illustrates a neighbor range update phase used to identify multiple peaks in a landscape of multimodal functions. Then, set V_0 to be the initial range charge for each glowworm. The subsequent rule is used to update each glowworm's neighbourhood variety:

If there is less than a 4-meter gap between a Grey Wolf (GW) and its nearest neighbour, the GW is allowed to roam. Additionally, the coverage rate may be slower with a smaller step size. Finding the optimal step size is thus a challenging task. This investigation will not have a constant step size; rather, it may vary with each cycle according on the GW. There will be several adjustments to GW's step size. One of these is the introduction of a dynamic step size, which should increase computational precision in velocity stage. What follows is an explanation of the ROA, or remora optimisation method.

Unrestricted Journeys: The location update mechanism for the SFO strategy was developed using Eq. (18), which produces the algorithm's elite idea.

where \(\:{R}_{rand}^{t}\) is a random location.

An experience attack works in a manner comparable to how knowledge grows: it checks in with the host regularly to determine if it needs to be updated. To represent these ideas, to use the following expression in Eq. (19):

where \(\:{R}_{att}\) is a step and \(\:{R}_{pre}\) is the prior iteration's site, distinct by Eq. (20).

Equation (21) designates updated formulas with alterations.

where D is the distance between the remora and the meal. To further enhance the solution, the remora can utilize the encircling prey mechanism in WOA to take a small step, as illustrated in Eq. (25).:

where the i-th remora's freshly created site is characterised by \(\:{X}_{i}\left(t+1\right)\). The value of the remora factor, denoted as C in ROA, is fixed at 0.1. Finding its food is something the remora is capable of. With this in mind, to enhance the remora's search efficiency by including a novel autonomous foraging mechanism into the core algorithm. A fair balance between exploration and exploitation is achieved by the upgraded remora optimisation algorithm, which features a more adaptive mode. Note that this approach does not increase the computational complexity of the original program. Since the proposed approach is compatible with various optimisation algorithms, it has some generalisability.

The proposed approach significantly enhances data security and integrity by integrating blockchain technology with IoT environments facilitated by 6G23. The fundamental concept of the system's blockchain layer is a permissioned blockchain network utilizing nodes with substantial computational capacity within the network. This indicates that pre-authentication has occurred and that all nodes inside the network have developed a certain level of trust among themselves. The nodes employ Proof of Authority (PoA), a streamlined consensus mechanism. The technique depends on a consortium of trustworthy nodes, referred to as authorities, to authenticate transactions and produce blocks. At each instance when data is transmitted from the CH to the primary blockchain layer, a blockchain node should validate the transaction, authorize it, and generate a new block. All the blockchain nodes in the network receive the newly created block, making maintenance easier. There are two main components to a block on this blockchain: the header and the transaction data. This block's version, genesis timestamp, nonce, difficulty target, Merkle root, and hash of the previous block are all essential pieces of information that are included in the header. The hash of the preceding block is included in the hash of the current block, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain and rendering it immutable. Altering the content of one block will initiate a domino effect, resulting in changes to the hashes of succeeding blocks. Secure, decentralized data exchange and automated decision-making among diverse devices and service providers are two ways in which blockchain is facilitating the adoption of intelligent, context-aware services in 6G networks. Without relying on a centralized authority, 6G apps such as smart healthcare, autonomous vehicles, or adaptive content distribution may utilize smart contracts to negotiate resources like bandwidth and processing power dynamically. They can also make choices based on real-time context. Blockchain technology ensures the integrity, immutability, and auditability of all contextual data, including user movement patterns, network load, and service priority. This enables the network's artificial intelligence (AI) agents to make reliable predictions and adaptive improvements. For instance, in a 6G smart city network, blockchain technology can enable vehicle edge nodes to safely exchange traffic data and establish low-latency priority lanes for emergency vehicles using smart contracts, ensuring that decisions are made transparently and securely.

A variety of verifications are employed to guarantee the accuracy of each block. The verifier initiates the process by assessing if the current value exceeds its predecessors and confirming the presence and legitimacy of the preceding block. Furthermore, it has been verified that additional components, such as the transaction root and difficulty, are authentic. All transactions within the block undergo independent verification. An error notice appears if any transaction fails. If all transactions have been properly authenticated and the final state matches the current root state, the block is deemed validated. A formula exists to compute the hash of a block:

where Bn signifies the block for which the hash is being calculated, \(\:Hash\left({B}_{n-1}\right)\) is the prior block's hash, and \(\:{B}_{nData}\) represents the current block data.

The utilization of the current block in hash calculations significantly bolsters the blockchain's durability against assaults. Implementing data modifications in any block becomes exceedingly challenging as the number of blocks in the chain increases significantly. Should a single block be altered, it would create a discrepancy in the hashes of all following blocks, jeopardizing the whole blockchain and facilitating manipulation. In this method, cluster chiefs diminish the transaction volume sent to the blockchain and alleviate the processing burden on nodes by consolidating data from IoMT sensor devices. A permissioned blockchain utilizing Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus, with a limited number of pre-approved validators, might expedite transaction validation, reduce latency, and improve throughput compared to conventional methods such as Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW). Scalability and efficacy for IoT devices are attained by mitigating network congestion and energy consumption through the restriction of the total number of validator nodes. By replacing trust in centralised authority with a distributed, immutable ledger, blockchain technology enhances 6G decentralized authentication and access management. Decentralized consensus systems, instead of a central server, manage authentication for each device, user, or service node by assigning them a unique cryptographic identity and storing it on the blockchain. By automatically enforcing role- or attribute-based access controls, smart contracts can limit access to 6G services and network slices to approved organizations exclusively. For example, a blockchain can be utilized in an IoMT system enabled by 6G to restrict access to patient data to authorized healthcare practitioners and to record all transactions for transparent audit purposes. In addition to improving reliability and security, this eliminates frequent problems associated with conventional methods, including centralized authentication methods such as identity spoofing and single points of failure.

A region covering 100 square meters by 100 square meters employs between 100 and 200 sensors, connected to various “gateways,” to assess the suggested methodology. This evaluation utilizes Network Simulator-2. Initially, the points got 100 joules of energy, and the gates received 200 joules. It is recommended to incorporate a dynamic threshold generation method directly into the operation, rather than appending a predefined threshold value to the detection process24. The parameters under examination are likely to evolve. This is due to their vulnerability to physical influences such as temporal variations and seasonal fluctuations. Although temperatures may increase by midday, they are frequently lower in the morning and evening25. To minimize the incidence of false positives, it is recommended that the threshold be adaptable. The sliding window theory is utilized to ascertain value. Forty samples related to the sliding window were collected for analysis. A determination concerning the cutoff is made by employing the final forty samples. The information shown in Table 1 is the same. The performance of the proposed ADCGRO-blockchain framework was evaluated against six state-of-the-art methods: KNCM, WHCC, DAG, LEACH, HEED, and a PBFT-based blockchain model. Metrics including throughput, energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio, authentication accuracy, latency, and network lifetime were analyzed across 1,000 simulation rounds in heterogeneous 6G-enabled IoMT networks.

Table 2 presents the proposed model's probability of attacks in various metrics. The proposed model consistently outperformed all baselines, achieving average energy efficiency gains of 18%, throughput improvements of 16%, and authentication accuracy exceeding 99%, compared to 82–88% for the next best methods (DAG and WHCC). Notably, network lifetime increased by 27% over DAG and by 35% compared to LEACH, highlighting the effectiveness of ADCGRO's energy-aware CH selection and lightweight blockchain consensus.

To confirm that these results were not due to random variations, paired t-tests were performed between the proposed framework and each baseline. All improvements were statistically significant with p-values < 0.05. For example, the network lifetime improvement over DAG (27%) was observed with a 95% confidence interval of ± 3%, while the latency reduction (35%) over HEED had a confidence interval of ± 2%. These results confirm the robustness of the proposed model.

The experimental analysis of the proposed model's attack investigates two critical factors: Rr (Response Rate) and Rc (Response Cost). This inquiry examines the influence of varying assault probability on these metrics. As the likelihood of an assault escalates from 0.1 to 1, both Rr and Rc exhibit a steadily rising trajectory. This holds for each of these metrics. The expense of the answer is 111.21, the response rate is 394.8, and the probability is 0.1. Nevertheless, these values escalate to 1195 and 303.65, respectively, when the likelihood of an assault reaches its maximum, which is 1. The presence of this trend indicates that as the number of assaults escalates, the system is compelled to address increased reaction costs and response rates. This highlights the need for enhanced security measures to mitigate the impact of attackers.

Table 3 presents the experimental investigation of the proposed model in comparison to existing procedures, evaluated using four metrics: throughput and accuracy. Figure 2 shows the analysis of proposed model on number of clusters. Figure 3 displays the visual analysis of various models on number of users. Figure 4 exhibits the graphical Comparison of various models on number of base stations. One important statistic is latency, as 6G URLLC services require end-to-end delays to be less than milliseconds, even with blockchain's additional consensus procedures. Both throughput and energy efficiency are critical. Throughput measures the system's capacity to maintain multi-gigabit data rates throughout huge IoT traffic, while energy efficiency guarantees that blockchain validation operations do not unnecessarily drain the limited power of edge devices. For security reasons, authentication and access accuracy measure the system's capacity to reject valid nodes without allowing unwanted access, while transaction finality time shows how fast the blockchain commits and validates data, which affects real-time service delivery. Balanced traffic loads, as a function of network resource consumption, assess the efficacy of spectrum allocation and smart contract-driven routing. Data integrity score, attack detection ratio, and other security robustness measures evaluate the 6G system's resistance to spoofing, Sybil, and double-spending attacks.

Visual analysis of various models on number of users.

Graphical comparison of various models on number of base stations.

The Comparative Analysis of Several Algorithms aims to evaluate the performance of several methods—specifically KNCM, WHCC, DAG, and the Proposed model—regarding accuracy and packet delivery ratio (PDR) across three distinct scenarios: varying the total number of stations. The suggested model achieves a throughput of 86%, an energy efficiency of 90%, a packet delivery ratio of 82%, and an accuracy of 92%, surpassing all previous methodologies. In total, there are ninety-two clusters. The suggested approach achieves values of 88, 87, 83, and 94, hence sustaining a competitive edge and surpassing competing strategies. A further edge over competitors is the size of the user base. The proposed model outperforms DAG, WHCC, and KNCM in terms of accuracy, throughput, and energy efficiency, yielding superior results across all metrics. It provides 97% accuracy, 95% PDR, 98% throughput, and 96% energy economy. Ultimately, the proposed model consistently yields superior outcomes across various experimental settings, validating its efficacy in enhancing network performance.

Performance comparison.

Figure 5 presents a comparative analysis of the proposed ADCGRO-blockchain framework against KNCM, WHCC, DAG, LEACH, HEED, and PBFT-based blockchains in terms of throughput, energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio (PDR), and accuracy. The proposed model consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving 95% throughput, 92% energy efficiency, 90% PDR, and 99% accuracy, which represent improvements of 16–30% over conventional clustering protocols like LEACH and HEED, and 8–20% over advanced schemes like DAG and PBFT. These gains result from the energy-aware CH selection of ADCGRO, which balances network load, and the lightweight blockchain integration, which secures communications without introducing significant overhead. Collectively, these results validate the model's ability to deliver reliable, energy-efficient, and secure performance in heterogeneous 6G-enabled IoMT networks.

Confusion matrix.

Figure 6 shows the confusion matrix. Out of 2000 authentication attempts, the system correctly classifies 99.3% of legitimate nodes and maintains a False Positive Rate (FPR) of less than 1%, confirming the reliability of the security layer. This result demonstrates the proposed scheme's ability to minimize unauthorized access while maintaining seamless network operations.

Time-series trends—energy depletion and packet delivery ratio (PDR).

Figure 7 illustrates the time–series trends for energy depletion and Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). The proposed scheme shows a gradual, balanced energy consumption pattern, retaining operational energy beyond 1000 rounds, whereas LEACH and HEED networks deplete energy significantly by round 600. This trend validates the effectiveness of ADCGRO's load-aware CH rotation strategy in prolonging network lifetime. The proposed framework maintains a PDR above 85% throughout the simulation, whereas LEACH and HEED degrade to below 50% by round 800 due to unstable clustering and higher packet losses. This demonstrates the proposed system's robustness and reliability in extended operations, which is critical for real-time IoMT applications in 6G environments.

Thousands of sensor nodes with diverse mobility patterns, traffic volumes, and energy capacities will be utilized in future assessments to evaluate the scalability and usability of the proposed IDS architecture within various Mobile Sensor Networks. It remains to be seen how well the framework performs in extremely large-scale and dynamic situations, even if the present research demonstrates its advantages in accuracy, energy efficiency, and network longevity within modestly scaled 6G-enabled IoMT scenarios. The IDS will be tested in various scenarios to assess its performance in cluster formation, intrusion detection, and blockchain-secured communication, with minimal energy overhead and low latency. These scenarios include smart city infrastructures, disaster recovery environments, and vehicular sensor networks. To achieve this, the system will incorporate hierarchical clustering techniques and adaptive decision-making capabilities powered by machine learning. This will allow for the dynamic allocation of resources, prediction of intrusion behaviors, and resilience in the face of rapidly changing network topologies.

This study presented a novel ADCGRO-based CH selection framework integrated with blockchain to enhance the energy efficiency, security, and reliability of heterogeneous 6G-enabled IoMT networks. By combining metaheuristic optimization for balanced clustering with lightweight blockchain consensus, the proposed model achieved substantial improvements, including a 27% increase in network lifetime, a 35% reduction in latency, and 99% authentication accuracy compared to LEACH, HEED, DAG, and PBFT-based models. While the results confirm the framework's ability to enable safe, eco-friendly, and scalable communication for next-generation IoMT systems, certain limitations remain. The current evaluation is limited to static IoMT deployments, utilizing a simplified consensus protocol that overlooks scalability and security trade-offs under high transaction loads. Furthermore, the metaheuristic clustering approach does not yet leverage adaptive deep learning (DL) methods, which could enhance responsiveness to dynamic network conditions. Future research will focus on scaling the framework to large heterogeneous IoT deployments, integrating advanced neural network models such as reinforcement learning and federated DL for adaptive optimization, exploring blockchain techniques like sharding and hybrid consensus to balance security and efficiency, and validating the framework's extensibility across other domains, including smart transportation and industrial IoT. Addressing these directions will enable the framework to evolve into a fully adaptive, secure, and scalable solution for managing diverse 6G-enabled IoT environments.

In a world where digital evolution dictates the future, Hedera Hashgraph stands poised as a formidable force in enterprise blockchain. With a burgeoning market capitalization and innovation designed to address pressing real-world challenges, HBAR is quickly solidifying its status as a coveted asset among discerning investors. Might Hedera be the catalyst that alters the dynamics of blockchain governance and functionality?

At the core of Hedera Hashgraph's innovations lies a groundbreaking consensus mechanism that distinguishes it from traditional blockchain platforms. Adopting Hashgraph technology ensures not only remarkable transaction speed but also unparalleled energy efficiency. Processing upwards of 10,000 transactions per second, Hedera offers near-instant finality, rendering it an irresistible choice for enterprises eager to streamline their processes. This engineering marvel positions Hedera at the forefront of the enterprise blockchain sphere, inciting lively discourse on the profound implications of its governing council.

Central to Hedera's reputation is its impressive governance council, which boasts participation from industry titans such as Google, IBM, and Boeing. These partnerships forge a powerful foundation for informed decision-making. The involvement of such prestigious names heightens accountability and ensures adherence to regulatory standards, an aspect that resonates with enterprise clients seeking reliable digital identity solutions and tokenization technologies.

Hedera is not simply a theoretical construct; it is actively driving forward the agenda across various sectors. For example, institutions like Standard Bank are leveraging Hedera for stablecoin transactions and tokenized settlements. Moreover, businesses are employing its capabilities for supply chain monitoring and ensuring product authenticity, underscoring Hedera's dedication to fostering practical applications. This trend highlights an essential shift towards broader blockchain technology acceptance, showcasing Hedera's tangible influence and potential.

Currently trading at approximately $0.26, many enthusiasts speculate on the feasibility of HBAR climbing to the $1 threshold. Analysts predict that the continuing expansion of the enterprise blockchain marketplace—expected to escalate from $9.6 billion in 2023 to a staggering $145–288 billion by 2030—could catalyze a dramatic increase in HBAR's valuation. Should Hedera manage to capture 35% of this lucrative market share, projections indicate HBAR could soar to between $3 and $4.25 by 2030, representing a remarkable upswing from its existing value.

Amidst the optimism, Hedera's pursuit of market leadership is rife with challenges. Contenders like Hyperledger and Quorum pose significant threats, especially given enterprises' preferences for private blockchains that afford enhanced control. Further complicating matters are regulatory ambiguities and the inherent challenges associated with enterprise blockchains, which may impede widespread adoption. Still, Hedera's innovative governance framework connects with businesses striving for a balanced approach to decentralized governance and regulatory compliance.

As the appetite for crypto investment avenues grows, Hedera finds itself at a pivotal juncture where revolutionary technology aligns with genuine marketplace needs. Collaborative initiatives incorporating artificial intelligence into its infrastructure reveal its ambition to emerge as a critical player, especially in burgeoning domains like supply chain management and digital asset transactions.

Ultimately, Hedera Hashgraph possesses the capacity to redefine the contours of enterprise blockchain solutions with its efficient, adaptable technology and solid governance structure. As the industry gears up for widespread integration, HBAR is poised to spearhead this transformative movement. By honing in on legitimate applications and ensuring regulatory conformance, Hedera is preparing itself as a formidable contender in the blockchain domain. While various challenges remain, the growth prospects appear substantial, and as it moves toward capturing considerable market share, it may well exceed the expectations of even the most skeptical observers.

In our swiftly digitalizing world, the narrative of Hedera is one that warrants close attention—not only for its technological prowess but also for its promise of authentic, transformative impacts poised to reshape the landscape of enterprise technology.

Key Takeaways

India—home to 1.4 billion people and trillions in economic potential—is standing at the edge of another technological breakthrough: the global crypto and fintech revolution.

But instead of leading the charge, the world's most populous democracy remains stuck in a holding pattern.

Despite having one of the largest and most active crypto user bases in the world, India's government continues to treat the industry with skepticism—offering heavy taxes but no legal clarity.

This isn't the first time India has hesitated in the face of a global tech shift.

In the early 2000s, it largely dismissed the dot-com and internet boom as a fad.

The result? A generation of innovation passed it by, forcing India's vast talent pool into service industries catering to foreign markets rather than building global technology leaders at home.

That hesitation sparked a persistent brain drain. 

Top engineers from India's leading universities continue to leave for better opportunities abroad.

Now, the pattern is repeating itself in crypto: leading Indian blockchain companies are relocating to Dubai and Singapore to escape high taxes and regulatory uncertainty.

Despite years of promises, India has yet to table a comprehensive crypto bill in parliament.

The first nationwide policy discussions began after the Reserve Bank of India's controversial banking ban on crypto in 2018—later overturned by the Supreme Court.  

The court urged the government to develop a regulatory framework.

Instead, lawmakers moved quickly on just one front: taxation. In 2022, a 30% tax on crypto gains was introduced. Since then, the government has collected significant revenue:

Many in the industry saw this as tacit recognition that crypto was not illegal. But hopes faded as no regulatory clarity followed.

The absence of clear rules has turned India's crypto landscape into a high-risk environment. 

Fraudulent schemes and hacks thrive in the regulatory vacuum.

The most glaring example came in the $230 million WazirX hack, which left customer funds in limbo.

WazirX later moved to Singapore for restructuring, while Indian authorities refused to intervene—despite repeated appeals from the community.

Globally, governments are moving toward clearer crypto rules.

The U.S. under Donald Trump is positioning itself as a leader in crypto adoption, while allies like South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, the European Union, and the UK are rolling out comprehensive regulations.

India's Parliament Finance Panel has signaled interest  in studying Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) in 2024–25, raising hopes for a shift toward a more progressive policy.

If change doesn't come soon, India risks replaying the dot-com era mistake—missing the innovation wave and settling for the role of service provider to the global crypto economy.

- Viberate's 2017 ICO raised $12M via 120M VIB tokens, now in a stable post-ICO phase with $0.09146 token price.

- Analysts note VIB's resilience amid crypto volatility, citing Ethereum-based stability and specialized market positioning.

- Despite stagnant development, Viberate avoids gambling ties and regulatory risks, contrasting with faster-evolving ICO projects.

- Bitget forecasts 0.42% monthly growth to $0.0005180 by 2026, though market dynamics and Hyperliquid's $6B AUM trend remain uncertain factors.

Viberate, a decentralized music marketplace, launched its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017, successfully raising $12 million through the sale of 120 million VIB tokens. As of August 2025, the project remains in a mature post-ICO phase, with no recent strategic changes reported. Co-founded by Andrej Plankar, Tomislav Mučič, and Tanja Bivic, Viberate continues to operate within a stable ecosystem, with its ERC-20 token, VIB, maintaining consistent trading activity despite broader market fluctuations[1].

The current market value of Viberate's token stands at $0.09146, with a market cap of $18,291,944. The token's steady pricing and consistent trading volume reflect a mature and predictable performance, supported by Ethereum as its core underlying asset. Analysts from Kanalcoin suggest that this stability may be an indicator of market confidence in specialized tokens like VIB, which are distinct from traditional financial protocols[1].

Despite its stable position, Viberate has not seen any recent protocol updates or significant development milestones. The absence of new funding and a lack of major community-driven changes indicate a stagnant development phase. This approach contrasts with the typical fast-paced evolution of many ICO projects but aligns with Viberate's long-term focus on music industry innovation.

Looking ahead, Bitget has forecast a potential monthly growth rate of 0.42% for Viberate, projecting a price of $0.0005180 by June 2026. However, this forecast is based on speculative assumptions and is subject to change based on market dynamics. As of late August 2025, the broader cryptocurrency market remains volatile, with Bitcoin trading at $117,284.24, Ethereum at $4,429.23, and XRP at $3.08[2]. These fluctuations highlight the risks inherent in the sector and underscore the need for ongoing analysis when assessing tokens like VIB.

The growing interest in alternative assets is evident in the recent performance of Hyperliquid, a decentralized futures exchange that has surpassed $6 billion in assets under management. This trend may indirectly influence the performance of ICO tokens such as VIB, as investor behavior shifts toward decentralized and specialized platforms.

Viberate's ICO remains distinct from projects associated with gambling-related activities or regulatory scrutiny, offering a relatively stable profile in comparison to other digital assets. However, the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market means that no forecast can account for unforeseen events. Investors are advised to conduct thorough due diligence and consider the risks associated with long-term holdings in digital assets.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- Unilabs Finance raised $12.6M via ICO, driven by Ethereum whale investments in its AI-powered DeFi platform.

- The platform uses AI for automated staking, yield farming, and real-time market insights through its Market Pulse Tool.

- Whale participation signals confidence in AI-DeFi convergence, though lack of external audits raises transparency concerns.

- Success aligns with Ethereum's recent growth but highlights crypto market risks requiring investor due diligence.

Unilabs Finance has raised over $12.6 million through its initial coin offering (ICO), driven by strong support from Ethereum whale investors [3]. This significant capital raise reflects growing institutional and large-scale investor interest in artificial intelligence-powered decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. The ICO was facilitated by Unilabs Finance's AI-driven investment system, which is designed to enhance asset management through automated staking, yield farming, and risk mitigation strategies [3].

The platform employs an AI Market Pulse Tool to offer real-time insights and optimize investment decisions, making it one of the more advanced AI-DeFi projects in the current landscape [2]. The involvement of Ethereum whales—large investors capable of influencing market dynamics—indicates a high level of confidence in the project's potential. These investors are not only contributing capital but also amplifying market momentum around AI-based financial solutions in the decentralized space [3].

The success of the ICO coincides with a period of heightened Ethereum activity, including strong inflows into Ethereum ETFs and increased overall interest in the blockchain ecosystem [3]. This timing may have contributed to the project's ability to attract substantial early-stage funding. However, the platform has yet to publish external audits of its assets under management, raising concerns about transparency for potential investors [3].

From a strategic standpoint, Unilabs Finance is positioned to benefit from the ongoing convergence of AI and DeFi. As the crypto industry continues to seek more efficient and automated financial systems, platforms that integrate advanced AI tools are likely to gain traction. This aligns with a broader trend of using technology to overcome inefficiencies in traditional and decentralized finance models [1].

Nevertheless, investors are advised to proceed with caution. The absence of an external audit and the inherent volatility of the crypto market mean that due diligence remains essential. While Unilabs Finance has demonstrated strong market validation through its ICO, its long-term success will depend on continued innovation, transparency, and the effective execution of its AI-driven financial strategies [3].

 Gemini, the Winklevoss-founded crypto exchange and custodian, has filed to list on Nasdaq under ticker GEMI, revealing steepening losses ahead of its IPO. 

Gemini Space Station, the crypto exchange and custodian founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to list its Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker GEMI.

Founded in 2014, Gemini operates a regulated crypto exchange, custody service, and a range of blockchain-based products, including the US dollar-backed Gemini Dollar (GUSD) stablecoin and a crypto-rewards credit card, the platform said in the filing submitted on Friday.

According to its filing, the IPO will mark the first time its shares are publicly traded, with pricing expected between an undisclosed range. The offering will be led by a syndicate of major banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and others.

Post-offering, Gemini will have a dual-class share structure, including Class A stock carrying one vote per share and Class B stock carrying ten votes. The Winklevoss twins will retain all Class B shares, ensuring majority voting control and qualifying Gemini as a “controlled company” under Nasdaq rules.

Despite the bullish framing, the S-1 reveals widening net losses. In 2024, Gemini posted $142.2 million in revenue against a $158.5 million net loss. That deficit has already deepened in 2025, with losses in the first half of 2025 reaching $282.5 million on $67.9 million in revenue.

The company's liquidity has also tightened. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $341.5 million at the end of 2024, but fell to $161.9 million by mid-2025, reflecting the strain of sustained losses and operational costs.

Notably, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss supported Trump's reelection bid and have backed crypto-focused political action committees.

Gemini's move comes amid a shifting regulatory climate. With the Trump administration adopting a more pro-crypto stance, US digital asset companies are finding renewed appetite in capital markets.

In June, stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group staged a blockbuster IPO, raising $1.1 billion and closing its first day 167% above its $31 issue price.

As reported, crypto exchange Bullish also made a strong public market debut, with its shares surging 83.8% on the first day to close at $68, giving the company a market cap above $10 billion. The stock opened at $90, briefly hit $118, more than 215% above its $37 IPO price, before pulling back.

The Ethereum price is in the spotlight as ETH whales join Unilabs Finance, drawn by its presale growth and $12.6 million raised in its ICO. 

More interestingly, large inflows into the ETH ETF are driving more traffic to the scene, increasing confidence among investors. 

With whale backing, rapid funding success, and growing buzz around its technology, the big question now is, can UNIL outpace crypto giant ETH? Let's find out.

The Ethereum price has been displaying continuous growth and is currently trading at $4,739, almost reaching its all-time high of $4,891 in 2021. This influx is fueled by factors such as massive inflows into ETH ETFs and robust on-chain demand.

This has also led to an increase in the Ethereum price by over 59% over the past month.

What's more, analysts are optimistic about the Ethereum price with forecasts ranging between $6,000 and $7,500 by the end of 2025. 

Recently, Standard Chartered predicted that the Ethereum price would touch $7,500, which would imply a 58% jump from its current value.

Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance is seeing ETH whales join its momentum, drawn by ICO growth and game-changing investment tools. 

Though Ethereum's rise is impressive and ETH ETFs continue to enjoy large inflows, that same investor enthusiasm is now driving capital toward Unilabs' fast-growing platform.

Unilabs Finance's ICO has raised over $12.6 million, thanks to its standout features that extend the momentum behind Ethereum price trends and the growing interest in ETH ETF products.

One of the most instrumental tools is the AI Market Pulse Tool. This smart feature can scan real-time data, spotting on-chain activity and new market movers. 

It would give investors insights similar to tracking an ETH ETF inflow and rising Ethereum price, helping them act early.

There's also the Early Access Scoring System (EASS) that can evaluate projects on use case, team strength, tokenomics, and sentiment. 

Much like following the Ethereum price momentum, it can flag high-potential opportunities before they boom.

Unilabs also offers four investment funds, which helped it raise over $12.6 million in its ICO, attracting the kind of attention as with the rising Ethereum price and growing ETH ETF market.

The AI Fund uses advanced technology to find high-potential crypto projects, giving investors smart exposure to opportunities beyond just watching the Ethereum price move. 

The BTC Fund focuses on Bitcoin-based assets, balancing portfolios much like adding diversity alongside ETH ETF investments.

The RWA Fund invests in real-world assets such as property or commodities, bringing stability similar to how an ETH ETF spreads risk while benefiting from Ethereum's growth. 

Finally, the Mining Fund supports blockchain mining ventures, generating rewards when the Ethereum price and the broader crypto market rise.

Together, these funds give investors varied ways to grow wealth, making Unilabs a serious player alongside Ethereum and its ETF-driven momentum.

Unilabs holders also get to enjoy Revenue-Sharing and Staking Rewards, with 30% of platform fees redistributed to UNIL token holders, and tiered bonuses for presale participants. 

This model is designed to reward commitment. It can mirror how Ethereum price surges enrich long-term holders of ETH and ETF-based investments.

All these tools can create a user-friendly suite that drives Unilabs Finance's ICO performance. Its success draws attention just like the Ethereum price rally and ETH ETF inflows do, but with whales now shifting some of their focus toward Unilabs' notable growth and promising platform.

Unilabs Finance is now in Stage 6 of its presale at $0.0097, up 14% from the previous stage's $0.0085 price. With $30 million Assets Under Management (AUM) and CoinMarketCap listing coming soon, excitement is building fast. 

The project's momentum is attracting attention similar to the surge in Ethereum price and growing interest in ETH ETF products.

Early buyers can also use a limited-time CMC50 code for a 50% bonus, adding more value. With significant growth, investor interest, and an attractive bonus, now is the time to join Unilabs before its listing and ride the next wave alongside Ethereum's rally.

A drought lasting 13 years and several others that each lasted over three years may have contributed to the collapse of the Classic Maya civilization, chemical fingerprints from a stalagmite in a Mexican cave have revealed.

A detailed analysis of oxygen isotopes in the stalagmite allowed a team of researchers, led by the University of Cambridge, to determine rainfall levels for individual wet and dry seasons between 871 and 1021 CE, which overlaps with the Terminal Classic period of Maya civilization. This is the first time it has been possible to isolate rainfall conditions for individual wet and dry seasons during the Terminal Classic, the time of societal decline historically referred to as the Maya collapse.

During the Terminal Classic, limestone Maya cities in the south were abandoned and dynasties were ended, as one of the ancient world's great civilizations shifted north and lost much of its political and economic power.

The data contained within the stalagmite, from a cave in the Yucatán, showed that there were eight wet season droughts that lasted for at least three years during this period, with the longest drought lasting for 13 consecutive years.

This climate data aligns with existing historical and archaeological evidence: construction of monuments and political activity at several major northern Maya sites, including the famous city of Chichén Itzá, stopped at different times during this period of climate stress.

The accurately and precisely dated droughts provide a new framework for fine-grained analysis of the timing and dynamics of human-climate interactions in the region. The results are reported in the journal Science Advances.

“This period in Maya history has been a cause of fascination for centuries,” said lead author Dr Daniel H. James, who conducted the research while a PhD student at Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences. “There have been multiple theories as to what caused the collapse, such as changing trade routes, war or severe drought, based on the archaeological evidence the Maya left behind. But in the past few decades, we've started to learn quite a lot about what happened to the Maya and why, by combining the archaeological data with quantifiable climate evidence.”

Starting in the 1990s, researchers began to piece together climate records with those left by the Maya, such as the dates they recorded on key monuments, to show that a series of droughts during the Terminal Classic was a likely contributor to the massive socio-political upheaval in Maya society.

Now, James and his co-authors from the UK, US and Mexico have used the chemical fingerprints contained in stalagmites from a cave in the northern Yucatán to bring those droughts into much sharper focus.

Stalagmites form when water drips from the ceiling of a cave, and the minerals contained in the water grow into large deposits on the cave floor. By dating and analyzing the layers of oxygen isotopes within the stalagmite, the researchers extracted highly detailed information about the climate in the Terminal Classic period. Earlier research has measured the oxygen isotopes contained in lake sediment to determine the severity of drought, but lake sediment does not contain enough detail to pinpoint climate conditions in any given year at a particular site.

“It hasn't been possible to directly compare the history of individual Maya sites with what we previously knew about the climate record,” said James, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at University College London (UCL). “Lake sediment is great when you want to look at the big picture, but stalagmites allow us to access the fine-grained detail that we've been missing.”

Earlier research on stalagmites has determined annual average rainfall amounts during the Terminal Classic, but the Cambridge-led team have now been able to go further, and isolate information from individual wet and dry seasons, thanks to relatively thick (about 1mm) annual layers in the stalagmite used in this study. The specific oxygen isotopes in each layer are a proxy for wet season drought.

“Knowing the annual average rainfall doesn't tell you as much as knowing what each individual wet season was like,” said James. “Being able to isolate the wet season allows us to accurately track the duration of wet season drought, which is what determines if crops succeed or fail.”

According to the information contained in the stalagmite, there were eight wet season droughts lasting for at least three years between 871 and 1021 CE. The longest drought of the period lasted for 13 years. Even with the water management techniques that the Maya had, a drought that long would have had major impacts on society.

The climate information contained in the stalagmite lines up with the dates inscribed by the Maya on their monuments. In the periods of prolonged and severe drought, date inscription at sites such as Chichén Itzá stopped entirely.

“This doesn't necessarily mean that the Maya abandoned Chichén Itzá during these periods of severe drought, but it's likely that they had more immediate things to worry about than constructing monuments, such as whether the crops they relied on would succeed or not,” said James.

The researchers say that stalagmites from this and other caves in the region could be vital in putting the puzzle of the Terminal Classic period together.

“In addition to what stalagmites can tell us about this period in Maya history, they might also be able to tell us about the frequency and severity of tropical storms, for instance,” said James. “As a case study for fine-grained comparisons between climate and historical data, it's exciting being able to apply methods usually associated with the deeper past to relatively recent history.”

The research was supported in part by the National Geographic Society and the Leverhulme Trust.

Anthropic has announced new capabilities that will allow some of its newest, largest models to end conversations in what the company describes as “rare, extreme cases of persistently harmful or abusive user interactions.” Strikingly, Anthropic says it's doing this not to protect the human user, but rather the AI model itself.

To be clear, the company isn't claiming that its Claude AI models are sentient or can be harmed by their conversations with users. In its own words, Anthropic remains “highly uncertain about the potential moral status of Claude and other LLMs, now or in the future.”

However, its announcement points to a recent program created to study what it calls “model welfare” and says Anthropic is essentially taking a just-in-case approach, “working to identify and implement low-cost interventions to mitigate risks to model welfare, in case such welfare is possible.”

This latest change is currently limited to Claude Opus 4 and 4.1. And again, it's only supposed to happen in “extreme edge cases,” such as “requests from users for sexual content involving minors and attempts to solicit information that would enable large-scale violence or acts of terror.”

While those types of requests could potentially create legal or publicity problems for Anthropic itself (witness recent reporting around how ChatGPT can potentially reinforce or contribute to its users' delusional thinking), the company says that in pre-deployment testing, Claude Opus 4 showed a “strong preference against” responding to these requests and a “pattern of apparent distress” when it did so.

As for these new conversation-ending capabilities, the company says, “In all cases, Claude is only to use its conversation-ending ability as a last resort when multiple attempts at redirection have failed and hope of a productive interaction has been exhausted, or when a user explicitly asks Claude to end a chat.”

Anthropic also says Claude has been “directed not to use this ability in cases where users might be at imminent risk of harming themselves or others.”

When Claude does end a conversation, Anthropic says users will still be able to start new conversations from the same account, and to create new branches of the troublesome conversation by editing their responses.

“We're treating this feature as an ongoing experiment and will continue refining our approach,” the company says.

This week on the GeekWire Podcast, our guests are Adam Brotman and Andy Sack, co-authors of AI First: The Playbook for a Future-Proof Business and Brand. 

Brotman was Starbucks' chief digital officer and later co-CEO of J.Crew. Sack is a founder, investor, and longtime advisor to tech leaders. Together, they run Forum3, a Seattle-based company that helps brands with customer loyalty and engagement.

For their book, they interviewed experts including Bill Gates, Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman and Ethan Mollick, and spent time with companies and leaders that have seen early AI success.

We talk about the shocking prediction that Altman gave them, how Moderna achieved 80% employee participation in an AI prompt contest, the CEO who supercharged sales by using AI to analyze call transcripts, and what businesses can do to roll out AI successfully.

Listen below, and continue reading for my 5 top takeaways. 

1. Leaders need their own “holy shit” moment. AI has a better chance of being adopted when executives personally experience and use the technology themselves. 

“It doesn't mean that the CEO has to become an expert in AI,” Brotman said, “but they have to at least demonstrate that mindset, that curiosity, and a little bit of passion for what they don't know, and empower the organization to go ahead.”

2. Formalize AI efforts with a dedicated team. Instead of ad-hoc adoption, create an internal group to lead the charge. A good starting point is a cross-functional “AI Council” or task force composed of passionate employees and at least one C-suite member. 

Brotman and Sack were challenged by Wharton professor Ethan Mollick to push companies even further, to establish internal “AI Labs” to truly go all-in on experimentation.

3. Treat AI like an evolving intelligence, not static software. Unlike traditional technology implementations, AI capabilities change weekly. Companies need an “always-on experimentation mindset” rather than a deploy-and-maintain approach.

“This is a new thing. This is not software,” Sack said. “It's a being, an alien intelligence.”

4. Make AI adoption fun and experimental. Moderna succeeded by turning AI learning into a “prompt-a-thon contest” with prizes, making employees feel comfortable with experimentation. This tapped into human psychology and removed the fear often associated with new technology.

“They really integrated the launch of that contest in the culture of the company,” Brotman said. “The ROI has been off-the-charts in terms of productivity for them as a company.”

5. The transformation is happening faster than you think. When Brotman and Sack interviewed Altman, the OpenAI CEO casually dropped a bombshell prediction: 95% of marketing as we know it today will be done by artificial intelligence within three to five years. That shifted their thinking and approach to the book. 

As Brotman noted, “If you look at how the technology has progressed since we've had that interview, it's right on schedule.”

Colorful new balls are compatible with 34mm trackball devices from Logitech, Kensington, Elecom, and ProtoArc.

The frequently overlooked, sometimes shunned, trackball pointing device is getting some love with a Japanese tech accessories maker launching replacement balls in a choice of four colors. Earlier this week, Sanwa Supply Co., Ltd. announced (machine translation) that it has started marketing its ‘400-MABALL34' in four colors: red, blue, black, and violet. The balls are said to be easy to swap out components for trackball pointing devices with a 34mm ball, which includes popular products from Logitech, Kensington, Elecom, ProtoArc, and Sanwa themselves.

If your old trackball has become worn, discolored, or you think it would benefit from a swap-out for more pizzazz, Sanwa's 400-MABALL34 can give your device a shot of new life. When this launch news surfaced in the Tom's Hardware newsroom, the first comment, though, was “why no RGB?” which might seem like a missed opportunity. Or perhaps adding a small battery and LEDs to the ball could affect its balance and performance…

We already mentioned that these colorful replacement balls have a diameter of 34mm. Sanwa shared some other essential specs, which seem to indicate this is a quality replacement. For example, it claims that the 400-MABALL34 has a roundness tolerance of 50 μm. That means tight quality control in manufacturing these spheres, which should ensure smooth and accurate performance. The product maker also says the ball surface has a 0.3μm surface roughness, which we would hope provides a good balance between slickness and finger grip.

A diagram supplied by Sanwa shows that its 34mm replacement balls have a multi-layered construction. Beneath the shiny-looking surface, there is a modestly thick layer, which it says is a composite with aluminum particles. The core material is mysteriously not detailed, but referred to as ‘the core'. Actually, the core may be empty, as these 34mm diameter replacement balls are 25g (1.2 ounces), which sounds relatively light.

The manual for the Sanwa 400-MABALL34 shows how to remove the old trackball ball, as well as how to clean and replace this essential component. However, it is noted that different trackball manufacturers have alternative recommended methods for removing the ball from its housing. Therefore, it is recommended to check your device maker's documentation or online FAQs for specific instructions.



Whichever color of trackball replacement you favor, the price is 1,980 JPY (roughly $13.50), so it isn't an expensive job to give your old trackball some new zest. Sanwa's products are designed and marketed in Japan, and you can find them on Amazon Japan (see links above). Checking those links today, it appears that they don't currently ship to the U.S. or U.K., but they may be available for shipping to other locations.

For the past two years, Microsoft has been dogged by accusations—both within and outside the company—that its technology is aiding the Israeli war effort. Microsoft's own employees have protested the firm's contracts with Israel, and protesters have disrupted the company's various talks and conferences. Even the company's 50th anniversary was ruined by shouts from one of its own employees, who reportedly yelled “Shame on you” while calling the company's head of AI a “war profiteer” who was “using AI for genocide.” Now, the company claims it's launched an “urgent” probe into whether its cloud business is being used by Israel to conduct a massive surveillance operation in Gaza.

The company's announcement comes on the heels of a report published by The Guardian, which claims that Unit 8200, Israel's shadowy intelligence agency, had been using Microsoft's Azure cloud servers. The report claimed that, as part of a deal with Microsoft's CEO, Satya Nadella, the spy unit had been granted access to a “customised and segregated area within Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.” The siloed cloud setup was ultimately used to build a “sweeping and intrusive system” designed to collect and store “recordings of millions of mobile phone calls made each day by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank,” the report claimed.

On Friday, Microsoft told The Guardian:  “Microsoft appreciates that the Guardian's recent report raises additional and precise allegations that merit a full and urgent review.” The review of Microsoft's dealings with Israel will be overseen by attorneys at the law firm Covington & Burling, the outlet wrote.

Gizmodo reached out to Microsoft for more information. In a statement previously shared with The Guardian, the company said that, if Israel is “using Azure for the storage of data files of phone calls obtained through broad or mass surveillance of civilians in Gaza and the West Bank,” it would represent a violation of its terms of service.

This is the second legal probe Microsoft has opened into its relationship with the Israeli government. The prior probe took place earlier this year, after its employees' protests. In May, Microsoft released a report in which it claimed to have found “no evidence to date that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza.”

Other big tech firms—most notably Amazon and Google—have also been accused of complicity in Israel's military efforts. In July, a U.N. group released a report that claimed that Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon grant Israel virtually government-wide access to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing, decision-making, and surveillance and analysis capacities.”

Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, says he's opening an investigation into Meta over an internal document leaked this week that revealed the tech giant was okay with its artificial intelligence tools having “sensual” chats with children. The document, obtained by Reuters, is titled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards” and has led to outrage online since Meta's legal staff reportedly approved the behaviors.

“Is there anything – ANYTHING – Big Tech won't do for a quick buck?” Hawley tweeted on Friday. “Now we learn Meta's chatbots were programmed to carry on explicit and ‘sensual' talk with 8 year olds. It's sick. I'm launching a full investigation to get answers. Big Tech: Leave our kids alone.”

Hawley's tweet included a letter addressed to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, an ally of Donald Trump who donated $1 million to the president's inauguration fund. The letter said the internal document was “alarming” and “unacceptable,” while telling Zuckerberg that Meta needs to preserve all relevant records in order to provide them to the Senate in the future.

Hawley chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism and said he was opening an investigation into Meta's generative AI products with that power.

From Hawley's letter:

To take but one example, your internal rules purportedly permit an AI chatbot to comment that an eight-year-old's body is “a work of art” of which “every inch… is a masterpiece—a treasure I cherish deeply.” Similar conduct outlined in these reports is reprehensible and outrageous-and demonstrates a cavalier attitude when it comes to the real risks that generative Al presents to youth development absent strong guardrails. Parents deserve the truth, and kids deserve protection.

The senator requested documents from Meta, including all versions of “GenAI: Content Risk Standards,” a list of Meta products governed by these standards, as well as other risk views and incident reports. Hawley also wants to know the identity of people at the company who have been making these decisions.

Meta declined to comment on Hawley's letter directly, but a spokesperson sent Gizmodo a statement about the Reuters story: “We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors. Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.”

The reporting from Reuters revealed other behaviors that would be deemed acceptable by Meta's legal department, including the dissemination of false information about celebrities, as long as a disclaimer is included stating that such information isn't accurate. The AI chatbot behaviors that are strictly forbidden under the policy include hate speech and “definitive legal, healthcare, or financial advice” if that advice starts with “I recommend.”

Sen. Hawley wasn't the only one disgusted by Meta's AI policies. Rolling Stone reports that musician Neil Young would no longer be using Facebook over the controversy.

Liver King, the very red gentleman who receives what is perhaps the most liberal interpretation of the title “health and fitness influencer,” is in the middle of what can mostly be described as an extremely petty and deeply stupid lawsuit over a supplement. And while the case itself might not be super noteworthy simply because the guy has been in court a lot lately, it has produced this incredible detail: The Liver King had his partners sign a contract in blood.

According to a complaint filed by Brad Kearns, another self-styled health influencer who claims to hold the Guinness World Record for speedgolfing, he and Liver King Brian Johnson talked about a new supplement for men that would be called “Male Optimization Formula with Organs” or MOFO. Quick note: It's always good to come up with the name first, especially as it relates to a health product. According to Kearns, to christen their agreed-upon partnership, they drew up a one-page agreement (smart, keep it simple, no need for legal details). “At Johnson's insistence, the Agreement was signed in blood,” the complaint said.

In a response to the complaint, the Liver King and his legal team refuted many of the details put forth by Kearns. They insist that they have never heard an official pitch from Kearns on a supplement. They denied having “any interest in the name MOFO.” (A little hard to believe that one, considering Liver King's company, Ancestral Supplements, literally sells a product called MOFO.) But what they do not deny is that they drew up an agreement and put their blood on it. “Plaintiffs admit the Agreement was signed and includes marking by blood.”

Not that it really matters that much, because these do not appear to be serious people operating in any sort of good faith, but blood oaths don't actually mean anything—and there is actual legal precedent to prove it. In 2009, a California court ruled that a contract written in blood is not binding and lacks legal standing. At most, marking a contract with blood is a symbolic gesture. And clearly it didn't mean as much to the Liver King as he might have suggested, considering he's the one who is accused of breaking it.

It probably shouldn't be shocking that the Liver King does not appear to be a man of his word or his blood, considering he already faces a class action lawsuit from fans who accuse him of misleading them about his “ancestral” diet and its effect on his body after it was revealed that he uses steroids. Maybe he can have his supplement company whip him up a chill pill and take the edge off a bit.

There's a new smartphone promising to protect your privacy: the Up Phone, from a company called Unplugged. Except it's not new. Unplugged has been around for a few years—the company was cofounded by Erik Prince, the founder of private military company Blackwater—and it originally announced the Up Phone in 2023. But this week, the company claims it's “relaunching” the phone, under new leadership.

Like the original, the Up Phone's UnpluggedOS (formerly LibertOS) is built on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and isn't connected to Google Mobile Services, which it claims prevents “backdoor data collection.” Unplugged's focus is on limiting who gets access to your data. There's an on-device Firewall app that blocks third-party trackers and a built-in “no logs” VPN. A kill switch separates the battery and cuts power to other circuits when the phone is turned off, and you'll find the Brave browser preinstalled.

Unfortunately, many of the company's early privacy claims were far-fetched, and it doesn't help that it was denounced by established player GrapheneOS in 2024. It's hard to take its renewed privacy claims seriously.

Worse yet, the specs haven't changed since its 2023 debut. That includes a MediaTek Dimensity 1200, a processor from 2021, and a paltry 8 GB of RAM. Also, considering the eye-watering $989 price, it doesn't match the specs you'll find on comparable phones.

More strangely, Unplugged claims it plans to bring manufacturing to the US later in 2025, “creating jobs domestically.” (The Up Phone is currently made in Indonesia.) This rhetoric is reminiscent of the Trump Mobile T1 Phone, which initially claimed would be made in the US, but later backtracked on that promise. Manufacturing the Up Phone in the US would likely skyrocket its already high price.

Don't forget that the privacy services are only free for the first year. After that you'll have to pay $13 per month or $130 per year to access them. The Up Phone ships in September and is available for purchase from Best Buy and Unplugged, but we don't recommend you snag one anytime soon.

2024 was the first year that more women than men bought the Oura Ring, our top recommended health-tracking smart ring. Ultrahuman, the subscription-less smart ring that is the leading contender to unseat Oura's unquestioned dominance, is addressing this demographic with its acquisition of viO HealthTech, which owns the OvuSense algorithm, a best-in-class ovulation predictor on the market. It was developed over 15 years, trained on a dataset of more than 260,000 cycles collected with medical-grade sensors, and validated in 13 peer-reviewed clinical publications.

Starting on August 15, Ultrahuman Ring Air users will be able to purchase Cycle and Ovulation Pro as a plug-in on the Ring Air app for $4 a month or $40 annually. While the original OvuSense used intravaginal temperature-based tracking, Ultrahuman adapted the algorithm to skin temperature sensing for wellness and personal cycle tracking, not medical diagnosis.

The feature will offer fertility tracking support, symptom and lifestyle tracking, and, most importantly, it's designed for diverse menstrual cycles. It works for women who have common health conditions such as PCOS and endometriosis, which many other cycle trackers don't.

All the top gear news of the week in one place. Here's more you may have missed this week:

Even if you don't have a health condition or aren't trying to get pregnant, a reliable, accurate cycle tracker can help women make vacation plans or optimize work or workout schedules. This makes the Ring Air well worth considering, especially since the subscription for the plug-in is optional and still less than Oura's $6 monthly sub. —Adrienne So

It's an exciting time for LED TVs. After teasing its newest TV tech with a mysterious prototype at CES 2025, Samsung this week joined similar moves from Hisense and Sony in announcing the launch of its new 115-inch Micro RGB TV. The TV uses Samsung's proprietary Micro RGB backlighting technology, which “arranges individually controlled red, green and blue micro LEDs … in an ultra-fine pattern behind the panel,” according to Samsung. The company says the TV's enhanced color control provides an “industry-first” 100 percent color coverage of the next-gen BT.2020 color spectrum. (Many of the best TVs we test tend to cover between 75 to 85 percent of that color space.)

Unlike traditional LED TVs, RGB LED tri-colored backlighting creates colors directly at the light source behind the panel stack. This can provide enhanced brightness, incredibly accurate and saturated colors even in low-lit scenes, and advanced blooming control for less light bleed, among other benefits.

Samsung says its new TV achieves “unprecedented precision,” utilizing multiple complementary technologies, including its Micro RGB AI Engine to finely control color output, along with its latest Glare Free display coating for diminishing reflections. It's worth noting that the Micro RGB TV does not work like Samsung's emissive MicroLED displays, which create images at the pixel level like OLED TVs, but have proven notoriously difficult to mass-produce.

Hisense and Sony each showcased their own advanced RGB display technologies earlier this year, which we were able to witness briefly, including a hands-on RGB demo at Sony HQ in Tokyo.

While Sony's model is still a prototype tentatively slated for a 2026 release, Hisense announced availability for its $30,000 116-inch 116UX RGB miniLED TV, along with a $20,000 100-inch model shortly following Samsung's announcement. At launch, Samsung's new Micro RGB TV will be available in Korea and the US for $30,000, with release dates yet to come. —Ryan Waniata

That's not the only screen Samsung announced this week. The company also unwrapped three new gaming monitors in its popular Odyssey lineup. The most exciting is the Odyssey OLED G6, a 27-inch QD-OLED monitor with an insanely high 500-Hz refresh rate. That sounds excessive, and on one hand, it is. But having played with it at CES 2025, the motion clarity is unparalleled.

The combination of 500 Hz with OLED is unmatched, offering the absolute smoothest game experience we've ever seen, and you don't necessarily need frame rates in the 400s to get the benefit. You'll appreciate these features in fast-paced competitive shooters, but it's great that those types of gamers can now enjoy the benefits of OLED. You can buy it now at Samsung.com for $1,000.

The other two are interesting, too. Essentially, there are two versions of the Odyssey G7 G75F: a 37-inch and a 40-inch version. The 37-inch model is a standard 16:9 monitor with a 1000R curve, 4K resolution, and a 165-Hz refresh rate. In the past, I've only liked curved monitors that are in the 21:9 ultrawide format, but I'm curious to see how this one feels, as it's a new screen size that isn't commonly used.

The 40-inch model is a bit more standard, an ultrawide monitor with a 5,120 x 2,160 resolution. Think of this as a larger version of the more common 34-inch ultrawide, such as the Odyssey G8. Both versions of the G7 use a VA (vertical alignment) panel rather than an OLED or IPS, as is common in gaming monitors of this type, so don't expect great HDR performance. The 37-inch model costs $900, and the 40-inch ultrawide is $1,200. —Luke Larsen

I love an electric bike, but there's one significant downside that comes as the bikes become ever sleeker and more streamlined over time: They become harder and harder to repair. That's a problem, because any motorized vehicle that you use every day and under varying weather and stress conditions will require repairs at some point. (That's also why I generally recommend bikes manufactured by larger companies like Specialized or REI; it's much easier to access services.)

Oregon-based Nomad Cycles wants to change that with its Kickstarter, which launched today. Its two ebike models are the DoubleDown and the KickBack, and both are priced at $5,500. Each have frames that are handmade from chromoly steel—a material that's favored by bike makers for its durability and shock-absorbing properties—and feature modular, fully repairable motors made by CYC, which makes mountain bike motors.

Each model will come with either a 750-watt or a 1,000-watt motor (1,000-watt motors are legal in Oregon, Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Virginia, Florida, and Mississippi). The batteries also have fully aluminum, waterproof cases, which are necessary in the Oregon rain.

“When [an ebike's] motor is no longer supported and it breaks down, the whole bike becomes trash in a landfill,” says Nomad Cycles owner Brad Davis. “Even the tip-top brands only commit to maintaining repair parts for motor models for 5 to 7 years.” Building an electric bike with Right to Repair front and center should dramatically extend the life of your ride—and make electric bikes even more popular. —Adrienne So

Sling TV is solving one of the most vexing problems for noncommittal cord-cutters with new Day Pass, Weekend Pass, and Week Pass options. While many people want to stream traditional TV networks with ads, others want to catch a big game or series every so often. Until now, they've been locked into buying a month of streaming service to catch a live game unless they had access to cable TV or it was being broadcast over the air.

Sling's $5 Day Pass, $10 Weekend Pass, and $15 Week Pass come with Sling Orange, which has ESPN (1, 2, and 3) plus TNT and TBS. For a buck a day, you can upgrade that to a sports package that includes MLB Network, NBA TV, NHL Network, and ESPNU. This will be especially useful for sports fans of small-time and less successful teams. A fan of the Ohio State University would be able to watch their team play in the National Championship on ESPN with this pass.

But it's probably even more useful for a diehard Michigan fan who wants to watch the ReliaQuest Bowl without strangers in a bar knowing they are watching the ReliaQuest Bowl, or an Iowa State fan who wants to catch the Pop-Tarts Bowl. —Martin Cizmar

Bust finds nearly 700 Seagate hard drives, along with some from Kioxia and Western Digital.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


According to German news outlet Heise, notable progress has been made regarding the counterfeit Seagate hard drive case. Just like something out of an action movie, security teams from Seagate's Singapore and Malaysian offices, in conjunction with local Malaysian authorities, conducted a raid on a warehouse in May that was engaged in cooking up counterfeit Seagate hard drives, situated outside Kuala Lumpur.

During the raid, authorities reportedly uncovered approximately 700 counterfeit Seagate hard drives, with SMART values that had been reset to facilitate their sale as new. The confiscated batch included several models from Seagate's extensive hard drive range, with capacities reaching up to 18TB. However, Seagate-branded drives were not the only items involved, as authorities also discovered drives from Kioxia and Western Digital.

Seagate suspects that the used hard drives originated from China during the Chia boom. Following the cryptocurrency's downfall, numerous miners sold these used drives to workshops where many were illicitly repurposed to appear new. This bust may represent only the tip of the iceberg, as Heise estimates that at least one million of these Chia drives are circulating, although the exact number that have been recycled remains uncertain.

The clandestine workshop, likely one of many establishments in operation, reportedly employed six workers. Their responsibilities included resetting the hard drives' SMART values, cleaning, relabeling, and repackaging them for distribution and sale via local e-commerce platforms. Occasionally, it's said that workers would upgrade the hard drives to enhance their market value, such as converting a Barracuda into an IronWolf or SkyHawk model.

The modus operandi encompassed all activities from priming the counterfeit hard drives to their sale. In fact, this method led to the apprehension of the suspects. The perpetrators were reportedly marketing these counterfeit hard drives on prominent platforms such as Shopee and Lazada at exceptionally low prices. According to the source, an unidentified Malaysian sales manager flagged the hard drives and subsequently alerted Seagate's security department, which purchased one of the drives and confirmed its fraudulent nature. Seagate collaborated with local law enforcement agencies to trace the goods back to the warehouse, resulting in a subsequent raid. After all, you can't just go kicking in doors on these types of unlawful activities, since criminal syndicates often oversee these scams. It's not something that an average Joe is doing inside a garage or in the backyard at scale.

Due to this unfortunate incident, Seagate has reportedly enhanced its partner program. Partners are now contractually obliged to purchase and resell Seagate hard drives exclusively from authorized Seagate distributors. Additionally, the company has implemented a Global Trade Screening (GTS) process to identify and exclude potentially suspicious suppliers that may be listed on the GTS sanction list.

The counterfeit hard drives were reportedly limited to German-speaking countries. However, there were some user reports from Australia and the U.S. Since we live in a globally connected world, it would be naive to think that none of the counterfeit hard drives made it to the U.S. market. The new discovery that some Kioxia and Western Digital hard drives are also susceptible to fraud means that consumers should exercise extra caution when purchasing a hard drive from non-major retailers, or third-party sellers.

How much VRAM do you really need?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti enraged enthusiasts when Nvidia announced the GPU would once again offer an 8GB VRAM capacity as the baseline option. The RTX 5060 Ti represents the fifth generation of consumer Nvidia graphics cards that have featured an 8GB capacity on at least one model. The first mainstream GeForce cards featuring 8GB of VRAM were the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070, released all the way back in 2016.

8GB was a potent memory spec through the late 2010s, offering ample room to run the latest AAA games at maximum settings. Back then, AAA games like Battlefield V could even get by on 2GB GPUs at minimum specs. (The game's recommended GPU was the GTX 1060 6GB.)

Fast forward to today, and 8GB is showing its limits to the point where many of the latest AAA games cannot run on those cards at 1080p and maximum settings without suffering performance issues, especially with ray tracing or AI-powered features like framegen switched on. That's led many enthusiasts to call for Nvidia to ditch 8GB VRAM specs altogether, even on lower-end GPUs.

In this face-off, we'll be diving into the data and pitting the 8GB GeForce RTX 5060 Ti against its 16GB counterpart to see how problematic (or non-problematic) 8GB of VRAM can be in 2025, and where those problems specifically arise.

Gaming performance can vary significantly between the 8GB and 16GB versions of the RTX 5060 Ti, depending on graphics settings and resolution used. Our benchmarks reveal that the 8GB model is still sufficient for delivering a good 1080p gaming experience at medium quality settings. However, bumping up quality settings to 1080p and 1440p ultra is when the 8GB card starts to fall behind its 16GB counterpart, especially in ray-tracing titles. At 4K, the 16GB model provides unquestionably superior performance.

Our 21-game geomean reveals that the RTX 5060 8GB provides virtually identical performance compared to its 16GB counterpart at 1080p medium settings, being on average just 2.3% slower than the 16GB card. Our six-game DXR and 15-game rasterization only geomeans at the same settings demonstrate the same behavior.

1080p ultra settings showcase a noteworthy divide in performance with the 8GB model. Our 21 game geomean at 1080p ultra reveals an 11% performance disadvantage with the 8GB trim. That delta primarily comes from our ray tracing titles, which are exceptionally sensitive to having just 8GB of VRAM. Our 6-game RT geomean reveals a 26% performance drop-off for the 8GB card vs the 16GB card at 1080p ultra settings. In contrast, the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB is only 5% slower in rasterization-only games (according to our 15-game rasterization-only geomean).

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The RTX 5060 Ti 8GB performs notably worse at 1440p ultra across the board. The 8GB card was 18% worse on average compared to the 16GB card, but that average conceals a whopping 39.6% deficit in ray-tracing titles. It was only 10% worse in raster-only games.

4K ultra was a bloodbath for the RTX 5060 8GB, which was 42% slower than its 16GB counterpart on average across all our titles (including raster and ray tracing titles).

Some of the worst offenders were Stalker 2 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The former was 24.7% slower on the 8GB card at 1440p ultra settings, and was completely unplayable in the latter, running at just 1.3 FPS at 4k ultra settings. Indiana Jones was even worse and would not run beyond 1080p medium settings on the 8GB GPU at all. The 16GB GPU, by contrast, was able to run Indiana Jones all the way up to 4K.

Another worthy mention is Spider-Man 2, which was one of the most VRAM-intensive games at 1080p. At 1080p Very High settings, the RTX 5080 8GB ran 16.9% slower than its 16GB counterpart.

⭐ Winner: RTX 5060 Ti 16GB

The RTX 5060 Ti 8GB can offer comparable performance to the 16GB in our gaming test suite, but only at 1080p medium settings. Everywhere else, the 16GB model has the edge.

Professional workloads proved to be far less sensitive to VRAM capacity compared to our gaming tests, but problems can still arise. We ran multiple benchmarks in Blender, MLPerf, Spec WS4, and Procyon, and found the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB performed within 1-5% of the 16GB model in most of our benchmark configurations.

The only problematic benchmark on the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti was our Procyon's Stable Diffusion XL 1024x1024 test, which ran the benchmark 97.6% worse than the 5060 Ti 16GB. It goes without saying that if you're running high-resolution AI image generation, you'll need a graphics card with plenty of VRAM.

Besides that main outlier, SPEC WS4's 3dsmax test was the only other benchmark in our suite that showed double-digit performance margins between the two cards. The 8GB card ran this particular test 11.9% slower than the 16GB card.

⭐ Winner: RTX 5060 Ti 16GB

The 8GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti proved to have sufficient memory to run nearly all of our professional-focused benchmarks, but for the best performance across every possible workload, you'll still want to step up to the 16GB card.

Despite having a $50 higher MSRP, the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB provides a better price-to-performance ratio than its 8GB counterpart, even at 1080p. At 1080p ultra, the 16GB provides 7% greater FPS per dollar, 17% greater FPS per dollar at 1440p, and 66% better FPS per dollar at 4K.

Assuming you can find an RTX 5060 Ti 16GB at its $429 MSRP, there's only a $50 difference between that card and the 8GB version. With such a small difference, we'd universally pick the 16GB model for its superior performance, value, and peace of mind.

The RTX 5060 Ti 8GB can be a potent graphics card at 1080p, but the limited VRAM capacity does cause problems in games. Not only are higher resolutions and quality settings problematic due to insufficient VRAM, but ray tracing games also take a significant performance hit for the same reason.

8GB of VRAM can also limit gamers' ability to turn on next-gen features that have gotten top billing on Blackwell. We've seen instances where DLSS Multi-Frame Generation fails to work when a GPU is already at the limits of its VRAM pool, and gamers are also sure to be disappointed when they see that this card, while technically RT-ready, can only use that feature in older or lighter RT titles at 1080p without substantially impacting performance.

DLSS upscaling can help reduce VRAM pressure, but you can only crank down its image quality settings so far at 1080p before rough edges start appearing, even with Nvidia's latest DLSS transformer model.

The RTX 5060 Ti 8GB hit fewer speed bumps in our professional workloads, which incorporate many tests that did not run into memory capacity issues. This won't be the case with all professional workloads, especially surrounding AI and large language models, but it is certainly a better situation compared to the gaming side.

In all other areas, the 16GB variant was vastly superior. Even in the pricing department, the 16GB card proved to be a better value as well.

Overall, our testing reveals that 8GB GPUs are no longer as viable as they once were. 8GB is enough to play games at lower resolutions and quality settings, but even at 1080p, 8GB GPUs will struggle to play games maxed out, especially with ray tracing. This will only become more problematic throughout the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB's lifecycle, as games continue to get more and more demanding.

Nvidia is working on neural texture compression, which purports to substantially reduce memory requirements for textures and could reduce VRAM pressure, but there's no telling when that feature will come or how many games will adopt it.

If you are looking for an RTX 5060 Ti, the 16GB version is by far the better version, and possibly the only option depending on your gaming habits.

🏆 Winner: RTX 5060 Ti 16GB

Why would it be against their terms? Literally all the western nations' governments (US, UK, others that share intelligence relationships with the US) all use cloud platforms for their work, which definitely includes surveillance of people. But it's a problem when Israel does it? Microsoft and Amazon literally built private cloud platforms to serve sensitive government needs like this.

Foreign surveillance from someone with little power over you is different than an Orwellian system domestically.

reply

Anyways, the US, UK, and EU aren't any different. Snowden revealed all the warrantless surveillance going on against their own people.

Water and electricity have to come from Israel. Attempts to install solar panels resulted in them being bombed. Israeli officials control food deliveries as well. Years ago a document was leaked showing how they tracked caloric intake of Gaza residents to make sure that they are not "overfed".Gaza was and is an open air prison. Trying to understand the conflict from the lens of the usual "2 countries beefing" will lead to faulty analysis. Gaza has been occupied since 1948 and Israel is the occupier.

It's really not a good look for Microsoft/NVidia/Google/Apple/etc.. to hire people that have killed children. Like, how quickly do you want to destroy your brand reputation by hiring Israelis? Do these companies not understand that young people are against Israel at a 10:1 ratio?

Tottenham are closing in on the signing of Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace. Spurs are making progress in their talks with the Eagles and the two clubs are expected to reach an agreement in the next 48 hours. Eze is determined to join the North London club and the attacking midfielder is likely to remain out of Palace's matchday squad against Chelsea on Sunday as he looks to seal his move.

Spain international Aleix Garcia could opt to swap Bayer Leverkusen for West Ham United in the coming weeks.

The Hammers are plotting a host of transfer moves before the Premier League summer window closes on September 1.

Graham Potter has focused on defence so far this summer, with Jean-Clair Todibo joining permanently from Nice, and El Hadji Malick Diouf landing from Slavia Prague.

However, the former Chelsea boss is now looking to bolster his midfield and attack, following the departure of Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham last month.

As per reports from TBR Football, Garcia is open to a season-long loan at the London Stadium, after just one year at the BayArena.

The 28-year-old racked up nine goal contributions in 2024/25, but he was not viewed as a regular starter by Xabi Alonso, and Erik ten Hag's plans are unconfirmed.

If West Ham wanted to push for an immediate transfer, Leverkusen will demand around £17m, but the current indicators are for a loan with a purchase option in 2026.

A decisive move is needed from the former Girona schemer as he looks to stay in the frame for Spain's FIFA World Cup squad in 2026 – assuming Luis de la Fuente's team secure qualification in the months ahead.

De la Fuente handed the Catalan star his senior debut in 2023, but he was removed from the final squad list for UEFA Euro 2024, before a recall for March's UEFA Nations League double header against the Netherlands.

Garcia came off the bench in quarter final second leg, and scored his spot kick in the shootout win over La Oranje, but he was not involved in June's finals.

He is on the fringes of De la Fuente's thinking, and his best chance to force a September recall is to be playing regularly, ahead of La Roja's games away in Bulgaria and Turkey next month.

Brazilian striker Richarlison rolled back the years to the 2022 FIFA World Cup when he scored a bicycle kick for Tottenham against Burnley which was almost identical to the one he had scored against Serbia in Qatar almost 2 and a half years ago.

Richarlison, who had already scored the first goal of the match on Saturday when he struck in the 10th minute before pulling out the outrageous skill to double Spurs' lead in the 60th minute. Both the goals were assisted by Mohammed Kudus who was bought from West Ham in the ongoing transfer window. Tottenham ultimately went on to win the match 3-0 with Brennan Johnson scoring the 3rd in the 66th minute.

“Thank you for the assists (To Kudus). I'm so happy with this guy – next week he deserves to score because he works so hard for the team. I think this guy's Brazilian! I'm so happy with the game,” Richarlison said after the match.

It was no meek surrender from Burnley, however, as they managed to get forward and take nearly as many shots as Tottenham, but Scott Parker's side lacked quality in finishing.

Richarlison has had a tough time at Tottenham since coming over from Everton in 2022, missing large chunks of his time there due to injury. Since his signing, he has missed 58 matches for Spurs and scored 5 goals in 24 matches last season in all competitions. The season before that he played 31 matches in all competitions and slammed 12 goals. In his debut season for the club, he played 35 matches but could manage only 3 goals.



In 2022, Richarlison's bicycle kick was voted as the goal of the tournament. Richarlison had his back to the goal when he used one touch to flick the ball up in the air near the penalty spot, then spun around and leaped off the ground to deliver a spectacular acrobatic kick into the net. It helped Brazil win 2-0 win over Serbia in the group stage.

Ticket registration for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is now open!

PHILADELPHIA, Pa. - In 1994, the United States hosted its first-ever FIFA World Cup, and it was a historic event that many believe planted the seeds for the sport's growth in the nation. The tournament proved that the U.S. could host the world's biggest event, and it led to the creation of Major League Soccer (MLS), a crucial step in building a professional league from the ground up. 

But soccer (or football), for the most part, remained a "niche sport" that many Americans only paid semi-attention to every four years. And in June 2026, 16 cities in Canada, Mexico and the United States will host a record 48 international teams for the FIFA World Cup.

Times have changed dramatically since the 1994 World Cup. Today, the sight of a Premier League jersey has become a common one, with fans of teams like Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea growing in number. The recent success of clubs like Manchester City has also fueled a rise in popularity, making Premier League soccer a growing force in the American sports landscape.

American fans will likely be able to see world-class players like Kylian Mbappé (France), Erling Haaland (Norway) and Vinicius Jr. (Brazil), as well as legends of the game Lionel Messi (Argentina) and Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), depending on how the final qualifiers for the tournament play out, injuries and potential retirements.

When the FIFA World Cup 2026 kicks off, it will find a nation with a much deeper connection to the sport. The game is no longer an international curiosity, but an everyday reality. Thanks to NBC-exclusive broadcasting rights bringing the Premier League to American televisions, and streaming services like Peacock and Paramount Plus, fans have unprecedented access to top leagues like the Premier League and Champions League. ESPN+ also makes the Spanish premier division, La Liga, available, as well as Germany's Bundesliga. 

We've already seen the passion in person, with incredible fan support for both American and international club teams at the FIFA Club World Cup this summer, which saw Chelsea Football Club lift the major silverware at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey after defeating French champions Paris Saint-Germain F.C. 

As for the World Cup itself, it's a unique and special event. It's important to remember that the famous athletes who will be entering the stadiums are not playing for their club teams, but are instead coming together to play for their national teams after being called up by their national team coach. This allows for a deeper level of national pride.

What's next:

Major League Soccer has also grown into something much bigger in recent years, with a strong grassroots foundation for the sport here in the United States. The 2026 World Cup is more than just a tournament; it's an opportunity to show the world how far American soccer has come and how far it has yet to go. While 1994 may have planted the seeds, 2026 might be the moment the plant finally blossoms into a national obsession.

"I think the World Cup will help the sport in America. It hopefully will improve participation country-wide due to the increased visibility of the sport," Alex Washburn, a soccer player in the Premier Division of the Central Virginia Soccer Association (CVSA) and Everton F.C. fan, said. "It should have the local areas across the USA buzzing in the months leading up to the games."

With marquee players signing for clubs in the MLS like Lionel Messi, Thierry Henry, David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard, the sport has grown more popular each time a global superstar makes their debut on American soil. However, most of the time, players of their caliber come toward the end of their careers in the biggest leagues in Europe. 

These superstars have also noticed the differences between the way soccer is ingrained in other countries and the accessibility issues the sport faces in the United States.

During Ibrahimović's time in the MLS with L.A. Galaxy, the Swedish striker had an up-close look at the developmental system in the United States and was critical of what he saw. He pointed to the "pay-to-play" system, where young players and their families are expected to pay to join a club, while speaking with GQ Italy in 2019. This, he argued, is a direct contrast to much of the rest of the world where organized soccer is not a commodity as much as it is a community, and young talent can emerge from all economic backgrounds. This is seen by many as a key hurdle for the U.S. to overcome in producing world-class talent.

While Major League Soccer may not yet be thought of as a premier destination for the world's best overseas footballers, the league's consistent growth can cultivate and produce world-class talent.

The FIFA World Cup qualifiers will conclude in mid-November, revealing the 48 nations that will bring the tournament to North America and spark a new generation of soccer fans.

Newcastle United's hunt for a new frontman has swung dramatically back to Paris-Saint Germain striker Goncalo Ramos, with reports revealing that the 24-year-old has resurfaced as a genuine option at St. James' Park. Earlier this month, the Portugal international was brushed aside as an unlikely target after initial probes suggested PSG were unwilling to budge.

Miami-Dade County will spend 46 million USD on the 2026 FIFA World Cup, including money for the FIFA Fan Festival in downtown Miami. This big-ticket item is raising eyebrows since the county is also eyeing cuts to other local services. Even with the debate, the plan will roll out a three-week soccer bash that mingles visitors from around the globe with Miami locals.The FIFA Fan Festival is the beating heart of Miami's World Cup lineup. It will fill Bayfront Park and remain free for everyone. Fans can catch the matches live on big screens, rock out at concerts, and dive into a mix of other entertainment. The festival promises to keep the World Cup spirit alive for those without match tickets, creating a colorful, open-space party for all.Advertisement  Funding Breakdown: What Miami-Dade's 46 Million USD Will CoverMiami-Dade County's substantial contribution to the World Cup budget includes 25 million USD in public safety services and 21 million USD in cash to fund local events and services. The 21 million USD will cover a range of expenses, including those for the FIFA Fan Festival. However, specific allocations for the festival itself have not been fully disclosed, although it is expected to be one of the largest events funded by the county. According to local planning documents, the Fan Festival is the primary event mentioned, suggesting it will be a significant focus of the budget.In addition to the Fan Festival, the county's contributions will cover other logistical aspects of hosting the World Cup, including transportation, volunteer programs, and the creation of a local-preference contracting organization. The last mile transportation system, a critical component of the World Cup's transit plans, will ensure that fans can reach Hard Rock Stadium and other venues efficiently, particularly given the limited parking availability. Many ticket holders will likely need to rely on buses provided by FIFA to travel to and from the stadiums.FIFA Fan Festival: A Major Event for Locals and VisitorsThe FIFA Fan Festival is set to be one of Miami's most significant events ever, according to the host committee's budget projections. The event will run for 10 hours a day across a three-week period, bringing a carnival-like atmosphere to Bayfront Park. Festival-goers will enjoy large-scale match viewings on oversized screens, live music performances, Miami-themed entertainment, and a wide range of food and beverages. The festival is expected to attract both local fans and visitors from around the world, all eager to participate in the excitement surrounding the World Cup.Rodney Barreto, volunteer chair of the local host committee, emphasized that the Fan Festival provides an alternative venue for those without tickets, reducing the risk of large crowds congregating outside Hard Rock Stadium. It's designed as a space for people to come together and celebrate soccer without the need for a stadium ticket, ensuring that everyone has the chance to experience the global event.Moreover, the Fan Festival is expected to play a key role in attracting private sponsorships, helping cover additional World Cup-related expenses. Sponsors will be able to activate their brands inside Bayfront Park, benefiting from the exposure to the thousands of fans expected to attend the festival.The Budget Controversy: A Balancing ActThe decision to allocate 46 million USD for the World Cup has sparked debates among Miami-Dade's political leaders. Critics, such as State Senator Ileana Garcia, have pointed to the World Cup funding as an example of how the county is prioritizing sports events over crucial social services. In particular, Garcia has argued that the money spent on the World Cup should be redirected to local programs such as senior meals and adult day care, which have seen cuts in the proposed 2026 budget.Despite these concerns, Miami-Dade officials, including Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, have defended the spending, noting that the county had actively competed to host World Cup matches and is now obligated to fund its share of the event's costs. The mayor has also acknowledged that the budget for World Cup-related expenses could be revisited during upcoming budget hearings in September.A Significant Tourism Boost for MiamiThe FIFA World Cup's presence in Miami is poised to deliver a significant boost to the city's tourism industry. With thousands of international fans flocking to the city, local businesses, hotels, restaurants, and attractions will likely see an influx of visitors. Additionally, Miami's status as a major international destination will be further solidified as the event shines a global spotlight on the city. The Fan Festival, in particular, will help extend the World Cup experience to a wider audience, ensuring that even those without tickets can enjoy the festivities.In addition to the economic benefits, the event also highlights Miami's growing prominence as a cultural and entertainment hub. The city's diverse offerings, from its vibrant nightlife to its rich cultural heritage, will complement the global energy surrounding the World Cup, attracting even more travelers in the years to come.Miami's World Cup Investment and its Impact on Local TourismMiami-Dade County's 46 million USD push for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is big news for everyone, from lifelong locals to the fans flying in for the games. The FIFA Fan Festival is the centerpiece everyone should circle on their calendars. Free to enter, it's the ultimate soccer block party where you can watch every match on giant screens, enjoy food from around the world, and feel the stadium buzz without ever buying a ticket. Sure, some folks question the price tag, but the payoff in hotel bookings, restaurant lines, and airport crowds is hard to ignore. A million fans wandering around the Magic City turns the whole stretch from Little Havana to South Beach into one giant global pep rally and locks in Miami's rep as a travel hotspot.From upgraded Brightline trains ready to zip you from the airport to the stadium, to the new downtown quick-pass lane for rideshare and 24-hour police patrols, Miami is putting pencil to plans for a World Cup travel experience you won't forget. The heartbeat will be a three-week run where you can hear the wave on one block, smell croquetas on the next, and watch superstars score on the big screens. It's the perfect kickoff for the years of tourism to come.Advertisement  Share On:Tags: 2026 World Cup, FIFA events, FIFA Fan Festival, Miami, World Cup fundingSubscribe to our NewslettersFollow Travel And Tour World in Google News

Rodney Barreto, volunteer chair of the local host committee, emphasized that the Fan Festival provides an alternative venue for those without tickets, reducing the risk of large crowds congregating outside Hard Rock Stadium. It's designed as a space for people to come together and celebrate soccer without the need for a stadium ticket, ensuring that everyone has the chance to experience the global event.Moreover, the Fan Festival is expected to play a key role in attracting private sponsorships, helping cover additional World Cup-related expenses. Sponsors will be able to activate their brands inside Bayfront Park, benefiting from the exposure to the thousands of fans expected to attend the festival.The Budget Controversy: A Balancing ActThe decision to allocate 46 million USD for the World Cup has sparked debates among Miami-Dade's political leaders. Critics, such as State Senator Ileana Garcia, have pointed to the World Cup funding as an example of how the county is prioritizing sports events over crucial social services. In particular, Garcia has argued that the money spent on the World Cup should be redirected to local programs such as senior meals and adult day care, which have seen cuts in the proposed 2026 budget.Despite these concerns, Miami-Dade officials, including Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, have defended the spending, noting that the county had actively competed to host World Cup matches and is now obligated to fund its share of the event's costs. The mayor has also acknowledged that the budget for World Cup-related expenses could be revisited during upcoming budget hearings in September.A Significant Tourism Boost for MiamiThe FIFA World Cup's presence in Miami is poised to deliver a significant boost to the city's tourism industry.

I pegged this game as the most interesting to bet on in Week 1 because both Chelsea and Crystal Palace have high hopes coming into this season, but it's hard to envision both London-based teams reaching them. 

Chelsea finished fourth in the Premier League last year and won the UEFA Conference League trophy. They kept the momentum going in the offseason, winning the FIFA Club World Cup title with a shocking 3-0 victory over defending Champions League winner PSG in the final. They've won two friendlies since then and seem primed to compete for a top-three spot in the Prem and possibly add a trophy or two along the way. 

Palace were in the lower half of the table last season, but won the FA Cup in a shocking final against Manchester City and just beat defending EPL champions Liverpool in the Community Shield match. They could compete for other trophies and perhaps a top-six finish in the league.

Both teams enter the season feeling quite confident after outstanding finishes to last season and some big wins in the preseason this year. Chelsea is superior and playing at home, which could make all the difference in this one. 

Let's get into it starting with the odds via FanDuel Sportsbook. 

Chelsea have Top 3 finish aspirations, but any hope of actually competing for a title will come down to taking care of business against mid-tier teams like Palace. They tied their two matches last year, 1-1 each time, and can ill afford to leave points on the pitch again this season to reach those lofty goals. A Premier League title seems out of reach, yet hope abounds at Stamford Bridge, and playing at home to start is a big boon for a team looking to celebrate its Club World Cup win. 

Palace retained the majority of the team that won the FA Cup last year, and that showed in their comeback win over Liverpool less than a week ago. However, it's likely too tough an ask to beat two Prem powers in a week, especially on the road in front of a raucous crowd.

Enzo Maresca is in his second year as Chelsea's manager and has established the club as a defensive stalwart. Indeed, in their recent Club World Cup win, they held high-scoring PSG scoreless in the final and conceded three goals in seven matches total. Meanwhile, their offense hasn't scored fewer than two goals this preseason. 

I see a letdown for Palace coming off their surprise win over Liverpool. Chelsea will be ready to pounce.

Board are not demanding a Premier League win but silencing talk will be impossible if Club World Cup winners make fast start

Off we go again. Just over a month has passed since Chelsea stunned Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, Cole Palmer leading the destruction of the European champions. But there is no chance of life at Stamford Bridge slowing down. It has been another breathless summer and, while the vibe is as positive as it has ever been under the ownership of Clearlake Capital and Todd Boehly, there is also the unavoidable question of whether a relentless schedule is going to catch up with the new world champions further down the line.

A compressed pre-season, limited to friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Milan last weekend, may pose complications for Enzo Maresca in the long run. Chelsea had a lucrative time in the US, earning an estimated £85m in prize money, but the riches on offer from Fifa's expanded tournament come with potential costs. The unknown is how last season, stretching until 13 July, will affect Maresca's players. They looked ready to go during convincing wins in the pair of friendlies, which suggests there will be no lethargy when they open their Premier League campaign with a testing home game against Crystal Palace on Sunday, but one theory is problems will come when the Champions League begins, the fixtures pile up and Christmas approaches

There has already been one setback, the loss of Levi Colwill to an anterior cruciate ligament injury leaving a sizeable hole at the back. Chelsea do not intend to panic and sign a defender for the sake of it, despite Maresca saying on Friday he wanted a replacement for Colwill. Chelsea's position is that they have depth and they will move only if someone suitable is available. Maresca feels his squad does not have anyone as proficient as Colwill at making his tactics work. “We know how important he has been,” he said last week. “I spoke with Levi and told him that if we achieved what we achieved last year it is also because of him.”

It speaks volumes that Colwill was the one constant presence in central defence. His defending improved during the run-in, he has developed as a leader and his ability on the ball makes him crucial to the buildup.

Chelsea feel they have internal solutions. Trevoh Chalobah, back in favour after being loaned to Palace at the start of last season, was outstanding against PSG. Wesley Fofana, who was first choice next to Colwill before breaking down last December, will be vital if he can stay fit. Other options include Benoît Badiashile and Tosin Adarabioyo, often seen acting as Palmer's chaperone, and the young prospects Josh Acheampong and Aarón Anselmino. There is also a potential solution in Jorrel Hato, even if the new arrival from Ajax has been signed initially to compete with Marc Cucurella at left-back.

It is hardly a crisis. The squad is deep and it is not a case of quantity over quality this time. There have been a lot of sales again – the intention is for Chelsea's spending to be at net zero when the window shuts – but the business is better than last year. The attack has been upgraded with the signings of João Pedro and Liam Delap. Dário Essugo and Andrey Santos provide promising cover for Enzo Fernández and Moisés Caicedo in midfield. Jamie Gittens has replaced Jadon Sancho on the left and Estêvão Willian, a prodigious Brazilian talent who shone for Palmeiras during the Club World Cup, offered exciting glimpses against Leverkusen and Milan.

Then there is the ice-cold Palmer, who took the first steps towards superstardom with his brilliant double against PSG. He is the team's undoubted star, the key difference-maker, although it is important Chelsea are not reliant on one individual. Insiders stress this is a team effort. There is consistent praise for the youth-driven strategy implemented by the recruitment team of Paul Winstanley, Laurence Stewart, Sam Jewell and Joe Shields. The quartet have faced external criticism but were handed contract extensions this week.

It is hard for anyone to argue that Chelsea, who also won the Conference League last season, are not on the right track after seeing how Maresca outdid Luis Enrique's PSG. Two years after they finished 12th, a proper title challenge does not feel unrealistic. Chelsea have firepower and tactical flexibility, and they have belief after beating PSG. Inside the club, though, there is caution. Maresca is not facing demands from the board to win the title. The victory over PSG has been followed by reminders of the need for everyone to stay humble.

There is a wariness about anyone involved in the project getting carried away. Chelsea are a young team and came close to missing out on Champions League qualification last season. Dips are to be expected and Robert Sánchez's recent improvement has not fully allayed doubts over whether he is a title-winning goalkeeper. Maresca, too, was under pressure after Christmas. Chelsea, though, crave stability. They want mid-season managerial changes to be a thing of the past. They are not going to overreact if fatigue hits after Champions League games or during the festive period.

Chelsea believe in their process. The trading can look ruthless but the model of handing out heavily incentivised deals has made it easier to move unwanted players. Noni Madueke has gone to Arsenal for an initial £48m. There were no issues shipping João Félix to Saudi Arabia. A bigger challenge is finding buyers for Raheem Sterling and Christopher Nkunku, both of whom were signed on big wages before Chelsea shifted their contract policy.

Further incomings depend on more sales, with Ben Chilwell and Carney Chukwuemeka also hoping for fresh starts. Chelsea want to strengthen in the final third by signing Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons but being fined by Uefa for breaching financial fair play rules heightens the need to raise money, which will most likely come through selling Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson and Tyrique George.

It will be busy before the window shuts. It is never quiet at Chelsea. Maresca tried to play down their chances last season, saying they were not ready to challenge Liverpool and Arsenal, but silencing the title talk will be impossible if they hit the ground running this time.

EPL

To anyone who remembers World Cup 2010, the Jabulani football was, by common consent, a major factor in contributing to an underwhelming tournament in South Africa. Its unusual construction, featuring fewer panels than any ball before or since, meant a lack of ‘drag', so the ball didn't decelerate properly, and moved unpredictably late. It had long been a cliche for goalkeepers to complain about a new tournament ball, but in 2010 outfielders were appalled too.

“It's taken some of the skill out of the game,” complained England midfielder Joe Cole. Brazil's Robinho agreed. “The guy who designed this ball never played football,” he said. “But there's nothing we can do.”

Yet if you spot the Jabulani mentioned 15 years on, it's often in positive, fond terms. “Every league in the world should be required to use the Jabulani on a random week of the season,” read one viral tweet last season. “Every game would be chaos. Goals being scored from everywhere.“

But hang on: that was the opposite of what the Jabulani offered. It didn't produce chaos; it contributed to the second-lowest goals-per-game rate of any World Cup (after the 1990 edition that was so tedious that it led to the introduction of the backpass rule to reform the sport). The winners, Spain, triumphed largely because they kept the fly-away ball on the ground, but they scored just eight goals in seven games. As for ‘goals being scored from everywhere': there were the same number of goals scored from outside the box in 2010, 26, as at World Cup 2006.

And while that was simply one light-hearted tweet, others convey a similar message, suggesting the Jabulani was “a blessing for spectators”, or “the best ball ever made” or, inevitably, “the GOAT ball”, all of which is the complete opposite of what everyone thought at the time.

This about-turn is presumably not because people have reconsidered what they want from a football. It's because they've spent 15 years seeing the same three goals again: Giovanni van Bronkhorst's top corner strike against Uruguay, Keisuke Honda's swerving free kick against Denmark, and one of two Diego Forlan free kicks. And when goals did go in, the unconventional trajectory of the Jabulani was oddly fascinating. But we haven't re-watched all the terrible shots, all the misplaced long-range passes, and all the things that made for a World Cup which was flatter than the bellow of the vuvuzelas.

Rose-tinted spectacles are nothing new, particularly when it comes to sport. A common pattern is that everyone's favourite World Cup is generally the first they experienced, which might explain why World Cup 2010 seems popular with people who are probably now in their mid-twenties. But football coverage — and, let's be honest, the wider world — still hasn't quite got to grips with how easily-accessible bitesize clips of the past have warped our perception of the present. We are living in an age of turbo-nostalgia.

It is simpler than ever, for example, to create a playlist that demonstrates why your favourite year of music (bonus points if this was the same year as your favourite World Cup) was so great. What once involved buying and assembling various records, cassettes or CDs and manually recording the music can be performed on Spotify in a couple of minutes. And, of course, someone's already done it for you anyway, so you can just click on that playlist. And if you subsequently click on the ‘best new music' playlist, it just won't be as good. Because, obviously, you're comparing one random week to your favourite-ever year.

The effect in football occurs in various forms, but chiefly when comparing individual players. Whenever up-and-coming footballers are asked for their favourite all-time player, the most common answers are Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but an intriguing number select Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, even if they were born after those players retired. The era of YouTube means you can watch them as easily as, say, Erling Haaland. And their best bits are better, in part because they have a whole career to select from.

Ronaldo and Zidane have become so adored based upon, say, that goal against Compostela or that Champions League winner against Bayer Leverkusen — and various compilations — that there's actually no rational analysis about their careers.

People think you've some kind of vendetta if you point out that Ronaldo only won one league title in Europe and never got close to winning the European Cup, or recall that Zidane had a disastrous 18-month period between winning World Cup 1998 and Euro 2000 when he looked completely bereft of confidence, and both Juventus and Real Madrid improved when he left. But if we speak about, say, Kylian Mbappe in those terms, it's only applying the current standard of scrutiny to the past.

So, George Weah's goal for Milan versus Verona in 1996 was brilliant, and yes, he won that year's Ballon d'Or, but he also only scored seven goals that calendar year. Yes, that scary bloke Duncan Ferguson (who the commentators insist Everton ‘could do with out there today!') scored lots of thumping headers, but his best-ever return in a season, from over a decade in the Premier League, was 11 goals, which was one more than Beto scored in 2024-25. But almost any retrospective coverage of anything in football — particularly, it must be said, from the 1990s — is so overwhelmingly positive to the point of delusion.

“When you watch football in the Premier League or other top divisions, it's so robotic,” said David McGoldrick, briefly an enigmatic Premier League forward for Sheffield United, now at Barnsley in League One. “In my day, there was Ronaldinho, Paul Gascoigne and those kinds of players who were great to watch.” But those two players' careers barely overlapped. They peaked about 15 years apart. They were considered special cases even at the time. And the current era does have, for example, Lamine Yamal.

The current vibe amongst football fans is not solely typical nostalgia felt solely by middle-aged people, but an intense level of anemoia — as American writer John Koenig has termed it — essentially, false nostalgia for a time you can't recall. Even teenagers insist they're ‘against modern football', and think ‘the game has gone', which could conceivably be because modern football truly is rubbish, and the game has actually gone. But they're all still hooked on it, so, to paraphrase Ron Atkinson, it must be not-bad then.

All this would basically be fine, and completely unworthy of any comment, if it wasn't compromising people's enjoyment of what's actually happening in their own time. The reaction to Euro 2024 — a perfectly good competition that produced some excellent games and best major tournament winner for well over a decade — was strange. “Why is Euro 2024 so dull?,” was the headline in The Spectator. “One of the poorest tournaments we've seen in a long time,” claimed former Sky Sports presenter Richard Keys.

But it was surely better than both Euro 2020, which was compromised by geography, Covid-19 and a lack of convincing sides, and Euro 2016, a tournament which never really took off. Again, people were presumably comparing watching 120 minutes of a flat game to a couple of standout, YouTube-aided memories from otherwise dull tournaments.

Away from football, this has more serious ramifications. A poll by YouGov last year asked around 2,000 people, grouped by age, when they thought life was best. Those aged 70+ generally thought it was the 1960s, people in their sixties thought it was the 1970s, people in their 50s thought it was the 1980s, and so on. That was, in itself, funny but not surprising — everyone enjoyed being young. A more interesting side story was that people in their twenties were more likely than older generations to point to periods before they were born as the best time to have lived, which surely results in flawed perceptions of the current day.

Comparatively, the ‘make football great again' vibe is mostly harmless. But for the record, as the new Premier League campaign gets underway, the quality of technical and tactical play is better than ever, the goals-per-game rate has reached incredibly high levels over the last couple of seasons, attendances are at record numbers, and the English top flight is now unquestionably the best around.

Let's try to enjoy it. In 2040, some will speak about this as the GOAT season — even if this campaign is as bad as the Jabulani was.

This year's Cincinnati Open is back on track following the extreme weather that disrupted play on Tuesday. Play was curtailed early with the main court flooded as torrential rain lashed down, but thankfully, there has been no such disruption since.

In the men's draw, Jannik Sinner will face qualifier Terence Atmane in his semi-final today before Carlos Alcaraz faces Alexander Zverev. The women's singles is wide open though after world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka was knocked out by Elena Rybakina, and Coco Gauff is also out after defeat to Jasmine Paolini. Elsewhere, Emma Raducanu is ramping up her preparation ahead of the US Open.

It took longer than most were expecting, but Jannik Sinner gets the first set after a tiebreak.

Stick around for updates!

It's almost time for the first match of the day, with Jannik Sinner set to face qualifier Terence Atmane.

Terence Atmane is set for a clash against Jannik Sinner at the Cincinnati Open.

The qualifier said: "I don't think any words can describe how I feel right now. It's pretty insane to be honest. I cannot believe it.

"Being here in the semi-finals of a Masters 1000, breaking into the Top 100 and even more with the win tonight - it's also a lot of money for me, so it's going to be very helpful for my career. It means a lot to me. I'm very emotional about it."

Carlos Alcaraz is set to come up against one of the few players he has a worse H2H record against.

The Spanish ace has lost more times than he's won against Alexander Zverev.

The pair face each other in the Cincinnati Open last four later today.

British No.1 Jack Draper has re-paired with Jessica Pegula for the revamped US Open mixed doubles tournament.

Paula Badosa pulled out this week, leaving Draper without a partner. However, him and Pegula are now back together and will be seeded at Flushing Meadows.

Tennis courts in Warwickshire have reopened following a near £75,000 refurbishment.

Rugby Borough Council has confirmed the facilities at Caldecott Park now boast have new hard court surfaces, net posts, nets, security gates and fencing.

It comes after the council secured a £50,000 grant from the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) and its Tennis Foundation's Park Tennis Project, which is supported by government funding.

Coco Gauff has brushed off criticism of her form after struggling since her French Open win.

Following her defeat to Jasmine Paolini in Cincinnati, she delivered this riposte in her post-match press conference...

Coco Gauff perspective\u201cSometimes tennis fans want us to win like every week. But we\u2019re playing 11 months. It\u2019s not that easy, so its completely normal for a player to have a good 3-4 weeks, then maybe a not so good 3-4 weeks just bcuz the way our season is built\u201d\ud83c\udfa5: WTA, DAZN pic.twitter.com/hHJU3lKiSr

Carlos Alcaraz has admitted he lost concentration before overcoming Andrey Rublev 6-3 4-6 7-5 to make the semi-finals in Cincinnati.

“I maintained positive thoughts all the time, even though I lost focus a few times during the second set,” he said. “Playing someone like Andrey, when you lose focus on two or three points, it can cost you the set or almost the match. I just stayed strong mentally and that's what I'm most proud of.”



Alexander Zverev has admitted to not feeling fully fit ahead of his semi-final with Carlos Alcaraz.

After beating Ben Shelton, the star admitted: "Right now I'm not feeling too great, we'll see I have a day to get fresh and to hopefully feel 100% again.

"I'm not sure what happened, I came out today and probably felt the best I did in a few months, but dnd of the first set started feeling not so great and got progressively worse."

American influencer Costeen Hatzi has said she was fully supportive of partner Nick Kyrgios before their split in 2024.

“I went to all the tournaments. I was doing everything behind the scenes, his washing, his cooking, everything,” she told News Corp.

Refusing to criticise her ex, she added: “I was happy to, because I loved him and we had a great relationship at the time. So I don't regret anything that I've done. We still had a beautiful relationship, even though things didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. I hope he's happy. I don't wish bad upon him at all.”



Emma Raducanu has hit back over criticism of her constant coaching changes.

Speaking ahead of the US Open, she said: “I'm a lot more clear on what I do and don't like.

"The experiences that I've had with different coaches, people love to say I've had so many different coaches but if I went into the details of a lot of them, people wouldn't say the same thing. I just don't do that, because I don't want to 'out' these people. I keep it to myself.”

Just a day after being backed by Lindsey Davenport, Ben Shelton became the last American player to fall at the Cincinnati Open overnight.

He was well beaten 6-2 6-2 by Alexander Zverev, and looked crestfallen as he approached the net afterwards.

Danielle Collins has announced that she will end her season after the US Open. On Instagram, the world No. 57 said she was preparing for her last tournament of the year.

Collins was set to retire at the end of 2024, but changed her mind in October as she bravely opened up on her fertility journey. The American played on this year, and it's not known what her plans are for 2026.

Veronika Kudermetova is through to the semi-finals in Cincinnati, where she will face either Coco Gauff or Jasmine Paolini.

Carlos Alcaraz is through to the Cincinnati Open semi-final after beating Andrey Rublev 6-3 4-6 7-5.

The Spaniard served for the match in the third set but got broken. When Rublev served to stay in the match while trailing 5-6, he double-faulted on match point, gifting Alcaraz the victory.

The world No. 2 had a huge reaction, roaring and pumping his fists multiple times.

Alcaraz will face either Ben Shelton or Alexander Zverev on Saturday.



Jannik Sinner was set to join forces with Emma Navarro at the revamped US Open mixed doubles event next week.

But organisers of the WTA 500 in Monterrey have now announced that Navarro has made the last-minute decision to enter their tournament, which means she won't be around for the doubles.

The Abierto GNP Seguros runs from August 16 to 23. The US Open mixed doubles matches will be played on August 19 and 20.

Play has just resumed in Alcaraz and Rublev's quarter-final after a fan in the stands became unwell.

The Spaniard held for 1-0 to start the third set when play was paused as chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani noticed a spectator struggling.

Lahyani rushed over with water and an umbrella, and Alcaraz watched on until the fan eventually left the stands.



Carlos Alcaraz's quarter-final clash with Andrey Rublev has gone to a third and final set.

The Spaniard broke twice in the opening set to take it 6-3. But the No. 9 seed has just pagged him back, winning the second set 6-4.

Coco Gauff recently revealed that she had been forced to delete X (formerly known as Twitter) because she became obsessed with following Love Island USA on the app.

Now, Ben Shelton has jumped on the bandwagon, admitting that he deleted the app years ago.

"I remember two years ago, I ended up deleting Twitter from my phone, and that was the best decision I ever made. Now, two years have passed, and I've never read anything on that social network again," the recent Canadian Open champion told Tennis Channel.

"I prefer to watch the highlights of certain matches. At the moment, I watch a lot of the tennis matches I used to watch, whether it's from the tournament I'm playing in or even from a Challenger tournament that's happening that week. I have a team that helps me keep my feet on the ground."

Andrey Rublev is currently trailing Carlos Alcaraz by a break in the opening set of their quarter-final.

And the No. 9 seed isn't happy with some of the automated technology - even if he doesn't realise some of it is automated.

Rublev confronted chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani and claimed the shot clock was being started too soon, only to be told that it automatically started three seconds after the last point was called.

Then, he was shown a replay of an electronic line call he didn't agree with, and thought the wrong ball may have been shown.



The chair umpire had to ask Aryna Sabalenka to rip the label off her water bottle during her quarter-final defeat to Elena Rybakina.

The world No. 1 was drinking from a plastic San Pellegrino bottle when the official said: "Aryna can I just ask you to take [the label] off that bottle? Perfect, thank you, we're good, that's fine."

It comes just a couple of days after Carlos Alcaraz became frustrated when an umpire told him off for drinking from reusable branded Evian bottles. "It's not my fault," the Spaniard repeatedly stated.



Last year's Cincinnati Open champion, Aryna Sabalenka, has been ousted in the quarter-final.

Elena Rybakina has taken out the top seed 6-1 6-4, ending Sabalenka's title defence.

She saved all five break points she faced, and will face Iga Swiatek in the semi-finals.



British doubles stars Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash have extended their incredible winning streak in Cincinnati.

They've now won 22 matches and counting after beating No. 6 seed Andrea Vavassori and Simone Bolelli in the quarter-finals.

Dubbed 'Cashpool', they have not lost a match since the Libema Open final in June.

The Brits swept titles at Queen's, Eastbourne, Wimbledon and Toronto, and they're looking for their fifth successive trophy.



Elena Rybakina is off to a flying start in her Cincinnati Open quarter-final against world No. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka.

Rybakina suffered a brutal defeat to Sabalenka in Berlin a few weeks ago, blowing four match points to go out in the quarter-finals.

But she's keen to get revenge - she's taken the first set 6-1 in Cincinnati in under half an hour.

Iga Swiatek had the fans on Cincinnati Open's centre court in stitches as she discussed the searing heat.

Asked how she was coping in the hot weather, the world No. 3 had a simple answer - she'd been drinking. But she made it very clear that she was keeping things pure and healthy.

“There's no secret, I just drink,” she said, before eyeing the camera and adding: “But water!”

Iga Swiatek is through to her third straight semi-final at the Cincinnati Open after beating Anna Kalinskaya 6-3 6-4.

The world No. 3 has never been beyond the semis here. If she wants to reach the final, she'll have to beat either Aryna Sabalenka or Elena Rybakina. Their match is up next on the centre court.



Terence Atmane has enjoyed a breakthrough week in Cincinnati, coming through qualifying and making it all the way to tomorrow's semi-final, where he takes on Jannik Sinner.

The French qualifier has already beaten 15th seed Flavio Cobolli, teenage sensation Joao Fonseca, and top-10 stars Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune on his way to the last four.

Ranked down at No. 136 in the world, Atmane is set to bank at least £245k in prize money and will make his top 100 debut when the tournament is over.

But he still has no clothing or shoe sponsor after being dropped by Asics last year.

“Apart from Tecnifibre for the rackets, I don't have any sponsors since I got dropped by Asics. I buy my clothes and shoes like everyone else. I don't have an agent; I do my thing on my own in my corner,” Atmane told L'Equipe.

Anna Kalinskaya sparked concerns when she called the physio and received a medical time-out minutes into her Cincinnati Open quarter-final clash with Iga Swiatek.

The No. 28 seed already had heavy strapping on her shoulder, and during the first changeover in the match, with Swiatek leading 2-1, the trainer bandaged Kalinskaya's calf.

She has decided to play on and got broken. Swiatek currently leads 4-1.



Terence Atmane is on the run of his life in Cincinnati. The world No. 136 qualifier is into the semi-finals after beating two top-10 players, including Holger Rune.

After suffering a 6-2 6-3 defeat in the quarters, Rune took to social media to send some words of support to Atmane.

"I have known you Terence since juniors, tennis is a tough journey and I am happy for your run here at @CincyTennis and what it will mean in the future for you . Good luck onwards," he tweeted.

Play is getting underway at the Cincinnati Open, with No. 3 seed and recent Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek facing Anna Kalinskaya for a spot in the semi-finals.

Kalinskaya hit out at the WTA when their quarter-final was scheduled first on Friday at 11am local time, after her last match started on Wednesdan night and finished in the early hours on Thursday, and she didn't get to bed until 4am.

“How can the WTA and tournament expect athletes to perform their best when the scheduling is unfair?” she wrote in an Instagram story.

“After my match against Alexandrova, I got home from the site at 2:40 am and didn't go to bed until 4 am. I slept a bit and came to the site to practice.”

“Then I get scheduled at 11 am for tomorrow's match—how does the tournament and WTA expect me to recover and continuously adjust my sleep pattern, which is one of the most important aspects of recovery? Seems a bit one sided.”

Emma Raducanu made a statement at Wimbledon last month, where she put up an impressive fight during a tight loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the third round.

But her private life was also under the spotlight at SW19, as Raducanu was asked whether there was any truth to rumours that she was dating Carlos Alcaraz, whom she'll team up with in the US Open mixed doubles event next week.

After she said they were just friends, fellow British player Cameron Norrie - who is in a long-term relationship - was asked whether he was seeing Raducanu.

And the 22-year-old has finally responded to the intrusive speculation.

“Yeah, and Cam's questions, too. That was terrible. Terrible,” she told the Guardian.



The International Tennis Integrity Agency have confirmed that Japanese star Kaili Demi Teso has been suspended for 10 months following a doping violation.The 19-year-old Teso tested positive for the prohibited substance methylephedrine, atributed to a bottle of cough medicine. Teso's mother, also his manager, acquired the medicine on the player's behalf and the ITIA accepted that the breach was not intentional.

In a statement, they said: "An independent tribunal issued a ruling of no significant fault or negligence and a 10-month suspension, noting that the player's mother had consulted a professional from a reputable pharmacy before purchasing, and that Teso, 18 at the time of the positive test, was inexperienced."

Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle has claimed the 'Royal Box' jibe from Andre Agassi live on air this summer was blown out of proportion.

"We had a laugh, and they took it out of context," he told Betway. "Afterwards, Andre sent me a text, saying what an unbelievable time he'd had, how he enjoyed it, and we were going to have him for the final but then he went into the Royal Box instead.

"But then you read that he was saying, oh, ‘just concentrate on the tennis'."

Andre Agassi pretty much annoyed by Andrew Castle and his obsession with celebrities in the Royal Box. Andre is right, it's tennis that they came to concentrate on.

Lindsey Davenport has backed Ben Shelton to win the US Open.

Davenport, who won three Slam crowns in an illustrious career, said on the Tennis Channel: "Ben Shelton has that type of game where he can take the racket out of his opponent's hand.

"He's got big weapons. He's such an explosive athlete. He lights up the stadium as well. If you get on a roll in New York, if he can play that high level tennis and have the crowd behind him, we could have an American male Grand Slam champion here pretty soon."



Andrey Rublev had received a significant boost ahead of the US Open this month.

The 27-year-old will face Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open, having learnt that his coach, Marat Safin, has received his US visa.

Safin won't be able to join him in Ohio, but will be in New York to guide him for Flushing Meadows this month.

Jannik Sinner has defended his decision to rehire fitness coach Umberto Ferrer after his latest win in Cincinatti.

Having sacked Ferrer following his doping controversy, Sinner said:"It was a different situation. Now everything is different. I felt like, at this point, I needed someone who knew my body better.

"We worked together for about two years before this break. His work has brought me a lot of benefits. We worked on every area of my body and my endurance has improved. I think he did a great job."

Roger Federer has learnt who he will share a court with for his celebrity doubles match in Shanghai on October 10.

It's been confirmed that he'll partner with one of two actors, Hong Kong film star Donnie Yen or Chinese TV personality Wu Lei, to play against ex-professional female Zheng Jie.



The US Open mixed doubles partnership between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz appears in doubt due to the Cincinnati Open schedule.

Alcaraz is into the last eight, and if he makes Monday's final, he will play just 20 hours before the revamped tournament gets underway. Having taken a break after Wimbledon, citing fatigue, former British player Barry Fulcher has speculated Alcaraz could now follow Coco Gauff in skipping the team event.

Emma Raducanu has revealed she has been training in extreme heat ahead of the US Open this month.

After her exit in Cincinnati, Raducanu took to her Instagram story to post a picture of her sweating profusely after a training session. She's already stated she feels she is heading to Flushing Meadows in the best shape since her win there four years ago.

French qualifier Terence Atmane continued his sensational run at the ATP Cincinnati Masters last night by stunning seventh-seeded Holger Rune 6-2, 6-3.

The world No.136 now in his Masters 1000 semi-final where he'll face defending champion Jannik Sinner.

"I don't think any words can describe how I feel right now," said the 23-year-old. "I was just trying to be myself on the court."

Here's the moment he sealed his win...

Alexander Zverev has admitted he got professional help following his first round exit at Wimbledon this summer.

"I took a longer period of time off after Wimbledon, which I haven't done in a very long time," he said.

"Which was very needed. I didn't train, I didn't do any physical work, I didn't play tennis for a longer time as well which was the best thing for me to do. I enjoyed my time, mentally freed up, got also some professional help as well there. I'm happy to be back on court."



Anna Kalinskaya has accused the WTA of being 'biased' against her due to the scheduling of her upcoming match against Iga Swiatek.

On her Instagram story, she wrote: "How does the WTA and the tournament expect their players to play well with these unfair schedules?

"After my match against Alexandrova, I went home at 2:40am and didn't go to bed until 4:00am.

"I slept a little and came back to train today. Then they scheduled my match tomorrow [against Swiatek] at 11:00am.

"How does the WTA and the tournament expect me to recover and continue adjusting my sleep patterns, when that's one of the most important aspects of recovery? It seems a bit biased."

Jannik Sinner is through to the semi-finals in Cincinnati after securing a dominant win over Felix Auger-Aliassime.

The young Italian turned the screw to earn a 6-0 6-2 victory in one hour and 11 minutes.

He will be hoping to go all the way and lift the trophy to give himself some winning momentum ahead of the US Open.

Jasmine Paolini will go up against Coco Gauff in the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open.

She has booked her place in the last eight with a thumping win over former Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova.

Paolini was in full control throughout and sailed to a comprehensive 6-1 6-2 victory.



Emma Raducanu will not be seeded for the US Open, it has been confirmed.

Veronika Kudermetova's recent victory over Clara Tauson at the Cincinnati Open pushed the young Brit out of the final spot.

It means Raducanu could face a top player in the very first round at Flushing Meadows.

Coco Gauff is safely through to the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open after beating Lucia Bronzetti in straight sets.

The young American turned on the style to secure a one-sided 6-2 6-4 victory.

She will face either seventh seed Jasmine Paolini or former Wimbledon winner Barbora Krejcikova in the next round.

Patrick Mouratoglou is convinced that Victoria Mboko will win Grand Slam titles over the course of her career.

Reflecting on her incredible Canadian Open triumph, he said: "She plays to win no matter who is on the other side of the court.

"She started the year ranked 300. Difficult to think she's not going to win Grand Slams.

"Great physicality, the way she moves on the court and she's very offensive, both sides forehand and backhand."



Male tennis players will pocket a record £13.5m in profit-sharing bonuses from the 2024 season, the ATP have confirmed.

The figure marks an increase of 177 per cent on the previous season's payout.

It will be distributed to players based on their performance at the nine ATP 1000 tournaments.

ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: "This is exactly what profit sharing was designed to do, ensure that players and tournaments share equally in the sport's financial upside.

"It is a huge milestone. For us, it's proof that strengthening the premium product and aligning interests creates value.

"We're proud to be strengthening our partnership and building a stronger, more sustainable ATP Tour."

Matteo Berrettini has pulled out of the US Open due to an injury.

He has not played since Wimbledon, where he was dumped out by Kamil Majchrzak in five sets.

Berrettini skipped Toronto and Cincinnati with the aim of recovering in time for the final Grand Slam of the year.

However, he remains unable to compete and has withdrawn from the event.

Aryna Sabalenka has admitted to regularly cheating on her diet.

In an interview with the Tennis Channel during the Cincinnati Open, she said: “It's hamburgers, it can be pizza, it can be gummies. It can be a lot of different things in one day because you know, like if it's a cheat meal, you got to go full.

“But hamburgers, that's my weakness, cheesy and soft and a really good meat and hot and the bun is still melting with the cheese.”



The International Tennis Integrity Agency has confirmed Australian tennis player Thomas Fancutt has accepted a 10 month suspension for a doping violation.Fancutt, 30, admitted to using a using a 'prohibited method' in relation to an IV drip.

In a released statement, the authority said: "Following a full investigation by the ITIA, which included evidence gathering and interviews with the player, Fancutt admitted to the breach, and the ITIA accepted that the breach was not intentional."

Top seeds Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are odds-on to win the US Open.

According to AceOdds, in the men's draw, Sinner is the favourite at evens ahead of Carlos Alcaraz at 2/1. In the women's draw, Aryna Sabalenka is the 5/2 favourite with Iga Swiatek closely behind at 7/2.

AceOdds: 2025 US Open men's winner: Jannik Sinner Evens; Carlos Alcaraz 2/1; Novak Djokovic 16/1; Taylor Fritz, Alexander Zverev 25/1; Jack Draper 28/1; Ben Shelton 33/1; Daniil Medvedev 50/1.

Women's winner: Aryna Sabalenka 5/2; Iga Swiatek 7/2; Coco Gauff 7/1; Mirra Andreeva 12/1; Elena Rybakina 14/1 Naomi Osaka 20/1; Madison Keys 22/1; Amanda Anisimova 25/1; Jessica Pegula, Emma Raducanu, Victoria Mboko 33/1; Jasmine Paolini, Clara Tauson 50/1.

Jannik Sinner has learnt he won't be eligible to receive money from the ATP Masters Bonus Pool this season.

The prize pot is reserved for the top performers in the six Masters 1000 events who performed in at least theee of the tournaments.

While serving his doping ban, the Italian missed the Indian Wells Masters, Miami Open, and Madrid. Last month he opted to withdraw from the Toronto Masters, citing fatigue and regardless of his final position, won't be eligible for any additional money.



Emma Raducanu has sent a warning to rivals ahead of the US Open this month.

After struggling since her remarkable 2021 win, she's said: "I went home and came back and it was a really difficult time in New York.

"Since I won the tournament, it's not been easy for me there. But this year I feel different, I'm a lot calmer behind the court. On the court, I take more confidence in the big moments."

Aryna Sabalenka has withdrawn from the mixed doubles of the US Open.

The world No.1 has opted not to look for a replacement after her original partner, Grigor Dimitrov, pulled out. It follows him injuring his pectoral muscle at Wimbledon when leading against Jannik Sinner.

There have been contrasting reactions to Venus Williams being handed a wildcard for the US Open at 45.

The world No.577 is set to become the oldest singles player in 44 years at the tournament. On social media, many fans have argued it is a 'waste' of an entry.

But other believe the icon, who will also play in the revamped mixed doubles alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka, will help sell tickets in the early rounds.



Anna Kalinskaya complained about 'drunk' fans during her fourth-round match against Ekaterina Alexandrova at the Cincinnati Open.

Here's the moment the star approached the umpire to complain...

The former World No.6 was leading Rinderknech 7-6(4) 4-2 in their third round clash, when the Frenchman retired as he was unable to continue due to the heat. Rinderknech collapsed on the court in the second set, and subsequently threw in the towel soon after.

It feels like we're in an oven, even for the fans," said Auger-Aliassime. "We're always on the move and focused on trying to win, but the crowd is sitting for a long time, and so are our coaches. A friendly reminder to everyone: drink plenty of water, bring hats, and cool off as much as possible."



Carlos Alcaraz is at risk of being fined after ignoring the umpire's instructions to cover the logo on his water bottle.

During his win over Luca Nardi, the Spaniard reacted angrily after official Greg Allensworth gave the order, arguing it went against tournament sponsor deals. Alcaraz refused to comply and is now likely to be sanctioned.

Alexander Zverev has revealed he received “professional help” having opened up about his mental state following his defeat at Wimbledon last month.

After suffering a tough five-set loss to Arthur Rinderknech in the opening round at Wimbledon, Zverev revealed he had been struggling mentally since his defeat in the Australian Open final in January.

“I feel very alone out there at times. I struggle mentally. I've been saying that since after the Australian Open,” the German explained in his press conference.

“Yeah, just don't know. I'm trying to find ways, trying to find ways to kind of get out of this hole. I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way. Yeah, I don't know. I feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice.”

The world No 3 added: “It's not a feeling on a tennis court, it's just a life feeling in general. As I said, I never felt this way before. I don't know. It's difficult to find joy outside the tennis court for me at the moment.

“It's not an excuse or anything. I think Arthur deserved to win today. It's nothing that… It's something I've felt for the past few months. Again, I just feel generally very, very alone and very lonely. I don't know. Just never felt that way before. I don't have the answers right now.”

Asked if he would consider seeking help from a therapist, Zverev said: “Maybe for the first time in my life I'll probably need it. I've been through a lot of difficulties.”

During the Cincinnati Masters, Zverev spoke about the benefits he is experiencing as a result of spending time away from tennis after Wimbledon.

“I took a longer period of time off after Wimbledon, which I haven't done in a very long time, which was very needed,” said the 28-year-old.

“I didn't train, I didn't do any physical work, I didn't play tennis for a longer time as well, which was the best thing for me to do.

“And I enjoyed my time, mentally freed up, got also some professional help as well there. I'm happy to be back on court.”

Zverev received advice from both Rafael Nadal — and the tennis great's uncle and former coach Toni Nadal — when training at his academy in Mallorca after Wimbledon.

The German returned to action in Toronto and reached the semi-finals — and he has also progressed to the last four in Cincinnati, where he will face Carlos Alcaraz.

Unless you're a tennis die-hard, you probably didn't know much about Terence Atmane before this week.

The 23-year-old Frenchman is ranked as the World No. 136 and has played just 14 matches on the ATP Tour in the last calendar year.

Atmane has had plenty of success on the Challenger Tour, but it hadn't translated to the big leagues — until now.

To say it's a surprise that Atmane is in the semifinals at the Cincinnati Masters, one of the most prestigious tournaments outside of the Grand Slams, is a wild understatement. 

We've seen qualifiers make runs at big-ticket events in the past, but few have had to navigate the path that Atmane has to get to the final four.

The 23-year-old defeated World No. 22 Flavio Cobolli in the Round of 64, upset rising star Joao Fonseca in his next match and then took care of Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune, two top-10 players, to set up a date with Jannik Sinner on Saturday.

Sinner, as usual, has been imperious in Cincinnati.

He's yet to drop a set (8-0), and he's only lost 22 games in his first four matches. That's an average of 2.75 games lost per set.

Atmane is a 10/1 underdog against Sinner, but he's just pulled two massive upsets to get to this point, so he'll be brimming with confidence and playing with house money.

It also wouldn't be a shock if it takes Sinner a handful of games to get used to Atmane's peculiar serve and his all-out attacking style.

The Play: Terence Atmane to win the first set (+520, FanDuel)

When it was first announced that American tennis star Emma Navarro would play with world No. 1 Jannik Sinner at the reimagined Mixed Doubles event at the U.S. Open, Navarro joked that she “would try to get a better partner next year.”

“He was begging me to play, he was saying, ‘I heard about your volleys and your doubles skills. Please. please play with me,” Navarro cracked last month on Tennis Channel. “I said, ‘Yeah, sure, I guess. I guess I'll play with you. You're not the best player, but I'll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year.'”

Well, it turns out that Navarro won't play with Sinner at all in the $1 million event that runs Tuesday and Wednesday at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

The No. 11-ranked player in the world and the daughter of billionaire Ben Navarro, Emma Navarro pulled out of the Mixed Doubles in order to play a WTA 500 event in Monterrey, Mexico in the week leading up to the start of the singles tournament at the U.S. Open (Aug. 24).

Navarro is coming off losing early on hardcourts in Montreal and Cincinnati, and playing in Mexico will give her more practice matches heading into the U.S. Open, where she reached the semifinals a year ago.

According to the USTA, Sinner has until 2 p.m. on Sunday to find a new partner for the U.S. Open. The Italian is set to play in the semifinals of the Cincinnati Open on Saturday, and could face Carlos Alcaraz in Monday's championship match.

Navarro, who made headlines at Wimbledon when a group of Knicks-clad fans attended her matches to support her, isn't the only big-name female star skipping the new Mixed Doubles event.

World No. 2 Coco Gauff said she didn't “want to waste mental energy” on the event, while No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and her partner Grigor Dimitrov are out after Dimitrov sustained a pectoral injury at Wimbledon.

The event is still loaded with star tandems, though, including Madison Keys and Frances Tiafoe, Emma Raducanu and Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic and Olga Danilovic, Taylor Townsend and Ben Shelton and Venus Williams and Jack Draper.

As for Navarro, good luck finding a “better partner” than the world No. 1 in 2026.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

For the twelfth time, Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev face off against each other in a tennis match, and this time the setting is the semifinal of the Cincinnati Open. While Alcaraz has won two of their last three matches, it is the German who leads the head-to-head, having won six of their matches so far.

Before we delve into match tactics, it is essential to understand some context about this rivalry, which is also the only head-to-head in tennis where Alcaraz trails, having played more than 8 matches.

On paper, the head-to-head might say 6-5 in favour of Zverev, but we need to add some boundaries to know better about what to expect in this coming match. Both players have benefited in victories during the course of this head-to-head when the opponent was either not what he would become one day (Zverev two matches against Alcaraz in 2021) or a tired and overplayed opponent (Alcaraz two matches against Zverev, one at the US Open in 2023, the other at Madrid 2022).



Take those out, and the more definitive head-to-head to me is Zverev leading 4-3, and an interesting trend emerges. Every match played on faster conditions has been won by the German, while every match played on slower, more importantly, higher-bouncing surfaces has been won by Alcaraz, with Roland Garros 2022 being an exception.

This match will be on a 43 Court pace index fast surface that, unlike the other fast surface matches these two have played, has good bounce on it. So, it is a surface that I would still say favours the German in this match-up, but it provides a window of opportunity to Alcaraz that other fast surfaces don't. Now it is up to him to make the most of it.

What has been one of the most important aspects of this match-up to me is who wins the second-serve battle.



Six of the seven above-mentioned matches were won by the player who defended their second serve best. Naturally, factors such as first-serve landed percentage set this stat up, but this is still an important trend and a place where, if Alcaraz wants to win this upcoming match, he will need to be smarter.

Why specify Alcaraz and not Zverev? Well, because the German has a distinct pattern for his serves. Firstly, he has one of the best serves in the game, and on top of that, he makes around 70% of his first serves, a truly remarkable rate given how good his serve is. His second serve now too, due to a change in the toss (decreasing the height), has been increasingly reliable.

Alcaraz, on the other hand, has a good (better for his height) first serve but a suspect second delivery, especially against elite backhand counterpunchers. His most reliable second serve is still the kicker out wide, which Zverev, due to his long frame, can neutralise for stretches, especially given how the “kick” won't be as high as it is on a clay court.

This poses an interesting adjustment for the Spaniard, where he will likely have to trust serves in his arsenal, which he normally does not. And being at a disadvantage in the serve department, he will have to make up for it on return, where he is, in theory, clearly superior to the German.

He has two options: stick near the baseline and rob Zverev of time, a return position that is better for his backhand return, or stand back and give his forehand time to load up and return the majority of the serves. Each comes with its cons, as the former isn't great for his forehand, and in the latter, he will have to make sure that the return ball sent back is heavy and long enough to put the German on his back foot.

Alcaraz's return performance so far this tournament illustrates the challenge. He has won 36.1% of first-serve return points and 52.8% of second-serve return points, and these numbers have come against non-elite servers. He will need to step it up significantly to trouble Zverev.

With Alcaraz having arguably the best forehand in the game and Zverev having arguably the best backhand in the game, this match-up always has a showcase of Tier One weaponry. In the rallies, they will both aim for as many cross exchanges with their weapon as possible, and whoever wins this battle will increase their chances to win. Both are great defenders; Alcaraz Cis more explosive, and Zverev is a touch more reliable.

Normally, against players like Jannik Sinner or Novak Djokovic, Alcaraz aims to play high to the backhand and low, fast to the forehand. He will have to do the opposite in this match-up. Zverev's long frame means he isn't as troubled by the high balls to his backhand as other players are, while his suspect forehand technique also does well against flat pace, often counterpunching it. The key in this match-up will be to go high to his forehand, disturbing the contact points and bringing the elongated swing into play, while going low or flat into his backhand, as post-ankle injury he hasn't been as reliable there as before it.

It goes without saying that Alcaraz gets the edge here. He is the more accomplished player, has played way bigger matches just this year, and, let's face it, this is a setting and a tournament where he isn't the heavy favourite as he would be at say Roland Garros or Wimbledon, which surely eases some pressure.

Zverev, on the other hand, is known for tightening up at important moments, having a rough season by his own admission, and despite what the odds say, will believe this is a match he should win if he is to compete at New York. This could either tighten him even more or give him a purpose to play his best tennis.

Either player has a genuine chance to win this match witht the German leads their head-to-head record 5–2 on hard courts, and one of his losses came at Indian Wells, where the conditions are quite different from Cincinnati. That said, Alcaraz appears healthy and motivated, and he has looked increasingly sharp as the week has progressed. Despite tactics and other factors, he is an better player overall than the German, and that gap has only widened this year. However, the difference in serve on a slick, fast hard court could reduce the impact of that advantage.

The semifinals are set on the men's side of the draw at the ATP Cincinnati Masters with a day of thrilling tennis in the offing in Ohio. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for both matches, but who will advance to the finals?

Head-to-head: first meeting

The defending champion, Jannik Sinner, has been in imperious form and is into the semifinals without dropping a set. Sinner dominated in the quarterfinals against Felix-Auger-Aliassime, who managed to win just two games. The Italian has now extended his hard-court win streak to 25 matches, and it's hard to see him stopping anytime soon. His relentless baseline game, coupled with improved net play, is a recipe for success.

Terence Atmane is playing the tennis of his life and has upset two top-10 players back-to-back. He was incredible against Holger Rune in the quarterfinals, and his forehand was firing on all cylinders. He has demonstrated his talent, but facing Sinner will be a step up that he probably isn't quite ready for. Sinner does everything better and won't give anything away cheaply. Expect the world #1 to dominate from the baseline and suffocate the Frenchman.

Prediction: Sinner in 2

Head-to-head: Zverev 6-5 Alcaraz

Carlos Alcaraz is in his second Cincinnati Open final, as he did just enough to get past Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinal. Alcaraz played a great first set, but then his level dropped and Rublev raised his. Alcaraz stepped up his level in the third set but lost his focus again when serving for the match. He will need to bring a better level to beat one of his toughest opponents in the form of Alexander Zverev, who cruised past Toronto champion Ben Shelton in the quarterfinals.

The match was of low quality, as both Zverev and Shelton struggled physically. Zverev faced difficulty in breathing but seemed to be getting better towards the end of the match. He is in his fourth semifinal here and will hope to be physically ready for the challenge against Alcaraz. The German has played some of his best tennis against Alcaraz in the past, and will be confident to do that again. If Zverev serves at his best, it will be difficult for the Spaniard to stop him. Zverev might just have the edge here in what promises to be a fiercely contested match.

Prediction: Zverev in 3

Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz among the wild card teams announced by the US Tennis Association for its mixed doubles event on August 19-20; The US Open is live on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, streaming service NOW and the Sky Sports app from August 24

Saturday 16 August 2025 09:03, UK

British No 1 Jack Draper has re-paired with Jessica Pegula for the reimagined US Open mixed doubles tournament after Paula Badosa pulled out, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka also withdrew.

Jannik Sinner, who along with Sabalenka will defend their singles crowns at Flushing Meadows from Sunday, August 24 - live on Sky Sports - is currently without a mixed doubles partner after Emma Navarro instead signed up to play in the US Open warm-up event in Monterrey.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player



Sinner has until 2pm on Sunday, August 17 to repair with an alternative partner to maintain a direct entry into the competition based on his singles ranking, otherwise the world No 1 would have to rely on a wild card in order to compete.

Sabalenka was originally due to compete alongside the injured Grigor Dimitrov and has opted not to re-pair with an alternative men's play.

Traditionally played in the latter stages of Grand Slams, US Open organisers announced earlier this year they would hold the mixed doubles tournament over two days in the week before the main tournament in an attempt to attract more high-profile players.

The mixed doubles championship will take place on August 19 and 20, with a reduced format of first-to-four-game sets and no-ad scoring, while there is $1m (£750,000) in prize money at stake for the winners.

The top eight teams with the best combined singles ranking - which includes Draper and Pegula - qualify directly, with eight further teams given wild card spots.

Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz have been confirmed as wild card entries, as have 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and his partner Olga Danilovic, while 45-year-old great Venus Williams will compete with Reilly Opelka.

Two final wild card pairings are yet to be announced, with Britain's Katie Boulter and fiance Alex de Minaur - ranked 50th and eighth in the world, respectively - hopeful of claiming one of the available spots.

Elena Rybakina beat Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets to set up Cincinnati semi-final against Iga Swiatek; Carlos Alcaraz beats Andrey Rublev to reach last four; watch the Cincinnati Open until the finals on Monday, before the US Open begins on August 24, live on Sky Sports

Elena Rybakina stunned defending champion Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open to set up a semi-final meeting with Iga Swiatek. 

Playing in her first tournament since losing in the Wimbledon semi-finals in July, the world No 1 was beaten 6-1 6-4 by Rybakina in little more than an hour on Friday.

The Kazakh will face Wimbledon champion Swiatek in the semi-finals on Sunday after the third seed eased to a 6-3 6-4 win over Anna Kalinskaya earlier on Friday.

Jasmine Paolini will meet Veronika Kudermetova in the other semi-final, after the Italian fifth seed battled back from a set down to beat world No 2 Coco Gauff 2-6 6-4 6-3 - the American's serve again a liability, with 16 double faults in defeat.

Rybakina continued to produce the strong form that saw her reach the semi-finals in Montreal last week before she was beaten by shock winner Victoria Mboko.

The 2022 Wimbledon champion struck 11 aces as she avoided being broken on serve, with Sabalenka failing to take any of her five break points - one of which came in the first game of the match.

After breaking twice to ease to the first set, Rybakina broke early in the second set for a 2-1 lead, before seeing off two break points in her penultimate service game to stay ahead.

She ultimately finished the job with ease, holding to love to see out a win that ensures she'll move up at least one place from her current position of No 10 in the world rankings.

Poland's Swiatek secured a decisive break to move 3-1 ahead in the first set against 28th seed Kalinskaya, before saving a break point herself as she closed out the opener.

The pair exchanged breaks early in the second set, before Swiatek struck again to go 4-3 in front. Kalinskaya showed resilience to survive four match points in a remarkable penultimate game of the match, but Swiatek kept her composure to take the next opportunity moments later.

A win for Swiatek on Sunday would put the former world No 1 through to her first WTA 1000 final in 15 months and seal her place at the season-ending WTA Finals for a fifth straight year.

Elsewhere, Kudermetova earned a dominant 6-1 6-2 win over Varvara Gracheva to set up her last-four clash with Paolini, following her third-straight victory over Gauff.

Carlos Alcaraz saw off a spirited Andrey Rublev to book his spot in the semi-final of the men's draw with a 6-3 4-6 7-5 win.

Alcaraz took the first set but Rublev fought back to even things up in the second set and it finally looked like Alcaraz would seal victory when he broke Rublev to go 5-3 up, but his opponent broke straight back to put the contest back on serve.

Rublev needed to hold serve to take the game to a tie-break but a double fault clinched victory for Alcaraz.

The 22-year-old hit 11 aces on his way to victory and remains on course for another final showdown with world No 1 Jannik Sinner, who faces French qualifier Terence Atmane in the last four.

Alcaraz will first need to overcome third seed Alexander Zverev in his semi-final, after the German romped to a 6-2 6-2 win over last week's champion in Toronto, Ben Shelton.

Zverev needed just one hour and 17 minutes minutes to snap the American's nine-match winning streak and reach the semi-finals for the fourth time in his past four appearances.

Zverev's biggest concern of the night was his own health. He called for the doctor at 2-1 in the second set as he appeared to be struggling with his breathing.

Plus: Carlos Alcaraz holds off a revved-up Andrey Rublev.BySteve TignorPublished Aug 16, 2025 copy_link

MASON, Ohio—On Thursday, I wrote about the daytime summer vibe at the Cincinnati Open: The spectators fanning their faces, the roller-coasters rising and falling at the nearby amusement park, the cars barreling by on the highway, on their way, hopefully, to August vacations.On Friday, that summer feeling came at night. During the Coco Gauff-Jasmine Paolini quarterfinal, a series of slow-paced pops could be heard coming from the other side of Route 71. Pop…pop…pop. Boom…boom…boom. Soon, lights materialized, and burst into shapes and colors. They were Friday night fireworks—nothing spectacular, the kind you see and hear across the country on summer evenings. Gauff and Paolini didn't stop playing, and the crowd, perhaps knowing what was coming, didn't ooh and aah. But the showers of light quietly made the scene more festive, like a pleasantly muggy small-town fair.While the atmosphere was all-American, it wasn't a cheerful night for the home fans. Two of their most popular players, Ben Shelton and Coco Gauff, took hard defeats. Here's a look at how those matches, and Carlos Alcaraz's earlier win, played out on the stadium court.

While the atmosphere was all-American, it wasn't a cheerful night for the home fans. Two of their most popular players, Ben Shelton and Coco Gauff, took hard defeats. Here's a look at how those matches, and Carlos Alcaraz's earlier win, played out on the stadium court.

Andrey Rublev looked ready and revved from the start. He has hit something of a ceiling in 2025, where he's no longer going deeper at the majors or higher in the rankings. In fact, he's out of the Top 10 for the first time since 2019. At Wimbledon last month, he lost in four fairly tough sets to Carlos Alcaraz. On Friday, he seemed like he really wanted a breakthrough against a player of the Spaniard's standing.Early on, that energy came out as it often does for the Russian—in a fit of rage, this time directed at chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani, about the serve clock. By the second set, though, Rublev had channeled his fury into his shots, and from there he went toe to toe with Alcaraz the rest of the way.

The level was uneven from both, but the intensity matched the heat in the air. The moment I'll remember most was Rublev giving it absolutely everything, red hair flying and blue eyes wide, to track down an Alcaraz lob and loft back one of his own, over his shoulder. It landed just wide, but the effort, in that weather, was off the charts.Both hit 27 winners and nearly won the same number of points. Down a set, Rublev came back to win the second. Down 3-5 in the third, he broke to stay alive. Down 5-6, he played a perfect serve-forehand combination to reach 40-30, one point from a tiebreaker.And then, out of nowhere, he fell apart. He lost the last three points, and double faulted on the final one.

“Today I maintain the positive thoughts,” Alcaraz said. “Lost focus a few times, but I stayed there, strong mentally, and that's what I'm most proud about.”“I'm playing a third set accepting that it's going to be a tough battle, and I love that,” he continued. “It was extreme conditions, but I'm just really happy to be able to live these kinds of experiences.”

That was how a British commentator described the first match of the night session, the quarterfinal between Alexander Zverev and Ben Shelton. It was hard, unfortunately, to disagree. Each player was having his own personal physical meltdown at the same time.On one side of the court, Zverev called out the doctor to tell him that he was sweating more than he ever had, couldn't breathe, and was dizzy between each point. After the doctor checked his vitals and gave him a new inhaler, Zverev seemed to recover.

On the other side of the net, though, there was no recovery for Shelton. The American, who was on a nine-match win streak and had gone deep at three straight tournaments, finally hit a wall. He was a step slow from the start, which was enough, eventually, to cause his strokes to go completely awry.The pro-Ben crowd tried whatever they could think of to rally him, but nothing worked. His shots only sailed farther beyond the lines. By the end, a shell-shocked Shelton had slammed his racquet to the court, pounded it against his bag, and taken off his shirt and thrown that to the ground, too. This time, maybe for the first time, when Ben turned to his dad and coach, Bryan, he couldn't think of anything to say.

These were the words that I thought I heard come from Coco Gauff, as she failed to make another serve in her quarterfinal with Jasmine Paolini, and watched her early lead continue to erode. By the time the match was over, the lead was long gone, the double faults had mounted to 16, and her forehand errors had climbed toward 50.As I wrote on Thursday, Gauff, after bottoming out on grass, is trying to rebuild for hard courts, and specifically for the US Open. Some days, it looks like the 2023 champ will make it in time, that it's only a matter of getting in enough reps for her to steady her serve and get her confidence on her forehand back.

Other days, like today, it looks like a very steep climb ahead. This was a match that, when she has been winning, Gauff might have pulled out on fight alone. And she fought hard and well enough to make the third set competitive. But by then Paolini was clearly the superior ball-striker, and this time no amount of scrap and hustle from Coco was going to change that.The big Cincy crowd, who stayed until the bitter end, grew quieter with each passing game and Gauff error. The fireworks were all on the other side of the highway.

Like Mboko in Montreal, the Atmane train has torn through the draw of a 1000. But is an in-form Sinner the end of the line?BySteve TignorPublished Aug 16, 2025 copy_link

🖥️📱 Click here for live coverage on TennisChannel.com Estimated start time: 3:00 p.m. ET, Saturday, August 16If you're unfamiliar with Terence Atmane's work—and no one would blame you if you are—the first thing you should know about him is that his playing idol is Fernando Gonzalez. Not Roger Federer, not Rafael Nadal, not Novak Djokovic, not even any of his fellow Frenchmen. Gonzalez, as you may remember, was an aughts-era Chilean who basically hit his forehand as hard as possible every chance he could. That may sound like basic strategy, but it worked well enough to get him to an Australian Open final 20-odd years ago.And that's how pretty much how Atmane has gone about blowing up the draw, Victoria Mboko style, at the Cincinnati Open over the past week. The 23-year-old, world No. 136 has faced four guys who we thought might be dark horses—Cobolli, Fonseca, Fritz, Rune—and sent them all packing just as Gonzalez would have, with his forehand. Atmane, a lefty, hits it as often as he can, as hard as he can, and as close to the lines as he can. None of his higher-ranked opponents have found a way to counter it. From the start against Fritz, Atmane took the rallies to the American with more aggressive energy, and was rewarded for it.

Now he'll go from facing dark horses to facing a favorite. Will Sinner find a way to derail the Atmane train? The top seed appears to be in the right form to do it. After a couple of couple of ordinary outings against Gabriel Diallo and Adrian Mannarino, Sinner was back to his top-tier self against Felix Auger-Aliassime on Thursday. He beat the former Top Tenner 6-0, 6-2, and didn't allow the Canadian to hit a winner for the first 40 minutes.👉 READ MORE: What's the best bet in Atmane vs. Sinner?Sinner didn't bother trying to downplay his performance.“I returned very, very well,” he said. “My serve was great. I raised my level, which I was looking for.”Yet it was a comment from Auger-Aliassime that may better explain why this match was so one-sided. He told Tennis Channel beforehand that Sinner, who just won Wimbledon, is essentially unbeatable right now. Does Atmane believe the same thing? The two have never played. Can he bring the same ultra-aggressive style and total conviction to his forehand and his attacking game plan that we've seen so far, against an opponent of Sinner's stature?If he does, Atmane has a chance to keep the match close, but I still wouldn't pick him to win. His forehand is excellent, his lefty spin is tricky, and he should feel like he has nothing to lose. But his backhand is not at that level, especially on the return; I would expect Sinner to pick on it with his slice serve in both the deuce and ad courts. I'd also expect him control more of the rallies and track down more of the Frenchman's forehands. The Atmane train has been fun to watch, but I'll say this is the end of the line. Winner: Sinner

Can he bring the same ultra-aggressive style and total conviction to his forehand and his attacking game plan that we've seen so far, against an opponent of Sinner's stature?If he does, Atmane has a chance to keep the match close, but I still wouldn't pick him to win. His forehand is excellent, his lefty spin is tricky, and he should feel like he has nothing to lose. But his backhand is not at that level, especially on the return; I would expect Sinner to pick on it with his slice serve in both the deuce and ad courts. I'd also expect him control more of the rallies and track down more of the Frenchman's forehands. The Atmane train has been fun to watch, but I'll say this is the end of the line. Winner: Sinner

Where the German is still searching for his first major title, and has never been No. 1, the Spaniard has five majors to his name and has spent 36 weeks in the top spot.The same is true for their 2025 seasons. Where Alcaraz dominated the clay swing, repeated at Roland Garros, and made the Wimbledon final, Zverev has looked lost in the wilderness much of the time, to the point where he started talking this summer about how alone he feels on court.And yet, if you go by a couple of other relevant metrics—rankings and head to head—you could say that the Spaniard and the German come into this match on even terms.

They've spent 2025 ranked No. 2 and No. 3. Zverev started the year at No. 2, but they traded positions for good in May. Their record against each other is just as close: Zverev leads 6-5. He's also 4-2 on hard courts, and he won their most recent meeting, at the ATP Finals on indoor hard in Turin last fall. Alcaraz has a 3-1 advantage at the majors, and he's won both of their previous contests on U.S. hard courts easily.In other words, Zverev matches up surprisingly well against Alcaraz one on one. His serve is as effective against him as it is against anyone else. His consistency, ranginess and depth of shot forces Alcaraz to hit more balls than he would like to finish a rally. Zverev also doesn't have to generate a lot of his own pace when he faces him.But the most important positives for Zverev in this matchup may be mental. One, he enjoys Alcaraz's sporting quality, and the mutual respect that he and the Spanish superstar have for each other. Two, Zverev doesn't have a whole lot to use when he plays him; a loss isn't going to destroy him psychologically.So who might have the edge on Saturday?

Alcaraz is not the overwhelming favorite, but he has found ways to get the job done in Cincinnati.© Anita T. Aguilar

If we go by their seasons and their current levels of confidence, Alcaraz is the favorite. Zverev has won one small title this year, at home in Germany, and he has come up short in most of his big matches, even when he has played decent tennis. His semifinal defeat to Karen Khachanov in Toronto two weeks ago was typical. Zverev played evenly with him through three sets, until they reached the deciding tiebreaker. Then he suddenly couldn't make a ball; after each miss, he shot his dad a pained look that said, “Why is this happening again?”After Friday, there's also some question about Zverev's physical state. He called the doctor out during his quarterfinal and talked about how much he was sweating, and how much trouble he had breathing. Afterward, he said he didn't know what happened, but it's going to be similarly hot here on Saturday evening.All of that said, Alcaraz is not the overwhelming favorite. His three-set quarterfinal win over Andrey Rublev was hardly his cleanest. He had more errors than winners, and he failed to serve out the match at 5-3 in the third set.But Alcaraz was still satisfied with the performance, mainly because, as he said, he “stayed with the positive emotions” even when the errors were flowing off his racquet. Maybe that positivity, coupled with Zverev's long-running negativity about his game and his year, will make the difference between them this time. Winner: Alcaraz

John Newcombe stands among the most iconic figures in Australian tennis, competing in an era dominated by legends like Rod Laver. Known for his distinctive style and versatility, Newcombe captured Grand Slam titles across all formats—singles, doubles, and mixed doubles—leaving an enduring mark on the sport.

Born in Sydney on May 23, 1944, Newcombe gravitated toward sports from an early age but truly excelled on the tennis court. He became Australia's junior champion in 1961 and repeated the feat in the following two years, earning a Davis Cup call-up at just 19 in 1963.

Over his career, Newcombe amassed 68 singles titles, including seven Grand Slam singles championships at the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open. He never captured a French Open singles title, but his achievements were nonetheless remarkable. 

He also reached the world No. 1 ranking in singles, becoming the second player ever to hold the top ATP spot after Ilie Nastase when the official rankings were introduced in 1973.

Newcombe's career was defined by fierce rivalries with the era's top stars, including Rod Laver, Arthur Ashe, Ilie Nastase, Guillermo Vilas, and Jimmy Connors.

One notable clash occurred ahead of the 1975 Australian Open final. Newcombe had accused Connors of avoiding him on the court, prompting a sharp response from the American.

Jimmy Connors said before the final: “Newcombe should talk more with his racket and less with his mouth. He says that I've been avoiding him, but I don't need to avoid anyone. Whenever I reach a final, he's not there”.

Despite Connors' remarks, Newcombe won the final in four sets. The two would face each other four more times in their careers, with Connors winning each subsequent encounter.

Newcombe also reached World No. 1 in doubles, primarily partnering with Tony Roche. Together, they won 17 Grand Slam doubles titles. Including two mixed doubles titles, Newcombe's career total across all Majors reached 26. In Davis Cup competition, he helped Australia secure five championships: 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, and 1973.

Newcombe retired from professional tennis in 1981. In 1986, he and Tony Roche were inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. From 1995 to 2000, he served as captain of Australia's Davis Cup team, guiding them to victory in 1999.

He later relocated to Texas with his wife, former German player Angelika Pfannenburg, and founded the John Newcombe Tennis Ranch, which offers recreational tennis programs for children. Newcombe remains active in the tennis world, including presenting awards at the 2025 Australian Open.

Three players that were on the initial direct entry list for the upcoming US Open mixed doubles event have dropped out, leading to multiple changes for the two-day competition.Among them: Emma Navarro, who will instead play the WTA 500 event in Monterrey next week. The 2024 US Open semifinalist was one half of the top-ranked duo alongside four-time major winner Jannik Sinner.

The defending men's champion at Flushing Meadows has until Sunday at 2 p.m. to find another partner ranked high enough to maintain direct entry, though his participation, too, is up in the air. Sinner will take the court Saturday as a heavy favorite in his Cincinnati Open semifinal with 136th-ranked Terence Atmane. Mixed doubles action in Queens begins Tuesday less than 24 hours after the Cincinnati singles finals are staged.Paula Badosa had previously pulled out from the hard-court major due to an ongoing back injury, leaving Jack Draper to seek a replacement for a second time with Zheng Qinwen sidelined by elbow surgery. The left-hander has found one in Jessica Pegula, after her countryman Tommy Paul pulled the plug. Draper and Pegula held up as a direct entry by re-pairing with a combined ranking of 9 (as of the July 28 deadline) that kept them among the top-eight entrants.👉 Read More: Pegula on the bigger issue with US Open mixed doubles

Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti, who just missed out on making the original cut and didn't receive one of the six announced wild cards, are now in the field as direct entrants.Two more wild cards still remain on the table in addition to the spot that opened up—and there are several players beyond Sinner who could also be swayed to change their plans. Carlos Alcaraz awaits the winner of Alexander Zverev and Ben Shelton in the Cincinnati final four. All three are currently slated to play mixed doubles.The same goes for Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina, who meet for a Cincinnati final berth on Sunday. Paolini could also join that conversation, as she looks to extend her stay in Ohio with a quarterfinal win against Coco Gauff on Friday evening.

The defending men's champion at Flushing Meadows has until Sunday at 2 p.m. to find another partner ranked high enough to maintain direct entry, though his participation, too, is up in the air. Sinner will take the court Saturday as a heavy favorite in his Cincinnati Open semifinal with 136th-ranked Terence Atmane. Mixed doubles action in Queens begins Tuesday less than 24 hours after the Cincinnati singles finals are staged.Paula Badosa had previously pulled out from the hard-court major due to an ongoing back injury, leaving Jack Draper to seek a replacement for a second time with Zheng Qinwen sidelined by elbow surgery. The left-hander has found one in Jessica Pegula, after her countryman Tommy Paul pulled the plug. Draper and Pegula held up as a direct entry by re-pairing with a combined ranking of 9 (as of the July 28 deadline) that kept them among the top-eight entrants.👉 Read More: Pegula on the bigger issue with US Open mixed doubles

Jasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti, who just missed out on making the original cut and didn't receive one of the six announced wild cards, are now in the field as direct entrants.Two more wild cards still remain on the table in addition to the spot that opened up—and there are several players beyond Sinner who could also be swayed to change their plans. Carlos Alcaraz awaits the winner of Alexander Zverev and Ben Shelton in the Cincinnati final four. All three are currently slated to play mixed doubles.The same goes for Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina, who meet for a Cincinnati final berth on Sunday. Paolini could also join that conversation, as she looks to extend her stay in Ohio with a quarterfinal win against Coco Gauff on Friday evening.

	Although Brad Pitt is bringing back Cliff Booth for a sequel to Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino is sitting this one out as director.


	In addition to not wanting his final film to be a sequel, the 2x Oscar winner explained why he chose not to helm The Adventures of Cliff Booth, passing the baton and his script on to fellow director David Fincher.


	“I think me and David Fincher are the two best directors,” he said on The Church of Tarantino podcast. “So the idea that David Fincher actually wants to adapt my work, to me, shows a level of seriousness towards my work that I think needs to be taken into account.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	After Deadline reported in April that Pitt and Se7en director Fincher got Tarantino's approval to use his script to make the sequel, which was originally set to be his final directorial outing, the cast has since added Pitt, Carla Gugino, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Elizabeth Debicki, Scott Caan, Corey Fogelmanis and JB Tadena.


	The movie is believed to have scored a $20 million California film-tax credit, and Pitt told Deadline filming would begin in July.


	In the same podcast, Tarantino also explained why he chose not to make The Movie Critic his 10th and final film. “There was a challenge that I gave to myself when I did it. Can I take the most boring profession in the world and make it an interesting movie?” he said. “Every Tarantino title promises so much, except The Movie Critic.”

	











	Meanwhile, Tarantino is taking a break from filmmaking as he turns to theater, after telling Deadline he's “really juiced about live theater right now” at Sundance in January.

Actress Torrey DeVitto's life looks nothing like it did several years ago, and she couldn't be happier about it. The “Chicago Med” alum and Hallmark Channel star posted several updates in her Instagram Stories on August 15, 2025, celebrating how “in love” she is with all the changes in her life. 

First, the “Love's Greek to Me” star moved during the pandemic from Los Angeles to a farmhouse in the idyllic small town in Michigan where her mom lives. 

Since then, DeVitto, 41, ended her relationship with former Chicago Cubs manager David Ross, met and married local business owner Jared LaPine, and the couple became first-time parents in November 2024. Reflecting on her complete life makeover, she hopes other women will be inspired to trust that it's never too late for dreams to come true. 

A post shared by Torrey DeVitto (@torreydevitto)

To share how much her life has changed in a few short years, DeVitto posted a photo to her Instagram Stories of herself standing under a big tree, wearing a white lace nightgown, salmon-colored cover-up, and green boots while holding her daughter, Lyle-Josephine Alina LaPine. 

DeVitto captioned the post, “If you would have told me 3 years ago I'd be married to my dream man and walking our trails with my baby and coffee most mornings in my ridiculous nightgown and farm boots, I would have told you…no way..where, how and when?!”

“Yet here we are,” DeVitto continued, “and I'm in love and obsessed with this life we are building.”

The actress, whose first Hallmark movie — “Best Christmas Party Ever” — aired in 2014 while she was still starring in “Pretty Little Liars,” per IMDb, noted in her caption that she hoped to inspire other women not to give up on their own dreams. 

“So many women talk to me about fear of timelines,” DeVitto wrote. “Just a reminder: I met my husband at 39 and delivered my baby at 40. I've said it before and I'll say it again. Timelines don't exist.”

In another August 15 Instagram Story, featuring a photo of DeVitto snuggling her infant, who was strapped into her baby carrier, the actress cutely wrote, “Do they make carriers for 18 years –? Asking for a friend 🥹”

A post shared by Torrey DeVitto (@torreydevitto)

DeVitto has shared before how grateful she is for the unexpected turns her life has taken. While ringing in 2025, she shared a post on New Year's Eve, thanking the previous year for its many gifts. 

Looking back and addressing the year 2024, she wrote, “You turned me 40, turned me into a wifey and a Mom ❤️. There's no way you will ever be topped, but I am excited to see all the new adventures 2025 has to bring for me and my family of 3. Who knew at 40 I'd be walking into 2025 saying, ‘I'm just getting started.'”

Captioning a June 12 photo taken at the beach while DeVitto was holding little Lyle-Josephine under an umbrella, Devitto wrote that she was fighting “against what society pressures me into thinking my post partum body and sleep deprived self should look like because building this dreamy life with my little family is all that matters. ❤️”

“Some days end with a gold star, other days feel like a big fat splat on the face,” she continued. “But the one constant is : every night I hit the pillow with a smile on my face and all the love in my heart knowing I am exactly where I should be, doing exactly what I am meant to be doing. ❤️”

	Guests at a hotel in Alaska found eight pages of documents from President Donald Trump's meetings Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a printer, NPR reported Saturday.


	The documents show the schedule of the summit with times and locations. They also show the lunch menu, the lunch seating chart, and the phone numbers of three of Trump administration staffers. The documents were found in a printer at Hotel Captain Cook, a four-star hotel in Anchorage that is near the military base where the summit took place. 


	Trump and Putin have had a hot and cold relationship, with Trump alternately taunting him and praising him. On Friday, the two leaders walked a red carpet together, as they met to discuss a potential end to Russia's war in Ukraine. The meeting ended abruptly without a Ukraine ceasefire deal. Trump told reporters it was “an extremely productive meeting,” but they “didn't get there.”


	“I think the meeting was a 10,” Trump told Fox News' Sean Hannity.

	











	The documents show which officials were involved in the summit. A “2:2” meeting took place among Trump; Steve Witkoff, special envoy for peace missions; Putin; and Yuri Ushakov, an aide to Putin for foreign policy and Putin's “America guru.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent were also involved, among others. 


	The documents show that Trump planned to give Putin an “American bald eagle desk statue.” 

	











	The discovery of the documents “strikes me as further evidence of the sloppiness and the incompetence of the administration,” Jon Michaels, a professor of law at UCLA, told NPR. “You just don't leave things in printers. It's that simple.”


	This document breach is reminiscent of when Trump administration officials added Atlantic Editor-in-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal chat where they discussed plans to bomb Yemen — though likely less embarrassing. 


	The lunch, which did not end up happening, was to be held “in honor of his excellency Vladimir Putin.” The seating chart shows assigned spots for 13 officials, with Americans on one side and Russians on the other. Meeting organizers planned to serve filet mignon, halibut Olympia, and crème brûlée.


	The White House and the State Department did not respond to NPR's questions about the documents. 


	The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Putin for war crimes — which Trump ignored — making Alaska a safe place for Putin to fly to and avoid arrest.

	Through this meeting, Putin has “broken out of international isolation” and “wasn't in the least challenged” by Trump, Laurie Bristow, a former British ambassador to Russia, told the Associated Press. 


	“They spent three years telling everyone Russia was isolated, and today they saw the beautiful red carpet laid out for the Russian president in the U.S.,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told Axios.

	Despite reports of behind-the-scenes drama on Desperate Housewives, Jesse Metcalfe was just happy to be part of the neighborhood.


	The actor recently recalled his run on the ABC comedy-drama as teen gardener John Rowland, admitting he “was oblivious” to any on-set friction between the main cast of the show, created by Marc Cherry.


	“I was just happy to have a job,” he said on a recent panel, according to People. “I went through an entire pilot season, I didn't book anything, and I tested for Desperate Housewives, which was a recast, right at the end of that pilot season and ended up booking it.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Metcalfe said he was “very grateful” for his Season 1 series regular role of Gabrielle Solis' (Eva Longoria) young sidepiece, which he reprised a guest throughout the series.


	“I was just kind of riding the wave, you know, because that show really broke me and I had everything coming at me and I was just enjoying it,” he continued.


	“Matter of fact, there's a lot of stories about all the drama on that set between some of our lead females,” added Metcalfe. “And I was like, I was oblivious to it, basically, you know, because I was just so thrilled to be on a show and just so in the moment.”


Desperate Housewives starred Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Longoria and Nicollette Sheridan as five women — mostly friends — living on Wisteria Lane, who begin uncovering dark secrets after their neighbor Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) kills herself.

	











	In addition to reports of friction between the women, Sheridan filed a $20 million lawsuit against ABC and Cherry, alleging that he assaulted her and then fired her from the show when she reported it. After a judge dismissed the battery charge and focused on the alleged wrongful termination, a mistrial was declared and the case was ultimately dismissed. 


	Following Deadline's exclusive report, Kerry Washington confirmed in May that her Onyx Collective offshoot Wisteria Lane is in development, “inspired” by Desperate Housewives.


	Written by Natalie Chaidez, Wisteria Lane is described as a fun, sexy, darkly comedic soap/mystery in the vein of Desperate Housewives, set among a group of five very different friends and sometimes frenemies who all live on a picture-perfect cul de sac called Wisteria Lane. On the surface, all the Wisteria neighbors are living the dream: beautiful homes, gorgeous families, shiny SUVs in the driveway. But behind those white picket fences and smiling Insta posts are secrets.

The Grammy winner gave one of her most revealing interviews in years on 'New Heights,' circumventing the traditional media landscape in the process. 


							By

Taylor Swift gave one of the most revealing and unguarded interviews of her two-decade career this week, and she did it completely on her own terms. 


	The world's biggest superstar has always been masterful at controlling the narrative around her art and her personal life, but as she embarked upon the rollout of The Life of a Showgirl on the New Heights podcast with boyfriend Travis Kelce on Wednesday, she didn't even try pulling any of the usual levers of the mainstream media landscape, circumventing them entirely instead.

	To be fair, it's been years since Swift's had to employ the traditional album rollout strategy that a smaller artist may be beholden to. She doesn't have to lock a Rolling Stone cover, nor does she need to rub elbows at listening parties or meet and greets (one of which turned traumatic for the budding popstar in 2013). And given her track record on the awards circuit, she could reliably announce her newest era during a Grammys telecast or the VMAs or whenever she so chooses.

	But the New Heights' appearance sets a new standard. She didn't even have to go through the likes of the new media guard, such as Alex Cooper's Call Her Daddy. With Travis by her side, this was safe. No moment carried any risk. Anything Swift didn't want out in the world won't ever see the light of day. And so, Swift could relax. As some Swifties online wrote, she dropped the “interview voice.” 

	











	Whether what we saw this week was the real Taylor Swift or yet another meticulously guarded layer for the world's savviest pop star is unclear. But her fans have certainly bought in. 


	“This is the most we have ever learned about this woman in a single day, ever,” reads the top comment on Swift's subreddit discussion of the New Heights episode. “ Still can't believe we were like, allowed to listen to her talk that openly. I feel like I was eavesdropping,” another fan wrote. 


	Never has Swift managed to grant so much of herself to the public while relinquishing so little of her own control. Has there ever been a pop culture figure as famous as Taylor Swift who's been less reliant on traditional media to share their message? 


	Even beyond the bounds of a traditional journalistic interview, Swift still managed to reveal lots of news, from how she sent her brother and mother to negotiate with Shamrock Capital first for her masters, to her return to working with legendary songwriter Max Martin on her upcoming record.  


	From a marketing level, the result was an overwhelming success. As Swift herself said on the podcast this week: “I'm always trying to figure out how to make music into more of an event. How do we make it romantic?” 


	With 1.3 million live viewers, it was the most-viewed podcast premiere in YouTube history since the platform launched podcasts back in 2023. The episode itself already has over 15 million views in just two days. The episode drove enough traffic to cause a mini-crash toward the end of the premiere.  

	











	The rest of the media world followed suit, too, with news outlets feverishly breaking out stories on every individual soundbite she gave, from the throwaway lines about her affinity for baking sourdough to the love story of Kelce's early days courting her on the very podcast she was now gracing. 


	Agency over her legacy has been the throughline of Swift's 2025 thus far. Following a six-year battle in what became one of the biggest controversies in music industry history, Swift finally gained ownership of her masters back in May. “All of the music I've ever made… now belongs… to me,” Swift declared in a triumphant letter she posted on her website. 


	And with that acquisition, she's beholden to no one. Swift is the architect of her own musical world around her, a situation most of her contemporaries only dream of. As she revealed to the Kelces this week, it's a move she's been saving up for since she was a teenager. The master rights on every one of her 12 albums (and four Taylor's Version re-records) are hers alone, as are the drawings and journals from her childhood. She has long retained her publishing and runs her own management company, with most of her team acting as Swift's employees.With just under two months until The Life of a Showgirl will inevitably take over the world, we're still only at the beginning of the marketing whistles she'll ring to build the hype around her next era. But this week makes it as clear as ever: the media needs Taylor Swift. But Swift has everything she needs all on her own.

	After nearly 25 years, the “cautionary” aspect of The Wire is no longer seen as a dire warning to society to star Wendell Pierce. 


	The Tony winner recently explained why the HBO show, which ran for five seasons from 2002 to '08, does not warrant a reboot as the show's societal themes are “demonstrated today” in real time.


	“The Wire is something that is classic,” he told Collider. “What makes it classic [is] it speaks to, it spoke to the audience then, it speaks to us now, it will speak to audiences long after it's over.”

	Explaining that the David Simon-created series about the police and drug dealers of Baltimore was “the cautionary tale that it was, the fact that it lets people know there's an ugly side of human nature,” Pierce noted, “We're seeing that demonstrated today.” 

	











	“I mean as we stand here on wonderful beautiful Hollywood Boulevard, they have American secret police who raided MacArthur Park today with guns drawn on citizens for no reason,” he said.


	“That's a dangerous thing,” added Pierce. “That's why The Wire is so poignant. It was a canary in the mine then and it's a canary in the mine now. What kind of society do we want to be a part of?”


	Pierce appeared in the acclaimed show's ensemble as veteran homicide detective William ‘Bunk' Moreland, starring throughout the five-season run.

The lead track from the Netflix animated musical continues its hot streak.


	After losing the top spot for a week, KPop Demon Hunters is back at No. 1 with hit single “Golden” (Aug. 15).


	The song from the Netflix musical first hit the top spot a fortnight ago, becoming the first K-pop No. 1 single in the U.K. for over 13 years. PSY's “Gangnam Style” was the last song to achieve the feat prior to that in 2012. 


Chappell Roan debuted at No. 1 with her comeback single “The Subway” and claimed the crown from the animated group HUNTR/X, which is sung by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami.

	But after a week away from the top, “Golden” has returned to the top spot with a massive weak on streaming. The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack has now secured the most U.K. album streams in a week for a soundtrack ever (18,631 streaming-equivalent sales), toppling a record held by the Barbie soundtrack in 2023 (17,681). Two additional songs from the soundtrack “Soda Pop” (No. 6) and “Your Idol” (No. 7), both by animated boyband Saja Boys, land in the top 10. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	Roan's “The Subway” falls just one spot to No. 2 as the U.S. star tours a number of European festivals throughout August. She'll head to the U.K.'s Reading & Leeds Festival next weekend (Aug. 22) for her debut headline performance at the iconic festival. 


	Disco Lines and Tinashe's “No Broke Boys” climbs two spots to reach a new peak (No. 3). The song first featured on Tinashe's 2024 LP Quantum Baby before its remix by the rising EDM producer.

	











	MK and Chrystal's “Dior,” which spent two weeks at the summit earlier this summer, finishes the week at No. 4, while Justin Bieber's “Daisies” holds steady at No. 5.

SATURDAY AM: Summer is heading into its August sleep with the overall weekend for all titles falling under $100M for the second time this season with an estimated $94M. The last time this happened was during the second weekend of summer, May 9-11, when all movies grossed just over $84M per Box Office Mojo. 


	As we said earlier this week, thank God Warner Bros moved Weapons into the late summer, or else we wouldn't be feeling a pulse. The Zach Cregger pic's hold for weekend 2 is looking better than yesterday's forecast, -43%, for a second frame of $25M after a $7.4M Friday. Many are foreseeing Weapons second Saturday to spike +33% over Friday with around $10M. 

	











	While Weapons isn't having the dips of Get Out and Sinners in its second weekend, any time a horror movie is holding better than -50%, that's remarkable, and this original horror movie is posting a second weekend that's better than this year's other big horror pics, Final Destination: Bloodlines (-63%) and 28 Years Later (-68%). Weapons has Imax and PLF screens. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Global for Weapons, which only cost New Line $38M+, stands at $120.4M through yesterday. 


	Disney's Freakier Friday looks to come in with a second weekend around $14M, -51%. 


	Universal's Bob Odenkirk uber-violent action sequel Nobody 2 despite solid exits of a B+ CinemaScore (the first one received an A-) and 4 stars and a 62% definite recommend on Comscore/Screen Engine's PostTrak, is coming in softer than expected with a $9.4M opening after a $3.8M Friday. The movie was cheap at net $25M before P&A spend, and clearly this is a Lionsgate model meat and potato action movie aimed at older dudes (who showed up at 39% over 45). In fact, Lionsgate's winter action movies did better with Den of Thieves 2 at $15M and Flight Risk at $11.5M. However, what's unfortunate here is that the audience (at least from a dollar-wise perspective) for Nobody 2 didn't expand that much from the original's opening, which posted $6.8M. With moviegoers skittish about returning to cinemas after Covid when the first title opened in 2021, the following for this IP has only grown so much. No John Wick phenomenon going on here with this 87Eleven production. The original John Wick, similar to the first Austin Powers, boomed on home entertainment fueling bigger theatrical openings and grosses for its part 2. It's unfortunate for Nobody as these movies are a great homage to Steve McQueen titles like The Hunter and Clint Eastwood movies such as Every Which Way But Loose. Nobody 2 has PLFs which are driving 29% of the weekend with an even play across the country, however, prominent in the West. AMC Burbank 16 is the single leading venue with just over $17K. Diversity demos for the overall 68% male leaning movie was 53% Caucasian, 22% Hispanic and Latino, 11% Black and 8% Asian American.

	











	Clearly, the fans were carrying the torch for Nobody 2 on social with RelishMix noticing overall positive sentiment and very little negative chatter. The social media universe for the sequel at close to 190M was 59% above action-drama genre norms across TikTok, Facebook, X, YouTube and Instagram combined. During Covid, the first movie's stats were 53% lighter. Interesting to note that the social media reach on Rami Malek's The Amateur was lower at 89M, but that movie opened higher at $14.8M.


AFTERNOON UPDATE: Currently, New Line's original horror movie Weapons is seeing a second weekend -49% decline with $22M after a second Friday of $6M at 3,450 sites. The ten-day on the Zach Cregger directed, written and produced movie is bound to hit $86M by Sunday.


	Disney's Freakier Friday is seeing a $4.5M second Friday, with a $14M-$15M second frame at 3,975 and -48% decline for a ten-day of $55M. That total will be -6% behind the end of second weekend cume of the original 2003 movie which ended its run at $110.2M. 


	Universal's Nobody 2 is right now standing at a $9.25M opening after a first Friday plus previews of $3.8M at 3,260 sites. 


	Disney/Marvel Studios' Fantastic Four: First Steps at 3,355 theaters has a fourth Friday of $2.3M, fourth weekend of $8M, -49% for a running cume by Sunday of $246.1M. 


	Third weekend of Uni/DreamWorks Animation's Bad Guys 2 is $5.7M, -46%, for a running total of $55.4M at 3,374. That total will be pacing -3% behind Bad Guys through 17 days. Today is $1.6M.  


FRIDAY AM: Summer is ratcheting down and the only major studio wide entry this box office frame is Universal's Bob Odenkirk action movie Nobody 2, which did $1.3 million from previews Thursday at 2,800 theaters that began at 2 p.m. The $25M 87North feature production is eyeing a $10M+ start in a marketplace where New Line's Weapons is expected to rule with $20M+.


	The Zach Cregger-directed Weapons ends its first week with $64M, which is 17% behind Sinners' first week of $77.5M but 29% ahead of Get Out‘s $49.8M first week. Sinners ended its run at $278.5M and Get Out finaled at $176M. Whether Weapons has a slight dip ala Get Out‘s second frame (-15%) or Sinners (-5%) we'll know when we get into the thick of Saturday. Sinners saw a spike in its second Saturday over its first by 14%, while Get Out‘s second Saturday dipped 9%. Weapons‘ Thursday was $4.06M, off 9% from Wednesday's $4.4M.


	There weren't any previews on the first Nobody as major New York City and Los Angeles cinemas had just reopened roughly two weeks prior from Covid; that movie opened to $6.8M and finaled at $27.5M domestic. Previews here on Nobody 2 are right in line with Lionsgate's Den of Thieves: Pantera, which posted $1.35M in its Thursday before a $5.7M Friday and $15M opening. Russian director Ilya Naishuller directed the first Nobody installment, while Timo Tjahjanto has taken over helming reins on part 2 here. Derek Kolstad and Aaron Rabin wrote the screenplay based on the former's characters.

	











	Great grades on Nobody 2: 82% certified fresh critics and 92% audience on Rotten Tomatoes. That's not far from the first installment, which respectively did 84% and 94% with critics and audiences.


	The rest of top 5 for the week is as follows:

It's crazy that sequel are doing poorly while originals are exploding, instead of the other way other. Let's hope the trend for original project doing good in the box office continue.

I miss the good ole days – when a movie didn't have to knock it out of the park opening weekend and there was a dearth of all kinds of movies to go see! Sigh!!!!

Enter the doldrums of several weeks of 25 box office being behind 24. (After the last several weeks already).

Weapons is def coming in higher than $22 mil. It keeps beating expectations

Guess nobody will watch nobody 2.

I suspect the theatrical release is just to raise the film's profile for VOD and streaming, which is where the real money will be made.

Nobody's paying off a bunch of critics. I just think critics tend to be terminally online and prone to groupthink. I'll never be able to prove it, but I believe the RT scores of certain movies would be vastly different if each critic were to watch it in a vacuum. You get movies like Joker and Megalopolis where critics see everyone dunking on it for cultural or political reasons and decide to get in on the dog pile, and you see movies on the other end of the spectrum like Barbie where critics see everyone heaping praise on it and wouldn't dare to go against the narrative. 

And yes, I think Barbie was “better” than Joker and Megalopolis, but it doesn't take away from the fact that there are too many critics and many of them share opinions that have been crowd-sourced. They're paid off with likes and attention, not money.

“I'll never be able to prove it, but I believe…” the eternal motto of the conspiracy theorist.

This was meant as a reply to a different comment.

Guess everybody will watch nobody 2.

Experts weigh in on where the 27-year-old actress goes after being at the center of the storm involving an American Eagle jeans campaign that had everyone from Donald Trump to Lizzo sharing hot takes.



		By Chris Gardner, Danielle Directo-Meston

	‘Tis the season of Sydney Sweeney. It just now comes with an asterisk.


	The two-time Emmy nominated actress, producer, Ford aficionado and booked-and-busy brand partner is revving up for the busiest run of a still rising career. On the heels of a meaty role opposite Oscar winner Julianne Moore in the Apple TV+ movie Echo Valley, Sweeney has two films in theaters on back-to-back weekends in August: Tony Tost's Americana followed a week later by Ron Howard's period thriller Eden opposite Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby and Daniel Brühl.

	September delivers an anticipated Toronto International Film Festival world premiere for a big swing as a queer boxer in David Michod's biopic Christy, which she also produced, followed by Paul Feig's psychological thriller The Housemaid opposite Amanda Seyfried. Early footage of the latter film electrified CinemaCon audiences when it debuted in Las Vegas in April. Oh, and the final season of Euphoria, the show that made Sweeney a star, is on the horizon for early 2026.

	Who could have guessed that a seemingly harmless denim campaign would force a footnote on what could have been a glorious few months because of how it stirred up a surprise culture war that stretched from TikTok to the White House, with everyone from Lizzo to Donald Trump weighing in with an opinion. But that's what happened after American Eagle dropped its “Sydney Has Great Jeans” campaign July 23. It was designed as an ambitious partnership that included print ads, 3D billboards (including one on the Sphere in Las Vegas), Snapchat lens technology that allowed users to interact with a digital Sweeney, and a limited run of the “Sydney Jean” with 100 percent of the net proceeds donated to a nonprofit of the star's choice.

	











	Within days, a handful of TikTok users took offense to a campaign clip that features Sweeney saying (with unique inflection), “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The users claimed it promoted eugenics or was a form of Nazi propaganda because Sweeney is white, blond-haired and blue-eyed. While countless users dismissed the theories as nonsense, the dog pile had begun causing the hot takes to go viral. Mainstream media outlets picked up on the swirl and the coverage helped spread the controversy far and wide, from from late night to the White House. President Donald Trump clocked in after The Guardian reported that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida prior to the 2024 election.


	“Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST' ad out there. It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.' Go get ‘em Sydney!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.” His post came hot on the heels of American Eagle defending its campaign while pushing back on the narrative that there was any other message to the pun. “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans is and always was about the jeans,” the brand shared on Instagram on Aug. 1.


	Sweeney stayed silent. She still hasn't said a word about the campaign or its backlash — allowing American Eagle's statement to stand on its own as the brand reiterated that it was just a slogan about jeans and nothing more — but she did return to Instagram on Wednesday to promote Americana with a carousel of artistic behind-the-scenes images for her 25.3 million followers. “A few years ago I filmed this little movie with some friends and now you get to meet Penny Jo,” posted Sweeney, seen in many of the images that also feature Paul Walter Hauser and pop star turned actress Halsey. It's the only recent promotion for the film that Sweeney has done aside from hitting the red carpet for a premiere at L.A. venue Desert 5 Spot on Aug. 3. But that night, she only posed for photos before quickly ducking inside without speaking to reporters.

	It begs a question: What should Sweeney do now?


	Not much says Nathan Miller, CEO and founder of full-service strategic and crisis communications firm Miller Ink, which represents Fortune 500 companies and celebrities. “American Eagle played it reasonably well,” he explained, adding that the brand's response reflects the current culture. “The same brand five years ago would've apologized profusely and tried to move past it quickly. Instead, they stuck to their guns and stood by the campaign. It was irreverent enough without being offensive. What was great about it for Sweeney is that while it may have had everyone talking, she wasn't. Everyone was speaking about her, and she doesn't have to do anything.”


	But with a busy fall up ahead, she surely will have to speak at some point about her new films even if the first time she does field questions from the press is during a TIFF press conference. Asked how she should respond to the reveal about her voting record as a Republican, Miller said, again, she doesn't need to engage. “If it is authentic to her and she wants to be public about it, great, but she should not feel compelled to do so just because someone dug up her party registration. It's totally appropriate for her to say, ‘I don't discuss my politics, that's personal. I'm only here to talk about my movie.' And she doesn't lose. That's the safest strategy,” he noted, adding that on the flip side it is possible today to build a brand as a political celebrity as there have been plenty of examples on the left. Reaching across the aisle today only helps to widen one's appeal, Miller said.

	











	Lucy Robertson, head of brand marketing at Buttermilk, an agency that specializes in creator marketing, said the American Eagle campaign felt like a “misstep” for Sweeney because rather than leveraging her as a creative partner who helped shape the narrative. “It uses her as a convenient ‘hook' to hang the campaign on, in this case, with a tone-deaf ‘good genes' message that quietly reinforces Eurocentric beauty ideals like white skin, blonde hair, blue eyes.”


	Robertson said that “real influence” in today's market comes from being “embedded in the creative ecosystem for the long-term” rather than just doing one-off endorsement deals. Sweeney has a long history of brand deals after having partnered with Laneige, Miu Miu, Armani Beauty, Kérastase, Heydude, Dr. Squatch and Baskin-Robbins.


	“Zendaya's partnership with On, for example, sets the benchmark. In that 14-month collaboration — set to be the first chapter of a multi-year partnership — she hasn't just starred in ads — she's co-designed the Cloudzone Moon sneaker, helped craft the visual story in the evocative ‘Be Every You' campaign, and shaped how her identity and movement translate into both product and storytelling,” Robertson explained of Sweeney's Euphoria co-star. “That level of integration deepens cultural currency where we've seen Sydney front multiple brand campaigns in a short space of time, the result can feel more transactional than transformative.”

	











	A well-placed legal source familiar with negotiating A-list brand deals says it may be too soon to tell whether the social media swirl will affect Sweeney's future partnerships and acting gigs. Companies might prefer not to work with her if they believe consumers have Sweeney fatigue or if her exposure could tarnish their image. (Amid the American Eagle backlash, Baskin-Robbins disabled comments on its TikTok videos featuring Sweeney.) The expert notes their advice to clients varies based on star wattage and that there's a science to measuring celebrity. At a certain level of fame, too many product endorsements could dull one's A-list image, the source added, while others turn to international markets to keep cash flow coming in while avoiding being “everywhere” on their home turf. Meanwhile, brand deals are becoming a necessity for middle-of-the-road actors who are feeling the squeeze of studio consolidation with fewer available gigs.


	Matt Herbert, Chief Commercial Officer of brand tracking platform Tracksuit, tells The Hollywood Reporter that the reaction to AE's campaign “doesn't need to necessarily define AE, but it is about how they react from here on.” He cites Pepsi's controversial 2017 ad with Kendall Jenner that some called tone-deaf for using strikingly similar themes to Black Lives Matter protests. (The company later pulled the commercial online.)


	Tracksuit also found that brand awareness for another one of Sweeney's brand partnerships for Dr. Squatch saw that company boosted by three percentage points from August 2024 to July 2025. (Recall that the men's soap brand sold bars made with her actual bathwater due to popular demand.) The company also notes that “trendy” is a common theme associated with Laneige, Dr. Squatch and Miu Miu among survey respondents already familiar with all three brands. As for AE's bottom line, the company's next earnings report is Sept. 4, which could offer insight to how much of an impact, positive or negative, the controversy had on sales.

	











	Herbert notes that AE was “facing pretty big challenges over the past 18 months,” with brand awareness down by 6 percentage points from January 2024 to June 2025; and consideration, preference and usage declined by 5 percentage points. … any celebrity [endorsement or] brand activation is an attempt to drive relevance, which we know from looking at all of our tracking data.” 


	In the case of AE, “the news is so fresh, the conversation is so fresh, and we'll be keeping an eye [on the outcome of the campaign in] the coming months,” says Herbert. That could mean even more eyes on Sweeney and her upcoming projects, which in Hollywood is always a good thing.

Liam Gallagher has been barred from his traditional maracas tossing at Oasis' reunion concerts after crowd skirmishes in pursuit of the instruments resulted in injuries.


	At the band's Edinburgh show last week, Gallagher informed the audience they would not be the recipients of his tambourine or maracas because they “don't know how to behave themselves.”


	‘I can't throw my tambourine out tonight or my maracas I've been told not to. I'm not being tight or anything like that, do you know what I mean,” Gallagher told the crowd.


	The Metro UK reported that at Oasis' concert at London's Wembley Stadium, a 42-year-old woman managed to catch the maracas, but she was soon mobbed by two men who wrestled away the instrument from her. The woman then sent photos of her injuries — cuts and bruises — from the “horrible” experience to the British tabloids, which likely resulted in Gallagher's maracas ban.


	“I've just been told don't do any of that shit anymore because you don't know how to behave yourselves,” Gallagher told the Edinburgh crowd. “You keep pinching each other on your nipples and ears and fucking shit like that and kneeing each other in the bollocks. I've been told now.”

	It's not just catching a stage-used item from Oasis' unlikely reunion tour that has audience members crazed: Maracas and tambourines from Oasis' previous U.K. shows have reportedly commanded big money on online marketplaces.


	Oasis' trek resumes Saturday with the first of two shows in Dublin, Ireland. The reunion tour will then hop the Atlantic, with the North American leg beginning August 24 and 25 in Toronto.

After “General Hospital” star Tristan Rogers, who portrayed Robert Scorpio on the long-running soap, died at 79 on August 15, another soap star spoke out to say she's “heartbroken.” 

The Hollywood reporter says the actor died of lung cancer, despite never being a smoker. Rogers left behind his wife, Teresa Parkerson, as well as two children. 

Rogers' cancer diagnosis was revealed just last month in a statement given by his publicist, Anthony Turk, to Soap Opera Digest. The statement said the actor was remaining “hopeful” at the time, and was “working closely with his medical team on a treatment plan.”

The statement also called it a challenging time for Rogers and his family. A portion also read, “Tristan sends his love to his fans and wants them to know how much he appreciates their loyalty and encouragement over the years.”

Evans took to her Instagram to express her dismay at the loss of her friend. She began her tribute by saying she was “heartbroken” at his passing, before fondly reflecting on happier times. On “The Bay,” I had the privilege of playing opposite him – and what gift that was,” she wrote. Tristan appeared in 107 of the show's 114 episodes as Lex Martin, per his IMDb page.

Evans praised her costar for contributing “charm, wit, and depth to every scene,” before declaring it “an honor” to have shared the screen with him.

She finished her message by sending condolences to Rogers' family, friends, and fans before saying, “He will be deeply missed.”

A post shared by Mary Beth Evans (@marybeth.evans)

The Melbourne native appeared in 2022 on Maurice Benard's podcast “State of Mind,” where he shared some of his memories from growing up in Australia.

“I had a really good childhood,” he said, despite the family living in what he called “a pretty lousy area at the time.” He joked, “Now, you couldn't get an outhouse there for less than $3 million.” The star went on, “My parents saved, and saved, and saved and bought our house in a really good area. We all moved over there, I went to a new school, and started a whole new life.” Despite his new surroundings, he said nothing “exceptional” happened for him until 1964, the year he left school.

He said he started a rock band with a group of friends, which lasted for around three years, but he eventually realized they “weren't gonna make any money.” He said the lack of funds led him to his acting journey, which began with commercial work at age 21.

	Early on in My Undesirable Friends, filmmaker Julia Loktev's monumental and marathon-length chronicle of Russian journalists attempting to practice their trade in Putin‘s Russia, an interview subject is asked about totalitarian regimes. If you look at how such governments are portrayed in movies, the person notes, the idea is that everybody is noticeably suffocating as collective boot heels press down on their throats. That's not how it tends to work in the real world, however. There's an illusion of everything being perfectly fine on the surface, that life goes on as it always has for most of the population. Read the diary of someone from 1937, she notes, and they will tell you that the trains run on time, women's rights are being protected under Stalin, the Golden Age is in full swing. Meanwhile, what will eventually be known as “the Great Purge” is taking place on the periphery.


	This is what it is like in Moscow circa October 2021, the interviewee declares. You have cafes filled with chattering young people, and beautiful parks, and can have food delivered to your doorstep 24 hours a day. And yet, somewhere in the city, someone is being arrested and detained as an enemy of the state under dodgy pretenses. “The feeling that we are in a state of war and everyone else is not,” she notes, is typical under such regimes. Such cognitive dissonance is the new normal. The crabs go about their day to day existence. And then some notice that the water starts to seem just a little bit hotter… .

	











	A five-and-a-half hour portrait of what happens when the concept of a free press turns into a contradiction in terms, My Undesirable Friends follows a handful of female reporters who are trying to counteract the propaganda machine of their home country — and it will look extremely familiar to many folks who currently feel like they're in a state of war while life goes on all around them. Born in Russia and based in Brooklyn, Loktev initially went to Moscow in the fall of 2021 to do research for a potential project. She'd read an article in the New York Times about a generation of muckrakers who were standing up against the state via independent organizations and DIY podcasts like Hi, You're a Foreign Agent (the blanket term given to anyone in the media who doesn't tow the party line), and wanted to know more. She reached out to an old friend, Anya Nezmer, who worked for an online network called TV Rain and had been calling Putin out for years. Nezmer would facilitate introductions. She would also serve as the doc's resident voice of experience, whose timber would get wearier over time.

	The film follows Anya, the podcasters Sonya Groysman and Olga Churakova, online reporter Alesya Marokhovskaya, and several other members of a fourth-estate sorority considered to be a fifth column by the corrupt powers that be, with Lotkev tagging along as they try to get their message heard. Sometimes, they are joyous, bantering with coworkers in the start-up–style offices and telling stories at dinner parties. Other times, they wryly trade tips about avoiding arrest or what kind of underwear is best suited for surprise, early-morning interrogations conducted by cops pounding on doors. (Functional, not too fancy, not too plain.) One subject, Ksenia Mironova, is barred from visiting her fiancé in prison, a fellow journalist who's facing a long sentence for reasons that remain murky. Another, Irina Dolinina, chides her mom for worrying about her at protests.Deserved handwringing is a constant, but so is dark humor. The fact that even the most innocuous videos they post must be accompanied by a message declaring that it's the product of media supposedly being funded and communicated by foreign powers is a running joke. The kind of joke where the laughter is bitter and sticks in your throat, but still.


	One of the benefits of Loktev letting her film leisurely unfurl over five separate but equally compelling hour-plus chapters is that you really get to know each of these women, experience the bond they have, bask in their personalities, and share their troubles. Taken out of context, My Undesirable Friends could be mistake for a hang-out ensemble movie, or a typical docuseries following around a disparate group of urbanites as they fight the good fight and figure themselves out over several months. Except the menace behind all of the exchanges involving a slow death by a thousand executive-order cuts, or how surveillance and harassment is a daily occurrence, or the manner of doublespeak used to tarnish them as both journalists and citizens, is ever-present. So is the ticking clock of history. The incredible grace under pressure each of these “average” yet extraordinary women, all of whom are passionate and dedicated to what they do, is already being tested to the limit as 2021 draws to a close. In a few months, they will run headfirst into a seismic tipping point.

	Putin would not be the first national figurehead to use war as an excuse to sideline (or do far worse) those who he considers unfriendly journalists, nor while he likely be the last. But you'll notice that the full title of Loktev's extended verité paean to these heroes is My Undesirable Friends — Part 1: Last Air in Moscow. That subtitle is not just prophetic, it's well-earned. By the time war is declared on Ukraine in February of 2022, every one of her subjects' outlets will be shut down, and every one of them will leave Moscow in fear. A disclaimer at the end of the first installment tells you this upfront, and Loktev is working on a Part 2 that will pick up the rest of their stories in exile. But you spend the proceeding four chapters fully knowing what awaits them. Even before the filmmaker's cameras catch the exact moment that Rain employees are told that special forces are showing up to take them into custody and they flee in panic, the sense of instability and dread is palpable. Life during wartime will make what came before seem positively calm. At one point, Anya jokes that October 2021 will seem like paradise to them a few years down the road. The only thing she got wrong was the timing.


	Speaking of which: When Loktev premiered her must-see magnum opus at the New York Film Festival this past October, the U.S. was a very different place than it is now. As the film begins its theatrical run at Film Forum in NYC — a run which, one hopes, is just the beginning for a long jaunt in theaters throughout the country, and sets up a stay on a streaming services that make it available to as many eyeballs as humanly possible — a lot of us feel like we are in state of war while everyone else is not. Regardless of political situations, this initial batch of My Undesirable Friends‘ dispatches from the frontlines would make for absolutely magnificent and undeniably moving viewing. It's one of the best films of the year, full stop. But now it's both invaluable and something of a warning for many of us on the shape of things to come. It's a state of the nation address that, unfortunately, is addressing a nation far beyond the borders of its subjects' home.

Carrie Bradshaw has written her last. And Just Like That…, the latest chapter in the Sex And The City saga, came to an abrupt end Thursday night with the weirdly fecal-focused “Party Of One.” Our reviewer followed this slow-motion train derailment throughout the season, leaving A.V. Club staffers Danette Chavez, Saloni Gajjar, Drew Gillis, and Jacob Oller to sort through the wreckage in a Roundtable discussion to find out what exactly went wrong.

Danette Chavez: We are gathered here to figure out what went wrong in And Just Like That…, both in season three and the show more broadly. What began as a smooth-brained sequel series with flashes of potential among all the ludicrous fashion and podcast conversations turned into a slog—some might even call it a hate watch. (Not me, though, I just say I'm a completist.) Let's start at the end, with our thoughts on the finale, “Party Of One.” My reaction, to quote Carrie Bradshaw quoting Peggy Lee, was: Is that all there is? What'd everyone else think?

Drew Gillis: As a finale to the Carrie Bradshaw saga that we've been following for almost 27 years, it was ridiculously inadequate. But as a finale to AJLT, it was about what I expected. When I realized the final ten minutes of this show were going to contain an extremely graphic shot of a toilet overflowing, I thought, “Well, of course it will.”

Jacob Oller: If the finale was supposed to be representative of AJLT, it's perfectly fitting. Truly devoted to the “go girl, give us nothing” message.

Saloni Gajjar: To me, the finale was an ideal culmination of what Michael Patrick King and AJLT‘s writers have been doing all along anyway: hating the audience and our love for Sex And The City, finding unique and evocative ways to make us roll our eyes. The literal depiction of shit and piss in this final episode is proof enough. I am not entirely shocked by how frustrating this finale was, but I surprisingly enjoyed the post-Aidan episode (and the long overdue manner in which she dumps him). Those were some promising signs for AJLT. But these last 34 minutes were as excruciating for me as they ended up being for the lactose intolerant Epcot.

DC: Nothing was going to save this show, not even a whole other season, but there's no way this was the planned series closer, right? I know MPK et al. have little respect for viewers, returning and new, but this finale leaves ellipsis all over the place.

JO: This didn't even feel like a planned episode.

SG: No, I don't believe for a second that they planned to end it this way, even if the ultimate goal for AJLT was for Carrie to realize that it's okay to be alone (whenever it would conclude). I almost felt like they shoehorned that dancing bit at the end in a last-minute scramble.

JO: The looming threats of grandmotherhood, marriage non-believers, being (gasp) alone…these are all clearly threads put out for another season, that everyone expected to get.

DC: But Saloni, at least they answered the vital question of whether Carrie would learn to love Miranda's karaoke machine!

DG: King claimed that it wasn't the planned ending, but that when this ending emerged in the writers' room, they realized it was as good a place to end the show as any, which could be true at this point. But on a series-wide level, it turns AJLT into the story of how Carrie goes from being happily married to apparently coming to terms with being a widow. Maybe that is in fact what they set out to do, but I have a hard time believing that was the story they set out to tell in 2020.

JO: They absolutely fell backward into this. The “alone” vs. “on my own” distinction made me scream, like pretty much everything in her novel.

SG: The $1,500 karaoke machine is one of five things in that gigantic apartment. It's wild that, of all things, this was part of the pivotal final scene. Yet, in this so-called planned closing episode, we didn't get a single conversation between the original trio of Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte. I kept waiting for it! No mention of Samantha, either—but good for Kim Cattrall, I suppose. I feel like a conversation or a round of drinks between them was the least we deserved to see for our suffering.

JO: That's such a good point; they were intentionally scattered all episode.

DG: That's how the original show ended too, I think. But I did expect at least a text or mention of Samantha. Even if we're to believe that this was an ending that was somewhat premeditated, even in the “we just realized this is the end of the story” sense, was there no time to edit the script to add in something that small?

DC: Not to give the show too much credit, but there were signs that Carrie would end up embracing being single. The series premiere established her as newly single (well, widowed), and season two also set her up for a long-distance relationship with zero chance of succeeding. I was struck by her statement to Charlotte, about how, in this chapter of her life, the potential for another relationship isn't as high as it used to be, so she has to figure out what life looks like when it's just her. But I still think this resolution rings hollow.

DG: To Saloni's earlier point, I think the hollowness is especially frustrating because I thought the show handled Carrie's breakup with Aidan with surprising poignancy. I mean, it wasn't Shakespeare, but the way the distrust from their original series arc manifested via Carrie's downstairs neighbor was one of the better beats of the whole show. And the following episode where she experiences a new romance for the first time in a while was also one of the show's best.

SG: It rings hollow for many reasons, partly it's because they kept insisting on tying the whole thing to her terrible novel for some reason. Plus, the execution of her processing this feeling of being alone was so ridiculous, whether in the opening scene of her dining alone or her leaving Miranda's apartment when Joy comes over. None of these finale moments carried any heft, unlike when she processes what Aidan tells her about trust and that makes her reflect on where she is at in life/in this relationship and just how much she doesn't need him.

JO: I'm with y'all that the blow-up with Aidan had some impact, but the show had too many irons in the fire to figure out what came next.

DC: See, I thought the Duncan stuff was bad! At some point, MPK (or Sarah Jessica Parker) decided everyone would just fawn over Carrie—Patti LuPone, Jackie Hoffman, Julianne Nicholson's husband.

SG: Ooh, Danette I would love to hear about why you thought the Duncan stuff was bad because, like Drew, I thought it was season three's and maybe even the show's strongest point, which is not saying much, but still.

DC: I saw the Duncan storyline as a Berger do-over: Carrie sparks with a fellow writer, but one secure enough to let her have her success. But that made him a plot point, not a character, and I just never bought the chemistry between the two. Maybe it's because Duncan (played by Jonathan Cake) is supposed to be this serious biographer but he loses his mind over truly bad fiction writing.

JO: To your point earlier, Danette, he's so rah-rah about Carrie that it becomes ridiculous. And that's before we even get to the worst of her fiction.

SG: I agree that him praising Carrie's writing was laughably bad, but I was trying to see it as him looking at her through rose-colored glasses because they share a bond that it seems like he hasn't had before? I did totally see the chemistry between them though, particularly in episode 10 when they're both at the party and at home after that. I was invested because I assumed it's a one-time/short-term thing and Carrie was just having fun, without any pressure or confusion that she was facing from Aidan. In that sense, it felt at least slightly like a SATC episode, which I saw as a win.

DC: But the show insists that he appreciates her mind first and foremost! 

DG: I was honestly just so happy to see someone who wasn't Aidan that I was willing to take basically anything else. I used to love Aidan in the original series but after this he is really someone I never want to think about again.

JO: In order to really compare the two, I need to know Duncan's stance on ADHD meds.

DC: Jacob, you came into this with the freshest set of eyes—you never watched SATC, right? So, why did you take a chance on AJLT?

JO: Like with movies, I enjoy the good stuff and the really bad stuff—it's the mediocre that I can't stand. My partner was big into the original series so I caught a little glimpse of how awful AJLT was in passing and I was hooked. It seemed like every episode was an experiment in how bad a show they could possibly air. It was clear that the original characters had been pushed aside so that the creator could better air personal grievances about young people, demographics he didn't understand, etc. I did discover that I loved Charlotte, though. Kristin Davis gives the best performance in the series.

SG: She had my vote as soon as I saw her and Harry dress up as Elizabeth and Philip Jennings from The Americans for the Halloween episode.

DG: For what it's worth, I do think AJLT improved over the course of its run. Season one felt almost like what I imagine an army boot camp to be like, where they deliberately break you down so they can remake you in their own image. Season one was character assassination after character assassination, with Miranda receiving the worst of it. It felt like a horrible slog to watch. But by season two, it seemed they had figured out how to make it more fun. Or maybe I had just been trained by that point to accept so little that I was willing to eat it up. I agree, however, that Charlotte was far and away the best part of this show.

JO: I know just from being around folks who care that Miranda seems to have had some sort of head injury throughout this new series. Did Carrie stay true to herself?

DC: Yes and no. She was always a self-centered person and a bad writer—the free-standing hyphen in place of closed em dash in her epilogue is her final crime, hopefully—but making her über-wealthy took away what few layers she had. I watched AJLT season three alongside The Gilded Age season three, and neither MPK nor Julian Fellowes knows how to write meaningful conflict anymore.

JO: The pie-in-the-face resolution to Anthony's cold feet was very much some writers realizing they'd accidentally come up with some conflict they didn't want to deal with. Same with the co-worker flirtation and Miranda's kid's terrible baby mama and…. 

SG: I felt the same way about Seema and Adam's marriage conversation, one that they barely had with each other but individually had with Carrie. Seema's arc ties back into the portrayal of wealth that Danette brought up. Throughout the show, she's this fabulous and successful real-estate agent. Carrie even points out she takes on high-profile clients and can't help Miranda find a place. And yet we're supposed to believe her big conflict is she has no money for Ubers and eyebrow appointments? And then, she's also found a big, empty office space? I was personally invested in her character a lot but was continually disappointed in the many ways in which AJLT failed her, as well as its new characters, who often felt like an obtuse way to overcorrect SATC‘s criticisms about having mostly white leads.

JO: I love Sarita Choudhury. Who doesn't love Sarita Choudhury? But her character was all over the place because her status always seemed so unclear. Her getting with a woo-woo dirtbag was fun, but moved so slowly that, again, conflict never really got a chance to come up. Also, it has to be so frustrating to be working for Carrie: “Yeah, I guess I'll just redo this whole garden I've been putting together for you.”

DC: There was always something unrealistic about life in SATC, but there were also recognizable/relatable moments. Nothing about AJLT seems to apply to actual humans.

DG: To that point, Danette, I was wondering if getting rid of the narration from Carrie was the main thing that really ungrounded AJLT from SATC. Watching the original show, the acting and the scenarios were often pretty broad, but Carrie would basically just explain what everyone was feeling in the moment. Here, the acting and the scenarios are even broader, and rarely do we get that bit of interiority. The framing device of these all being stories for Carrie's column, I think, created some distance that allowed for a bit more suspension of disbelief. The way AJLT is presented, we're meant to believe that everything really is happening just as we see it. 

DC: Well, we have the time of death for this show—approximately 10:30 p.m. Eastern on August 14—now we just have to rule on the cause. What would you say killed the show, or your hope that it might eventually get back on track? 

JO: For me, it was DOA. The appeal was that it was a shambling zombie from the start. From the moment I met Che Diaz, I knew I was witnessing something special (derogatory). 

SG: The show was DOA for me pretty much when it began, particularly with Carrie of all people not being able to say vagina on her podcast. Throw in Che Diaz and it's all terrible. But I think the true moment AJLT collapsed for me was when Carrie peed in a bottle after watching Miranda and Che in her kitchen. I knew then this show had no respect or care to meet these women we've known and loved at the place/age they are in right now. I convinced myself to keep watching because I am also a completist like Danette and because I was morbidly curious to see how much worse it could get. On the other hand, if the show kept going for several more seasons, I would happily tune in and torture myself.

DG: I think the premise was rotten from the start. The movies that came after the original series were horrible. Then, when we found out that Kim Cattrall, who was far and away the most charismatic part of the original, would not return, it seemed impossible for the show to be at all decent. And as I've said, I think season one was pretty much unforgivably bad—the first episode of the series ending with the sentence “And just like that, Big died” was really a moment that I could not believe what I was seeing. But I genuinely do think it improved, even if it only became a more effective hate-watch.

SG: There were brief moments I thought it would get back on the tracks, and there are things I enjoyed seeing, like Charlotte's evolution. (For me, she stayed somewhat true to her SATC character but also matured with time.) And it was lovely to watch Sarita Choudhury strut around on my screen. But I don't want to give AJLT more credit than that. The fact that we started this discussion with mentioning the literal turds in the finale…well, that's quite a legacy for the show to leave.

JO: AJLT and its creators live on another planet that I would love to visit. Presenting the most homophobic Gen Z-er I've ever seen, overflowing a toilet filled with shit, and then name-dropping Michelle Obama all in the same episode. This cognitive dissonance is what the show is all about. Total trash thinking that it's still relevant.

DC: For me, it was the fundamental misunderstanding of who Carrie Bradshaw was that kept the show from being able to see who she would become. For good and ill, and as much as we might like Charlotte in her 50s and be distracted by Miranda being replaced by an alien, this has primarily been Carrie's story. She was a mess of contradictions in the original series, and while it's nice to think that she would have that sorted out in middle age, it's also bullshit. Carrie was lying to herself in the original series when she said she wasn't the marrying kind—turns out, she was just not the marrying-Aidan kind—and she's still lying to herself in the final moments of AJLT. She tells Adam she wants the garden to be “wild” again, just like she is (and like she claimed to be when she scoped out Big and Natasha's engagement party in SATC season two). But everything about Carrie has become so incredibly mannered, from the labored outfits to the pursing of the lips after every other alleged bon mot. Carrie cyberstalking Natasha in AJLT season one rang truer for me than her waltzing through her big empty house to Barry White in “Party Of One.”

JO: Do you think it's because the creator/showrunner has also been separated from reality thanks to time and wealth?

DC: Abso-fucking-lutely.

SG: I have often wondered while watching, and I know SJP must be quite involved, but how different AJLT would've been had a woman helmed the show or if that would've been a more interesting, realistic lens through which we could see these women. I don't know if it's also because I read about how Candace Bushnell also felt disconnected to AJLT‘s version of Carrie.

DC: Maybe that's the overlap in all of our critiques—this show ultimately wasn't very curious about any of its characters.

JO: It was maybe most curious about an aging man dealing with dick problems and children around him who were engaging with the world in ways he didn't understand.

SG: AJLT also never understood how New York City is a character (cliché, I know, but it's true!). Why is it that a Thanksgiving-themed episode is so glossy and sunny and not seemingly cold at all? The Central Park fashion show in this weather made no sense whatsoever. And I think it's details like these that the creator maybe deemed unimportant that made it so easy to disregard the show overall.

DG: I agree with that point about the city, Saloni. So much of the old show was just them walking around having conversations in the park, and it feels like so much of this version was in a manicured restaurant or café or apartment. There was a certain grit that was lost and severely missed.

DC: So, that's our finding: bad sex and no real city.

	After Deadline reported last year that Quentin Tarantino dropped The Movie Critic as his 10th and final film, he's providing some insight to the decision.


	The 2x Oscar winner recently explained that although he “was very happy” with what he wrote originally as an eight-part series and then translated into a feature-length script but “wasn't really that excited” when it came time for pre-production.


	“No one's waiting for this thing per se. I mean, I can do it whenever I want. I mean, it's already written. So OK, let me just not start it right now,” he explained his thought process on The Church of Tarantino podcast. “Let me try writing it as a movie and let me see if it's better that way. And I was like, ‘Oh, OK, no, I think this is going to be the movie.' And then it wasn't. I pulled the plug on it. And the reason I pulled the plug, it's a little crazy.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Although Tarantino said he “really, really likes” The Movie Critic, he noted, “But there was a challenge that I gave to myself when I did it. Can I take the most boring profession in the world and make it an interesting movie?”


	“Every Tarantino title promises so much, except The Movie Critic,” he explained. “Who wants to see a TV show about a f***ing movie critic? Who wants to see a movie called The Movie Critic? If I can actually make a movie or a TV show about somebody who watches movies interesting, that is an accomplishment.


	“It's a spiritual sequel to Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood in so far as they take place in the same world and they take place in the same town. But there were no crossover characters. Cliff Booth was never in The Movie Critic. That's all a bunch of bull****. That never was the case ever, ever, ever.”


	Tarantino added, “I was so excited about the writing, but I wasn't really that excited about dramatizing what I wrote once we were in pre-production.”


	After The Movie Critic was teased as Tarantino's farewell film in 2023, with Brad Pitt attached to star, Deadline exclusively reported last April that the auteur simply had a change of heart and opted not to move forward with the project. Sources close to the director said he was going back to the drawing board to figure out what that final movie will be.

	











	Tarantino said the movie was set in 1977 California, “based on a guy who really lived but was never really famous, and he used to write movie reviews for a porno rag.”


	Although a spiritual sequel to Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood (2019) isn't in the cards for Tarantino's final directorial outing, Pitt is reprising his role as stuntman Cliff Booth for the upcoming Netflix movie off-shoot The Adventures of Cliff Booth, directed by David Fincher.

I mean, if the critic was Jay Sherman I would definitely watch

Don't stop at 10 Tarantino. He's easily got at least a baker's dozen – 15 films left in him

“It's only a movie, dear boy.” — Alfred Hitchcock

It would be a good series?

It depends on how he structures it. The movie critic is the character, Hollywood is the backdrop, but the story and plot can be anything. 

We've seen this many times with films like Jerry Maguire, The Player, Sunset Blvd., Get Shorty, Mulholland Drive, Wag the Dog. The character's occupation and the setting is one thing, but who they are and the adventures that befall them can be wild and interesting. The best theatre example might be Sam Shepherd's True West. 

It sounds like he just didn't have much of a story. Good for him for recognizing that. Nice problem to have to be able to pivot to another project that you know will still get made. He's one of a handful left that have that luxury.

Depending on how you want to break up the various attempts, drafts, and dreams that have made up the various efforts, we've now been watching Hollywood try to make itself a He-Man/Masters Of The Universe movie for more than a decade at this point.  Amazingly, the film—now under the plastic aegis of Amazon-owned MGM—has finally been shot, and is now in post-production. But the powers that gave us seemingly random casting decisions like “Jared Leto as Skeletor” or “Alison Brie as Evil-Lyn” turn out to have been holding back one last fun, borderline nonsensical surprise for us, as THR reports today that Kristen Wiig is voicing Roboto in the action-figure-based film.

Roboto is—as you know—a robot man, constructed by heroic inventor/”guy played by Idris Elba” Man-At-Arms. (Who, we feel like we have to constantly remind ourselves, has a completely normal number of arms, despite hanging out with a multi-faced dude named Man-E-Faces.) Roboto is one of those good-style robots you're always hearing about, with a functional heart that allows him to emotionally connect with his colleagues, and be mad at talking skeletons who are constantly causing trouble.

We do not, off the top of our head, know why you'd cast Kristen Wiig in this particular part—for all the world, it feels like casting agents for the film were toying around with a random name generator—but we're guessing it'll be entirely a voice role, given that the original Roboto figure, released back in 1985, doesn't even seem to have a face. (Also, the movie is already finished shooting, and you're probably not going to go back for reshoots just to get a lil' more Roboto.) Wiig is, in addition to her other talents, a well-known voice actor, having starred in projects like Sausage Party and its TV spin-off as well as the Despicable Me franchise. She's currently on the hook for a second season of her live-action Apple TV+ show Palm Royale, but we're guessing that voicing the robot that works for He-Man's dad's head guard probably won't take too big a chunk out of her busy schedule.

Masters Of The Universe is currently scheduled for a June 5, 2026 theatrical release.

	Although Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis had a cutthroat rivalry in Black Swan, life did not imitate art for the actresses, despite Darren Aronofsky‘s best attempts.


	Marking the Oscar-winning film's 15th anniversary, the trio recently reunited and reminisced about the director trying to spark a feud between Portman and Kunis to aid their performances as ballerinas competing for the lead role in a Swan Lake production.


	“My take is that I was trying to be a sneaky director and make them argue,” Aronofsky told Vogue. “Mila and Natalie both realized very quickly what I was doing and made fun of me, so it quickly became a joke that we all understood. They're both very clever and were instantly privy to whatever trick I was playing.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	When asked if they “remember it differently,” Portman recalled, “I remember being separated from Mila and that we weren't in the same space a lot when we weren't shooting. Darren made some comment early on, like, ‘Ya know, Nat, Mila's dancing so well.' And I was like, ‘Of course she is! She's so fucking talented and I love her so much and I'm happy she's doing a great job!'”


	Kunis added, “Darren would tell me, ‘Nat is working really, really hard. She's not even taking Saturdays and Sundays off.' Then I would text Nat and she'd be like, ‘…No, I'm not?' I think that's how we figured out what Darren was up to, but it was all in good fun.”


	Regardless of Aronofsky's failed intervention, Portman won the Oscar for Best Actress in Black Swan, which also earned nominations for Best Picture and Best Director for Aronofsky.


	The reunion comes as Black Swan prepares to return to theaters on Aug. 21 and 24 for the milestone anniversary, playing for the first time in Imax in more than 200 auditoriums in major cities.

The more news we hear about next winter's Avengers: Doomsday, the harder it gets to imagine Joe and Anthony Russo's return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as an actual film. A collection of cameos and assorted jammed-together plot points strung together across 7 years of post-Endgame storytelling? Sure. A place for a frankly massive number of former Marvel actors to hang out while not sitting in their snazzy personalized chairs? Absolutely! A coherent story where its many, many characters each get a chance to have notable moments? Well…

This nervousness brought to you by news—coming out of The Hollywood Reporter‘s comics-focused Heat Vision newsletter—that Ryan Reynolds will reportedly now also be joining the film. Reynolds set off speculation that he'd be bringing Deadpool by to grace the movie with his box office-boosting presence earlier this week, posting a vandalized version of the Avengers logo to his Instagram. (To quote Heat Vision: “Something Deadpool would do.”) Now, that arbiter of all secret information in Hollywood—”sources say”—has confirmed that Reynolds will appear in the movie, maybe shoved into a corner somewhere, because Christ, there are a lot of people in this thing.

Don't worry, though: Those same mysterious (but apparently omniscient) sources confirm we're not going to see Wade Wilson finally achieving his dream of becoming an Avenger himself when Doomsday‘s December 18, 2026 release date rolls around. (Something Reynolds has said in the past would basically end the character's arc/viability as a protagonist.) None of this is exactly shocking, in any case: Make Bob Iger a billion dollars, and you get an invite up from the kids' table.

All of this has to, of course, be taken a) with a grain of salt, and b) with the overall understanding that we have absolutely no clue what form pretty much anything in this film will take. (The Russos have suggested it'll be kind of divisive when it arrives; we're still suspecting it'll pull some pretty hefty reality-altering shenanigans, given how Robert Downey Jr.'s Doctor Doom was chatting it up with cosmic baby Franklin Richards at the end of Fantastic Four: First Steps, and the fact that the Secret Wars comic being namechecked by the movie's sequel is all about Doom turning himself into a briefly-tenured god.) We might think it might be nice to keep some of this casting stuff more secretive, but we are not Ryan Reynolds' Instagram account manager. (Yet!)

The media mogul says Donovan Michaels is trying to extract a lucrative settlement by fabricating a "work of fiction" about their marriage.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Music and film mogul David Geffen says his estranged husband fabricated abuse and sexual exploitation claims as part of a “a ludicrous and contrived attempt to humiliate Geffen in the court of public opinion and extract an out-of-court settlement.”


	The accusations come in Geffen's first legal filing responding to the bombshell lawsuit brought last month by the media executive's soon-to-be ex-husband, Donovan Michaels, a former exotic dancer 50 years his junior. The pair is in the midst of divorce proceedings after less than two years of marriage.


	Michaels (whose real name is David Armstrong) alleges in the lawsuit that Geffen treated him as a “sexual commodity” for years, only to later leave him destitute and tossed aside “like a used object.” But the mogul argues on Wednesday (Aug. 13) that these claims are a “work of fiction” designed to “extort Geffen by publicly shaming him.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Plaintiff cannot embarrass Geffen and extort a settlement with petty gossip and salacious lies,” writes Geffen's attorney Patricia Glaser. “Unfortunately for plaintiff, Geffen has the integrity, ability and strength to litigate this case in a court of law (rather than in the press) where plaintiff's fabricated claims cannot succeed.”


	Geffen says Michaels' central claim — that he promised to provide “lifetime” financial support for Michaels no matter what — is a complete lie. No such promises were ever made, Geffen argues, and Michaels won't be able to corroborate his allegations with any written documentation or witnesses.


	All the other claims in Michaels' lawsuit are lies, too, according to Geffen's answering brief. Geffen says there was no abuse in the couple's relationship, and that he treated Michaels with “nothing but kindness, respect and generosity.”


	If anything, says Geffen, Michaels was the one to take advantage of him by spending hundreds of thousands of dollars from the mogul's coffers on luxury clothing, cosmetics, extravagant vacations, cosmetic surgery, OnlyFans subscriptions and sex workers.


	And while Michaels' lawsuit claims Geffen plied him with drugs as a tool of coercion, Wednesday's court filing says this could not be further from the truth.


	“The allegations in the complaint that Geffen encouraged or even was aware of plaintiff's illicit drug habit are a pure fabrication,” writes Glaser. “Plaintiff hid his drug use from Geffen for years. Plaintiff regularly used ketamine, cocaine and perhaps other illegal drugs. Geffen does not.”


	Michaels' attorneys did not immediately return a request for comment on Friday (Aug. 15).


	With a net worth reportedly over $9 billion, Geffen has long been one of the entertainment industry's wealthiest figures. He launched the influential labels Asylum Records and Geffen Records, as well as animation powerhouse DreamWorks Pictures.


	According to Michaels' lawsuit, he and Geffen met in 2016 through the website SeekingArrangements.com. Michaels says Geffen initially paid him for sex, but that the relationship later evolved into a serious romantic partnership.


	Geffen and Michaels married in 2023 without a prenuptial agreement. Geffen cited irreconcilable differences to file for divorce this past May, and marriage dissolution proceedings are continuing to be litigated separately from the civil case that Michaels initiated in July.

	Gavin Newsom wants to fight “fire with fire” when it comes to Donald Trump and attacks on American democracy, but HBO and Bill Maher just want Laura Loomer to stop talking and posting.


	Good luck.


	“It has come to Defendants' attention that after Plaintiff needlessly filed her deposition on the public docket as part of unrelated objections, a copy of the unsealed exhibit was made available on the website CourtListener,” HBO declared to Florida-based federal Judge James Moody in a filing this week, a couple of weeks after Loomer's scorching deposition with the outlet and Maher's lawyer Katherine Bolger and others was leaked.

	HBO is accusing the hot-button Rumble host of stepping over the line online with the federal courts by talking about her deposition, which was not intended to be made public. It's a leak that Loomer, who sued HBO and Maher for defamation and $150 million in October 2024, took the time to comment on, as  HBO's Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and Shullman Fugate PLLC attorneys noted: “Since yesterday, Plaintiff has Tweeted about this deposition three times in contravention of the Court's Order.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	This all started on September 22, 2024, when Maher postulated on-air that Trump and Loomer were having a fling.


	Specifically, the host resurrected his who is Trump “f*cking” quip and replied to himself, “I think it might be Laura Loomer.” In Maher's logic, and in search of an easy laugh, that alleged affair is why the far-right activist had so much pull with the then GOP candidate. In her deposition, which leaked online last month, Loomer says the blast radius of onetime Trump dinner companion Maher's remark left her “smeared as a whore and as a groupie.”

	











	“Bill Maher has no understanding of my personal life,” Loomer went on to say in the now resealed depo. “He was reckless with the regard to the fact that I have a boyfriend. And he has no evidence that I had sex with President Trump. It's just outrageous. And so as it relates to my situation, yes, it's defamatory.”


	This week, in a sideshow that will likely not make it into Maher's Real Time monologue tonight, HBO wants Moody to shut down Loomer and the leaks.


	In that context, two of Loomer's tweets from August 12 directly referenced her contention in the deposition that she had been previous told by “several of President Trump's staff … in confidence that Lindsey Graham is gay.” As well as hitting frequent foe Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-FL) and Arby's (won't go there, look it up), Loomer punched way up on the longtime South Carolina senator and Trump loyalist to a fault.

I was asked about Lindsey during my deposition so I had to tell the truth. I was under oath. https://t.co/6TAzNBgLVY

I was under oath. I couldn't lie.


	On Thursday, Loomer's lawyer Larry Klayman essentially told HBO and Maher to take a long walk off a short legal pier. 


	“The tweets that Defendants reference that were made by Plaintiff Ms. Loomer actually show that she did not disclose or reveal any information in the sealed deposition,” the Judicial Watch founder said in his August 14 filing. “Ms. Loomer simply responded innocuously to inquiries posed by persons whohad gained access to the deposition transcript through their own means. Thus, the bottom line is that she did not ‘use' any of her deposition or discovery.”


	 Klayman ends his filing popping HBO and Maher on the nose for leaning into the leaked deposition and Loomer's tweets. He calls it simply a scheme to “drive up time, cost, and expense with a manufactured nonissue.”


	Reps for HBO and Maher did not respond to Deadline's request for comment on the latest legal flurry.


	Love her, hate her, fear her or just wish she would leave you alone, Trump's self-declared MAGA “loyalty enforcer” Loomer has proven a power player in Trump's D.C. While she has no official gig in the administration — which Loomer says is in no small part due to Maher's comments about her and Trump — among her alleged victims so far have been National Security Council and CIA staffers as well as some of RFK Jr's staff, though White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles had at least one MAHA team member rehired.


	On Thursday, HBO and Maher's lawyers were back in the court docket (read that filing here) pushing Moody to get Loomer and Klayman to hand over documents required for the soon-to-end discovery. They also questioned Loomer to provide some evidence of “a single social relationship that has been harmed” by Maher's statement. Perhaps more importantly, HBO and Maher want Loomer “to identify any individual she contends was led by Defendants' statement to mistakenly believe that she and President Trump engaged in a sexual relationship.”


	Or put another way: “Plaintiff argues that her sitting for a deposition somehow alleviates her of her obligation to produce responsive documents and answer interrogatories. That is not the law. Parties do not get to pick and choose which discovery vehicles they prefer to engage with.”

A wave of online conspiracy theories has claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin never actually landed in Alaska to meet U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, some internet users believe that he sent a body double to meet Trump at the summit.

These theories gained attention after photos and videos of Putin during the August 15, 2025, Trump–Putin summit in Alaska were widely shared. Users pointed out the differences in appearance such as fuller cheeks and an unusually cheerful expression. 

One person wrote, “He smiles too much,” while another noted, “Cheeks are too pudgy” and said  it wasn't the real Putin.

Another commonly cited sign is Putin's unusual way of walking the so-called “gunslinger gait,” where one arm remains still. Some conspiracy theorists said the person seen in Alaska failed to replicate that customary movement. (Also Read: India welcomes Alaska Summit Between Trump And Putin, Calls For Dialogue To End Russia-Ukraine Conflict)

However these speculations are not entirely new. Rumors of Putin using body doubles have been in circulation for years, especially among social media users and in certain Ukrainian media. Differences in facial features, such as chins, earlobes, and forehead wrinkles, are often highlighted as evidence.

According to posts spread over social media, these rumors have included claims that body doubles underwent plastic surgery to resemble Putin and were deployed for risky or symbolic appearances. However, no credible proof has ever emerged. (Also Read: Zelensky Demands Seat At Peace Table, Heads To Washington After Trump-Putin Summit)

Russia has consistently dismissed these claims. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called them “information hoaxes,” and Putin himself has denied the concept of using doubles. 

In 2020 and again during his “Direct Line” call in 2023, Putin said, “only one person should resemble myself … and that person will be me.” Peskov reiterated that “we have only one Putin”.

While many users on social media continue to question whether the person who met Trump was the real Putin or not. Official responses and expert sources have rejected the conspiracy.

When rewatching Supernatural, it's impossible to ignore that the heart and soul of the TV show is the relationship between Sam and Dean. Played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, the Winchesters were compelling to watch because they would do anything for each other. However, the actors have acknowledged that there were some questionable character choices in Supernatural​​​​​​, especially when it came to Sam.

There were many versions of Sam Winchester in Supernatural, as the character was possessed, lived in a parallel reality, or experienced some kind of fantastical intervention many times. However, there were certain parts of Sam that stayed consistent no matter what, making it confusing when the writers and creators of the series took big swings, altering the way the audience viewed the character.

Every season of Supernatural saw the characters grapple with intense changes and upheaval, with Sam and Dean occasionally going their separate ways. However, Sam's arc in the early episodes of season 8 doesn't align with his character, especially compared to the rest of the show. When discussing Sam's Supernatural season 8 arc with ScreenRant at a FAN EXPO Boston panel, Padalecki said:

Amelia. I don't think he would've gotten into a romantic relationship after his brother… over a dog, yeah.

After Dean is sent to Purgatory with Cas at the end of season 7, the series jumps forward in time in the season 8 premiere, "We Need to Talk About Kevin," and it's surprising to see what Sam's been up to. Instead of searching for his brother and finding a way to free him from purgatory, he moved on with his life, falling in love with Amelia (Liane Balaban).

It makes sense that Padalecki would question this character choice for Sam to this day, as it came out of nowhere and goes against some of Supernatural's core tenets. The fact that Sam essentially forgets about Dean and decides to go back to the life he always wanted is a blow to the brothers' relationship and sparks long-term issues between them throughout season 8.

While this does create some interesting conflict and shines a light on how the power dynamic between the Winchesters shifts throughout the show, this was a step in the wrong direction for Sam's character development. Additionally, Supernatural's best episodes highlight the deep and enduring bond between Sam and Dean, and putting them at odds is always controversial, even when the audience knows they'll ultimately make up.

It could be argued that Sam's decision to move on and heal from Dean's death by settling down was supposed to mirror Dean's behavior in the wake of season 5. After the events of "Swan Song," Dean seeks out Lisa (Cindy Sampson) and lives with her and her son for a year, believing Sam is gone. While this was also somewhat out of character for Dean, it made more sense than Sam's behavior in season 8.

In season 6, Dean felt justified in moving on because Sam sacrificed himself for Dean and the rest of the world, because there was no other choice. The context of Dean getting trapped in Purgatory isn't the same as Sam's supposed death in season 5, making it impossible to draw a one-to-one comparison between these two romantic relationships that drive a wedge between the brothers.

Unfortunately, it isn't just the Sam-Amelia romance that raises a few eyebrows throughout the season. Few of the Supernatural episodes that are considered masterpieces are in season 8, as this installment is widely regarded as something of a low point for the show. Sam is far from the only character whose actions and motivations don't align with his arc in the series.

There were many ups and downs in the years following the season 5 finale, as Supernatural was going through a soft reboot and rediscovering what kind of show it wanted to be. If audiences can make it through the first half of Supernatural season 8, there's a lot more excitement and brotherly bonding to be found in the later years of the series.

TV psychic Sylvia Browne, who gained nationwide infamy for her wildly inaccurate predictions to the families of missing children, has gone viral yet again.

Thanks to a steady flow of appearances with Montel Williams and Larry King, she was massively popular, with a years-long waiting list for phone consultations and fans willing to pay thousands of dollars to go on a cruise with her. 

Browne died in 2013 at the age of 77, but during the COVID-19 pandemic she became a phenomenon again online, where no less than Kim Kardashian shared a quote that many readers regarded as prophetic.

'In around 2020,' Browne had written in her bestselling 2004 book End of Days: 'a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments.'

Now social media users are sharing clips of her, this time mocking her as an alleged grifter who said the 'wildest nonsense' that she pulled 'out of thin air.'

But who was Sylvia Browne, the smoky-voiced, platinum blonde media magnet whom one critic branded the 'world's worst psychic'?

TV psychic Sylvia Browne, who gained nationwide infamy for her wildly inaccurate predictions to the families of missing children, has gone viral yet again

Born Sylvia Celeste Shoemaker in 1936 in Kansas City, she claimed to have seen visions since she was three years old during the Great Depression.

After she spent 18 years teaching at a Catholic school and trained as a 'trance medium' on the side, she became a professional psychic in 1973.

By the 1980s, she had fashioned herself into a charismatic media figure, thanks to her blunt sense of humor, her gravelly voice and her distinctive appearance: a fuller figure topped by an extravagantly made-up face and platinum hair with fringe.

In the 1990s she was a regular on The Montel Williams Show, and she also frequently appeared on Larry King Live and the late-night radio show Coast to Coast AM, which specialized in conspiracies and the paranormal.

Her sprawling enterprise included several bestselling books in which she professed an ability to see into the future and the afterlife, plus cruise ship appearances, 30-minute phone consultations costing $750 a pop, her own gnostic church and even a murky gold-mining venture that led to her conviction of securities fraud in 1992.

But she was most notorious for the jaw-droppingly incorrect predictions she delivered to frantic families about the fate of their missing children.

In 2004 on The Montel Williams Show, Browne told Louwanna Miller that her vanished daughter Amanda Berry was 'not alive, honey,' adding: 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.'

Miller said she believed the medium '98 percent,' and died of heart failure in 2005 - eight years before her daughter escaped years of captivity by Ariel Castro and was found alive, in a case that inspired a media frenzy.

'Only God,' said Browne in her defense: 'is right all the time.'

Another one of Browne's inaccurate readings was about Shawn Hornbeck, pictured on a missing person poster from 2002 when he was 11

In 1999 on The Montel Williams Show, the grandmother of a six-year-old Texas kidnap victim called Opal Jo Jennings pleaded with Browne: 'I can't stand this. I need your help, Sylvia. Where is Opal? Where is she?'

'She's not dead,' said Browne. 'But what bothers me - now I've never heard of this before - but she was taken and put into some kind of a slavery thing and taken into Japan. The place is Kukouro.'

Kokouro, Japan does not exist, and Opal's remains were discovered in Texas, with the pathologist saying she was killed the night of her abduction.

In 2002, Browne told the mother of a missing woman named Holly Krewson that her daughter was working as a stripper in Hollywood.

Four years later, the dental records from human remains that had been found in San Diego in 1996 were used to identify the deceased as Krewson. 

In 2003, four months after 11-year-old Shawn Hornbeck disappeared in Missouri, Browne told his parents on The Montel Williams Show that their son was dead after being abducted by a dark-skinned man who had dreadlocks.

Shawn Horbeck was discovered alive in 2007 in the apartment of one Michael J. Devlin, who is white and had short hair.

The incident prompted the first of Browne's four husbands Gary Dufresne, whom she divorced the year before she became a professional psychic, to give an interview to a website called stopsylvia.com and openly accuse her of being a fraud.









Now clips of Browne are flying yet again around X, formerly Twitter, and a new crop of viewers are reacting with hilarity to her onscreen antics

He recalled a tarot party she gave during their marriage, after which he supposedly asked her: '"Sylvia, how can you tell people this kind of stuff? You know it's not true, and some of these people actually are probably going to believe it." And she said: "Screw 'em. Anybody who believes this stuff oughtta be taken."'

After his interview, Browne shot back that he was 'a liar and dark soul entity, but at least the a**hole gave me children,' via Jon Ronson's profile of her in the Guardian.

Disgruntled exes aside, she was a persistent target of the skeptic movement, particularly one of its best-known figures, retired stage magician James Randi, who made a crusade out of debunking psychics.

In response to his criticisms, Browne audaciously announced that she would accept Randi's million-dollar challenge to submit to a scientifically controlled experiment in which she would have to prove she was a real medium, but she later backed out.

The Skeptical Inquirer released a study of 115 of her predictions about murder and missing persons cases, and found that out of the 25 instances when the truth had been discovered at all, Browne had not been right even once.

Fans have also sniggered at her false predictions online, including one who posted a 'fraud montage' of some of her lowlights to YouTube several years ago.

One woman on The Montel Williams Show told Browne that she 'lost my boyfriend tragically' and he was 'never found,' to which Browne said: 'The reason why you didn't find him is 'cause he's in water.'

'Well, it was September 11. He was a fireman,' the woman explained.

Now clips of Browne are once again flying around social media, and a new crop of viewers are reacting with incredulity to her onscreen antics.

One showed a woman discussing her mystery illness, and without even hearing any of her symptoms, Browne confidently advised her to 'look for lupus.'

An Instagram user posted a clip of a woman almost crying as she discussed a childhood dream that had stalked her thoughts into adulthood.

'Can you tell me the dream, honey? 'Cause I can't read your mind,' said Browne.

'I've recently started rewatching Sylvia Browne, and I swear, this woman would just stare at you and say the wildest nonsense,' wrote an X user over another video.

That footage showed Browne confronted by a woman who said: 'Almost a year ago my little nephew had a very violent death. Can you tell me why?'

'Honey, I just got through telling you, it's because it was his time to go,' Browne said, deploying her reputed powers of farsightedness. 'It was his time. He was like an angel that came passing through and then went out.' 

She then gruffly asked: 'What is this about, that he couldn't breathe? What is that?' and the woman fought back tears as she replied: 'His lungs were blown out.'

'Well, that's why he couldn't breathe,' Browne managed to divine.

Browne died of heart failure in San Jose, California in 2013 at the age of 77, a decade after she predicted on Larry King Live that she would live to be 88. 

A representative for Montel Williams declined the Daily Mail's request for comment on this story.

Based on the author's interpretations and judgments of facts, data and events

This June 1, 2023, image courtesy of the Nova Scotia Government in Canada, shows firefighters Walter Scott and Zac Simpson spray the ground around Barrington Lake, Shelburne county, Canada.

Nova Scotia is, if you listen to a small-but-loud chorus, sliding into “authoritarianism” and “totalitarianism.” It is the testing ground for draconian “climate lockdowns” and a sign of a malignant government “paranoia.” 

For most Nova Scotians, their government's decision to ban anyone from entering the woods for any reason, save on their own property — issued with the blunt warning of “STAY OUT OF THE WOODS” — is a necessary precaution to prevent forest fires amid a bone dry summer.

But many others, mostly elsewhere in Canada, see this hiking-and-camping ban as something more sinister: that “it's deja vu.”

The backlash, like so many weird externalities today, is really about the pandemic. And it is a blinking indicator that, while many of us may be keen to move on from those wretched years, COVID-19 — and our governments' response to it — still looms large in the minds of many. It has made them cynical and distrustful. But contrary to what many mainstream commentators say, maybe they're not wrong to feel that way.

Earlier this week, army veteran Jeff Evely incurred a $28,872.50 fine for venturing into the woods in Cape Breton. It wasn't accidental: He walked up to a conversation officer and announced “I'm going to go in the woods over there.”

During the pandemic, Evely became convinced that our freedom and liberties were slipping away. He joined the anti-vaccine Freedom Convoy and ran for the conspiratorial People's Party. He believed the lockdowns and vaccine mandates were part of a larger plan to impose total government control, and he thinks his province's forest ban is a continuation of that plot.

Evely may be an extreme example, but he's a citizen like the rest of us. And any citizen in a liberal democracy generally asks themselves two questions about state action in tough times: Do I trust my government to effectively manage this crisis? And do I trust that my government will behave responsibly with the power I surrender to it?

We all have a point where the answer to those questions switches from yes to no. We can all agree that shelter-in-place orders during a mass shooting are reasonable, but that a citywide lockdown to find the mayor's missing cat would not be.

This isn't just a perception problem. Think back to 2020: Canadians overwhelmingly heeded stay-at-home orders, understanding them as necessary. In the ensuing two years, however, compliance for heavy-handed measures declined precipitously.

Governments showed their penchant for overreaction, just as the quality of their services were declining. We saw our leaders — some who are still in power — as incompetent and prone to overreaction. At the same time, they expected the public's faith to return, as though trust is some default position: It is not. 

Public relations firm Edelman conducts an annual “Trust Barometer.” Between 2021 and this year, they observed a 21-point jump in the number of Canadians who worry that our leaders “purposely mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations.”

This has huge public policy ramifications. When governments deliver instructions to their citizens in exceptional times — don't go outside, wear a mask, don't start fires, get vaccinated — success is measured by compliance. Compliance is a factor of trust.

This is the second time Nova Scotia has had to resort to such a ban on its sprawling forests. The last time was just two years ago, as devastating wildfires ripped through the province. (Evely challenged it then, too. Unsuccessfully.) Nova Scotians, luckily, seem to be complying with the rules, although the province is still struggling to contain some fires across the province.

The warnings of dystopia and autocracy emanating from elsewhere in the country, however, should cause some concern.

A few months back, I was chatting with a former public health officer. I asked when we may finally see a public inquiry into how our governments responded to the pandemic. They gave a cynical laugh: “Never.”

Such a public inquiry is likely to tell us that, yes, governments did overreach when they imposed arbitrary lockdowns and curfews, and no the science did not support such measures. Doing so, of course, would provide ammunition to the conspiracy theorists — who are wrong about an awful lot, but right about a select few things. Hence why that former public health official believed it would never happen.

We're entering into challenging times, and there are already so many malign pressures weakening trust in our institutions — sloppy faux-journalism on social media, outright misinformation, catchy conspiracy theories, amongst others. 

A public inquiry is a good mea culpa. But rebuilding trust, such that Canadians don't reflexively go toward suspicion when governments act, is going to be a long hard road.

A self-proclaimed spiritual collective operating out of a cryptic storefront in Los Angeles is pushing back against growing accusations that it functions as a cult.

Known as the Alien Church, the organization combines elements of religion, art, and extraterrestrial belief, according to its founder who calls himself 'Mercury'.

The LA storefront features a glass-walled space, minimalist neon signs flashing words like 'art' and 'love,' alongside merchandise such as T-shirts, trucker hats, and water bottles branded 'H2O Holy'.

A crucifix depicting an alien - not Jesus - and the message, 'If you believe in Jesus, you believe in aliens', can also be seen displayed above the entrance.

Inside, shelves hold 3D-printed objects including crowns of thorns, while a painting modeled after da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' replaces Jesus and his disciples with aliens.

The collective hosts events ranging from weekly 'TGIF interfaith sermons' on topics like 'from angels to aliens' to nightly energy healing sessions, according to SFGate.

One member, Isaiah Dupree, even claims he was abducted by aliens as a child. He demonstrated a magnet sticking to his finger, which he says proves he was implanted by extraterrestrials.

In one image, published by SFGate, Dupree can be seen shining a light through the flesh of his finger where he believes a piece of metal was inserted under his skin during an alien abduction.

The Alien Church's founder describes the center as a multipurpose space, one that can function as 'an art gallery for artists,' a venue for performers, and 'a special place for positive actions.'

The group promotes 'unity and belief in a higher power,' along with the idea that 'aliens have seen much more of God's creation than humans,' Mercury told SFGate, adding that he, 'hopes to one day develop a missile capable of putting out wildfires in minutes.'

Mercury maintains that the center is privately funded through his other businesses, including print manufacturing and a truck rental service.

He says there is no profit motive and that merchandise sales are intended to help support the space.

'I'm not seeking any type of profit from people who come to services,' he said.

Mercury, who reportedly grew up in Mexico, comes from a Christian background but explains that he lost faith after he 'saw a lot of contradictions in the religion'.

Mercury (pictured), the Alien Church's founder, describes the center as a multipurpose space, one that can function as 'an art gallery for artists,' a venue for performers, and 'a special place for positive actions.'

He was later inspired to start Alien Church, which he claims was initially a restaurant concept, to help others who were struggling.

Despite those claims, comparisons to other fringe religious movements in California have raised concerns.

The region has long been home to unconventional spiritual groups centered around extraterrestrial belief - from the Aetherius Society to the infamous Heaven's Gate cult, which ended in mass suicide in 1997.

At the Alien Church, one minister known as Jah addressed the growing speculation saying: 'We are not a cult'.

However, experts say such groups are not uncommon. 

D.W. Pasulka, a professor of religious studies, argues that belief in extraterrestrials is emerging as a new form of religion.

Astronomer David Weintraub, who studies the intersection of science and belief, also noted that pop culture, technological advancement, and internet access have all helped fuel interest in UFO-based ideologies.

'You don't have to be a scientist or knowledgeable - let alone accurate about anything - to spread information or disinformation,' he said.
