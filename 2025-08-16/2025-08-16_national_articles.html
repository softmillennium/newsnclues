                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin stands on the steps of the plane prior to departure at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025, after meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. F-35 fighter escorts a Ilyushin Il-96-300 aircraft of the Russia Special Flight Squadron carrying Russian President Vladimir Putin back to Russia after his meeting with US President Donald Trump on Friday, Aug. 15, 2025, at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska. Russia's President Vladimir Putin speaks during a news conference at Joint Base Elmendorf- Richardson, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025, in Anchorage, Alaska. In Alaska, President Vladimir Putin walked on a red carpet, shook hands and exchanged smiles with his American counterpart. Donald Trump ended the summit praising their relationship and calling Russia “a big power ... No. By Saturday morning Moscow time, Trump appeared to have abandoned the idea of a ceasefire as a step toward peace — something he and Ukraine had pushed for months -– in favor of pursuing a full-fledged “Peace Agreement” to end the war, echoing a long-held Kremlin position. The “severe consequences” he threatened against Moscow for continuing hostilities were nowhere in sight. The hastily arranged Alaska summit “produced nothing for Mr. Trump and gave Mr. Putin most of what he was looking for,” said Laurie Bristow, a former British ambassador to Russia. Crippling sanctions followed, along with efforts to shun Russia on the global stage. The International Criminal Court in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin on accusations of war crimes, casting a shadow on his foreign trips and contacts with other world leaders. He warmly greeted Putin, even clapping for him, on a red carpet as U.S. warplanes flew overhead as the world watched. Russian officials and media revelled in the images of the pomp-filled reception Putin received in Alaska, which pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda described as signalling “utmost respect.” It called the meeting a “huge diplomatic victory” for Putin, whose forces will have time to make more territorial gains. The reception contrasted starkly with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's March visit to the Oval Office, where Trump treated him like a “representative of a rogue state,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a member of the German parliament. “He will consider the summit outcome as mission accomplished.” In recent months, Trump has pressed for a ceasefire, something Ukraine and its allies supported and insisted was a prerequisite for any peace talks. The Kremlin has pushed back, however, arguing it's not interested in a temporary truce -– only in a long-term peace agreement. Moscow's official demands for peace so far have remained nonstarter for Kyiv: It wants Ukraine to cede four regions that Russia only partially occupies, along with the Crimean Peninsula, illegally annexed in 2014. After Alaska, Trump appeared to echo the Kremlin's position on a ceasefire, posting on social media that after he spoke to Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, “it was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.” Trump already imposed those tariffs on India, and if applied to others, Russian revenues “would probably be impacted very badly and very quickly,” said Chris Weafer, CEO of Macro-Advisory Ltd. consultancy. In the days before Alaska, Trump also threatened unspecified “very severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to stop the war. Asked about that in a post-summit interview with Fox News Channel, Trump said he doesn't need “to think about that right now,” and suggested he might revisit the idea in “two weeks or three weeks or something.” In a statement after the summit, Putin claimed the two leaders had hammered out an “understanding” on Ukraine and warned Europe not to “torpedo the nascent progress.” But Trump said “there's no deal until there's a deal.” In his Fox interview, Trump insisted the onus going forward might be on Zelenskyy “to get it done,” but said there would also be some involvement from European nations. Zelenskyy will meet Trump at the White House on Monday. Both raised the possibility of a trilateral summit with Putin, but Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov said it wasn't discussed in Alaska. “Trump now appears to be shifting responsibility towards Kyiv and Europe, while still keeping a role for himself,” Tatiana Stanovaya of the Carnegie Russia and Eurasia Center wrote on X. Fiona Hill, a senior adviser on Russia to Trump during his first administration, told AP that he has met his match because “Putin is a much bigger bully.” Trump wants to be the negotiator of “a big real estate deal between Russia and Ukraine,” she said, but in his mind he can “apply real pressure” only to one side — Kyiv. Far from the summit venue and its backdrop saying “Pursuing Peace,” Russia continued to bombard Ukraine and make incremental advances on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front. Ukraine shot down or intercepted 61 drones, its air force said. Front-line areas of Sumy, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk and Chernihiv were attacked. “Unless Mr. Putin is absolutely convinced that he cannot win militarily, the fighting is not going to stop,” said Bristow, the former ambassador.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Peace deal over ceasefire: US President Donald Trump said focusing immediately on a lasting peace deal is the best way to end the war in Ukraine, rather than starting with a ceasefire. It's a reversal of his own position and one that may align more with the view of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who met with Trump in Alaska yesterday. • More on yesterday's summit: Putin called the Alaska meeting “timely and very useful” in new comments today. US President Donald Trump told European leaders he wants to arrange a trilateral summit between himself, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin by next Friday, and that he would get to work arranging the meeting if Monday's Oval Office talks with Zelensky go well. European officials expect at least one other leader from Europe will join those talks on Monday, but it wasn't yet clear who. While reporters weren't invited to the meeting, afterward, Vance posted a photo of him and Zelensky smiling. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said that US President Donald Trump is “creating the opportunity to end Russia's illegal war in Ukraine.” During a call with European leaders after yesterday's Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump highlighted an Italian idea for a NATO-style security guarantee for Ukraine as part of a peace deal, according to Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Reuters reports. Putin said in exchange, he would be willing to freeze the current front lines in the rest of Ukraine — in the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia — and agree to a promise not to attack Ukraine or other European nations again. But he didn't back away from a demand to eliminate what Russia calls the “root causes” of the war in Ukraine — code for reducing the size of Kyiv's military, abandoning its aspirations to join NATO and becoming a neutral state. The details of Putin's conditions emerged when Trump briefed European leaders on the talks as he was arriving back in Washington early this morning. European leaders also said Trump voiced openness to providing US security guarantees for Ukraine once the war ends, though the specifics of what he's willing to provide remained unclear. Taken together, Trump's recounting of the meeting provided little optimism among European officials, though leaders' public responses to the summit were calibrated to avoid contradicting Trump. Let's take a look ahead to next week, when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with US President Donald Trump in Washington, DC. There is currently “no motivation” for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his war in Ukraine now that his US counterpart Donald Trump has said he will hold off on imposing secondary sanctions on those who buy Russian oil, a prominent critic of the Russian leader told CNN. “We can make it uncomfortable for him militarily by providing more military aid to Ukraine,” he suggested. “Or we can make life very uncomfortable for him economically” by imposing secondary sanctions on countries that buy Russian oil or confiscating frozen assets, Browder added. “What I find so upsetting about the last 24 hours is, at least from the US perspective, there doesn't seem to be any plan to do that. The Russian leader's meeting with Trump was a “huge victory for Putin,” Browder said. He can carry on with his war, and there are to be no devastating sanctions, which means that there is no incentive for him to come to any kind of reasonable solution on this war,” he said. Kremlin officials have said the meeting is proof that Moscow is not as isolated on the world stage as Western leaders have argued. Russian officials also stated that the meeting resulted in progress on sanctions and opened up room for future negotiations. Just hours after getting back to the White House after his high-stakes meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, US President Donald Trump arrived at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, this morning at 11:52 a.m. US President Donald Trump remains “bafflingly unwilling” to apply maximum economic pressure on Russia, despite such measures being his best bet to exert influence over the Kremlin, a finance and security expert said Saturday. Ahead of the meeting, Trump deployed a range of contradictory economic signals, Keatinge said, mixing “carrots” like investment deals and sanctions relief with “sticks,” such as heavier sanctions and more tariffs on Russia's oil trading partners. Despite these efforts, the status quo remains, with post-summit remarks offering no insight into whether Trump threatened further economic pressure during the Alaska meeting, Keatinge said in a statement. “In short, with Russia's economy on the ropes, Trump remains bafflingly unwilling to apply the maximum economic pressure on Russia that would mean summits like those held yesterday are more likely to yield the success Donald Trump craves,” Keatinge added. “To achieve a just and lasting peace the next step must be together with Ukraine. Only Ukraine can make decisions concerning its future,” the statement said. The eight countries include Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden. “Experience has shown that (Russian President Vladimir) Putin cannot be trusted,” it added. “Ultimately it is Russia's responsibility to end its blatant violations of international law. Russia's aggression and imperialist ambitions are the root causes of this war.” The statement welcomed news of President Donald Trump's discussions with European officials for Ukrainian security guarantees, saying that “no limitations should be placed on Ukraine's armed forces or on its cooperation with other countries” and that “Russia has no veto over Ukraine's pathway to the EU and NATO.” The leaders pledged to continue arming Ukraine and enhancing Europe's defenses, while warning they will keep strengthening sanctions and economic measures “as long as Russia continues its killing.” Russian President Vladimir Putin said his meeting with US President Donald Trump in Alaska was “timely and very useful,” marking his first comments since appearing alongside Trump after Friday's summit. “I would like to note right away that the visit was timely and very useful. We would like to move towards resolving all issues by peaceful means,” Putin said. This post has been updated with additional comments from Putin. US President Donald Trump attempted to express friendly dominance with most of his body language seen yesterday at his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to behavioral analyst and body-language expert Chris Ulrich. He told CNN's Michael Smerconish this morning that the initial handshake moment between the two leaders was “a moment of opportunity for them to connect.” This is a moment of rapport-building and parity,” Ulrich said. Here, Trump shows deference, followed by pulling the hand in and using these touch gestures to reestablish dominance as they walk down.” After Trump and Putin shook hands for about 10 seconds, they could be seen walking down the tarmac. Then, after the two had their closed-door discussion, Trump and Putin held a news briefing where they did not take questions. Standing behind the podium, Ulrich said their body language looked “very cordial.” It's a much different energy in the room,” he said. Inna Sovsun, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, pointed out in an interview with CNN's Polo Sandoval that Trump's reception of Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska yesterday appeared to be in sharp contrast to his frosty Oval Office exchange with Zelensky earlier this year, when Trump castigated him for not demonstrating enough gratitude for American support. She also said Trump's “potential partnership” with Putin is a “very scary prospect for all of us.” “This has been such a bloody war that even if a ceasefire is put in place and a peace plan is negotiated, the sense that there must be retribution on both sides — Ukrainians for having been killed, Russians for having been killed — will continue,” Brzezinski told CNN's Michael Smerconish. European leaders called for strong security guarantees for Ukraine on Saturday following US President Donald Trump's high-profile summit with Russia's Volodymyr Zelensky in Alaska. For context: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the “openness” of the United States to provide security guarantees to Ukraine as part of any future peace deal. Russian President Vladimir Putin's final words at the Alaska summit were delivered with a smile, spoken in an unusual burst of English. “And next time in Moscow,” Putin said — no translation needed — in response to US President Donald Trump suggesting they would see each other again soon. Back in 2017, the Kremlin said that Putin understands English “almost completely” and even corrects his interpreters, according to Russia's Izvestia newspaper. When he is “on the go,” Putin “most often speaks English, but when negotiations are conducted and when an official meeting is taking place, of course, he communicates through interpreters,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, the paper reported at the time. Using interpreters at high-level meetings allows leaders room for maneuver. Security guarantees for Kyiv — not disputes over land swaps and the future borders of Ukraine — represent the biggest obstacle to Russia agreeing to a peace deal, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Adm. James Stavridis said Saturday. In calls with European counterparts following his summit Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump reportedly discussed the potential for NATO-esque security guarantees as part of a prospective Russia-Ukraine peace deal. Stavridis said that will be a hard sell for the Kremlin, as Trump shifts his focus from achieving an initial ceasefire to pursuing a more sweeping peace agreement. In a fresh post on X Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered battlefield updates as he warned of a possible uptick in Russian attacks over the coming days. This, he said, could be an attempt by Russia to garner more favourable political sway. It comes after Russian leader Vladimir Putin held talks with US President Donald Trump in Alaska, which centered on ending the war. Trump has since floated the idea of further meetings, including a possible trilateral summit with Putin and Zelensky. According to the Élysée Palace, the meeting tomorrow will be co-chaired by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The meeting will be held by video conference and begin at 3 p.m. local time (9 a.m. During US President Donald Trump's call with European leaders, Trump highlighted an Italian proposal for security guarantees for Ukraine “inspired by NATO's Article 5,” Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said, according to Reuters. A European official told CNN earlier that part of the conversations with Trump involved “Article 5-type” security guarantees for Ukraine, with European and US backing, in the event of a peace deal. The US president has previously been dismissive of Kyiv's frequent calls for security guarantees — some way to ensure that Russia won't violate a ceasefire agreement or renew its offensive in Ukraine in a few years. “If there are Article 5-style guarantees, that is a very big deal,” said Jill Dougherty, adjunct professor at Georgetown University and former CNN Moscow bureau chief, noting that the article itself is not an obligation. “It never obligates anybody, but the expectation is that they would protect Ukraine.” Dougherty also highlighted Putin's remark yesterday that “the security of Ukraine must be secured.” “That could be an indication that maybe (Putin) is working out something with the United States that, yes, he could say ‘never ever NATO membership for Ukraine, but yes, maybe we could have some type of American guarantee,'” Dougherty added. European powers have proposed a “reassurance force” for Ukraine, which they have said cannot work without a US “backstop,” but Trump has so far been reluctant to commit US forces or resources. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Kyiv contributed to this report. “You had a situation which was completely under the control of the White House but yet it seemed as if it was scripted by the Kremlin from beginning to end, especially that so-called press conference there,” Bociurkiw said CNN's Victor Blackwell. Asked if Zelensky might be shoehorned into making an unfavorable deal for Ukraine on Monday, Bociurkiw said: “As for what's about to happen on Monday, I'm very, very nervous about it. I actually have a gut feeling, Victor, that Mr Zelensky is walking into another trap.” Earlier, US President Donald Trump confirmed he will meet with Zelensky in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon after the pair had a “long and substantive conversation” following Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

District of Columbia National Guard soldiers pose for photos with people outside Union Station, Saturday, Aug. 16, 2025, in Washington. District of Columbia National Guard soldiers patrol inside Union Station, Saturday, Aug. 16, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Hundreds of West Virginia National Guard members will deploy across the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to overhaul policing in the District of Columbia through a federal crackdown on crime and homelessness. Patrick Morrisey, R-W.Va., announced Saturday that he was sending a contingent of 300 to 400 to nearby Washington at the Republican administration's request. They will arrive in the district along with equipment and specialized training services, his office said in a statement. “The men and women of our National Guard represent the best of our state, and this mission reflects our shared commitment to a strong and secure America.” The move comes as federal agents and National Guard troops have begun to appear across the heavily Democratic city after Trump's executive order Monday federalizing local police forces and activating about 800 D.C. National Guard troops. By adding outside troops to join the existing National Guard deployment and federal law enforcement officers temporarily assigned to Washington, the administration is exercising even tighter control over the city. It's a power play that the president has justified as an emergency response to crime and homelessness, even though district officials have noted that violent crime is lower than it was during Trump's first term in office. Maj. Gen. James Seward, West Virginia's adjutant general, said in a statement that members of the state's National Guard “stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region” and that the Guard's “unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking.” Federal agents have appeared in some of the city's most highly trafficked neighborhoods, garnering a mix of praise, pushback and alarm from local residents and leaders across the country. After a court hearing, Trump's attorney general, Pam Bond, issued a memo that directed the Metropolitan Police Department to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law. District officials say they are evaluating how to best comply. In a letter to city residents, Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, wrote that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now.” She added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy -– even when we don't have full access to it.” Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.</p>

EDS NOTE: GRAPHIC CONTENT - Bodies of children, killed in Friday's flash flooding, seen at a house at a village near Pir Baba, Buner district, in Pakistan's northwest, Saturday, Aug.16, 2025. BUNER, Pakistan (AP) — Flooding in a northwest Pakistani district has killed at least 220 people, officials said Saturday, as rescuers pulled 63 more bodies overnight from homes flattened by flash floods and landslides, with forecasts of more rain in the coming days. Hundreds of rescue workers are still searching for survivors in Buner, one of several places in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where torrential rains and cloudbursts caused massive flooding on Friday, said Mohammad Suhail, a spokesman for the emergency services. First responders have been trying to recover bodies from the worst-hit villages of Pir Baba and Malik Pura, where most of the fatalities were, said Kashif Qayyum, a deputy commissioner in Buner. Local police officer Imtiaz Khan, who narrowly escaped the deluges, said floodwaters carrying hundreds of boulders struck and flattened homes within minutes. “A stream near Pir Baba village in Buner swelled without warning. At first, we thought it was a normal flash flood, but when tons of rocks came crashing down with the water, 60 to 70 houses were swept away in moments,” Khan told The Associated Press, adding that many bodies were left mutilated. “Our police station was washed away too and if we hadn't climbed to higher ground, we would not have survived,” Khan said. Pakistan's Meteorological Department predicted torrential rains in the coming days and warned that monsoon activity was likely to intensify from Sunday onwards, including in the north and northwest. Rescuers said they saw large swathes of Pir Baba village destroyed, wrecked homes, and giant rocks filling the streets as the water started to recede. “It was not just the floodwater, it was a flood of boulders as well, which we saw for the first time in our lives,” said Sultan Syed, 45, who suffered a broken arm. Mohammad Khan, 53, said the floods “came so fast that many could not leave their homes.” Most victims died before reaching the hospital, said Mohammad Tariq, a doctor in Buner. The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, said efforts were underway to repair roads and other damaged infrastructure. Pakistan has received higher-than-normal monsoon rainfall this year, which experts link to climate change, triggering floods and mudslides that have killed some 541 people since June 26, according to the National Disaster Management Authority. Mourners attended mass funerals on Saturday, while authorities supplied tents and food to people in Buner. Local cleric Mufti Fazal had led funeral prayers at multiple locations since Friday morning. According to the provincial disaster management authority, at least 351 people have died in rain-related incidents this week across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the northern region of Gilgit-Baltistan. In India-controlled Kashmir, rescuers scoured the remote village of Chositi in the district of Kishtwar on Saturday, looking for dozens of missing people after it was hit by flash floods two days earlier, killing 60 and injuring some 150, about 50 in critical condition. Thursday's floods struck during an annual Hindu pilgrimage in the area. Pakistani officials said rescuers since Thursday have evacuated more than 3,500 tourists trapped in flood-hit areas across the country. Many travelers have ignored government warnings about avoiding vulnerable regions in the north and northwest. It killed more than 1,700 people and caused an estimated $40 billion in damage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>West Virginia National Guard troops are now being sent to Washington, DC, in an escalation of President Donald Trump's efforts to federally take over law enforcement in the city. We are deploying 300-400 skilled personnel to the nation's capital, reflecting our commitment to a strong and secure America,” West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, said in an X post on Saturday. A White House official said Saturday that the troops are a part of “Trump's ongoing effort to make DC safe and beautiful” and the “National Guard's role has not changed.” Its role in DC this week has, so far, not been to make arrests. “The National Guard will protect federal assets, create a safe environment for law enforcement officials to carry out their duties when required, and provide a visible presence to deter crime,” the official said. CNN has reached out to the DC mayor's office for comment. The troops' deployment is an escalation of Trump's efforts to take federal control of the DC police department as he rails against crime in the capital. “We stand ready to support our partners in the National Capital Region and contribute to the collective effort of making our nation's capital a clean and safe environment. The National Guard's unique capabilities and preparedness make it an invaluable partner in this important undertaking,” West Virginia Adjutant General  Jim Seward, who will command the deployment of the state's troops, said in a statement. Washington, DC, sued the Trump administration on Friday to block Attorney General Pam Bondi's Thursday directive for the city to accept an “emergency police commissioner,” acting Drug Enforcement Administration chief Terry Cole, and give him full control of the department during the federal takeover. Following a hearing in federal court, Bondi issued a new order Friday giving control of the Metropolitan Police Department back to its chief, Pamela Smith, in response to a judge's directive. Federal agents have been patrolling the city with local police and making arrests following Trump's order earlier this week declaring a crime emergency and federalizing DC's police. DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, has repeatedly said she wants to make sure the federal law enforcement surge is useful to the city, though she struck a more adversarial tone during an event this week, calling Trump's police department takeover an “authoritarian push.” CNN's Alayna Treene contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York Times best-selling author Greg Iles of Natchez, Miss., states the need for a change of the Mississippi state flag during the seventh annual Statehood Day celebration Thursday, Dec. 10, 2015, in Jackson, Miss. (AP) — Greg Iles, the Mississippi author of the “Natchez Burning” trilogy and other works, has died. Iles died Friday after a decades-long battle with the blood cancer multiple myeloma, his literary agent Dan Conaway posted Saturday on Facebook. Initially diagnosed with the incurable condition in 1996, he kept his illness private until completing his final novel, “Southern Man,” which was published in 2024. Iles was born in Germany but moved to Natchez, Mississippi, with his family when he was just three years old and developed a deep connection with the region. Many of his stories are set in Mississippi, including the “Natchez Burning” trilogy, historical fiction suspense novels exploring race and class in the 1960s Jim Crow South. Conaway described Iles as “warm, funny, fearless, and completely sui generis.” “To be on the other end of the phone as he talked through character and plot, problem-solving on the fly, was to be witness to genius at work, plain and simple,” he wrote on Saturday. “As a writer he fused story-craft, bone-deep humanity, and a growing sense of moral and political responsibility with the ferocious precisions of a whirling dervish or a master watchmaker.” In March 2011, Iles suffered a ruptured aorta and a partial leg amputation and spent eight days in a medically induced coma after another driver struck his car on Highway 61 near Natchez. Iles performed with the musical group The Rock Bottom Remainders along with popular authors Stephen King, Amy Tan and others.</p>

The State Department announced on Saturday that it was halting all visitor visas to individuals from Gaza while it reviews the issuing process. "All visitor visas for individuals from Gaza are being stopped while we conduct a full and thorough review of the process and procedures used to issue a small number of temporary medical-humanitarian visas in recent days," a post on X from the State Department read. Neither the State Department nor Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented on what triggered the sudden review. A Palestinian man collects food from a humanitarian aid distribution point in Beit Lahia, northern Gaza, on Sunday, July 20, 2025. In June, the Trump administration began cracking down on vetting for visa applicants. This involved the introduction of a "comprehensive and thorough" review of all applicants' "online presence." "Every visa adjudication is a national security decision. The United States must be vigilant during the visa issuance process to ensure that those applying for admission into the United States do not intend to harm Americans and our national interests, and that all applicants credibly establish their eligibility for the visa sought, including that they intend to engage in activities consistent with the terms for their admission," the State Department said at the time. US President Donald Trump listens to Secretary of State Marco Rubio speak during a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C., on July 16, 2025. Earlier this month, France suspended evacuations from Gaza after a Palestinian student allegedly shared a social media post with an image of Adolf Hitler that called for killing Jews. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told France Info radio that the woman "must leave the country" and that she "has no place" in France. "No evacuation of any kind will take place until we have drawn the necessary conclusions from this investigation," Barrot said in the interview. He also vowed there would be a probe into how the Palestinian woman was able to get a student visa. Palestinians return with bags from a food distribution point run by the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) group, near the Netsarim corridor in the central Gaza Strip on Aug. 2, 2025.

Fox News Digital spoke to Just Facts President James Agresti about misleading narratives about crime in the nation's capital Democrats across the country have been pushing back on President Trump's D.C. crime crackdown, citing statistics purportedly showing that crime in the nation's capital is down or even at historic lows, but an expert who spoke to Fox News Digital is pushing back on that narrative. And the problem with that is that they're portraying it as if it's a record of violent crime," Jim Agresti, president of the nonprofit research institute Just Facts, told Fox News Digital shortly after Trump announced he was sending federal resources to the nation's capital to confront crime in the city. "But really what it is is a record of crimes that are reported to the police and then those of those crimes that get reported to the FBI. And the FBI is very explicit about this when they present the data in their formal report every year, where they say, ‘Do not directly compare the data from year to year because there are differences in how frequently people report crimes and how frequently the FBI gets that data from the local police agencies.'" While many prominent Democrats, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, have insisted violent crime is at a 30-year low in the city, Agresti told Fox News Digital the "best way to understand the state of violent crime" in any jurisdiction is to look at the number of murders because it is a violent crime that is difficult to "sweep under the rug" because it "produces a dead body." Fox News Digital spoke to Just Facts President Jim Agresti about the crime situation in Washington, D.C.  (Getty) "When we look at the murder data for DC, we see that it is not a situation that is lower now than it's been in the last 30 years. So, there is a serious problem with serious crime, violent crime in D.C., and the city now, the nation's capital, has a murder rate that is five times the U.S. The chances of a person facing a violent crime in Washington, D.C., have dropped in recent years, but the possibility of dying during such a crime has skyrocketed, data shows, Fox News Digital reported on Wednesday. Lethality in D.C. jumped by a whopping 341% when compared to 2012 data, the study found, reporting that there were 13 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2012 and 57 homicides per 1,000 serious violent crimes in 2024. "That makes a lot of sense," Agresti said. People were talking about defunding the police, and there was overall mayhem in this country. So, that rise, by the way, that people blame on COVID actually didn't start with COVID, and it didn't appear in other countries. It happened here where we had these BLM riots." "We had roughly 17,000 murders last year," Agresti explained. "Imagine if all of them made national news. At the current rate of murders in this county, roughly one in every 230 people in the United States will have their lives cut short by being murdered. "Think about the horror of that, and beyond all this pain, suffering, death, there's also a financial cost to crime," Agresti said. "It's been quantified in a 2021 academic paper, and, bottom line, crime in all of its forms, pain, death, suffering, financial loss, activities we take to prevent crime, they amount to a cost on our US economy of roughly $40,000 per U.S. Questions have also been raised about local crime stats from D.C. showing crime is down so far this year, with many pointing to news reports that a D.C. police commander was recently suspended for allegedly altering crime data. Agresti said anyone can "cherry-pick" crime statistics to promote a specific agenda but that it is important to also realize that many crimes also go unreported due to various factors, including animosity toward police or the belief that calling the police won't yield results. "The vast majority of crime goes unreported, and another phenomenon that's really, really disturbing is the amount of crimes that are solved," Agresti said. In 2023, that figure was down to 58%, meaning that 40-plus percent of people who committed murders got away with it, and they're out there to commit them again." As of Thursday, 800 Trump-authorized National Guard troops were in Washington, D.C., supporting other federal law enforcement agencies with "monument security, community safety patrols, protecting federal facilities and officers, traffic control posts and area beautification," according to the State Department. Trump's move to crack down on crime in the capital, which the White House says is happening at levels that dwarf capitals in other far more impoverished countries across the world, has sparked protests led by liberal activists and outrage from some elected Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. "When politicians are saying, 'We don't have to worry about this, it's the lowest crime rate in 30 years,' they are abdicating their responsibility," Agresti told Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law on Aug. 16, 2022, after Democrats passed it following months of negotiations between liberals and centrist Sen. Joe Manchin (WV). In reality, it authorized major new spending on initiatives long sought by Democrats. Biden touted it as the “most significant legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis.” The bill also included major new healthcare provisions sought by Democrats, and was financed by tax hikes on corporations and investors. The clean energy provisions of the bill, in particular, have been significantly repealed by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4 — a major blow to Biden's legislative legacy. Other parts of the bill remain, and now appear to be firmly ensconced in federal law, at least for the near term. The OBBBA repeals more than $500 billion of IRA clean energy tax credits over the next decade, as well as billions for clean energy programs. Specifically, the bill eliminates credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of electric vehicles as well as up to $4,000 for used electric vehicles. The bill phased out tax credits for solar and wind energy, requiring projects to begin construction within one year or be operational by 2027 to be eligible for the production or investment tax credit. The department issued new stringent regulations on Friday. Many fiscal conservatives had sought a complete repeal of the clean energy tax credits. For nuclear power, geothermal power, and hydropower — sources of energy valued by the Trump administration because they can provide “baseload” power that does not vary with the wind or sun — the IRA tax credits were untouched or have a longer phase-out period. The OBBBA also further departed from the clean-energy agenda by including provisions to increase domestic oil and gas development by mandating lease sales on federal lands and waters. Specifically, it would require two lease sales in the Gulf of America, formally known as the Gulf of America, and would also mandate quarterly lease sales onshore and sales in Alaska. Overall, the course of federal energy policy has taken a dramatic turn. “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has positioned the federal government to encourage investment in traditional fossil fuel projects,” James Bowe, a partner at King & Spalding who focuses on energy, said via email. “One result of the [OBBBA] enactment and related changes in federal energy policy has been an upsurge in new natural gas and liquified natural gas project development, the revival of several large natural gas pipeline projects and a rush to develop new gas-fired generating facilities,” he added. “From the federal government's perspective, renewables are out, and oil, gas and even coal are now back in.” The Trump administration appears to be using the negotiation authority until larger plans for lowering drug costs take shape. Those new prices, for drugs like heart medications Jardiance and Eliquis and Crohn's Disease drug Stelara, are set to take effect Jan. 1, 2026. This January, the outgoing Biden CMS announced 15 new drugs up for negotiations with prices to take effect in 2027. That list included the Danish pharmaceutical juggernaut Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus. Trump CMS administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz has not yet announced whether the prices for those 15 drugs have been negotiated yet. But, during his Senate confirmation hearing in March, he said that the negotiation program was the law of the land and that he would “defend it and use it.” It clarified rules for so-called “orphan drugs” that treat one or more rare diseases. These orphan drugs are now fully exempt from the negotiation program, with the intention of encouraging pharmaceutical companies to invest in cures or treatments for rare diseases. If pharmaceutical companies do not voluntarily comply, the executive order gives Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. the authority to propose rules and restrictions on manufacturers and imports. “After much fanfare, Joe Biden's Inflation ‘Reduction' Act barely lowered drug prices in the first round of negotiations and actually increased Medicare premiums in the meantime,” said Desai. “President Trump is focused on delivering what American patients really want – lower drug prices by ending foreign free loading off of American innovation.” One major IRA provision that faces an uncertain future is its extension of additional Obamacare premium subsidies. If they expire, many families would face higher costs, and the ranks of the uninsured would rise by 3.8 million, a daunting political scenario for Republicans. It also enacted new campaign-trail Trump proposals, such as eliminating taxes on tips and ending taxes on overtime pay. The IRA created a corporate alternative minimum tax that mandated a 15% minimum tax for large corporations on their “book income” — that is, the income they report to investors, rather than what they report to the IRS. McBride said that the GOP bill only slightly tweaks that provision by providing a bit of a carveout for some companies in the oil and gas sector. “It's a very small issue — it's less than a billion dollars over 10 years — so otherwise, the corporate alternative tax is fully in place,” McBride told the Washington Examiner. The IRA also imposed a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. Still, other pieces of legislation have chiseled away at that $80 billion, and the funding is now about half of what it was when the IRA became law.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tucked in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is language the Trump administration hopes will allow border officials to detain illegal immigrants indefinitely, as its authority to do so makes its way through the courts. The law, passed by a GOP-controlled Congress in July, contained provisions that could allow the federal government to detain families through the duration of their court proceedings, something that has not been legally permissible since 1997, when a judge imposed what was known as the Flores settlement agreement that outlined detention regulations. Trump administration officials have touted the BBB provision as a way to prevent families that cross the border from being automatically released into the United States, given a 20-day limit on keeping parents and children in federal custody. Flores dates back to 1985, when the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law sued the government in a class-action lawsuit named after 15-year-old Jenny Lisette Flores, a girl from El Salvador who came over the southern border alone. The lawsuit alleged that Flores was not housed separately from unrelated adults, did not receive adequate hygiene care, and was wrongly denied release to a family member. Prior to this, border and immigration agencies did not have standards for detaining children. Under Flores, children would receive food, water, medical care, toilets and sinks, appropriate temperature controls within facilities, adequate adult supervision, and the ability to contact family. Central District of California Judge Dolly Gee, an Obama appointee, ruled in 2015 in Flores v. Johnson that children, whether unaccompanied or with family members, could not be held indefinitely and that they all had to be treated according to the terms of the 1997 settlement agreement. White House border czar Tom Homan told reporters outside the White House on Wednesday afternoon that Gee's decision was the “worst immigration decision in the history of this nation” because judges would not be able to hear claims in the 20-day period, which would force ICE to release families and hope they would show up to court years down the road. “I said at the time, if they did that, you would see a surge of family units across this border like never seen before,” Homan said. “Children who seek refuge in our country should be met with open arms — not imprisonment, deprivation, and abuse,” Sergio Perez, executive director of CHRCL, said in a statement. “The Trump Administration's move to dismiss this agreement … is another lawless step towards sacrificing accountability and human decency in favor of a political agenda that demonizes refugees.” “The law requires that everyone who crosses illegally should be detained. So you shouldn't be able to be exempt from that because you brought your children on this dangerous journey and put them at risk. It's not inherently cruel or punitive to keep people in custody until their case is resolved,” said Vaughan, whose organization is nonpartisan but takes a stricter approach to immigration levels. In particular, the law has provisions that appear to allow migrant parents and their children to be held at “family residential centers” for the duration of their court case. “Say there's a family that has an asylum application and is denied, and they may — if the government thinks that they're not going to comply with the removal order — put them in a facility like this,” Vaughan said. “It would be almost like a repatriation center to hold them in case they don't show up.” Vaughan maintained that since Congress was the one to pass legislation addressing Flores, it ought to override the court agreement. “Congress has spoken on it, which under our constitutional system, is very powerful,” Vaughan said. Neha Desai, managing director at the National Center for Youth Law, was insistent that the Flores settlement agreement was still in good standing. Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-TX), whose district is the largest one on the U.S.-Mexico border, was optimistic that ICE would have adequate facilities and accommodations if families ended up being detained beyond 20 days. “I visited these facilities under both administrations, and I've never had a problem with ICE facilities,” Gonzales told CBS News's Face the Nation on Sunday. “They've always allowed me to view everything I wanted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At parks, coffee shops, churches and government buildings around the country, hundreds of people are expected to gather today with a simple message: “Stop the Trump takeover.” Organizers emphasized “a commitment to nonviolence” at all events in event page descriptions. Over 200 events are planned in 34 states, according to the event's official website. The Democratic National Committee is helping organize events, it announced in a news release. “From coast to coast, people will be showing up at their statehouses, city halls, and community spaces to make it clear – we see what Trump is doing, and we won't stand for it,” said the DNC. A swath of nonprofits and other organizations are also supporting the effort, including Planned Parenthood, the Working Families Party and Human Rights Campaign. Texas Republicans call new special session for redistricting, this time with Democrats expected back Republican leaders in other states, too, have proposed changing their congressional maps ahead of next year's midterms. In Ohio, maps must be redrawn due to a quirk of state law – which may make the state's delegation even more Republican and carve up two Democratic seats, according to a report in June from CNN's Fredreka Schouten. Democratic lawmakers have announced their own plans to fight back, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who kicked off his own redistricting push on Thursday. Here's more on what we know about today's protests. Today's largest protest is slated to happen in Austin, Texas. “Texas is being used as a testing ground for extremist policies and partisan games that don't reflect our values,” reads the event page. Former Congressman Beto O'Rourke, United Farm Workers cofounder Dolores Huerta, Democratic US Rep. Greg Casar and Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Texas are expected to speak, according to a news release from the Texas for All Coalition. Drag queen Brigitte Bandit and singer Gina Chavez are also expected to perform. Across Texas, events are also planned in Houston, Dallas, San Angelo, Tyler, McAllen, Conroe and Kingwood. Obama praises Texas Democrats and calls state redistricting effort ‘a systematic assault on democracy' Protesters in Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina, plan to hold a “bridge brigade,” holding signs on 16 different bridges. Demonstrations are also planned in Cincinnati, Ohio; Sarasota, Florida; and Jefferson City, Missouri, among other cities. The planned events include rallies, teach-ins, banner drops and art-making at locations that include a bookstore in Jacksonville, Florida, and a Tesla showroom in Palo Alto, California. Drucilla Tigner, the executive director of statewide coalition Texas For All, said in a news release that the fight extends far past Texas. “Across Texas, and across the country, communities are speaking out in a united voice to call for an end to the Trump takeover,” she said. “Though this fight started in Texas, it doesn't end here. This isn't just about redistricting or one state's politics.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The nation's capital sued to block President Donald Trump's takeover of its police department in court on Friday, hours after his administration escalated its intervention into the city's law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday reversed course and agreed to leave the Washington, D.C., police chief in control of the department, while Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a new memo, directed the District's police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement regardless of any city law. But Bondi also signaled the administration would continue to pressure D.C. leaders to help federal authorities aggressively pursue immigrants in the country illegally, despite city laws on the books that limit cooperation between police and immigration authorities. In a social media post Friday evening, Bondi criticized D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, saying he “continues to oppose our efforts to improve public safety.” But she added, “We remain committed to working closely with Mayor Bowser.” Mayor Muriel Bowser's office said late Friday that it was still evaluating how it can comply with the new Bondi order on immigration enforcement operations. The police department already eased some restrictions on cooperating with federal officials facilitating Trump's mass-deportation campaign but reaffirmed that it would follow the district's sanctuary city laws. In a letter sent Friday night to D.C. citizens, Bowser wrote: “It has been an unsettling and unprecedented week in our city. She added that “our limited self-government has never faced the type of test we are facing right now,” but added that if Washingtonians stick together, “we will show the entire nation what it looks like to fight for American democracy – even when we don't have full access to it.” Trump's takeover is historic, yet it had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week. The two sides sparred in court for hours Friday before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, who is overseeing the district's lawsuit. An attorney for the Trump administration, Yaakov Roth, said the move to sideline Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith came after an immigration order that still held back some aid to federal authorities. He argued that the president has broad authority to determine what kind of help police in Washington must provide. The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally. Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terrance Cole speaks during a television interview outside the White House, Aug. 12, 2025, in Washington. It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he'd seek to extend it. Bondi's Thursday night directive to place the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, in charge of the police department came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's instructions because they allowed for continued practice of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers. Amy Fischer, an organizer with Migrant Solidarity Mutual Aid, said that before the federal takeover, most of what they had seen in the nation's capital was Immigration and Customs Enforcement targeting specific individuals. But since last Friday night they've seen a “really significant change,” she said, with ICE and federal officers doing roving patrols around the city. Activists with Free DC carry signs as they march to federal court, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025, in Washington. She said a hotline set up by immigration advocates to report ICE activity “is receiving calls almost off the hook.” A video posted on X showed two uniformed personnel putting handcuffs on someone while standing outside a white transport van. A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear. As the District challenged the Trump administration in court Friday, more than 100 protesters gathered less than a block away in front of police headquarters, chanting “Protect home rule!” and waving signs saying “Resist!” The U.S. Capitol building is seen as Air Force One flies over Washington, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats released a congressional map for California on Friday that could give them five more districts more favorable to Democrats. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) has been pushing to redistrict California as President Donald Trump demanded Texas Republicans redraw the state's map mid-decade in an effort to hold on to the GOP's razor-thin House majority. The proposed map would, in theory, cancel out any successful effort in Texas as Texas Republicans look to add five more GOP seats. “We anticipate these maps will completely neuter and neutralize what is happening in Texas,” Newsom said Thursday, adding he will only pursue the redistricting route if Republican-led states do the same. “We will not stand by as Republicans attempt to rig the election in their favor and choose their voters,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Executive Director Julie Merz said in a statement. “It's increasingly clear that Republicans will do anything to protect their narrow majority because they know they can't win on their disastrous legislative record, which has raised costs and rips away healthcare for millions, all to give the ultra-wealthy a tax break.” Rep. David Valadao could also see more Democratic challengers in his close swing district, while Rep. Darrell Issa's district moves from safe Republican to lean Democratic. The California constitution, however, requires a nonpartisan commission to draw its House seats. Newsom has said he and state lawmakers will put a ballot question to voters in a Nov. 4 special election to suspend that requirement for the next three federal elections. Texas Democratic lawmakers left the state earlier this month to deny Texas Republicans a quorum to vote on a new congressional map that would favor the GOP even more. Texas Republicans ended their special session Friday and called a new one hours later.</p>

President Donald Trump is set to travel to Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday morning to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the first US-Russia summit since former President Joe Biden took office in 2021. Covered by: Caitlin McFall , Morgan Phillips , Peter Pinedo, Alec Schemmel, Greg Norman, Louis Casiano, Efrat Lachter, Ashley Oliver and Chris Pandolfo President Donald Trump flew to Alaska on Friday to meet with President Vladimir Putin in the first US-Russia summit since 2021. The last time the US-Russia participated in a summit was during former President Joe Biden's presidency and before Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine. President Trump said he would like to "see a ceasefire" between Russia and Ukraine and threatened "very severe consequences" for Russia if Putin does not agree to end the war after Friday's meeting. Trump said he hopes to push for a second meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. By subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy. President Donald Trump waves as he boards Air Force One after meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. President Donald Trump said Ukraine could possibly not agree to a deal with Russia because former President Joe Biden “handed out money like it was candy,” referring to the billions of dollars in military aid. And look, Ukraine has agreed to it," Trump told Sean Hannity during a Friday appearance on “Hannity.” "Maybe they'll say no because Biden handed out money like it was candy. And Europe gave them a lot of money. Europe gave them much less, but still a lot. The United States has given Ukraine billions in military aid, weapons and training as Ukrainian forces continue to battle Russian's military. Trump said he believed the deal was close to being agreed upon but that “so many things can happen.” “But I think President Putin would like to solve the problem," he said. "And it was a problem that should have never happened.” President Donald Trump listens during a joint press conference with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. President Donald Trump is declining to reveal the main sticking points between himself and Russian President Vladimir Putin on achieving a conclusive peace deal in Ukraine. Trump met with Putin for almost three hours, saying they both agreed “on a lot of points.” “There's one or two pretty significant items, but I think they can be reached,” Trump told Sean Hannity on “Hannity” from Anchorage, Alaska, where the summit meeting took place. President Donald Trump, right, shakes the hand of Russia's President Vladimir Putin during a joint press conference at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. Russian President Vladimir Putin calls for increased engagement and economic cooperation with the United States During the Alaska summit press conference, Putin was speaking to reporters when he called for both nations to build stronger economic relations, citing opportunities for growth for the Russian economy, in areas such as digital innovation and research and development. He also relayed hope for greater political cooperation with the U.S. following years of fraught relations that escalated after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin said President Donald Trump was right that there would have been no war in 2022 if he were in charge at the time. Trump has long blamed his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, for not doing enough to prevent Russia's invasion of Ukraine. President Donald Trump called the meeting with President Vladimir Putin “extremely productive” but added “there's no deal until there's a deal.” He said he was going to call up NATO allies and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after the joint news conference with Putin and brief them about the inner workings of the meeting. Trump thanked Putin for  coming to Alaska, and Putin suggested their next meeting should be in Moscow.“That's an interesting one. I've always had a fantastic relationship with President Putin.” The footage shows The Beast passing by a row of military fighter jets that appeared to be F-35 Lightning II aircraft, which is primarily constructed by American defense contractor Lockheed Martin. The meeting of the two leaders was also accompanied by a flyover from a B-2 stealth bomber flanked by four F-35 jets, which took place as he deplaned to join the summit at at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Republican Alaska gubernatorial candidate Bernadette Wilson celebrated President Donald Trump as the first president to appreciate Alaska's vast resources and how they will benefit the entire nation as he jets to the Last Frontier State to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is a refreshing change in direction from the Biden administration, which issued more sanctions against Alaska than the country of Iran,” Wilson said in comment provided to Fox News Digital ahead of Trump touching down in the state. “It is time for ‘American Oil on Alaskan Soil',” she said “Now, President Trump and President Putin convene in the state whose purchase from Russia was once referred to as ‘Seward's Folly' - a state that has the ability to fuel our great country through this century and beyond,” Wilson added. “If this is to be the Golden Age of America, then the history books will be filled with stories of American excellence powered by Alaskans' determination. I truly believe America's strength starts with Alaska, and as governor, I look forward to partnering with President Trump, who recognizes this potential.” Wilson, a conservative Anchorage business owner, launched her gubernatorial campaign in May. Speculation swirled before President Donald Trump's meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over territory swaps, which could significantly alter the landscape of Ukraine as all three nations seek an end to the ongoing war ravaging that country. Russia has claimed vast parts of Ukraine since 2014, when it annexed Crimea. Both sides have sustained significant losses, but Moscow has recently made territorial gains. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has rejected ceding any territory to Russia as part of a peace plan. "Ukrainians will not give their land to the occupier," Zelenskyy said on social media last week after Trump announced Friday's meeting. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy has called for an unconditional ceasefire to end the conflict. Chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Ken Martin, took to social media to slam President Donald Trump's "priorities" amid his summit taking place in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Martin posted a photo of Trump's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alongside an image of Putin riding in the president's limo with a smile on his face sitting next to Trump.

As President Donald Trump greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin on the tarmac at Elmendorf Air Force Base, a B-2 stealth bomber flew overhead, flanked by four F-35 jets. Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a strategic U.S. military installation near Anchorage, was chosen for its security, remote location, and symbolic positioning between Russia and the continental United States. Just two months earlier, the stealth aircraft had delivered bunker-buster bombs on Iranian nuclear facilities during coordinated U.S. and Israeli strikes.“Absolutely incredible,” wrote one X user.

Russian troops have made gains inside Ukraine in recent days ahead of Friday's summit meeting in Alaska between U.S. and Russian leaders. Russian forces recently breached Ukrainian lines in the country's industrial heartland of Donetsk. On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Putin wants Ukraine to withdraw from the remaining 30% of the Donetsk region that Kyiv still controls as part of a ceasefire deal. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appears with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz following talks with European and U.S. leaders in Berlin, Germany, Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025. "Recently, weʼve discussed with the U.S. and Europeans what can truly work. Everyone needs a just end to the war.” In the video, the Ukrainian leader said security guarantees are needed to ensure a lasting peace on all sides of the conflict, which has resulted in losses for Ukraine and Russian forces. "Everything will depend on this – the Russians factor in American strength. Not for the first time European leaders are waiting to see what comes from the latest discussion between Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump as the leaders convene in Alaska on Friday. “[There's] absolute distrust in any even the slightest idea that Putin wants peace, because he keeps On annihilating Ukraine,” Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene told Fox News Digital during her trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with Pentagon officials this week. “Even now, when your president has clearly stated that he wants this war to end, and basically provides an opportunity for Putin to talk, still every single day and night, until those talks, he keeps bombing civilians,” she added. Trump has yet to detail how he will respond should his meeting with Putin prove fruitless in advancing a path forward for a ceasefire, though he said on Wednesday there would be “very severe consequences.” One day before his highly anticipated meeting with President Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested he was open to reaching a nuclear deal with the United States. Putin on Thursday praised the United States in televised remarks for making "sincere efforts" to end the three-year war between Russia and Ukraine, according to Reuters. President Donald Trump has renewed calls for a territorial land swap between Russia and Ukraine — a move that could give Moscow control of resource-rich regions in the south and east. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected ceding any occupied territory. David Salvo of the German Marshall Fund told Fox News Digital these areas contain “vast quantities of critical minerals and other key economic assets… like lithium, coal, and gas.” The Institute for the Study of War warned that Russia could exploit rare-earth deposits and sell them to China, undermining a U.S.–Ukraine mineral deal signed in April. Salvo added that occupation of the Black Sea coast restricts Ukrainian exports and grants Moscow offshore gas reserves. Ukraine's agriculture sector, once 11% of GDP, has suffered $80 billion in losses since Russia's invasion. The European Union made their position on President Donald Trump's "land swapping" push clear following a ministerial powwow on Monday, and told Fox News Digital, there should be no "concessions" until Russia agrees to stop its war. "Russia has not agreed to a full and unconditional ceasefire, we should not even discuss any concessions," EU policy chief Kaja Kallas told Fox News Digital in a written statement. "First an unconditional ceasefire with a strong monitoring system and ironclad security guarantees." Trump has said he does not intend to discuss any deals or concessions during his meeting with Putin, despite concerns that arose this week following his comments regarding Ukrainian territory. A senior ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin warned earlier this week that several countries would make “titanic efforts” to disrupt the forthcoming summit Friday between Putin and President Donald Trump in Alaska. The warning came from Kirill Dmitriev, Russia's investment envoy, who said critics could try to sabotage the talks through diplomatic maneuvers or media provocations. "Undoubtedly, a number of countries interested in continuing the conflict will make titanic efforts to disrupt the planned meeting between President Putin and President Trump," Dmitriev, wrote on Telegram on Saturday, referencing the Kremlin's ongoing war in Ukraine. The meeting, at this stage, remains on schedule and is set to take place as part of a bilateral program at 3 p.m. Dmitriev, who is known for his key behind-the-scenes role in diplomacy, has often acted as an informal link between Moscow and Washington. Putin and Gorbachev are vastly different statesmen, and so far Putin has shown no interest in ending his war ambitions, let alone altering the course he has set at home when it comes to the economy and government transparency, experts say. We need to see the results of the meeting," Dan Hoffman, former CIA Moscow station chief, told Fox News Digital. President Donald Trump today will hold a historic summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage, Alaska — the first U.S.-Russia meeting on American soil since June 2021. Zelenskyy continues to insist any peace deal must include Ukraine. Meanwhile, Putin praised Trump's “sincere” and “energetic” efforts toward peace, suggesting the talks could touch on broader topics like economics and arms-control cooperation. Mutual admiration was publicly brewing between Putin and Trump in late 2015 when Trump was running for his first term in office. In December that year, Putin described Trump as being the "absolute leader in the presidential race" and a "very outstanding person, talented, without any doubt." Trump later told supporters at a rally in Ohio that "It is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond." Valentina Pevtsova, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP Alaska was seen as a good in-between place for travel from Moscow and Washington, D.C., though it is notable that Putin opted to meet on U.S. soil rather than a neutral zone like Geneva, which is where Reagan and Gorbachev had their first meeting. "Probably your two choices were go to Russia — which Trump would never do — or invite him here.

A hiker in Japan was found dead on Friday after a brown bear reportedly attacked and dragged him into the bushes.

FILE PHOTO: Bear sightings at Mount Rausu, which is a natural habitat for brown bears, have increased recently. That evening, officials issued a brown bear warning near the trails on Mount Rausu, The Asahi Shimbun reported. On Friday morning, police launched a search and found several items —including a blood-stained shirt, wallet, hat and watch — lying dozens of meters from the trail. Bloodstains were also spotted on nearby trees and on the ground, according to The Asahi Shimbun. Hunters looking for the missing man shot and killed three brown bears on Friday near where his body was discovered, The Asahi Shimbun reported. Sightings of brown bears have recently become more frequent at Mount Rausu, which is a natural habitat for the species. Last month, a string of bear attacks across Japan prompted officials to host practice drills.
