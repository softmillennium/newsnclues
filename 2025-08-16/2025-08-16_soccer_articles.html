                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spain international Aleix Garcia could opt to swap Bayer Leverkusen for West Ham United in the coming weeks. Graham Potter has focused on defence so far this summer, with Jean-Clair Todibo joining permanently from Nice, and El Hadji Malick Diouf landing from Slavia Prague. However, the former Chelsea boss is now looking to bolster his midfield and attack, following the departure of Mohammed Kudus to Tottenham last month. As per reports from TBR Football, Garcia is open to a season-long loan at the London Stadium, after just one year at the BayArena. The 28-year-old racked up nine goal contributions in 2024/25, but he was not viewed as a regular starter by Xabi Alonso, and Erik ten Hag's plans are unconfirmed. If West Ham wanted to push for an immediate transfer, Leverkusen will demand around £17m, but the current indicators are for a loan with a purchase option in 2026. A decisive move is needed from the former Girona schemer as he looks to stay in the frame for Spain's FIFA World Cup squad in 2026 – assuming Luis de la Fuente's team secure qualification in the months ahead. De la Fuente handed the Catalan star his senior debut in 2023, but he was removed from the final squad list for UEFA Euro 2024, before a recall for March's UEFA Nations League double header against the Netherlands. Garcia came off the bench in quarter final second leg, and scored his spot kick in the shootout win over La Oranje, but he was not involved in June's finals. He is on the fringes of De la Fuente's thinking, and his best chance to force a September recall is to be playing regularly, ahead of La Roja's games away in Bulgaria and Turkey next month.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazilian striker Richarlison rolled back the years to the 2022 FIFA World Cup when he scored a bicycle kick for Tottenham against Burnley which was almost identical to the one he had scored against Serbia in Qatar almost 2 and a half years ago. Both the goals were assisted by Mohammed Kudus who was bought from West Ham in the ongoing transfer window. “Thank you for the assists (To Kudus). I'm so happy with this guy – next week he deserves to score because he works so hard for the team. This fan recorded Richarlison's overhead kick vs Burnley and I think we've seen the goal of the season already! It was no meek surrender from Burnley, however, as they managed to get forward and take nearly as many shots as Tottenham, but Scott Parker's side lacked quality in finishing. Richarlison has had a tough time at Tottenham since coming over from Everton in 2022, missing large chunks of his time there due to injury. Since his signing, he has missed 58 matches for Spurs and scored 5 goals in 24 matches last season in all competitions. The season before that he played 31 matches in all competitions and slammed 12 goals. In his debut season for the club, he played 35 matches but could manage only 3 goals.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ticket registration for the 2026 FIFA World Cup is now open! But soccer (or football), for the most part, remained a "niche sport" that many Americans only paid semi-attention to every four years. And in June 2026, 16 cities in Canada, Mexico and the United States will host a record 48 international teams for the FIFA World Cup. Times have changed dramatically since the 1994 World Cup. Today, the sight of a Premier League jersey has become a common one, with fans of teams like Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea growing in number. The recent success of clubs like Manchester City has also fueled a rise in popularity, making Premier League soccer a growing force in the American sports landscape. American fans will likely be able to see world-class players like Kylian Mbappé (France), Erling Haaland (Norway) and Vinicius Jr. (Brazil), as well as legends of the game Lionel Messi (Argentina) and Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), depending on how the final qualifiers for the tournament play out, injuries and potential retirements. Lionel Messi of Argentina celebrates with the World Cup trophy at the end of the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Final match between Argentina and France at Lusail Stadium on December 18, 2022 in Lusail City, Qatar. When the FIFA World Cup 2026 kicks off, it will find a nation with a much deeper connection to the sport. Thanks to NBC-exclusive broadcasting rights bringing the Premier League to American televisions, and streaming services like Peacock and Paramount Plus, fans have unprecedented access to top leagues like the Premier League and Champions League. We've already seen the passion in person, with incredible fan support for both American and international club teams at the FIFA Club World Cup this summer, which saw Chelsea Football Club lift the major silverware at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey after defeating French champions Paris Saint-Germain F.C. As for the World Cup itself, it's a unique and special event. It's important to remember that the famous athletes who will be entering the stadiums are not playing for their club teams, but are instead coming together to play for their national teams after being called up by their national team coach. This allows for a deeper level of national pride. 2025 FIFA Club World Cup at the Lincoln Financial Field, Chelsea v. Palmeiras. Major League Soccer has also grown into something much bigger in recent years, with a strong grassroots foundation for the sport here in the United States. The 2026 World Cup is more than just a tournament; it's an opportunity to show the world how far American soccer has come and how far it has yet to go. With marquee players signing for clubs in the MLS like Lionel Messi, Thierry Henry, David Beckham, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Wayne Rooney and Frank Lampard, the sport has grown more popular each time a global superstar makes their debut on American soil. This, he argued, is a direct contrast to much of the rest of the world where organized soccer is not a commodity as much as it is a community, and young talent can emerge from all economic backgrounds. This is seen by many as a key hurdle for the U.S. to overcome in producing world-class talent. While Major League Soccer may not yet be thought of as a premier destination for the world's best overseas footballers, the league's consistent growth can cultivate and produce world-class talent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I pegged this game as the most interesting to bet on in Week 1 because both Chelsea and Crystal Palace have high hopes coming into this season, but it's hard to envision both London-based teams reaching them. They've won two friendlies since then and seem primed to compete for a top-three spot in the Prem and possibly add a trophy or two along the way. They could compete for other trophies and perhaps a top-six finish in the league. Both teams enter the season feeling quite confident after outstanding finishes to last season and some big wins in the preseason this year. Chelsea is superior and playing at home, which could make all the difference in this one. Let's get into it starting with the odds via FanDuel Sportsbook. Chelsea have Top 3 finish aspirations, but any hope of actually competing for a title will come down to taking care of business against mid-tier teams like Palace. They tied their two matches last year, 1-1 each time, and can ill afford to leave points on the pitch again this season to reach those lofty goals. A Premier League title seems out of reach, yet hope abounds at Stamford Bridge, and playing at home to start is a big boon for a team looking to celebrate its Club World Cup win. However, it's likely too tough an ask to beat two Prem powers in a week, especially on the road in front of a raucous crowd. Enzo Maresca is in his second year as Chelsea's manager and has established the club as a defensive stalwart. Meanwhile, their offense hasn't scored fewer than two goals this preseason. I see a letdown for Palace coming off their surprise win over Liverpool. Create a new FanDuel Sportsbook account, and you can get $300 in bonus bets if you win your first $5 wager.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Board are not demanding a Premier League win but silencing talk will be impossible if Club World Cup winners make fast start But there is no chance of life at Stamford Bridge slowing down. A compressed pre-season, limited to friendlies against Bayer Leverkusen and Milan last weekend, may pose complications for Enzo Maresca in the long run. Chelsea had a lucrative time in the US, earning an estimated £85m in prize money, but the riches on offer from Fifa's expanded tournament come with potential costs. The unknown is how last season, stretching until 13 July, will affect Maresca's players. They looked ready to go during convincing wins in the pair of friendlies, which suggests there will be no lethargy when they open their Premier League campaign with a testing home game against Crystal Palace on Sunday, but one theory is problems will come when the Champions League begins, the fixtures pile up and Christmas approaches There has already been one setback, the loss of Levi Colwill to an anterior cruciate ligament injury leaving a sizeable hole at the back. Chelsea do not intend to panic and sign a defender for the sake of it, despite Maresca saying on Friday he wanted a replacement for Colwill. “I spoke with Levi and told him that if we achieved what we achieved last year it is also because of him.” It speaks volumes that Colwill was the one constant presence in central defence. Trevoh Chalobah, back in favour after being loaned to Palace at the start of last season, was outstanding against PSG. Wesley Fofana, who was first choice next to Colwill before breaking down last December, will be vital if he can stay fit. There is also a potential solution in Jorrel Hato, even if the new arrival from Ajax has been signed initially to compete with Marc Cucurella at left-back. Jamie Gittens has replaced Jadon Sancho on the left and Estêvão Willian, a prodigious Brazilian talent who shone for Palmeiras during the Club World Cup, offered exciting glimpses against Leverkusen and Milan. He is the team's undoubted star, the key difference-maker, although it is important Chelsea are not reliant on one individual. There is consistent praise for the youth-driven strategy implemented by the recruitment team of Paul Winstanley, Laurence Stewart, Sam Jewell and Joe Shields. The quartet have faced external criticism but were handed contract extensions this week. It is hard for anyone to argue that Chelsea, who also won the Conference League last season, are not on the right track after seeing how Maresca outdid Luis Enrique's PSG. Two years after they finished 12th, a proper title challenge does not feel unrealistic. There is a wariness about anyone involved in the project getting carried away. Chelsea are a young team and came close to missing out on Champions League qualification last season. Dips are to be expected and Robert Sánchez's recent improvement has not fully allayed doubts over whether he is a title-winning goalkeeper. They want mid-season managerial changes to be a thing of the past. They are not going to overreact if fatigue hits after Champions League games or during the festive period. The trading can look ruthless but the model of handing out heavily incentivised deals has made it easier to move unwanted players. Noni Madueke has gone to Arsenal for an initial £48m. There were no issues shipping João Félix to Saudi Arabia. A bigger challenge is finding buyers for Raheem Sterling and Christopher Nkunku, both of whom were signed on big wages before Chelsea shifted their contract policy. Further incomings depend on more sales, with Ben Chilwell and Carney Chukwuemeka also hoping for fresh starts. Chelsea want to strengthen in the final third by signing Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho and RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons but being fined by Uefa for breaching financial fair play rules heightens the need to raise money, which will most likely come through selling Nkunku, Nicolas Jackson and Tyrique George. It will be busy before the window shuts. Maresca tried to play down their chances last season, saying they were not ready to challenge Liverpool and Arsenal, but silencing the title talk will be impossible if they hit the ground running this time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To anyone who remembers World Cup 2010, the Jabulani football was, by common consent, a major factor in contributing to an underwhelming tournament in South Africa. Its unusual construction, featuring fewer panels than any ball before or since, meant a lack of ‘drag', so the ball didn't decelerate properly, and moved unpredictably late. It had long been a cliche for goalkeepers to complain about a new tournament ball, but in 2010 outfielders were appalled too. “The guy who designed this ball never played football,” he said. Yet if you spot the Jabulani mentioned 15 years on, it's often in positive, fond terms. As for ‘goals being scored from everywhere': there were the same number of goals scored from outside the box in 2010, 26, as at World Cup 2006. This about-turn is presumably not because people have reconsidered what they want from a football. It's because they've spent 15 years seeing the same three goals again: Giovanni van Bronkhorst's top corner strike against Uruguay, Keisuke Honda's swerving free kick against Denmark, and one of two Diego Forlan free kicks. Rose-tinted spectacles are nothing new, particularly when it comes to sport. A common pattern is that everyone's favourite World Cup is generally the first they experienced, which might explain why World Cup 2010 seems popular with people who are probably now in their mid-twenties. But football coverage — and, let's be honest, the wider world — still hasn't quite got to grips with how easily-accessible bitesize clips of the past have warped our perception of the present. We are living in an age of turbo-nostalgia. It is simpler than ever, for example, to create a playlist that demonstrates why your favourite year of music (bonus points if this was the same year as your favourite World Cup) was so great. What once involved buying and assembling various records, cassettes or CDs and manually recording the music can be performed on Spotify in a couple of minutes. And if you subsequently click on the ‘best new music' playlist, it just won't be as good. Because, obviously, you're comparing one random week to your favourite-ever year. Whenever up-and-coming footballers are asked for their favourite all-time player, the most common answers are Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but an intriguing number select Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane, even if they were born after those players retired. And their best bits are better, in part because they have a whole career to select from. Ronaldo and Zidane have become so adored based upon, say, that goal against Compostela or that Champions League winner against Bayer Leverkusen — and various compilations — that there's actually no rational analysis about their careers. People think you've some kind of vendetta if you point out that Ronaldo only won one league title in Europe and never got close to winning the European Cup, or recall that Zidane had a disastrous 18-month period between winning World Cup 1998 and Euro 2000 when he looked completely bereft of confidence, and both Juventus and Real Madrid improved when he left. But if we speak about, say, Kylian Mbappe in those terms, it's only applying the current standard of scrutiny to the past. So, George Weah's goal for Milan versus Verona in 1996 was brilliant, and yes, he won that year's Ballon d'Or, but he also only scored seven goals that calendar year. Yes, that scary bloke Duncan Ferguson (who the commentators insist Everton ‘could do with out there today!') But almost any retrospective coverage of anything in football — particularly, it must be said, from the 1990s — is so overwhelmingly positive to the point of delusion. “When you watch football in the Premier League or other top divisions, it's so robotic,” said David McGoldrick, briefly an enigmatic Premier League forward for Sheffield United, now at Barnsley in League One. “In my day, there was Ronaldinho, Paul Gascoigne and those kinds of players who were great to watch.” But those two players' careers barely overlapped. They were considered special cases even at the time. And the current era does have, for example, Lamine Yamal. The current vibe amongst football fans is not solely typical nostalgia felt solely by middle-aged people, but an intense level of anemoia — as American writer John Koenig has termed it — essentially, false nostalgia for a time you can't recall. Even teenagers insist they're ‘against modern football', and think ‘the game has gone', which could conceivably be because modern football truly is rubbish, and the game has actually gone. All this would basically be fine, and completely unworthy of any comment, if it wasn't compromising people's enjoyment of what's actually happening in their own time. The reaction to Euro 2024 — a perfectly good competition that produced some excellent games and best major tournament winner for well over a decade — was strange. “One of the poorest tournaments we've seen in a long time,” claimed former Sky Sports presenter Richard Keys. But it was surely better than both Euro 2020, which was compromised by geography, Covid-19 and a lack of convincing sides, and Euro 2016, a tournament which never really took off. Again, people were presumably comparing watching 120 minutes of a flat game to a couple of standout, YouTube-aided memories from otherwise dull tournaments. Away from football, this has more serious ramifications. That was, in itself, funny but not surprising — everyone enjoyed being young. A more interesting side story was that people in their twenties were more likely than older generations to point to periods before they were born as the best time to have lived, which surely results in flawed perceptions of the current day. Comparatively, the ‘make football great again' vibe is mostly harmless.</p>
