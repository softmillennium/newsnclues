                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the Terminal Classic, limestone Maya cities in the south were abandoned and dynasties were ended, as one of the ancient world's great civilizations shifted north and lost much of its political and economic power. This climate data aligns with existing historical and archaeological evidence: construction of monuments and political activity at several major northern Maya sites, including the famous city of Chichén Itzá, stopped at different times during this period of climate stress. “This period in Maya history has been a cause of fascination for centuries,” said lead author Dr Daniel H. James, who conducted the research while a PhD student at Cambridge's Department of Earth Sciences. Earlier research has measured the oxygen isotopes contained in lake sediment to determine the severity of drought, but lake sediment does not contain enough detail to pinpoint climate conditions in any given year at a particular site. “It hasn't been possible to directly compare the history of individual Maya sites with what we previously knew about the climate record,” said James, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at University College London (UCL). “Lake sediment is great when you want to look at the big picture, but stalagmites allow us to access the fine-grained detail that we've been missing.” Earlier research on stalagmites has determined annual average rainfall amounts during the Terminal Classic, but the Cambridge-led team have now been able to go further, and isolate information from individual wet and dry seasons, thanks to relatively thick (about 1mm) annual layers in the stalagmite used in this study. The specific oxygen isotopes in each layer are a proxy for wet season drought. “Knowing the annual average rainfall doesn't tell you as much as knowing what each individual wet season was like,” said James. “Being able to isolate the wet season allows us to accurately track the duration of wet season drought, which is what determines if crops succeed or fail.” According to the information contained in the stalagmite, there were eight wet season droughts lasting for at least three years between 871 and 1021 CE. In the periods of prolonged and severe drought, date inscription at sites such as Chichén Itzá stopped entirely. “This doesn't necessarily mean that the Maya abandoned Chichén Itzá during these periods of severe drought, but it's likely that they had more immediate things to worry about than constructing monuments, such as whether the crops they relied on would succeed or not,” said James. “In addition to what stalagmites can tell us about this period in Maya history, they might also be able to tell us about the frequency and severity of tropical storms, for instance,” said James. “As a case study for fine-grained comparisons between climate and historical data, it's exciting being able to apply methods usually associated with the deeper past to relatively recent history.” Note: Content may be edited for style and length.
