                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Play was curtailed early with the main court flooded as torrential rain lashed down, but thankfully, there has been no such disruption since. In the men's draw, Jannik Sinner will face qualifier Terence Atmane in his semi-final today before Carlos Alcaraz faces Alexander Zverev. The women's singles is wide open though after world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka was knocked out by Elena Rybakina, and Coco Gauff is also out after defeat to Jasmine Paolini. Elsewhere, Emma Raducanu is ramping up her preparation ahead of the US Open. It took longer than most were expecting, but Jannik Sinner gets the first set after a tiebreak. Terence Atmane is set for a clash against Jannik Sinner at the Cincinnati Open. "Being here in the semi-finals of a Masters 1000, breaking into the Top 100 and even more with the win tonight - it's also a lot of money for me, so it's going to be very helpful for my career. Not a bad way to meet your heroes... Tennis fans are filming messages to their favorite players in Cincinnati\u2026\u2026or so they thought. The Spanish ace has lost more times than he's won against Alexander Zverev. Barbie has unveiled a Venus Williams doll as part of its Inspiring Women collection. The news comes after she confirmed her entry for this year's US Open. Here's how the news was announced on social media... British No.1 Jack Draper has re-paired with Jessica Pegula for the revamped US Open mixed doubles tournament. Paula Badosa pulled out this week, leaving Draper without a partner. Tennis courts in Warwickshire have reopened following a near £75,000 refurbishment. Rugby Borough Council has confirmed the facilities at Caldecott Park now boast have new hard court surfaces, net posts, nets, security gates and fencing. Coco Gauff perspective\u201cSometimes tennis fans want us to win like every week. It\u2019s not that easy, so its completely normal for a player to have a good 3-4 weeks, then maybe a not so good 3-4 weeks just bcuz the way our season is built\u201d\ud83c\udfa5: WTA, DAZN pic.twitter.com/hHJU3lKiSr Carlos Alcaraz has admitted he lost concentration before overcoming Andrey Rublev 6-3 4-6 7-5 to make the semi-finals in Cincinnati. “I maintained positive thoughts all the time, even though I lost focus a few times during the second set,” he said. “Playing someone like Andrey, when you lose focus on two or three points, it can cost you the set or almost the match. Alexander Zverev has admitted to not feeling fully fit ahead of his semi-final with Carlos Alcaraz. After beating Ben Shelton, the star admitted: "Right now I'm not feeling too great, we'll see I have a day to get fresh and to hopefully feel 100% again. "I'm not sure what happened, I came out today and probably felt the best I did in a few months, but dnd of the first set started feeling not so great and got progressively worse." American influencer Costeen Hatzi has said she was fully supportive of partner Nick Kyrgios before their split in 2024. Refusing to criticise her ex, she added: “I was happy to, because I loved him and we had a great relationship at the time. We still had a beautiful relationship, even though things didn't turn out the way I'd hoped. I don't wish bad upon him at all.” Emma Raducanu has hit back over criticism of her constant coaching changes. Speaking ahead of the US Open, she said: “I'm a lot more clear on what I do and don't like. "The experiences that I've had with different coaches, people love to say I've had so many different coaches but if I went into the details of a lot of them, people wouldn't say the same thing. Just a day after being backed by Lindsey Davenport, Ben Shelton became the last American player to fall at the Cincinnati Open overnight. Favourite Aryna Sabalenka was stunned 1-6 4-6 by Elena Rybakina, before Gauff lost Jasmine Paolini. Here's the moment that Sabelanka was dumped out... Danielle Collins has announced that she will end her season after the US Open. 57 said she was preparing for her last tournament of the year. Collins was set to retire at the end of 2024, but changed her mind in October as she bravely opened up on her fertility journey. The American played on this year, and it's not known what her plans are for 2026. Veronika Kudermetova is through to the semi-finals in Cincinnati, where she will face either Coco Gauff or Jasmine Paolini. The former top-10 star, who currently sits at No. Carlos Alcaraz is through to the Cincinnati Open semi-final after beating Andrey Rublev 6-3 4-6 7-5. When Rublev served to stay in the match while trailing 5-6, he double-faulted on match point, gifting Alcaraz the victory. 2 had a huge reaction, roaring and pumping his fists multiple times. Alcaraz will face either Ben Shelton or Alexander Zverev on Saturday. Jannik Sinner was set to join forces with Emma Navarro at the revamped US Open mixed doubles event next week. The Abierto GNP Seguros runs from August 16 to 23. The US Open mixed doubles matches will be played on August 19 and 20. The Spaniard held for 1-0 to start the third set when play was paused as chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani noticed a spectator struggling. Lahyani rushed over with water and an umbrella, and Alcaraz watched on until the fan eventually left the stands. Carlos Alcaraz's quarter-final clash with Andrey Rublev has gone to a third and final set. 9 seed has just pagged him back, winning the second set 6-4. Coco Gauff recently revealed that she had been forced to delete X (formerly known as Twitter) because she became obsessed with following Love Island USA on the app. Now, two years have passed, and I've never read anything on that social network again," the recent Canadian Open champion told Tennis Channel. "I prefer to watch the highlights of certain matches. At the moment, I watch a lot of the tennis matches I used to watch, whether it's from the tournament I'm playing in or even from a Challenger tournament that's happening that week. I have a team that helps me keep my feet on the ground." Andrey Rublev is currently trailing Carlos Alcaraz by a break in the opening set of their quarter-final. 9 seed isn't happy with some of the automated technology - even if he doesn't realise some of it is automated. Rublev confronted chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani and claimed the shot clock was being started too soon, only to be told that it automatically started three seconds after the last point was called. Then, he was shown a replay of an electronic line call he didn't agree with, and thought the wrong ball may have been shown. 1 was drinking from a plastic San Pellegrino bottle when the official said: "Aryna can I just ask you to take [the label] off that bottle? It comes just a couple of days after Carlos Alcaraz became frustrated when an umpire told him off for drinking from reusable branded Evian bottles. "It's not my fault," the Spaniard repeatedly stated. Last year's Cincinnati Open champion, Aryna Sabalenka, has been ousted in the quarter-final. Elena Rybakina has taken out the top seed 6-1 6-4, ending Sabalenka's title defence. British doubles stars Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash have extended their incredible winning streak in Cincinnati. They've now won 22 matches and counting after beating No. 6 seed Andrea Vavassori and Simone Bolelli in the quarter-finals. Dubbed 'Cashpool', they have not lost a match since the Libema Open final in June. Elena Rybakina is off to a flying start in her Cincinnati Open quarter-final against world No. Rybakina suffered a brutal defeat to Sabalenka in Berlin a few weeks ago, blowing four match points to go out in the quarter-finals. “There's no secret, I just drink,” she said, before eyeing the camera and adding: “But water!” Iga Swiatek is through to her third straight semi-final at the Cincinnati Open after beating Anna Kalinskaya 6-3 6-4. Their match is up next on the centre court. Terence Atmane has enjoyed a breakthrough week in Cincinnati, coming through qualifying and making it all the way to tomorrow's semi-final, where he takes on Jannik Sinner. The French qualifier has already beaten 15th seed Flavio Cobolli, teenage sensation Joao Fonseca, and top-10 stars Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune on his way to the last four. 136 in the world, Atmane is set to bank at least £245k in prize money and will make his top 100 debut when the tournament is over. But he still has no clothing or shoe sponsor after being dropped by Asics last year. I buy my clothes and shoes like everyone else. Anna Kalinskaya sparked concerns when she called the physio and received a medical time-out minutes into her Cincinnati Open quarter-final clash with Iga Swiatek. She has decided to play on and got broken. Terence Atmane is on the run of his life in Cincinnati. 136 qualifier is into the semi-finals after beating two top-10 players, including Holger Rune. "I have known you Terence since juniors, tennis is a tough journey and I am happy for your run here at @CincyTennis and what it will mean in the future for you . Play is getting underway at the Cincinnati Open, with No. 3 seed and recent Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek facing Anna Kalinskaya for a spot in the semi-finals. Kalinskaya hit out at the WTA when their quarter-final was scheduled first on Friday at 11am local time, after her last match started on Wednesdan night and finished in the early hours on Thursday, and she didn't get to bed until 4am. “How can the WTA and tournament expect athletes to perform their best when the scheduling is unfair?” she wrote in an Instagram story. “After my match against Alexandrova, I got home from the site at 2:40 am and didn't go to bed until 4 am. “Then I get scheduled at 11 am for tomorrow's match—how does the tournament and WTA expect me to recover and continuously adjust my sleep pattern, which is one of the most important aspects of recovery? Emma Raducanu made a statement at Wimbledon last month, where she put up an impressive fight during a tight loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the third round. After she said they were just friends, fellow British player Cameron Norrie - who is in a long-term relationship - was asked whether he was seeing Raducanu. The International Tennis Integrity Agency have confirmed that Japanese star Kaili Demi Teso has been suspended for 10 months following a doping violation.The 19-year-old Teso tested positive for the prohibited substance methylephedrine, atributed to a bottle of cough medicine. Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle has claimed the 'Royal Box' jibe from Andre Agassi live on air this summer was blown out of proportion. "We had a laugh, and they took it out of context," he told Betway. "Afterwards, Andre sent me a text, saying what an unbelievable time he'd had, how he enjoyed it, and we were going to have him for the final but then he went into the Royal Box instead. "But then you read that he was saying, oh, ‘just concentrate on the tennis'." Andre Agassi pretty much annoyed by Andrew Castle and his obsession with celebrities in the Royal Box. Andre is right, it's tennis that they came to concentrate on. Lindsey Davenport has backed Ben Shelton to win the US Open. Davenport, who won three Slam crowns in an illustrious career, said on the Tennis Channel: "Ben Shelton has that type of game where he can take the racket out of his opponent's hand. If you get on a roll in New York, if he can play that high level tennis and have the crowd behind him, we could have an American male Grand Slam champion here pretty soon." Andrey Rublev had received a significant boost ahead of the US Open this month. Safin won't be able to join him in Ohio, but will be in New York to guide him for Flushing Meadows this month. Having sacked Ferrer following his doping controversy, Sinner said:"It was a different situation. "We worked together for about two years before this break. His work has brought me a lot of benefits. Roger Federer has learnt who he will share a court with for his celebrity doubles match in Shanghai on October 10. It's been confirmed that he'll partner with one of two actors, Hong Kong film star Donnie Yen or Chinese TV personality Wu Lei, to play against ex-professional female Zheng Jie. The US Open mixed doubles partnership between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz appears in doubt due to the Cincinnati Open schedule. Alcaraz is into the last eight, and if he makes Monday's final, he will play just 20 hours before the revamped tournament gets underway. Having taken a break after Wimbledon, citing fatigue, former British player Barry Fulcher has speculated Alcaraz could now follow Coco Gauff in skipping the team event. French qualifier Terence Atmane continued his sensational run at the ATP Cincinnati Masters last night by stunning seventh-seeded Holger Rune 6-2, 6-3. The world No.136 now in his Masters 1000 semi-final where he'll face defending champion Jannik Sinner. "I was just trying to be myself on the court." Alexander Zverev has admitted he got professional help following his first round exit at Wimbledon this summer. "I took a longer period of time off after Wimbledon, which I haven't done in a very long time," he said. I didn't train, I didn't do any physical work, I didn't play tennis for a longer time as well which was the best thing for me to do. I enjoyed my time, mentally freed up, got also some professional help as well there. Anna Kalinskaya has accused the WTA of being 'biased' against her due to the scheduling of her upcoming match against Iga Swiatek. On her Instagram story, she wrote: "How does the WTA and the tournament expect their players to play well with these unfair schedules? "After my match against Alexandrova, I went home at 2:40am and didn't go to bed until 4:00am. "I slept a little and came back to train today. Then they scheduled my match tomorrow [against Swiatek] at 11:00am. Jannik Sinner is through to the semi-finals in Cincinnati after securing a dominant win over Felix Auger-Aliassime. She has booked her place in the last eight with a thumping win over former Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova. Paolini was in full control throughout and sailed to a comprehensive 6-1 6-2 victory. Emma Raducanu will not be seeded for the US Open, it has been confirmed. It means Raducanu could face a top player in the very first round at Flushing Meadows. She will face either seventh seed Jasmine Paolini or former Wimbledon winner Barbora Krejcikova in the next round. Patrick Mouratoglou is convinced that Victoria Mboko will win Grand Slam titles over the course of her career. Reflecting on her incredible Canadian Open triumph, he said: "She plays to win no matter who is on the other side of the court. It will be distributed to players based on their performance at the nine ATP 1000 tournaments. ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: "This is exactly what profit sharing was designed to do, ensure that players and tournaments share equally in the sport's financial upside. For us, it's proof that strengthening the premium product and aligning interests creates value. "We're proud to be strengthening our partnership and building a stronger, more sustainable ATP Tour." Matteo Berrettini has pulled out of the US Open due to an injury. However, he remains unable to compete and has withdrawn from the event. Aryna Sabalenka has admitted to regularly cheating on her diet. It can be a lot of different things in one day because you know, like if it's a cheat meal, you got to go full. Top seeds Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are odds-on to win the US Open. AceOdds: 2025 US Open men's winner: Jannik Sinner Evens; Carlos Alcaraz 2/1; Novak Djokovic 16/1; Taylor Fritz, Alexander Zverev 25/1; Jack Draper 28/1; Ben Shelton 33/1; Daniil Medvedev 50/1. Women's winner: Aryna Sabalenka 5/2; Iga Swiatek 7/2; Coco Gauff 7/1; Mirra Andreeva 12/1; Elena Rybakina 14/1 Naomi Osaka 20/1; Madison Keys 22/1; Amanda Anisimova 25/1; Jessica Pegula, Emma Raducanu, Victoria Mboko 33/1; Jasmine Paolini, Clara Tauson 50/1. Jannik Sinner has learnt he won't be eligible to receive money from the ATP Masters Bonus Pool this season. Last month he opted to withdraw from the Toronto Masters, citing fatigue and regardless of his final position, won't be eligible for any additional money. Emma Raducanu has sent a warning to rivals ahead of the US Open this month. After struggling since her remarkable 2021 win, she's said: "I went home and came back and it was a really difficult time in New York. "Since I won the tournament, it's not been easy for me there. The world No.1 has opted not to look for a replacement after her original partner, Grigor Dimitrov, pulled out. It follows him injuring his pectoral muscle at Wimbledon when leading against Jannik Sinner. There have been contrasting reactions to Venus Williams being handed a wildcard for the US Open at 45. On social media, many fans have argued it is a 'waste' of an entry. Anna Kalinskaya complained about 'drunk' fans during her fourth-round match against Ekaterina Alexandrova at the Cincinnati Open. Anna Kalinskaya on some disruptive people in the crowd during her match against Alexandrova in CincinnatiAnna: \u201cI think maybe they\u2019re drunk or something\u2026\u201dUmpire: \u201cThey probably are\u201d \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/tFut5VIfWw It feels like we're in an oven, even for the fans," said Auger-Aliassime. "We're always on the move and focused on trying to win, but the crowd is sitting for a long time, and so are our coaches. Carlos Alcaraz is at risk of being fined after ignoring the umpire's instructions to cover the logo on his water bottle. During his win over Luca Nardi, the Spaniard reacted angrily after official Greg Allensworth gave the order, arguing it went against tournament sponsor deals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Zverev has revealed he received “professional help” having opened up about his mental state following his defeat at Wimbledon last month. After suffering a tough five-set loss to Arthur Rinderknech in the opening round at Wimbledon, Zverev revealed he had been struggling mentally since his defeat in the Australian Open final in January. “I feel very alone out there at times. I feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice.” I think Arthur deserved to win today. I don't have the answers right now.” Asked if he would consider seeking help from a therapist, Zverev said: “Maybe for the first time in my life I'll probably need it. Alexander Zverev's brother gives harsh reaction to his alarming Wimbledon comments Alexander Zverev reveals he is ‘not a huge fan' of one key Cincinnati Open change During the Cincinnati Masters, Zverev spoke about the benefits he is experiencing as a result of spending time away from tennis after Wimbledon. “I took a longer period of time off after Wimbledon, which I haven't done in a very long time, which was very needed,” said the 28-year-old. “I didn't train, I didn't do any physical work, I didn't play tennis for a longer time as well, which was the best thing for me to do. “And I enjoyed my time, mentally freed up, got also some professional help as well there. Zverev received advice from both Rafael Nadal — and the tennis great's uncle and former coach Toni Nadal — when training at his academy in Mallorca after Wimbledon. The German returned to action in Toronto and reached the semi-finals — and he has also progressed to the last four in Cincinnati, where he will face Carlos Alcaraz.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unless you're a tennis die-hard, you probably didn't know much about Terence Atmane before this week. Atmane has had plenty of success on the Challenger Tour, but it hadn't translated to the big leagues — until now. We've seen qualifiers make runs at big-ticket events in the past, but few have had to navigate the path that Atmane has to get to the final four. 22 Flavio Cobolli in the Round of 64, upset rising star Joao Fonseca in his next match and then took care of Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune, two top-10 players, to set up a date with Jannik Sinner on Saturday. Sinner, as usual, has been imperious in Cincinnati. That's an average of 2.75 games lost per set. Atmane is a 10/1 underdog against Sinner, but he's just pulled two massive upsets to get to this point, so he'll be brimming with confidence and playing with house money. It also wouldn't be a shock if it takes Sinner a handful of games to get used to Atmane's peculiar serve and his all-out attacking style. Michael Leboff is a long-suffering Islanders fan, but a long-profiting sports bettor with 10 years of experience in the gambling industry. He loves using game theory to help punters win bracket pools, find long shots, and learn how to beat the market in mainstream and niche sports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When it was first announced that American tennis star Emma Navarro would play with world No. 1 Jannik Sinner at the reimagined Mixed Doubles event at the U.S. Open, Navarro joked that she “would try to get a better partner next year.” “He was begging me to play, he was saying, ‘I heard about your volleys and your doubles skills. please play with me,” Navarro cracked last month on Tennis Channel. You're not the best player, but I'll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year.

Navarro is coming off losing early on hardcourts in Montreal and Cincinnati, and playing in Mexico will give her more practice matches heading into the U.S. Open, where she reached the semifinals a year ago. EMMA NAVARO #11 del mundo se suma al cuadro principal del #AbiertoGNPSeguros 2025 🤩🎾¡No te la puedes perder! According to the USTA, Sinner has until 2 p.m. on Sunday to find a new partner for the U.S. Open. Navarro, who made headlines at Wimbledon when a group of Knicks-clad fans attended her matches to support her, isn't the only big-name female star skipping the new Mixed Doubles event. 2 Coco Gauff said she didn't “want to waste mental energy” on the event, while No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and her partner Grigor Dimitrov are out after Dimitrov sustained a pectoral injury at Wimbledon. As for Navarro, good luck finding a “better partner” than the world No. Please consider supporting us with a subscription.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Alcaraz has won two of their last three matches, it is the German who leads the head-to-head, having won six of their matches so far. Before we delve into match tactics, it is essential to understand some context about this rivalry, which is also the only head-to-head in tennis where Alcaraz trails, having played more than 8 matches. Both players have benefited in victories during the course of this head-to-head when the opponent was either not what he would become one day (Zverev two matches against Alcaraz in 2021) or a tired and overplayed opponent (Alcaraz two matches against Zverev, one at the US Open in 2023, the other at Madrid 2022). Every match played on faster conditions has been won by the German, while every match played on slower, more importantly, higher-bouncing surfaces has been won by Alcaraz, with Roland Garros 2022 being an exception. This match will be on a 43 Court pace index fast surface that, unlike the other fast surface matches these two have played, has good bounce on it. So, it is a surface that I would still say favours the German in this match-up, but it provides a window of opportunity to Alcaraz that other fast surfaces don't. What has been one of the most important aspects of this match-up to me is who wins the second-serve battle. Naturally, factors such as first-serve landed percentage set this stat up, but this is still an important trend and a place where, if Alcaraz wants to win this upcoming match, he will need to be smarter. Well, because the German has a distinct pattern for his serves. Firstly, he has one of the best serves in the game, and on top of that, he makes around 70% of his first serves, a truly remarkable rate given how good his serve is. Alcaraz, on the other hand, has a good (better for his height) first serve but a suspect second delivery, especially against elite backhand counterpunchers. His most reliable second serve is still the kicker out wide, which Zverev, due to his long frame, can neutralise for stretches, especially given how the “kick” won't be as high as it is on a clay court. This poses an interesting adjustment for the Spaniard, where he will likely have to trust serves in his arsenal, which he normally does not. And being at a disadvantage in the serve department, he will have to make up for it on return, where he is, in theory, clearly superior to the German. He has two options: stick near the baseline and rob Zverev of time, a return position that is better for his backhand return, or stand back and give his forehand time to load up and return the majority of the serves. Alcaraz's return performance so far this tournament illustrates the challenge. He has won 36.1% of first-serve return points and 52.8% of second-serve return points, and these numbers have come against non-elite servers. In the rallies, they will both aim for as many cross exchanges with their weapon as possible, and whoever wins this battle will increase their chances to win. He will have to do the opposite in this match-up. Zverev's long frame means he isn't as troubled by the high balls to his backhand as other players are, while his suspect forehand technique also does well against flat pace, often counterpunching it. The key in this match-up will be to go high to his forehand, disturbing the contact points and bringing the elongated swing into play, while going low or flat into his backhand, as post-ankle injury he hasn't been as reliable there as before it. It goes without saying that Alcaraz gets the edge here. He is the more accomplished player, has played way bigger matches just this year, and, let's face it, this is a setting and a tournament where he isn't the heavy favourite as he would be at say Roland Garros or Wimbledon, which surely eases some pressure. Zverev, on the other hand, is known for tightening up at important moments, having a rough season by his own admission, and despite what the odds say, will believe this is a match he should win if he is to compete at New York. Either player has a genuine chance to win this match witht the German leads their head-to-head record 5–2 on hard courts, and one of his losses came at Indian Wells, where the conditions are quite different from Cincinnati. Despite tactics and other factors, he is an better player overall than the German, and that gap has only widened this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sinner dominated in the quarterfinals against Felix-Auger-Aliassime, who managed to win just two games. His relentless baseline game, coupled with improved net play, is a recipe for success. Terence Atmane is playing the tennis of his life and has upset two top-10 players back-to-back. He has demonstrated his talent, but facing Sinner will be a step up that he probably isn't quite ready for. Sinner does everything better and won't give anything away cheaply. Carlos Alcaraz is in his second Cincinnati Open final, as he did just enough to get past Andrey Rublev in the quarterfinal. He will need to bring a better level to beat one of his toughest opponents in the form of Alexander Zverev, who cruised past Toronto champion Ben Shelton in the quarterfinals. The match was of low quality, as both Zverev and Shelton struggled physically. He is in his fourth semifinal here and will hope to be physically ready for the challenge against Alcaraz. The German has played some of his best tennis against Alcaraz in the past, and will be confident to do that again. If Zverev serves at his best, it will be difficult for the Spaniard to stop him. Zverev might just have the edge here in what promises to be a fiercely contested match.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British No 1 Jack Draper has re-paired with Jessica Pegula for the reimagined US Open mixed doubles tournament after Paula Badosa pulled out, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka also withdrew. Jannik Sinner, who along with Sabalenka will defend their singles crowns at Flushing Meadows from Sunday, August 24 - live on Sky Sports - is currently without a mixed doubles partner after Emma Navarro instead signed up to play in the US Open warm-up event in Monterrey. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Sabalenka was originally due to compete alongside the injured Grigor Dimitrov and has opted not to re-pair with an alternative men's play. The mixed doubles championship will take place on August 19 and 20, with a reduced format of first-to-four-game sets and no-ad scoring, while there is $1m (£750,000) in prize money at stake for the winners. The top eight teams with the best combined singles ranking - which includes Draper and Pegula - qualify directly, with eight further teams given wild card spots. US Open: Schedule and how to watch on Sky Sports Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz have been confirmed as wild card entries, as have 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and his partner Olga Danilovic, while 45-year-old great Venus Williams will compete with Reilly Opelka. Two final wild card pairings are yet to be announced, with Britain's Katie Boulter and fiance Alex de Minaur - ranked 50th and eighth in the world, respectively - hopeful of claiming one of the available spots.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Rybakina continued to produce the strong form that saw her reach the semi-finals in Montreal last week before she was beaten by shock winner Victoria Mboko.

Kalinskaya showed resilience to survive four match points in a remarkable penultimate game of the match, but Swiatek kept her composure to take the next opportunity moments later. A win for Swiatek on Sunday would put the former world No 1 through to her first WTA 1000 final in 15 months and seal her place at the season-ending WTA Finals for a fifth straight year. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Alcaraz took the first set but Rublev fought back to even things up in the second set and it finally looked like Alcaraz would seal victory when he broke Rublev to go 5-3 up, but his opponent broke straight back to put the contest back on serve. The 22-year-old hit 11 aces on his way to victory and remains on course for another final showdown with world No 1 Jannik Sinner, who faces French qualifier Terence Atmane in the last four. Alcaraz will first need to overcome third seed Alexander Zverev in his semi-final, after the German romped to a 6-2 6-2 win over last week's champion in Toronto, Ben Shelton. Zverev's biggest concern of the night was his own health.</p>

On Friday, that summer feeling came at night. During the Coco Gauff-Jasmine Paolini quarterfinal, a series of slow-paced pops could be heard coming from the other side of Route 71. Two of their most popular players, Ben Shelton and Coco Gauff, took hard defeats. Here's a look at how those matches, and Carlos Alcaraz's earlier win, played out on the stadium court. Two of their most popular players, Ben Shelton and Coco Gauff, took hard defeats. Here's a look at how those matches, and Carlos Alcaraz's earlier win, played out on the stadium court. Andrey Rublev looked ready and revved from the start. He has hit something of a ceiling in 2025, where he's no longer going deeper at the majors or higher in the rankings. At Wimbledon last month, he lost in four fairly tough sets to Carlos Alcaraz. On Friday, he seemed like he really wanted a breakthrough against a player of the Spaniard's standing.Early on, that energy came out as it often does for the Russian—in a fit of rage, this time directed at chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani, about the serve clock.

Down a set, Rublev came back to win the second. Down 3-5 in the third, he broke to stay alive.© Anita T. Aguilar The moment I'll remember most was Rublev giving it absolutely everything, red hair flying and blue eyes wide, to track down an Alcaraz lob and loft back one of his own, over his shoulder. Down a set, Rublev came back to win the second. Down 3-5 in the third, he broke to stay alive. Down 5-6, he played a perfect serve-forehand combination to reach 40-30, one point from a tiebreaker.And then, out of nowhere, he fell apart. Both hit 27 winners and nearly won the same number of points. Down a set, Rublev came back to win the second. Down 3-5 in the third, he broke to stay alive.

And then, out of nowhere, he fell apart. “Today I maintain the positive thoughts,” Alcaraz said. “I'm playing a third set accepting that it's going to be a tough battle, and I love that,” he continued. Alcaraz will face Alexander Zverev during Saturday's semifinals.© Anita T. Aguilar Each player was having his own personal physical meltdown at the same time.On one side of the court, Zverev called out the doctor to tell him that he was sweating more than he ever had, couldn't breathe, and was dizzy between each point. After the doctor checked his vitals and gave him a new inhaler, Zverev seemed to recover.

Aguilar The American, who was on a nine-match win streak and had gone deep at three straight tournaments, finally hit a wall. He was a step slow from the start, which was enough, eventually, to cause his strokes to go completely awry.The pro-Ben crowd tried whatever they could think of to rally him, but nothing worked. His shots only sailed farther beyond the lines. This time, maybe for the first time, when Ben turned to his dad and coach, Bryan, he couldn't think of anything to say.

These were the words that I thought I heard come from Coco Gauff, as she failed to make another serve in her quarterfinal with Jasmine Paolini, and watched her early lead continue to erode. As I wrote on Thursday, Gauff, after bottoming out on grass, is trying to rebuild for hard courts, and specifically for the US Open. On Froday Paolini was clearly the superior ball-striker, and this time no amount of scrap and hustle from Coco was going to change that.© Anita T. Aguilar This was a match that, when she has been winning, Gauff might have pulled out on fight alone. But by then Paolini was clearly the superior ball-striker, and this time no amount of scrap and hustle from Coco was going to change that.The big Cincy crowd, who stayed until the bitter end, grew quieter with each passing game and Gauff error.</p>

His forehand is excellent, his lefty spin is tricky, and he should feel like he has nothing to lose. But his backhand is not at that level, especially on the return; I would expect Sinner to pick on it with his slice serve in both the deuce and ad courts. I'd also expect him control more of the rallies and track down more of the Frenchman's forehands. 👉 READ MORE: What's the best bet in Atmane vs. Sinner?Sinner didn't bother trying to downplay his performance.“I returned very, very well,” he said.

Where the German is still searching for his first major title, and has never been No. 1, the Spaniard has five majors to his name and has spent 36 weeks in the top spot.The same is true for their 2025 seasons. Where Alcaraz dominated the clay swing, repeated at Roland Garros, and made the Wimbledon final, Zverev has looked lost in the wilderness much of the time, to the point where he started talking this summer about how alone he feels on court.And yet, if you go by a couple of other relevant metrics—rankings and head to head—you could say that the Spaniard and the German come into this match on even terms.

He's also 4-2 on hard courts, and he won their most recent meeting, at the ATP Finals on indoor hard in Turin last fall. 2, but they traded positions for good in May. Their record against each other is just as close: Zverev leads 6-5. He's also 4-2 on hard courts, and he won their most recent meeting, at the ATP Finals on indoor hard in Turin last fall. Alcaraz has a 3-1 advantage at the majors, and he's won both of their previous contests on U.S. hard courts easily.In other words, Zverev matches up surprisingly well against Alcaraz one on one. His consistency, ranginess and depth of shot forces Alcaraz to hit more balls than he would like to finish a rally. Zverev also doesn't have to generate a lot of his own pace when he faces him.But the most important positives for Zverev in this matchup may be mental. One, he enjoys Alcaraz's sporting quality, and the mutual respect that he and the Spanish superstar have for each other. Two, Zverev doesn't have a whole lot to use when he plays him; a loss isn't going to destroy him psychologically.So who might have the edge on Saturday?

Alcaraz is not the overwhelming favorite, but he has found ways to get the job done in Cincinnati.© Anita T. Aguilar Zverev has won one small title this year, at home in Germany, and he has come up short in most of his big matches, even when he has played decent tennis. His semifinal defeat to Karen Khachanov in Toronto two weeks ago was typical. Zverev played evenly with him through three sets, until they reached the deciding tiebreaker. Then he suddenly couldn't make a ball; after each miss, he shot his dad a pained look that said, “Why is this happening again?”After Friday, there's also some question about Zverev's physical state. Afterward, he said he didn't know what happened, but it's going to be similarly hot here on Saturday evening.All of that said, Alcaraz is not the overwhelming favorite. He had more errors than winners, and he failed to serve out the match at 5-3 in the third set.But Alcaraz was still satisfied with the performance, mainly because, as he said, he “stayed with the positive emotions” even when the errors were flowing off his racquet. Maybe that positivity, coupled with Zverev's long-running negativity about his game and his year, will make the difference between them this time.

John Newcombe stands among the most iconic figures in Australian tennis, competing in an era dominated by legends like Rod Laver. Known for his distinctive style and versatility, Newcombe captured Grand Slam titles across all formats—singles, doubles, and mixed doubles—leaving an enduring mark on the sport. Born in Sydney on May 23, 1944, Newcombe gravitated toward sports from an early age but truly excelled on the tennis court. Over his career, Newcombe amassed 68 singles titles, including seven Grand Slam singles championships at the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open. He never captured a French Open singles title, but his achievements were nonetheless remarkable. Newcombe's career was defined by fierce rivalries with the era's top stars, including Rod Laver, Arthur Ashe, Ilie Nastase, Guillermo Vilas, and Jimmy Connors. Roland Garros champion and Davis Cup record-holder opens up about daily pain struggles One notable clash occurred ahead of the 1975 Australian Open final. Jimmy Connors said before the final: “Newcombe should talk more with his racket and less with his mouth. Whenever I reach a final, he's not there”. Despite Connors' remarks, Newcombe won the final in four sets. The two would face each other four more times in their careers, with Connors winning each subsequent encounter. Including two mixed doubles titles, Newcombe's career total across all Majors reached 26. In Davis Cup competition, he helped Australia secure five championships: 1964, 1965, 1966, 1967, and 1973. In 1986, he and Tony Roche were inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. He later relocated to Texas with his wife, former German player Angelika Pfannenburg, and founded the John Newcombe Tennis Ranch, which offers recreational tennis programs for children.
