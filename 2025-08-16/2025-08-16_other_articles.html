                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A wave of online conspiracy theories has claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin never actually landed in Alaska to meet U.S. President Donald Trump. Instead, some internet users believe that he sent a body double to meet Trump at the summit. These theories gained attention after photos and videos of Putin during the August 15, 2025, Trump–Putin summit in Alaska were widely shared. Users pointed out the differences in appearance such as fuller cheeks and an unusually cheerful expression. Another commonly cited sign is Putin's unusual way of walking the so-called “gunslinger gait,” where one arm remains still. Some conspiracy theorists said the person seen in Alaska failed to replicate that customary movement. (Also Read: India welcomes Alaska Summit Between Trump And Putin, Calls For Dialogue To End Russia-Ukraine Conflict) According to posts spread over social media, these rumors have included claims that body doubles underwent plastic surgery to resemble Putin and were deployed for risky or symbolic appearances. (Also Read: Zelensky Demands Seat At Peace Table, Heads To Washington After Trump-Putin Summit) Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called them “information hoaxes,” and Putin himself has denied the concept of using doubles. In 2020 and again during his “Direct Line” call in 2023, Putin said, “only one person should resemble myself … and that person will be me.” Peskov reiterated that “we have only one Putin”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Played by Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, the Winchesters were compelling to watch because they would do anything for each other. However, the actors have acknowledged that there were some questionable character choices in Supernatural​​​​​​, especially when it came to Sam. There were many versions of Sam Winchester in Supernatural, as the character was possessed, lived in a parallel reality, or experienced some kind of fantastical intervention many times. Every season of Supernatural saw the characters grapple with intense changes and upheaval, with Sam and Dean occasionally going their separate ways. When discussing Sam's Supernatural season 8 arc with ScreenRant at a FAN EXPO Boston panel, Padalecki said: Instead of searching for his brother and finding a way to free him from purgatory, he moved on with his life, falling in love with Amelia (Liane Balaban). It makes sense that Padalecki would question this character choice for Sam to this day, as it came out of nowhere and goes against some of Supernatural's core tenets. The fact that Sam essentially forgets about Dean and decides to go back to the life he always wanted is a blow to the brothers' relationship and sparks long-term issues between them throughout season 8. It could be argued that Sam's decision to move on and heal from Dean's death by settling down was supposed to mirror Dean's behavior in the wake of season 5. After the events of "Swan Song," Dean seeks out Lisa (Cindy Sampson) and lives with her and her son for a year, believing Sam is gone. While this was also somewhat out of character for Dean, it made more sense than Sam's behavior in season 8. In season 6, Dean felt justified in moving on because Sam sacrificed himself for Dean and the rest of the world, because there was no other choice. The context of Dean getting trapped in Purgatory isn't the same as Sam's supposed death in season 5, making it impossible to draw a one-to-one comparison between these two romantic relationships that drive a wedge between the brothers. Few of the Supernatural episodes that are considered masterpieces are in season 8, as this installment is widely regarded as something of a low point for the show. Sam is far from the only character whose actions and motivations don't align with his arc in the series. There were many ups and downs in the years following the season 5 finale, as Supernatural was going through a soft reboot and rediscovering what kind of show it wanted to be. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TV psychic Sylvia Browne, who gained nationwide infamy for her wildly inaccurate predictions to the families of missing children, has gone viral yet again. Thanks to a steady flow of appearances with Montel Williams and Larry King, she was massively popular, with a years-long waiting list for phone consultations and fans willing to pay thousands of dollars to go on a cruise with her. Browne died in 2013 at the age of 77, but during the COVID-19 pandemic she became a phenomenon again online, where no less than Kim Kardashian shared a quote that many readers regarded as prophetic. Now social media users are sharing clips of her, this time mocking her as an alleged grifter who said the 'wildest nonsense' that she pulled 'out of thin air.' TV psychic Sylvia Browne, who gained nationwide infamy for her wildly inaccurate predictions to the families of missing children, has gone viral yet again Born Sylvia Celeste Shoemaker in 1936 in Kansas City, she claimed to have seen visions since she was three years old during the Great Depression. By the 1980s, she had fashioned herself into a charismatic media figure, thanks to her blunt sense of humor, her gravelly voice and her distinctive appearance: a fuller figure topped by an extravagantly made-up face and platinum hair with fringe. Her sprawling enterprise included several bestselling books in which she professed an ability to see into the future and the afterlife, plus cruise ship appearances, 30-minute phone consultations costing $750 a pop, her own gnostic church and even a murky gold-mining venture that led to her conviction of securities fraud in 1992. But she was most notorious for the jaw-droppingly incorrect predictions she delivered to frantic families about the fate of their missing children. In 2004 on The Montel Williams Show, Browne told Louwanna Miller that her vanished daughter Amanda Berry was 'not alive, honey,' adding: 'Your daughter's not the kind who wouldn't call.' Miller said she believed the medium '98 percent,' and died of heart failure in 2005 - eight years before her daughter escaped years of captivity by Ariel Castro and was found alive, in a case that inspired a media frenzy. 'Only God,' said Browne in her defense: 'is right all the time.' Thanks to a steady flow of appearances with Montel Williams (right) and Larry King , she was massively popular, with a years-long waiting list for phone consultations One of Browne's false predictions involved Ariel Castro kidnap victim Amanda Berry, who is pictured (right) with fellow captive Gina DeJesus (left) after they achieved freedom In 1999 on The Montel Williams Show, the grandmother of a six-year-old Texas kidnap victim called Opal Jo Jennings pleaded with Browne: 'I can't stand this. 'But what bothers me - now I've never heard of this before - but she was taken and put into some kind of a slavery thing and taken into Japan. Kokouro, Japan does not exist, and Opal's remains were discovered in Texas, with the pathologist saying she was killed the night of her abduction. In 2002, Browne told the mother of a missing woman named Holly Krewson that her daughter was working as a stripper in Hollywood. Four years later, the dental records from human remains that had been found in San Diego in 1996 were used to identify the deceased as Krewson. In 2003, four months after 11-year-old Shawn Hornbeck disappeared in Missouri, Browne told his parents on The Montel Williams Show that their son was dead after being abducted by a dark-skinned man who had dreadlocks. The incident prompted the first of Browne's four husbands Gary Dufresne, whom she divorced the year before she became a professional psychic, to give an interview to a website called stopsylvia.com and openly accuse her of being a fraud. Now clips of Browne are flying yet again around X, formerly Twitter, and a new crop of viewers are reacting with hilarity to her onscreen antics He recalled a tarot party she gave during their marriage, after which he supposedly asked her: '"Sylvia, how can you tell people this kind of stuff? After his interview, Browne shot back that he was 'a liar and dark soul entity, but at least the a**hole gave me children,' via Jon Ronson's profile of her in the Guardian. The Skeptical Inquirer released a study of 115 of her predictions about murder and missing persons cases, and found that out of the 25 instances when the truth had been discovered at all, Browne had not been right even once. Fans have also sniggered at her false predictions online, including one who posted a 'fraud montage' of some of her lowlights to YouTube several years ago. One woman on The Montel Williams Show told Browne that she 'lost my boyfriend tragically' and he was 'never found,' to which Browne said: 'The reason why you didn't find him is 'cause he's in water.' Now clips of Browne are once again flying around social media, and a new crop of viewers are reacting with incredulity to her onscreen antics. 'I've recently started rewatching Sylvia Browne, and I swear, this woman would just stare at you and say the wildest nonsense,' wrote an X user over another video. 'Honey, I just got through telling you, it's because it was his time to go,' Browne said, deploying her reputed powers of farsightedness. He was like an angel that came passing through and then went out.' She then gruffly asked: 'What is this about, that he couldn't breathe? and the woman fought back tears as she replied: 'His lungs were blown out.' 'Well, that's why he couldn't breathe,' Browne managed to divine. Browne died of heart failure in San Jose, California in 2013 at the age of 77, a decade after she predicted on Larry King Live that she would live to be 88.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This June 1, 2023, image courtesy of the Nova Scotia Government in Canada, shows firefighters Walter Scott and Zac Simpson spray the ground around Barrington Lake, Shelburne county, Canada. Justin Ling is an independent investigative journalist based in Montreal and a contributing columnist for the Star. Justin Ling is an independent investigative journalist based in Montreal and a contributing columnist for the Star. Nova Scotia is, if you listen to a small-but-loud chorus, sliding into “authoritarianism” and “totalitarianism.” It is the testing ground for draconian “climate lockdowns” and a sign of a malignant government “paranoia.” For most Nova Scotians, their government's decision to ban anyone from entering the woods for any reason, save on their own property — issued with the blunt warning of “STAY OUT OF THE WOODS” — is a necessary precaution to prevent forest fires amid a bone dry summer. But many others, mostly elsewhere in Canada, see this hiking-and-camping ban as something more sinister: that “it's deja vu.” And it is a blinking indicator that, while many of us may be keen to move on from those wretched years, COVID-19 — and our governments' response to it — still looms large in the minds of many. It has made them cynical and distrustful. Earlier this week, army veteran Jeff Evely incurred a $28,872.50 fine for venturing into the woods in Cape Breton. It wasn't accidental: He walked up to a conversation officer and announced “I'm going to go in the woods over there.” During the pandemic, Evely became convinced that our freedom and liberties were slipping away. He believed the lockdowns and vaccine mandates were part of a larger plan to impose total government control, and he thinks his province's forest ban is a continuation of that plot. Evely may be an extreme example, but he's a citizen like the rest of us. And any citizen in a liberal democracy generally asks themselves two questions about state action in tough times: Do I trust my government to effectively manage this crisis? We can all agree that shelter-in-place orders during a mass shooting are reasonable, but that a citywide lockdown to find the mayor's missing cat would not be. This isn't just a perception problem. Think back to 2020: Canadians overwhelmingly heeded stay-at-home orders, understanding them as necessary. In the ensuing two years, however, compliance for heavy-handed measures declined precipitously. We saw our leaders — some who are still in power — as incompetent and prone to overreaction. At the same time, they expected the public's faith to return, as though trust is some default position: It is not. Public relations firm Edelman conducts an annual “Trust Barometer.” Between 2021 and this year, they observed a 21-point jump in the number of Canadians who worry that our leaders “purposely mislead people by saying things they know are false or gross exaggerations.” When governments deliver instructions to their citizens in exceptional times — don't go outside, wear a mask, don't start fires, get vaccinated — success is measured by compliance. This is the second time Nova Scotia has had to resort to such a ban on its sprawling forests. I asked when we may finally see a public inquiry into how our governments responded to the pandemic. Such a public inquiry is likely to tell us that, yes, governments did overreach when they imposed arbitrary lockdowns and curfews, and no the science did not support such measures. Doing so, of course, would provide ammunition to the conspiracy theorists — who are wrong about an awful lot, but right about a select few things. Hence why that former public health official believed it would never happen. We're entering into challenging times, and there are already so many malign pressures weakening trust in our institutions — sloppy faux-journalism on social media, outright misinformation, catchy conspiracy theories, amongst others. But rebuilding trust, such that Canadians don't reflexively go toward suspicion when governments act, is going to be a long hard road. Sorry, there was an error processing your request.

A crucifix depicting an alien - not Jesus - and the message, 'If you believe in Jesus, you believe in aliens', can also be seen displayed above the entrance. Inside, shelves hold 3D-printed objects including crowns of thorns, while a painting modeled after da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' replaces Jesus and his disciples with aliens. Known as the Alien Church, the organization combines elements of religion, art, and extraterrestrial belief, according to its founder who calls himself 'Mercury' The LA storefront (pictured) features a glass-walled space, minimalist neon signs flashing words like 'art' and 'love,' alongside merchandise such as T-shirts, trucker hats, and water bottles branded 'H2O Holy' One member, Isaiah Dupree, even claims he was abducted by aliens as a child. In one image, published by SFGate, Dupree can be seen shining a light through the flesh of his finger where he believes a piece of metal was inserted under his skin during an alien abduction. The group promotes 'unity and belief in a higher power,' along with the idea that 'aliens have seen much more of God's creation than humans,' Mercury told SFGate, adding that he, 'hopes to one day develop a missile capable of putting out wildfires in minutes.' Mercury maintains that the center is privately funded through his other businesses, including print manufacturing and a truck rental service. He says there is no profit motive and that merchandise sales are intended to help support the space. 'I'm not seeking any type of profit from people who come to services,' he said. Mercury, who reportedly grew up in Mexico, comes from a Christian background but explains that he lost faith after he 'saw a lot of contradictions in the religion'. An 'Alien Priest' can be seen inside the Los Angeles, California location Mercury maintains that the center is privately funded through his other businesses, including print manufacturing and a truck rental service. He was later inspired to start Alien Church, which he claims was initially a restaurant concept, to help others who were struggling. Despite those claims, comparisons to other fringe religious movements in California have raised concerns. Astronomer David Weintraub, who studies the intersection of science and belief, also noted that pop culture, technological advancement, and internet access have all helped fuel interest in UFO-based ideologies.
