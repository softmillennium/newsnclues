                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Russian president said he would make unspecified territorial concessions in Kyiv's favour in exchange for control over the mineral rich eastern oblast. His demands were outlined by the US president in a call with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, and a group of European leaders following their meeting in Alaska. The details of the peace summit in Anchorage will further fuel fears that Mr Zelensky will be pressured to cede territory and accept numerous Russian demands as part of Mr Trump's quick-fire attempt to end the war. Mr Zelensky has made clear that he is not willing to discuss ceding territory that is not already controlled by Russian forces as part of any peace deal. A former US Nato representative has said it is “just not credible” that Ukraine could be offered the protection of Nato members without actually joining the organisation. Reports emerged today that security guarantees for Ukraine were discussed in Alaska, which could see Ukraine's allies, including the US, promising to intervene if Russia decided to attack it again. “No one in Europe today trusts Donald Trump's US to defend them if they were attacked, and no-one in Ukraine is going to believe that unless and until they are the member of the one organisation that exists explicitly for that purpose,” he added. The Ukrainian General Staff on Saturday said that Kyiv's troops have advanced up to two kilometres (1.2 miles), repelling Russian troops on the northern Sumy front. US president Donald Trump backs a Russian proposal for Moscow to take full control of two Ukrainian regions and freeze the front line in two others which Moscow only partially controls, a source told AFP. “Trump is inclined to support it,” the source said. A three-way summit Donald Trump has mooted with Volodymyr Zelensky and Vladimir Putin could take place in Europe, Germany's leader suggested on Saturday. “I think that such a three-way meeting will take place,” German chancellor Friedrich Merz said in an interview with TV networks NTV and RTL, according to an advance transcript AFP obtained. “The date and place are still to be worked out. We have proposed that a place could be found in Europe,” he said. The leaders of eight Nordic-Baltic nations said on Saturday that they remain steadfast in their support for Ukraine and to the efforts by Donald Trump to end the Russian aggression against Ukraine. The leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said in a statement that achieving peace between Ukraine and Russia requires a ceasefire and security guarantees for Ukraine. “We welcome president Trump's statement that the US is prepared to participate in security guarantees.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia's reaction to Donald Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska has been nothing short of jubilant, with Moscow celebrating the fact that the Russian leader met his US counterpart without making concessions and now faces no sanctions despite rejecting Trump's ceasefire demands. Trump entered the high-stakes summit warning “I won't be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” and threatening “severe consequences” if Moscow refused to cooperate. But after a three-hour meeting with the Russian side that yielded no tangible results, Trump shelved his threats and instead said the meeting was “extremely productive”, even as Putin clung to his maximalist demands for ending the war and announced no concessions on the battlefield, where Russian forces are consolidating key gains in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has consistently rejected giving up territory and on Saturday European allies reaffirmed that Ukraine's borders must not be altered through force. On Saturday morning, Trump also publicly dropped plans for an immediate ceasefire he had himself championed for months, instead embracing Putin's preferred path to ending the war: pushing through a far-reaching agreement before halting any fighting. “It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up,” Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. “Putin gave Trump nothing, but still got everything he wanted. In his remarks after the meeting in Alaska, Putin gave little indication of softening his stance, repeating that Moscow wanted the “root causes” of the conflict addressed – Kremlin shorthand for demands to demilitarise Ukraine, restrict its domestic politics and block its path to Nato. No economic incentives offered by Trump's team seemed to sway Putin – the economic delegations meeting was even scrapped – with observers stressing he would always prioritise the war in Ukraine over whatever financial gains peace might unlock. Trump admitted there were still “one or two pretty significant items” left to resolve with Putin, but most worryingly for Kyiv, he ramped up pressure on Volodymyr Zelenskyy, telling Fox News host Sean Hannity: “Now, it's really up to President Zelenskyy to get it done.” “Both sides directly placed responsibility for achieving future results in negotiations on ending military actions on Kyiv and Europe,” Medvedev, now the deputy chair of Russia's security council, wrote. Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre, said: “Trump now appears to be shifting much of the responsibility on to Kyiv and Europe. She added that Trump was “once again clearly charmed and impressed by his interlocutor”, referring to the warm body language and effusive compliments the US president directed at Putin. The key question is how far Trump will press Zelenskyy, who is due to meet him in Washington on Monday, to accept a deal on Putin's terms and whether European allies can once again steer Trump on to a different course. “Trump clearly did not fully accept the settlement plan that Putin is promoting,” cautioned Stanovaya. “The tasks of the special military operation will be accomplished either by military or diplomatic means,” wrote a senior Russian lawmaker, Andrei Klishas, on Telegram. Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin aide who attended the Alaska meeting, said no talks had taken place about a three-way summit between Putin, Zelenskyy and Trump, directly rebutting Trump's claim to reporters that a meeting was in the works. “Western media are on the verge of completely losing it,” wrote the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, as Putin landed in Alaska. “For three years they told everyone Russia was isolated and today they saw a beautiful red carpet laid out for the Russian president in the US,” she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House officials said it mentioned the abductions of Ukrainian children by Russian forces in occupied territory Putin was indicted by the international criminal court in 2023, and still faces arrest in 125 countries, for his alleged role in the war crime of abducting those children and transferring them from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation. Slovenian-born Melania Trump did not attend the peace summit between Trump and Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday. But she has previously said that her ambition as US first lady was to be akin to Eleanor Roosevelt, who was known for her work advocating for children's rights and welfare during Franklin D Roosevelt's presidency. “During the conversation, President Zelenskyy also conveyed his gratitude to first lady Melania Trump for her sincere attention and efforts to bring forcibly deported Ukrainian kids back,” Sybiha said on X. Ahead of Friday's summit, the White House stated that Russia's abduction of more than 20,000 Ukrainian children “remains a concern” for Trump seven months into his second presidency. “Russia isn't even trying to hide it any more,” Kuleba said. “The way they describe our children is no different from a slave catalogue. After news of the first lady's letter was posted, the Bring Kids Back UA initiative expressed gratitude to Melania Trump for her concern. Each word of support brings them closer to their families, communities and home,” it said. US lawmakers have demanded the return of Ukraine's children from Russia before any peace deal is agreed to and in July introduced a congressional resolution calling for their return. Led by Texas Republican congressman Michael McCaul and New York Democrat Gregory Meeks, the resolution condemns Russia's abduction, forcible transfer and facilitation of the illegal deportation of Ukrainian children. A US Senate version was introduced by Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley and Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat. Meeks said “the Russian military has cruelly abducted and illegally deported tens of thousands of Ukrainian children from their homeland”. “These atrocities are not isolated incidents,” Meeks said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu has ordered binding arbitration to put an end to a strike by Air Canada's flight attendants that has grounded flights and disrupted air travel for hundreds of thousands of people in Canada and overseas. Ms. Hajdu said she has also ordered the Board to aid the two parties in reaching an agreement in binding arbitration. Earlier: Air Canada flight attendants go on strike after union, airline fail to reach a deal Ottawa's decision gives Air Canada AC-T “exactly what they want - hours and hours of unpaid labour from underpaid flight attendants, while the company pulls in sky-high profits and extraordinary executive compensation,” said Wesley Lesosky, President of the Air Canada Component of CUPE. Picket lines were active at airports across Canada on Saturday, including Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver, the union said. Workers at Vancouver International Airport in Richmond, B.C., strike after Air Canada and the flight attendants' union failed to reach an agreement.Chris Helgren/Reuters Reacting to Ms. Hajdu's announcement, a group of picketers outside Toronto Pearson Airport started chanting “Patty Hajdu, shame on you” and “Forced to fly, we won't comply.” In recent days, union representatives have said that the airline would not meet to negotiate, with the carrier stating that it had responded to each offer. The airline responded with a lockout notice of its own that went into effect early Saturday morning. On Thursday, the carrier began winding down its operations in preparation for a full stoppage of its Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flights. Early Saturday morning, Air Canada said it had been reducing its schedule of about 700 daily flights since the strike notice on Wednesday and anticipated about 130,000 customers would be affected. ET Friday, about 623 flights had been cancelled and 100,100 people impacted by the then-coming strike, Air Canada said in a social-media post to X. Air Canada flight cancellations are costing travellers more than just ticket prices Travellers affected by Air Canada strike scramble for answers at Toronto's Pearson airport Air Canada said earlier this week that it would take about a week for the airline to resume global operations after instituting a full shutdown.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How Trump's highly-anticipated peace talks unfolded in Alaska No number of Russian agents armed with bulletproof suitcases could shield him from being pelted by the sorts of questions he had managed to avoid since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine. As one reporter shouted, “Mr Putin, will you break your ceasefire?” it was clear he was not in a cocoon of Kremlin mouthpiece Russian media, but surrounded by US journalists determined to hold him to account. His wry smile evaporated into one of alarm. He looked pleadingly to the left and furrowed his brow. “Will you commit to not killing any more civilians?” another reporter yelled. The moment was a brief but stark reminder to the Russian leader that while Mr Trump may have rolled the red carpet out for him, he is a man with an International Criminal Court warrant for his arrest and on the sanctions lists of most Western governments. It was then that Putin, Mr Trump and their advisers began highly-anticipated closed-door talks. Less than an hour before, Putin had been met with a warm welcome as he stepped onto US soil for the first time in a decade. At 11.08am local time, after Mr Trump had already descended the steps of Air Force One, Putin finally ventured out of his own aircraft and walked briskly down the stairs to join the US leader. In a meeting such as this, every fine detail will have been negotiated – including which leader steps out of their aircraft first. With grey skies and Alaskan mountains setting the scene behind them, the two men walked down respective red carpets and joined one another at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. In an overt display of warmth that was quickly criticised by US media, Mr Trump grinned and applauded as he waited for Putin to join him. In the 42 months since Russia launched its full-scale war in Ukraine, every Western leader has refused to meet Putin. Standing on the red carpet, having descended the steps of Air Force One a fraction before Putin, Mr Trump applauded the approaching Russian leader before shaking his hand and clasping his arm. Standing on the raised platform quickly erected for this photo-op, the two men stood with their arms by their sides, both looking awkwardly rigid. Another asked if he would stop killing Ukrainian civilians. Putin pointed at his ear, suggesting that he could not hear. The two leaders had been due to be picked up separately on the tarmac after arriving on their respective flights. Putin's “Aurus” limousine, complete with Russian number plates and a flag on its bonnet, had been waiting to ferry him to the talks. Mr Trump was flanked by Steve Witkoff, the Middle East envoy who has previously negotiated with Putin, and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. While Mr Trump had initially planned to carry out discussions one-on-one, the president's team announced that the meeting had been changed to a three-on-three just hours before the meeting was set to take place. It was reported that a lunch between Putin and Mr Trump had also been cancelled, suggesting that their talks had gone badly. If the meeting had gone poorly, Mr Trump had declared, he would not stand side-by-side with Putin and brief the press. It was Putin, not Mr Trump, who began the press conference, a detail that even the Trump-loyal network, Fox News labelled as “really stunning”. Putin said he wanted the war to end but that he was worried about Kyiv and European capitals “throwing a spanner in the works”. No details of a ceasefire were provided, but Putin did offer Mr Trump something that he wanted: recognition that the war would not have started if he were president in 2022. “Today when President Trump said that if he was the president back then there would be no war and I'm quite sure that it would indeed be so,” the Russian president said, translated to English for reporters in Alaska. Mr Trump, stood at his presidential lectern, stared straight back, offering the slightest nods of approval in response. For months, the US president has been telling anyone who would listen that he believes that the Russian army would not have invaded Ukraine if he had beaten Joe Biden and retained his place in the White House for a second consecutive term. It was an olive branch from Moscow reminiscent of their last meeting in Helsinki in 2018, when Putin, standing beside Mr Trump at a joint press conference, insisted that Russia had not interfered in his election victory. However, he admitted that sticking points remained, “one the most significant”. He did not elaborate on what that was. But some 12 hours after the press conference, details emerged of the talks that suggest Mr Trump did make some progress with Putin in those few hours. During a call with Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's president, and a group of European leaders following their meeting, Mr Trump outlined the demands Putin had made. This concession would give Russia, which already controls a significant amount of Ukraine's Luhansk region, control of the eastern Donbas. Such territorial gains would give Russia an unabridged staging post for future attacks into the regions of Zaporzhia and Dnipropetrovsk in the direction of Kyiv. It also prompts concerns that Mr Zelensky will be pressured to accept Putin's demands as part of Mr Trump's quick-fire attempt to end the war. In one notable gear change, Mr Trump said the US would be ready to participate in “Article 5-style” security guarantees for Kyiv, referring to Nato's mutual defence clause. Putin also tabled a demand for “protections” for the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine, which Mr Zelensky banned last year after accusing it of being complicit in Putin's war. The move provided the Russian president with an excuse for his invasion, claiming that military action was taken to protect Russian speakers and culture in Ukraine. The Alaska press conference had ended with no questions, helping Putin dodge the scrutiny that had made him squirm earlier that day. “Next time in Moscow,” Putin said, breaking into English for full effect. “Ooh, that's an interesting one,” Mr Trump replied.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An emboldened President Donald Trump is increasingly using his bully pulpit to stamp his imprint on Washington, DC — pushing the bounds of executive power to reshape a city that once snubbed him. Trump in his first seven months has sought extraordinary control over key cultural institutions, taking over leadership of the Kennedy Center and demanding changes to Smithsonian museums that align with his political beliefs. He's slashed the size of the federal workforce, moved to sell off government buildings and embarked on a pricey White House renovation that will make the world's most famous address more closely resemble another one of his private clubs. And in an unprecedented move triggered by his own gripes with DC government, Trump has taken control of the city's police force and sent a surge of federal law enforcement into streets. White House officials and close allies of the president told CNN that Trump's decision to prioritize these actions boils down to one underlying point: He believes winning the 2024 election delivered him a mandate to impose his influence on a city he has long viewed as being captured by Democrats and liberal elites. He is self-assured in his decisions, and he is far more willing to take risks,” a person close to Trump told CNN. One White House official put it this way: “After 2021, everyone counted him for dead,” adding that Trump won a series of legal cases and clawed his way back to the top. “A lot of what is driving his agenda stems from the fact he believes he was given a mandate in ‘24,” the official added. A key difference in Trump's second-term approach to DC stems from whom he surrounds himself with. During his first term, Trump deferred several decisions to the aides he placed in the West Wing, many of whom worked tirelessly to counteract what they viewed as him following through on his worst impulses. Struggling to manage the competing factions within his White House and broader GOP, he notably shied away from engaging with a city whose residents had roundly rejected him. Trump declined to participate in the traditional tentpole events of official Washington, like the Kennedy Center Honors and White House Correspondents Dinner. He rarely ventured off the White House grounds during the week — aside from some visits to his local Trump Hotel — and spent as many weekends as possible in the friendlier confines of his clubs in Florida and New Jersey. But from within the Oval Office, he's devoted increasing energy to putting his mark on the few square miles around him — urged on by a new set of staffers that, rather than acting as gatekeepers, have encouraged him to act on asserting his influence on Washington. “He's got loyal people around him now,” said one Trump adviser. The president's announcement on Monday, during which he vowed to “restore the city back to the gleaming capital that everybody wants it to be,” was a result of a long-simmering belief that the federal government was required to step in and clean up DC. Two White House officials told CNN that much of that belief stems from Trump's dismay while traveling in his motorcade and seeing homeless tents and graffiti scattered through the city. A day before announcing the crackdown, Trump posted a series of photos of homeless encampments and roadside debris on Truth Social that appeared to be taken from his motorcade as it sped by. The attempted carjacking of administration staffer Edward Coristine earlier this month provided additional justification, with Trump posting a photo of the bloodied Coristine as evidence that crime had spiraled out of control. But the president — who friends note rose to prominence in New York City during its crime surge in the 1980s and ‘90s — had also complained about those issues long before he retook office. “We will take over the horribly run capital of our nation in Washington, D.C. and clean it up, renovate it, rebuild our capital city, so there's no longer a nightmare of murder and crime,” then-candidate Trump said during a campaign rally in Atlanta in August 2024. The surge of federal agents in DC triggered immediate backlash, with Democrats decrying it as an unprecedented power grab meant to distract from challenges that the White House is facing elsewhere. There are early signs, too, that Trump's hardline actions across the country are already wearing thin with some voters; a Pew Research Center poll released Thursday showed sharp declines in his approval rating among younger Americans and minorities. But Trump and his aides have leaned into the controversy, betting that it will benefit them with a broad base of voters who prioritize public safety — and feel that crime is on the rise in cities like DC, even if it's not reflected in the data. “I could see where federalizing the police ends up permanent,” said one person close to the White House, noting Democrats' early struggles to coalesce behind an effective response. While Trump during his first term only occasionally dipped into the culture war issues that have long animated the broader MAGA base, he's since made them core to his agenda — convinced that he can capitalize politically by presenting himself as a “common sense” bulwark against progressives who he sees as having taken over key institutions. They all went through me,” Trump said of the picks, which included country music star George Strait; actors Michael Crawford and Sylvester Stallone; singer Gloria Gaynor; and the rock band KISS. He added that throughout the process, “I turned down plenty. They were too woke, I had a couple of wokesters. He also announced that he would be hosting the awards ceremony in December, relishing his chance to once again command a televised event nearly a decade after his reality television show, “The Apprentice,” went off the air. In recent months, Republican lawmakers have proposed renaming the Kennedy Center after Trump, and its opera house after first lady Melania Trump. Trump is also eager to oversee a series of milestone events during his second term. He also pointed to the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics, which will be hosted in the United States in 2026 and 2028, respectively, both of which are major feathers in Trump's cap for his presidential legacy. The president in private conversations has repeatedly marveled at his luck, musing that he wouldn't have presided over America's 250th anniversary if he'd won reelection 2020 — even as he insists, without evidence, that race was rigged against him. “The president's crazy about America 250 — he's really focused on this,” said the person close to the White House, characterizing Trump's view as of DC as “in disrepair, which makes it a bummer to visit. That internal review — led by a trio of top White House officials — will examine exhibits and materials at eight Smithsonian museums to determine what should and shouldn't be displayed. It comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year of accusing the museums of having “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology” that has “promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.” Vice President JD Vance, a leader among the conservative movement to retake cultural institutions from the left, was put in charge of stopping government spending on “exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values.” “We want the museums to treat our country fairly,” Trump said Thursday, pushing back on accusations that the administration is rewriting history to suit its political narrative. “We're going to also fix up a place called Washington, DC,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Kremlin bragged about U.S. fighter jets escorting Russian President Vladimir Putin's plane from Alaska on Aug. 16, following his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. "American fighter jets escorted the Russian president's plane on its way from Alaska to Russia," the Kremlin wrote on Telegram, sharing a video filmed from the aircraft.The Aug. 15 summit marked Putin's first visit to the U.S. since 2015 and a break from the international isolation imposed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. During the visit, Putin received a red-carpet welcome, which top Russian officials later celebrated on social media. Putin looked visibly uplifted during the trip. The Trump-Putin meeting did not yield any agreement to bring an end to Russia's war in Ukraine closer. Instead, the main outcome was widely seen as Moscow's break from international isolation — a significant win for Putin both domestically and internationally. Since launching the full-scale invasion, Putin has faced international isolation, limiting his travel to close allies and regional partners such as China, Iran, and North Korea, while avoiding Western capitals entirely. His options became even more restricted after the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for him in March 2023 over the kidnapping of thousands of Ukrainian children from occupied territories. Russia's reintegration into global diplomacy began after Trump took office on Jan. 20, 2025. Within weeks, the two leaders held their first phone call, ending the communication freeze imposed during Joe Biden's presidency.Trump praised the Aug. 15 meeting with Putin as a 10 out of 10, despite not reaching any peace agreements. President Volodymyr Zelensky said he will meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Aug. 18 to discuss ending Russia's war in Ukraine, following a call between the two leaders on Aug. 16.

The joint statement by several European leaders was published on Aug. 16, shortly after their phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky. The summit restored a "full-fledged mechanism for meetings" between the two presidents, without "ultimatums and threats," Deputy Chairman of Russia's Security Council Dmitry Medvedev wrote on his Telegram channel on Aug. 16. Trump handed the letter to Putin during their nearly three-hour meeting on Aug. 15, two White House officials told Reuters. After speaking with Putin, Trump said he didn't think sanctions on Russia were a necessary measure — despite the lack of ceasefire. "There's no deal until there's a deal," Trump said during a press conference after his meeting with Putin. The two leaders began their meeting at the U.S. military Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage at around 11:30 a.m. local time. The event will mark their first face-to-face talks of Trump's second term and their first meeting in six years, as well as Putin's first visit to U.S. soil in a decade.</p>

NIH documents viewed by KFF Health News show a pronounced decline in patients at the 200-bed hospital from February through April, a time that coincides with the Department of Health and Human Services' mass firings of government employees, the gutting of scientific research, and the administration's broad crackdown on immigration. By contrast, in October, about 80 patients a day on average were at the hospital. The number of cancer clinical trial participants at the hospital as of July was down about 20% from last year, one NIH cancer scientist said. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. Adults and children with cancer, people who need bone marrow transplants, and people with rare diseases or infections are among the patients who receive care at no charge at the NIH hospital, according to former officials. Research at the hospital has also led to breakthroughs about cancer, traumatic brain injury, and AIDS, among other ailments. James Gilman, a physician who was CEO of the clinical center from 2017 until retiring in January, said the center has driven important advances against disease “that couldn't have happened anywhere else.” “Every day seems to be some type of breaking point,” one NIH worker said. He also noted 11 recent departures of clinical center staffers. Others have opted for early retirement or quit because they opposed the Trump administration's orders. Gilman said the NIH hospital relies on a “very complex ecosystem and network to find patients who are not too sick” to potentially be enrolled in a clinical trial. When researchers leave, “those patients are lost,” he said. The clinical center's 2025 annual report said there were roughly 1,500 research studies underway in 2024, including studies focused on cancer, infectious disease, heart and lung conditions, and blood disorders. “What has happened here since January has been a pretty traumatic time for that ecosystem,” he said, “and there are pieces of it that will take a long time to rebuild, if indeed they get a chance to rebuild.” During the May board meeting, Aiyelawo said NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya “is very aware” that fewer people are getting treated at the hospital “and we're doing everything we can to be able to get those numbers up.” The drop in patients this year isn't isolated to people needing inpatient care, NIH documents show. The number of new patients overall had declined by 6.7%, to about 3,370 people. In response to questions, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote in an emailed statement that the clinical center “remains fully operational and continues to provide world-class clinical research and patient care. Every day, patients from across the country and around the globe come here to participate in cutting-edge studies that drive scientific discovery and improve health outcomes.” “We are committed to fully leveraging its capabilities as the nation's hub for clinical research innovation. Even before President Donald Trump began his second term, the hospital had struggled with lagging patient numbers. Before the pandemic, it averaged more than 110 patients daily. NIH documents show that the hospital saw an average of roughly 81 patients a day during fiscal 2024, which ended in September. Still, one NIH worker said: “This is a manufactured crisis. Before Trump, officials developed a new visitor policy for the NIH that required people who aren't U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to register online before arriving. It did not launch until late January, after President Joe Biden was no longer in office and around the time the Trump administration began its deportation operation. The Department of Homeland Security has carried out widespread raids and arrests and allowed immigration authorities unprecedented access to various federal data sources — including tax information and Medicaid recipients' personal data — as part of its immigration enforcement efforts. The clinical center's most recent annual report said around 600 patients in 2024 were from abroad. Now “international patients are terrified to come,” said one recently departed clinician. “They don't know what will happen to them.” Are you a cancer patient whose care at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Maryland, or another hospital, has been affected by the Trump administration's cuts?

After two years of continuous effort in research, agitation and direct action, the organizers of the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) celebrated a landmark organizing victory in late June. Aligning with the broad strategy of the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement, PYM organized to make a material difference by interrupting Israel's still-unfolding campaign of ethnic cleansing, mass displacement and, incontrovertibly, genocide. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. As the Israeli military, having reduced its aerial bombing, continues to prosecute a genocide by other means — manipulating an aid system that is insufficient by design, creating distribution sites that are veritable death traps, and intentionally proliferating forced starvation and deprivation alongside active murder — the world's most powerful nations and corporations continue to show up for duty as Israel's reliable accomplices — and, of course, as eager profiteers. Some, though, are more susceptible to subversion than others. Despite the many measures taken to enact embargoes or other types of meaningful sanctions, leading global institutions have still proven unable to impose meaningful restraint on Israel and its main benefactor and arms dealer, our decaying superpower. Where the most vaunted chambers of international law have fallen short, it has been left to Palestinians themselves, and the vast and horrified publics worldwide that stand with them, to do all in their power to halt the genocidal machine. Anti-genocide activists are doing all they can to slow the ever-mounting death toll. Where can we be the wedge that forces it open?” And by targeting logistics lines rather than the original sites of arms producers, noted Nazar, “instead of going after one arms manufacturer, with this target, we are going after them all.” Initially, PYM organizers pursued research — detailed analyses of cargo manifests, bills of lading and other logistics minutiae were required to prove conclusively that the F-35 fighter jet parts that Maersk ships were indeed destined for Israeli military use. They found evidence that left Maersk's complicity beyond question. PYM's attention then turned to running direct actions, which included protests, sit-ins, and facility shutdowns at Maersk offices in New York, Copenhagen, Rotterdam, and elsewhere over the first half of 2025. Nazar pointed out that Maersk's globally distributed operation “allows us to employ a diverse set of tactics and demonstrates our movement's strength by consolidating internationally.” By identifying and pressing into service a wide array of potential allies, their protests were able to bring together everyone from “environmental groups, to the labor sector, to migrant justice advocates,” as well as members of Parliament, lawyers, and more. They also employed tactics that were gleaned from a range of struggles like “city divestment, campus boycott[s],” and organized labor. Mask Off Maersk and its allies mobilized a pointed intervention in March 2025, when, via an online campaign, they successfully urged Maersk shareholders to bring forth a resolution about its complicity. Then, in June, French dockworker unionists refused to work on Maersk's Israel-bound ships, forcing the company to further reroute arms shipments; a similar labor protest action took place in Morocco. Naturally, these inconvenient workarounds are costly for the company. Clearly, Maersk corporate leaders must have rerun their cost/benefit analyses: in June, they acceded to a major demand, agreeing to halt commercial dealings with companies in Israeli settlements and promising that they would be “aligning [their] screening process with reference to UN standards.” Veteran investigative journalist and author of The Palestine Laboratory Antony Loewenstein told Truthout that PYM's approach was worth replicating, as they've located a vulnerable node in the global war materiel network. “With every Western state refusing to impose any economic price on Israel for its endless genocide in Gaza,” Loewenstein remarked, “it's up to civil society to rise up.” He raised a historical example: “American dockworkers were central in the global fight against South African apartheid, and such people can again be a vital cog in stopping the shipment of weapons and defense equipment to Israel.” Nazar has also noted that PYM's findings are “bolstering arms embargo laws and targeting the supply line to Zionism across Tunisia, Morocco, France, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain … A couple of volunteer researchers and youth organizers created diplomatic crises for one of the biggest shipping giants in the world; what this tells us is that an arms embargo is possible, and it is within our grasp.” PYM continues to center a “People's Arms Embargo” as a key demand, hoping to build upon the Maersk win to further thwart the lines of industry and logistics that fuel the military machine of genocide. They are not alone: Palestine Action, the British “direct action network,” conducts direct subterfuge against military equipment and arms contractors like Elbit Systems (acts for which the group is now under severe censure and suppression), while, as Truthout reported, groups like Jews For Racial & Economic Justice and Port Workers and Communities for Palestine have also sought ways to interrupt the operations of companies like Atlas Air, ZIM, All-Ways Forwarding and others involved, to various degrees, in the flow of arms. And yet why, we should ask, has it fallen to a small group of young activists to enforce the responsibilities of states under the 1948 Genocide Convention, not to mention numerous other strictures of international law? It's not as if nation-states haven't used legal and institutional means to register their dissent, even if that has not halted the unrestrained slaughter. In one notable example, South Africa has pursued a high-profile legal case charging Israel with genocide. And quite a few states, countries of the Global South in particular, have signaled substantial support for the patchwork of existing sanctions, embargoes, and arms limitations. Recently, at the Emergency Ministerial Conference on Palestine, convened by the Hague Group in Bogota, Colombia, in July, a dozen countries agreed to enforce arms transfer limitations. Such measures are not without worth — but hopes must be tempered. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is already wanted for arrest by the International Criminal Court for egregious crimes against humanity, but it's not yet clear that he will ever face consequences of any sort, and several countries have also expressed their lack of interest in holding him accountable. In one telling example, a Dutch appeals court ruled in a landmark decision that the Netherlands must stop exporting F-35 parts to Israel. A wider ban on other arms exports was also rejected by Dutch courts. Likewise, the moral space of international human rights is invariably warped and compromised by contradictions that owe their existence to the messy allowances necessary to legitimize state-perpetrated traditional war. It should be noted that the U.S. is equally cavalier about flouting its own standards. For one, the Leahy Law — which prevents arms transfers to countries engaged in gross human rights violations — clearly applies in this case. Germany, for its role, has also faced internal calls for embargo and divestment from civil servants and academics, as well as legal challenges. Though it has at times slowed the passage of arms through its export review process in the course of legal review, Germany has been cagey at best with international courts. Germany also recently announced a more widespread embargo — but there are signs its staunchly pro-Israel stance may be unchanged; as  the BDS movement has charged, Germany has claimed to be imposing a comparable ban before, and may well continue to issue arms licenses via loopholes, contra public assurances. Incredibly, former President Joe Biden and his diplomats pretended to be locked in debate with Netanyahu: a callow effort to manipulate the public's perception in order to show far more U.S. reluctance (and moral backbone, it seems) than they ever really had. It was finally admitted by Biden staffers — after Kamala Harris lost — that at no point did the White House harbor the slightest intention of staying Israel's hand. And naturally, the Trump administration has gleefully taken up that mantle, promising even more repugnant catastrophes extending to the wholesale ethnic cleansing and appropriation of Gaza. It is the work of international organizers, and, most of all, Palestinians themselves — as journalists, or with their phones or their words — that have refused to let the world look away from this world-historical crime. As Aisha Nazar said determinedly, “We know the truth. It is safe to say that, when future generations reminisce on these events, the Palestinian people, PYM, and all those who saw this for what it was — those who full-throatedly condemned an utter evil and sought to put their bodies upon the gears and wheels of this odious machine, as Mario Savio famously put it — will be seen as figures of exemplary moral courage. Those who have posed gleefully with its top perpetrator, meanwhile, seem destined to be cast by history in a very different light.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ancient, fossilized teeth, uncovered during a decades-long archaeology project in northeastern Ethiopia, indicate that two different kinds of hominins, or human ancestors, lived in the same place between 2.6 million and 2.8 million years ago — and one of them may be a previously unknown species. Such an overlapping of two hominins in the fossil record is rare, which had previously led scientists to believe that Homo appeared after Australopithecus, rather than the two being contemporaries. Australopithecus species walked upright much like modern humans, but had relatively small brains, closer in size to those of apes. The emergence of Homo species, with their larger brains, is easy for people today to view as some sort of evolutionary upgrade on a path to modern humanity. “This new research shows that the image many of us have in our minds of an ape to a Neanderthal to a modern human is not correct — evolution doesn't work like that,” said study coauthor Kaye Reed, research scientist and president's professor emerita at the Institute of Human Origins and emeritus professor at the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State University, via email. “Here we have two hominin species that are together. And human evolution is not linear, it's a bushy tree, there are life forms that go extinct.” Since 2002, Reed has been a codirector of the Ledi-Geraru Research Project, which is focused, in part, on searching for evidence of early Homo species. It has also searched for later evidence of Australopithecus afarensis, which first appeared 3.9 million years ago, but there is no sign of these ancient human relatives in the fossil record after 2.95 million years ago — suggesting they went extinct before Homo's first appearance. Lucy was shorter than an average human, reaching about 3.3 feet (1 meter) in height, had an apelike face and a brain about one-third the size of a human brain. Her fossil showcased a mixture of humanlike and apelike traits and provided proof that ancient human relatives walked upright 3.2 million years ago. When the team discovered the Australopithecus teeth during two separate digs in 2018 and 2020, it compared them with species such as afarensis and another hominin group known as garhi, but they didn't match up. There were species that went extinct; some were better adapted than others, and others interbred with us — we know this for Neanderthals for sure. The teeth were found in Ethiopia's Afar region, a key place for researchers seeking answers about human evolution. A variety of preserved fossils have been found there as well as some of the earliest stone tools, Reed said. The Afar region is an active rifting environment — the tectonic plates beneath its earth are actively pulling apart and exposing older layers of sediment that shed light on almost 5 million years of evolution, Reed said. “The continent is quite literally unzipping there, which creates a lot of volcanism and tectonics,” said study coauthor Christopher Campisano, associate director and associate professor at the Institute of Human Origins and associate professor at the School of Human Evolution and Social Change at Arizona State, in a video the school released. Discovery of fossilized footprints reveals the moment two ancient human species crossed paths But the team is cautious about identifying a species for any of the teeth until it has more data and more fossils. The teeth were also different in shape than those of any Homo species, or of the ancient human relative Paranthropus, known for its large teeth and chewing muscles. Even just finding the teeth was a complicated task, according to Campisano. “And so, we have a great team of local Afars that are excellent fossil hunters. They've seen these things their entire lives walking around the landscape.” The new study is important because it provides insight into a time frame from 3 million to 2 million years ago, a mysterious period in human evolutionary studies, said Dr. Stephanie Melillo, paleoanthropologist and assistant professor at Mercyhurst University in Pennsylvania. A key feature helping archaeologists to understand humanity's evolution are structural basins, or “bowls” on Earth's surface that naturally collect layers of sediment better than the surrounding landscape does — like the Turkana Basin stretching across southern Ethiopia and northern Kenya, Melillo said. Previous research has found evidence to suggest that Homo and Paranthropus coexisted there 1.5 million years ago. “This contribution by Villmoare and colleagues demonstrates that in the Afar there was also some other species around with Homo — but it isn't Paranthropus,” Melillo said. “Instead, they identify this ‘non-Homo' genus as Australopithecus. They do a very convincing job of demonstrating why the new fossils are not Paranthropus.” When Australopithecus and Homo were alive, the Afar Region, now mostly a semidesert, had much more seasonal variation in rainfall than it does today, Reed said. Millions of years ago, the environment there was still dominated by a dry season, but it was interrupted by a brief wet season. “We have a fossil giraffe species that was eating grass, which probably indicates they were stressed as they eat trees and bushes almost every place else,” Reed said. Stone tool discovery could offer new clue in mystery of ancient ‘hobbit' humans Understanding whether or not Homo and Australopithecus had the same food sources could paint a portrait of how our ancient ancestors shared or competed for resources, Reed said. At the moment it's impossible to tell exactly how the two hominins coexisted, but Reed said she is hoping that future findings will provide more answers. More fossils will help us tell the story of what happened to our ancestors a long time ago — but because we're the survivors we know that it happened to us.” Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his US counterpart Donald Trump in Alaska became an "excellent first step" in improving relations between Moscow and Washington and settling the Ukraine crisis with the easing of tensions being apparent, Peter Kuznick, director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University, told a TASS correspondent, commenting on the summit's results. "Not only did the meeting not fail outright, as some hoped it would — especially most European leaders, US media, many Congressional representatives, and certain Ukrainian leaders — but both presidents indicated that they made progress and agreed on more than they disagreed on. "I would say that, on balance, this is an excellent first step and I hope they follow up sooner rather than later with another meeting that leads to them hammering out a productive framework for ending the Ukraine War and going beyond that to ease global tensions and walk us back from the terrifying precipice of WWIII," Kuznick emphasized. He stated that "it's great that the tensions that were so palpable during the Biden presidency have begun to ease and we're at least talking again. Getting the US and Russia, the world's two nuclear-armed behemoths, sitting down together and talking instead of making threats, is an enormous step in the right direction." Additionally, Kuznick reiterated that the Alaska summit was attended by "businessmen and economic advisors," indicating that the sides are discussing "sanctions relief and joint economic development projects, including Arctic development and perhaps a Bering Strait tunnel connecting the two countries." "I also thought it extremely encouraging that there seemed to be interest on both parts to work toward a new nuclear arms control treaty, especially with the New START treaty expiring in February," the expert concluded. On August 15, a summit between Russia and the US took place at a military base in Alaska. The talks lasted more than three hours and included several formats: one-on-one in the American leader's limousine en route to the main venue and in a small group of "three on three." The Russian delegation included Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the US delegation included Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The Russian leader also called for a new beginning in bilateral relations and a return to cooperation.</p>

The Emperor reiterated his strong desire to pass down memories of World War II in his address at the annual memorial ceremony for the war dead held in Tokyo on Friday. During a press conference in February, he stated, “I have taken to heart the suffering of many people,” adding that “it is important to pass on the tragic experiences and history to the generations who do not know war.” The Emperor and Empress have attended memorial services for the war dead in Japan and abroad this year. In April, they visited the island battlefield of Iwoto, also known as Iwojima, in Ogasawara, which is administratively part of Tokyo. In June, they visited Okinawa Prefecture with their daughter, Princess Aiko, and renewed their wishes for peace. They also visited Hiroshima, which was devastated by an atomic bomb. During their visits, the Emperor particularly valued meeting with atomic bomb survivors and other people who had experienced the war, as well as young people who serve as “storytellers” passing on war survivors' memories of the war. The addresses at a memorial service have a history of being carefully crafted by Emperor Showa and the Emperor Emeritus after the war, each word imbued with their wishes for peace. The Emperor Emeritus and Empress Emerita observed a moment of silence while watching the national memorial ceremony for the war dead on television at their residence in Moto-Akasaka, Tokyo, on Friday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Alaska meeting between President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Donald Trump of the United States marks the failure of the European Union's attempts to secure international pressure on Moscow, Esteban Actis, professor at Argentina's National University of Rosario, said. "No one will now be able to ask the leaders of the Global South questions because of their bilateral meetings with Putin. That said, it's a major defeat for Brussels and Europe, who sought to continue pressuring the international community to isolate Moscow. Another serious blow by Washington," he wrote on the X social platform. This is an important result achieved by Putin and the Russian delegation," the expert added. The meeting between President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Donald Trump of the United States took place at a military base in Alaska on August 15. Their closed-door negotiations also involved Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov, as well as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff. The Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and going back to cooperation. Putin invited Trump to visit Moscow. The US leader, in turn, pointed to progress in the negotiation process but noted that the parties had not been able to agree on all issues.</p>
