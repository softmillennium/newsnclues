                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The letter — signed by Senators Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Jack Reed, D-R.I.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Christopher Coons, D-Del. — was in response to an Aug. 11 announcement by Trump that Nvidia and AMD would pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. The United States has historically been successful in maintaining and building that advantage because of, in part, our ability to deny adversaries access to those technologies," the letter states. "The willingness displayed in this arrangement to 'negotiate' away America's competitive edge that is key to our national security in exchange for what is, in effect, a commission on a sale of AI-enabling technology to our main global competitor, is cause for serious alarm," the letter continues. Senators also warned that selling advanced AI chips — specifically Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips — to China could help strengthen its military systems, a claim that Nvidia denies. In a statement to CNBC, a Nvidia spokesperson said: "The H20 would not enhance anyone's military capabilities, but would have helped America attract the support of developers worldwide and win the AI race. Banning the H20 cost American taxpayers billions of dollars, without any benefit." The letter from Senate Democrats also requests a detailed response from the administration by Friday, Aug. 22, regarding the current deal involving Nvidia and AMD, as well as any similar arrangements being made with other companies. "We again urge your administration to quickly reverse course and abandon this reckless plan to trade away U.S. technology leadership," the letter states. A request for comment from the White House and AMD was not immediately returned. Despite Trump allowing chip sales to resume, it has already become clear that China isn't welcoming Nvidia back with open arms, instead urging tech companies to avoid buying U.S. companies' chips, according to a Bloomberg report. "We're hearing that this is a hard mandate, and that [authorities are actually] stopping additional orders of H20s for some companies," Qingyuan Lin, a senior analyst covering China semiconductors at Bernstein, told CNBC. In a separate report, The Information said regulators in China have ordered major tech companies, including ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, to suspend Nvidia chip purchases until a national security review is complete.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company's segments include laboratory solutions and bioscience production. He is a former partner and senior managing director at Crescendo Partners. Engine's history is to send letters and/or nominate directors but settle rather quickly. On Aug. 11, Engine sent a letter calling on Avantor's board to focus on commercial and operational excellence, demonstrate organic growth, reduce costs, optimize the portfolio, refresh the board and use free cash flow to repurchase stock. Engine noted that the company can alternatively consider a sale. Avantor is a market leading distributor of life science tools and products for the life sciences and advanced technology industries. At its 2021 investor day, management projected earnings per share above $2 for 2025; and at its 2023 investor day, management targeted an EBITDA margin exceeding 20%. Now in 2025, these currently stand at 96 cents per share and 11.8%, respectively. A complex matrix organizational structure and resultant lack of accountability have led to mass leadership turnover, including Avantor's CEO, CFO and both segment leaders within the past three years, contributing to a dysfunctional decision-making process and inefficient employee structure. The biggest casualty of this rocky management team is LSS, which has lost significant profitability and market share to its peers. Specifically, poor capital allocation decisions have destroyed significant value. In 2020 and 2021, Avantor spent a total of $3.8 billion to acquire Ritter, Masterflex and RIM Bio – companies that were notably purchased during the peak of the pandemic when life sciences businesses were trading at exceptionally high multiples. Applying Avantor's next 12 months 10x multiple to the 28x average acquisition price implies over $2.4 billion in lost value on these acquisitions, contributing to the company's high leverage. On top of that, despite LSS's ongoing underperformance and the need for strong leadership, from June 2024 to April 2025, LSS was left without a leader due to a non-compete lawsuit involving the hiring of its new segment leader, underscoring the operational dysfunction that has been taking place at the company. But perhaps the nail in the coffin for this management team and board is that despite this cascading set of errors and the internal knowledge of these forecasted losses, they were still given a way out. Engine points out that Avantor's reported $6.8 billion in revenue was stretched across 6 million stock keeping units, while Thermo's peer segment achieves similar revenue with less than half the SKUs, indicating a large opportunity, specifically within LSS, to optimize the portfolio by concentrating purchases to improve inventory turns, rebates and margins. Divesting non-core assets is another way to optimize the portfolio. For BPS, certain facilities operate in periods of extended downtime, limiting growth. For LSS, subscale facilities in smaller geographies may be more valuable to a competitor, and the same goes for some of the assets purchased under Avantor's aforementioned acquisition spree. On the cost discipline side, Avantor's history of poor M&A and its low valuation should limit its accretive M&A opportunities, and while the company is on the path to reduce leverage below 3x, the market remains concerned that once this is achieved, they will simply resume this costly M&A strategy. Engine argues that free cash flow should instead be allocated evenly to share repurchases and debt reduction. In 2024, despite organic revenue declining by 2% and a 7% share price decline, the board awarded CEO Michael Stubblefield 110% of his target annual bonus, underscoring the need to align these management incentives with shareholder value creation. Engine believes that all of these changes would be best implemented with a comprehensive board refreshment. Adding directors with executive leadership, capital allocation, and distribution expertise to replace board members that have overseen years of value destruction, likely targeting chairman Jonathan Peacock specifically, should signal to the market the start of a new chapter. Engine believes that if these changes are properly implemented that Avantor shares would be worth between $22 and $26 per share by the end of 2027. As a secondary option, Engine suggests that if a standalone path does not appear viable then the board should consider selling the entire company or splitting LSS and BPS into separate entities. When Avantor acquired VWR, which is now the core of the LSS business, it was valued at about 12x EBITDA, or $6.5 billion, and BPS peers trade at a median of 17x EBITDA. Neither of these businesses' valuations correspond to what Avantor trades at, roughly 8x EBITDA, and it's possible that a strategic path could become the best way to unlock this value on a risk-adjusted basis. New Mountain Capital previously owned Avantor prior to its IPO and still maintains an approximately 2% position. Strategics, like Ingersoll, would likely be interested as well, especially at a significant discount to what they once offered. Engine believes that Avantor could sell between $17 to $19 per share. Overall, Engine makes not only a compelling case that major change is needed at Avantor, but also a clear multipath plan forward. While some of these changes are already underway: a new CEO is set to start next week and management announced a $400 million cost-cutting initiative, the sheer volume of change required here is unlikely to occur by Engine's 2027 estimate. Engine's plan includes strengthening execution, instilling a culture of cost discipline, improving capital allocation, evaluating the company's portfolio, aligning executive compensation to shareholder value creation and refreshing the board. Engine's plan is the right one, but this is a company whose top line and operating margins have been in decline since 2022 and refreshing a board, instilling a new culture, reversing declining revenue and operating margins and evaluating and executing asset sales, many of which cannot be done simultaneously, is something that will likely take much longer than two years, particularly with the director nomination window not opening until Jan. 8. Moreover, the kind of change that Engine calls for here is generally not the kind of change that comes from an amicable settlement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 2014, Apple and Samsung were duking it out to rule the U.S. smartphone market. Samsung was selling devices with large screens, and iPhone fans were demanding a response. It took Apple some time, but the company finally released the iPhone 6, breaking with previous iterations and giving consumers a large-screen option. But more than a decade later, recent smartphone sales and shipment figures signal that the Apple-Samsung fight has returned. Apple's market share during the quarter declined to 49% from 56%. That's one reason investors have sent Apple shares down 7.5% this year, underperforming all of the U.S. megacap tech companies other than Tesla. In July, Samsung introduced a pair of innovative new phones that feature foldable screens. One model, the Z Fold 7, can effectively turn into a tablet, while the Z Flip resembles an old-school flip phone with modern smartphone features. They were added to Samsung's catalog of phones released this spring under its Galaxy brand, including a thin-and-light phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge. The devices are also getting a lot of traction on social media, particularly around durability tests. The video has been clipped and shared widely on social media, with one version of the clip accumulating more than 15 million views on YouTube. In the past month, Samsung's premium devices, including the Z Fold 7, were mentioned over 50,000 times on social media, and 83% of those mentions were positive or neutral, according to data from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company. But Samsung's gains also reflect the company's ability to offer a much wider range of products at different prices compared to Apple. That includes low-end phones, which accounted for much of Samsung's second-quarter U.S. improvement, as well as high-end devices that cost more than any individual iPhone. Samsung's Galaxy and Z phone lineup "stretches from $650 up to $2,400. That is a massive span of devices," said Canalys analyst Runar Bjorhovde. "There is an idea that you can target people at every single price point, and you can meet them at every spot." These days, the company offers a series of four slates ranging from $829 to $1,599. Apple is expected to start doing the same — beginning with a potential launch next month of a slimmer iPhone that will compete with Samsung's Galaxy Edge. "Apple is clearly betting that its 5.5mm Air model is going to lift its fortunes as testing suggests a strong desire for the new form factor," wrote Loop Capital managing director John Donovan in May. JPMorgan Chase analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a report last month that Apple may release a folding phone next year to compete with Samsung's Z Fold. "Investor focus has already turned to the 2026 fall launches with Apple expected to launch its first foldable iPhone as part of the iPhone 18 lineup in September 2026," Chatterjee wrote. Apple's most expensive phone, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, currently starts at $1,199 for 256GB of storage and can go up to $1,599 for a version with 1TB of storage. Chatterjee said he thinks Apple's version of a folding phone could start at $1,999. Samsung's first folding phone was released in 2019, but got off to a rocky start. But Samsung says this time is different, and that folding phones are finally ready to go mainstream, especially with respect to durability. "There really are no longer trade-offs towards owning a foldable device," said Drew Blackard, vice president of mobile product management at Samsung Electronics America. "Samsung with the foldable is able to actually optimize for innovation," said Bjorhovde. The rise of artificial intelligence is also heralding new form factors for consumer electronics that could one day replace the iPhone. OpenAI in May acquired the startup of former Apple design guru Jony Ive for $6.5 billion. Samsung devices, as well as other Android phones, get access to Google's Gemini, which is widely considered to be one of the best AI models alongside OpenAI's ChatGPT. Gemini has several features that users can't get with Siri and Apple Intelligence. Blackard said folding phones, with their larger displays, are well suited for AI. Google's circle-to-search feature, which allows a user to simply circle something on the screen that they'd like to learn more about, is an example, Blackard said. On a Samsung folding phone, he said, users can still see the original screen with the content they circled, as well as another screen with supplementary information. "It's much more productive being able to go back and forth," Blackard said. Investors have worried that Apple's AI delays, including its next-generation Siri that's now scheduled to come out next year, could start hurting sales. But many analysts say that Apple's brand loyalty and lock-in will give it a period of years before iPhone customers start defecting for competitors. Chatterjee told CNBC that Apple's strategy with devices is to wait until a technology is ready for the mainstream before embracing it. "It's about being watchful, seeing a technology mature, knowing that there are no big roadblocks to that technology adoption, and then moving ahead."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he did not immediately need to consider retaliatory tariffs on countries such as China for buying Russian oil but might have to "in two or three weeks." Trump has threatened sanctions on Moscow and secondary sanctions on countries that buy its oil if no moves are made to end the war in Ukraine. China and India are the top two buyers of Russian oil. The president last week imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian goods, citing its continued imports of Russian oil. However, Trump has not taken similar action against China. He was asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity if he was now considering such action against Beijing after he and Russian President Vladimir Putin failed to produce an agreement to resolve or pause Moscow's war in Ukraine. "Well, because of what happened today, I think I don't have to think about that," Trump said after his summit with Putin in Alaska. "Now, I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don't have to think about that right now. I think, you know, the meeting went very well." Chinese President Xi Jinping's slowing economy will suffer if Trump follows through on a promise to ramp up Russia-related sanctions and tariffs. But China could be the biggest remaining target, outside of Russia, if Trump ramps up punitive measures. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The high-stakes summit on Friday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin did not result in a breakthrough, even as Trump described it as "productive," while Putin proposed another meeting in Moscow. The White House had played down the talks — initially seen as an attempt at securing a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine — with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt calling the summit, "a listening exercise for the president." Following the Friday meeting Trump said, "There's no deal until there's a deal." Ukraine was not part of the discussions, stoking concerns that a potential deal could have compromised the country's sovereignty. "Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to bring the war to an end, and we count on a strong position from America … A meeting of leaders is needed – at the very least, Ukraine, America, and the Russian side," President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X prior to the summit. This was Putin's first visit to the U.S. in about a decade, with the Russian president stressing that it was a "hard time" for bilateral relations. "There were many, many points that we agreed on … I would say a couple of big ones that we haven't quite got there, but we've made some headway," Trump said at a joint press conference with Putin. Putin called the talks a "starting point," both for the resolution of the conflict with Kyiv as well as for improving relations with Washington, which he said had "fallen to the lowest point since the Cold War." Trump said Putin's observations were "profound," and added that he would talk to NATO and Zelenskyy to update them about the discussions with Russia. "It's ultimately up to them," he said. One is probably the most significant, but we have a very good chance of getting there," Trump said, without elaborating. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, multiple rounds of peace negotiations have taken place, but there has not been a breakthrough on ending hostilities. In an interview with Fox News following the Friday summit, Trump asked Zelenskyy to make a deal to end the war in Ukraine. Look, Russia is a very big power, and they're not. Russian media outlets were upbeat Friday ahead of Putin's meeting with Trump, with the summit being seen as a win for Moscow. Commentary across Russian state news sites characterized the talks as a positive for Russia. The mood in Ukraine was somber amid apprehensions of the country losing some territory as part of a Trump-brokered deal. We want to hear from you.
