                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chimpanzees may share more with human thinkers than researchers once realized. A new study published in Science presents compelling evidence that chimpanzees can revise their beliefs in a rational way when they encounter new information. The study, titled "Chimpanzees rationally revise their beliefs," was carried out by an international team that included UC Berkeley Psychology Postdoctoral Researcher Emily Sanford, UC Berkeley Psychology Professor Jan Engelmann and Utrecht University Psychology Professor Hanna Schleihauf. Their results indicate that chimpanzees, similar to humans, adjust their decisions based on how strong the available evidence is, which is a central component of rational thinking. Later, they received a clearer and more convincing clue that pointed to the other box. "Chimpanzees were able to revise their beliefs when better evidence became available," said Sanford, a researcher in the UC Berkeley Social Origins Lab. "This kind of flexible reasoning is something we often associate with 4-year-old children. It was exciting to show that chimps can do this too." To confirm that the animals were truly engaging in reasoning rather than reacting on impulse, the researchers used tightly controlled experiments combined with computational modeling. The modeling showed that their decisions followed patterns consistent with rational belief revision. "We also used computational models to test how their choices matched up with various reasoning strategies." This work challenges long-held assumptions that rationality, defined as forming and updating beliefs based on evidence, belongs only to humans. "The difference between humans and chimpanzees isn't a categorical leap. Sanford believes these findings may influence how scientists think about a wide range of fields. "This research can help us think differently about how we approach early education or how we model reasoning in AI systems," she said. "We shouldn't assume children are blank slates when they walk into a classroom." Her previous research spans topics from empathy in dogs to numerical understanding in children, and she notes that one theme continues to stand out: animals often demonstrate far more cognitive sophistication than people assume.
