                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Refresh for latest…: Lionsgate's third outing with the Four Horsemen conjured a $75.5M global opening this weekend. Of that, $54.2M was in 64 international box office markets. 1s in 40 of those offshore hubs, including a surprisingly solid China start of $21.7M, according to Maoyan, where Leomus handles. Next best was CIS (Pasatiempo) at $6.4M (and, yes, Lionsgate still third-party releases movies in Russia via its longstanding output deals). Lionsgate's 'Now You See Me 3' With $21M+ Opening Makes 'Running Man' Disappear From No. Glen Powell Recalls Bombing Audition For Dustin Hoffman: "I'm Watching The Life Drain From His Eyes" The other major opener, Paramount's The Running Man, got off to an $11.2M start overseas in 58 markets (including previews). France, Brazil and Spain release next week, followed by Korea on December 4, China December 5 and Japan on January 30. Last week's champ, 20th/Disney's Predator: Badlands, added $16.1M overseas to bring the international box office cume to $70M. The Top 5 markets to date are: China ($12.7M), UK ($5.6M), Mexico ($4M), France ($3.7M) and Japan ($3.3M). Meanwhile, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle was finally unleashed in China where it grossed 373 RMB ($52.5M), per Maoyan. Distributed by Maoyan locally, the Japanese anime juggernaut delivered the highest Imax opening weekend box office gross, attendance and indexing ever for a Japanese title in China. It also notched the second biggest Imax debut for an animated film ever in China, behind only Ne Zha 2. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Offset posted and deleted a shocking message about his estranged wife Cardi B's newborn baby with Stefon Diggs. According to screenshots shared online, the Migos rapper — born Kiari Cephus — took to his Instagram Stories, writing, “My kid lol,” after news surfaced that the “Bodak Yellow” emcee had given birth to her and Diggs' baby boy. In response, Cardi, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, took to X to call out her estranged husband in a series of now-deleted tweets. “Mf'ers do anything for attention and it could get real nasty with just one upload… LEAVE ME TF ALONE,” the mom of four added.

Last August, Page Six exclusively revealed that Cardi, 33, filed for divorce from the dad of six, also 33, for a second time after nearly seven years of marriage. The exes share three kids: Kulture, 7, Wave, 4, and Blossom, 1. Since their split, Cardi has blasted Offset as an absentee father online, saying she covers majority of the staggering six-figure expenses for their three children. Earlier this month, the Grammy winner welcomed a son with Diggs, 31, whom she went public with in May. After Cardi and the New England Patriots star made their relationship Instagram official, Offset shaded them, saying their romance was a “good roll out n PR” for Cardi's album.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During a panel discussion Saturday, Bravo fan Jerry O'Connell shared that his wife, supermodel Rebecca Romijn, recently flew on the same aircraft with the Duke of Sussex. “My wife said, ‘Yeah, it was exciting, [but] not as exciting [as] when Lisa Vanderpump sat two rows back,'” he joked. He isn't, right?” she said, per Us Weekly. “Come on, you know, I'm telling the truth.” Page Six has reached out to Harry's reps for comment but did not immediately hear back. “This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.” The couple ultimately settled into a sprawling estate in Montecito, Calif., with son Prince Archie, now 6, and have since welcomed Princess Lilibet, now 4.

Vanderpump, 65, was born and raised in London, and moved to the States with husband Ken Todd to run their string of upscale restaurants — including Sur, the famed eatery featured on Bravo's “Vanderpump Rules.” The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum told Express in 2019 that she “had a happy childhood” in London, where she “lived comfortably” with her family and started ballet lessons at the age of three. She ultimately met Todd, 80, at his London nightclub, and the two married shortly after. According to the outlet, they sold their restaurants in London and relocated to Los Angeles with their two children in 2005.</p>

I think everybody on every side — including people who were denied even the ownership of themselves — had the sense of possibility worth fighting for.” Related Stories ‘Rebuilding' Review: Josh O'Connor Copes with Wildfires in a Tender and Timely Western Drama ‘Murdaugh: Death in the Family' Star Jason Clarke Loved Getting Into the Head of a ‘Full-Time Narcissist' Burns' documentary venerates that possibility, not as an outdated idea but as a dream that took great effort to distinguish and that's prematurely fading from our cultural consciousness. As much a civil war as a revolutionary war, the conflict wasn't singular; it was varied and voluminous. It felt, in other words, not unlike today. He sees America through the long lens of history, where what feels unprecedented can also be viewed as familiar, given proper context. Without explicitly mentioning Donald Trump, “The American Revolution” is designed to juxtapose then and now, early and often. Through Mercy Otis Wilson, the series — written by Geoffrey C. Ward and co-directed by Burns, Sarah Botstein, and David Schmidt — acknowledges how satiric portrayals of British royalty helped shift public opinion in favor of democracy. Among these compelling comparisons — expressed in a deluge of details sure to excite history buffs (and drain the life from easily distracted viewers, like yours truly) — a major contrast stands out: The hope, the dream, the possibility that united so many to fight for an America yet to be realized has since been muddied as that America has taken shape. And maybe, just maybe, if Burns can use history to remind us where we were then, some viewers will find their way back to a shared reality in the here and now. “Those who have interests in keeping the political story alive and growing have to really work to keep it front and center; to define the problem as something present in the minds of ordinary people. ” Kamensky says in the premiere, while discussing the early days of the revolution and how hard it was to mobilize enough people to turn a good idea into an active uprising,. “Why would I care about this as a woman? Why would I care about this as a small farmer?” Burns' “American Revolution” exists in ours, which means it needs to put in the work to leave a mark on modern minds. They can do so with their platform (and PBS is giving “The American Revolution” quite the rollout, including education initiatives for classrooms and widespread accessibility for the general public). They can do so with their work ethic (which is staggeringly clear from the thoroughly researched information onscreen, plus, given Burns' omnipresence via tour stops, speaking engagements, and interviews, just as evident off of it). And they can do so with their style. By now, people know whether to count themselves in for a Ken Burns' documentary. The 72-year-old filmmaker is as close as any documentarian can get to a household name, and whether you sampled his encyclopedic examinations via “The Civil War,” “Baseball,” “Jazz,” “Mark Twain,” “The Vietnam War,” or something else, little should surprise you about how “The American Revolution” rolls out. Historians and writers provide their authoritative perspectives, while re-enactors march in formation and animated maps illustrate battle plans. For a unique bit of fun, you can play “guess the celebrity voiceover” assigned to each quoted historical figure. (It's quite the cast — Ethan and Maya Hawke! But Burns' dry, monotonous style applied to a season of television at least two hours longer than most modern audiences are used to consuming makes for an arduous watch — and I do mean “watch.” As a podcast, “The American Revolution” might be easier to process, but as a visual experience, it's stale. And for a series hellbent on reminding divided countrymen of their common ground, it's frustrating to feel like so little mind was paid to connecting with anyone who didn't worship at the altar of their high school history teacher. I say all this with the utmost respect for the director and his work, especially because “The American Revolution” makes its consequence so obvious, starting with its opening lines, spoken by Matthew Rhys, quoting Thomas Payne: “From a small spark kindled in America, a flame has arisen, not to be extinguished. While the series stops short of saying as much — insisting on its own apolitical perspective, even as its intrinsic morality roots it firmly against today's anti-truth, pro-fascist Republican party — the source of its urgency is unmistakable. “The American Revolution” premieres Sunday, November 16 at 8 p.m. New episodes will be released daily through Friday, November 21.

Jen noted how her and Zac were both still learning to deal with all the attention. “We're working on just tuning out the noise of the world—I think it still is hard for him.” She added, “It's hard to have to constantly open your phone and see negative comments and it's hard not to take that in,” she explained. “I feel like we've grown so much,” she reasoned. This isn't the first time that Jen has stood firmly by her marriage to Zac. “He's the one who checks that l've actually eaten breakfast, who reminds me to sleep and makes sure I get real rest. What you don't see are all the quiet ways he keeps us going-cooking, cleaning, kid duty, and those late-night shifts with Penny.

Not one freaking time,” Bunnie said in the video, teasing fans as Jelly prepared to ditch his trademark beard. The Need a Favor singer, who's lost nearly 200 pounds over the past two years, joked that he wanted to see his newly defined jawline. “We're trying to see if a facelift might be in order,” he quipped while trimming his beard on camera. Bunnie documented the entire process as Jelly experimented with different styles, including a goatee and what she called a “cop stash,” before going completely clean-shaven. “The total naked face… it's not terrible,” Bunnie said while laughing and covering her mouth in disbelief. I love how you hype him up, Bunnie,” one user wrote. Another joked, “I've actually never experienced FOMO until right now.” Celebrity friend and singer Jessica Simpson also joined in, commenting, “Oh Bunnie! Despite the cliffhanger, Bunnie assured followers that her husband would reveal his full look “when he's ready.” Fans, however, couldn't help but speculate about his transformation, with many noting that his ongoing weight loss has made him nearly unrecognizable. The new clean-shaven look marks another major moment in Jelly Roll's health journey. In a recent interview, he admitted that his physical transformation has also changed his outlook on life, saying he's “healthier, happier, and a way better human.” Now I don't hate my life as much.” And while Bunnie says the clean-shaven look isn't her favorite, even she couldn't deny one thing: “That jawline though!” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

In writer-director James Vanderbilt's “Nuremberg,” Russell Crowe plays Nazi Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring in the days following World War II, when he was arrested by Allied forces and forced to stand trial for his war crimes. The film's secret weapon in this regard is the sound design, which strips down the sound design in Göring's cell to give every line, breath, and silence emotional power. When he came on board the movie, supervising sound editor and re-recording mixer Michael Babcock saw creating a complex characterization of Göring as one of the biggest challenges looming before him and his collaborators. Related Stories Christopher Nolan Says ‘The Odyssey' Contains ‘a Bit of Everything in It' Pope Leo XIV Gives His Blessing to the Theatrical Experience: ‘Cinemas and Theaters Are the Beating Hearts of Our Communities' “It was one of those projects where we talked less about sound than what was going to inform the sound, because I was really enthralled with how they were going to balance making Göring human without making him sympathetic. Babcock began work on the film with a deep dive into historical research, figuring out what trains and backgrounds would have sounded like in 1940s Germany, but was guided throughout the process through the performances. “There's a lot of gray area there,” Babcock said, noting that his job was to build mood through layers of atmosphere that might register with the viewer only on a subliminal level, or after the fact. For the many scenes between Göring and his lawyer, Babcock found himself relying on modern technology to create a period sound. “I spent a lot of time on those scenes because I was so enthralled by what they were doing as actors,” Babcock said, noting that making the sound unnoticeable required an insane amount of work. “The cell had to sound like it was made of German cement, but the set itself does not sound like that. Babcock relied on technology that he said has come out in the last two or three years — “not AI,” he is quick to note — to take superfluous noise out, recreate the space as it would have sounded in the 1940s, and then “put it all back in to make it seem like nothing happened to the sound.” Babcock wanted the sound in the cell to convey a sense of claustrophobia and of no escape from the serious topics under discussion. In real life, the courtroom had been built in a bombed-out building, and Babcock wanted to get across what that meant psychologically. “There are creaks where it's almost like it's breathing,” he said, adding that he used reverb to give a sense of gravitas to the setting and went on eBay to buy a period-authentic stenograph machine for the location. Given the darkness of the subject matter, “Nuremberg” was a heavy project to take on, but it did provide pleasures in the form of finding period sounds for trains, cars, and other vehicles and props. “There were a lot of gut checks where we would ask, ‘Does that sound too Hollywood? '” Babcock said, noting that a hanging scene in the movie was particularly challenging. It's all about embracing how immersive you can make something.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SNL‘s Weekend Update was sizzling tonight — going no frills and eschewing guests, bits and standup sets — with numerous shots taken at President Donald Trump‘s expense following the release of hundreds and thousands of Jeffrey Epstein emails this week further implicating the GOP leader's involvement in the the disgraced mogul's sex trafficking operation. “Well, the longest government shutdown in history finally ended after 43 days, and you know, first day back in the office, you gotta check all those piled-up emails,” co-host Colin Jost began, kicking off a relentless torrent of jokes. He continued: “House Democrats released an email written by Jeffrey Epstein in which he claims that Donald Trump ‘knew about the girls.' It's bombshell news that legal experts are calling ‘duh. “In one of the emails, Epstein's brother asked if Vladimir Putin has a picture of Donald Trump giving oral sex to someone named Bubba, which was an old nickname for Bill Clinton, so I guess that's one job that Trump has created,” he said, adding that while he doesn't know for sure if the allegation is true, the thought of it is nonetheless “burned in my brain like that scene from The Shining.” The co-anchor then referenced an email in which Epstein said he was the only figure “able to take Trump down, which is pretty big talk for a guy who lost to a bedsheet.” The lob at Epstein's demise — ruled as a suicide by hanging via a shirt or sheet — garnered shocked reactions from the audience. This week, headlines were also dominated by Trump's ongoing spat with BBC, the UK broadcaster he accused of editing his January 6 speech in a misleading manner and for which he has since threatened legal action. Che, apparently conceding the point, then offered to air the real footage, which resulted in a spliced video of Trump saying: “Everybody knows I went down on Bill Clinton.” In another hit at Trump, Che said POTUS “denied online rumors that the gold decorations in the Oval Office came from Home Depot, even though he has a whole team of guys taking stuff from Home Depot all the time,” as the screen flashed an image of ICE agents. As a bonus, Che addressed the cessation of penny production with a perfect pun: “The U.S. Mint this week stopped producing new pennies. Doesn't make sense [cents].” After audience enthusiasm for the joke, Che offered another option: “One last severe blow to Lincoln's head.” Following a more mixed response, he stood corrected: “I'll do the first one.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

We played these random kids and that was rough,” Chalamet remembered, as Sandler added, “You're very good, awesome. We played these two kids, just out of nowhere they just so happened to be so fucking good.” (Soon after, one turned up as Sandler's waiter on a night out). Timothée Chalamet talks to Adam Sandler about playing Paul Atreides and reveals he wrapped #Dune3 four days ago pic.twitter.com/szDrStZeCO The pair discussed moments on Saturday Night Live, as well as Chalamet shooting Call Me By Your Name, Dune (revealing he just wrapped the third film four days ago) and A Complete Unknown; for Sandler, the Punch-Drunk Love segment was a highlight, as Chalamet gushed, “To actors across all ages but really my generation, it's one of the most important performances — impactful, deeply moving. The younger star continued, “Hopefully Jay Kelly, it should have been Uncut Gems — I know it's not about awards but you should have a golden man in your hand because you're one of the best fucking actors.” Speaking of Jay Kelly, Sandler brought it back to basketball while noting he used to play with co-star George Clooney, as Chalamet responded, “No way, he balls?” Chalamet asked Sandler how he keeps his comedic edge with such a stable personal life, as Sandler turned the “how do you do it?” question back on him after seeing what he deals with in public. “You have it worse than me because you've got so many fucking photographers following you and shit, which makes life nuts,” Sandler said, as Chalamet joked that was only when the pair were playing basketball and he called the paparazzi to come to capture the moment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Glen Powell‘s debut as Saturday Night Live host finally occurred after four years in the making—and for four years, a UPS driver who delivered to his house wondered if he was making it all up. When he got the news, he said, a UPS driver had just pulled up, and Powell and his family celebrated by taking a group photo with him. But when the film got pushed back due to Covid, Powell said, executive producer Lorne Michaels told him: “Without Top Gun, no one will know who the f— you are.” And the invitation was pulled. Which means for four years, this UPS driver was going around saying Glen Powell is a liar,” he said. What feels even better than hosting, he added, is “proving that I am not crazy.” Powell, 37, then explained how Mitch ended up in the studio audience. “This is real: my sisters tracked him down—because the women in my family are terrifying—and they found the cell number of this guy,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"You know that, as a band, Black Sabbath don't take things lying down," Sharon wrote on Instagram. Sharon Osbourne is pushing back against an attempt to release early Black Sabbath recordings, publicly challenging former band manager Jim Simpson after he issued a press release claiming legal ownership of the tapes. Jennifer Aniston, Max Greenfield Help Alex Warren Announce Arena Tour Pete Townshend Brings 'Quadrophenia, A Rock Ballet' to NYC on His Own Dime, Dedicates U.S. Kim Kardashian and Britney Spears Cozy Up With Khloe at Pajama Party: 'Calabasas Nights' Sharon publicly disputed those claims in a detailed Instagram post shared on Saturday (Nov. 15). Her post included screenshots of a July 2 email she says she sent to Simpson, warning him against moving forward without the band's approval. “You know that, as a band, Black Sabbath don't take things lying down and you can be assured that if you go ahead with this against the Band's wishes we will take any action where their rights are infringed, both here and in America.” While recordings from this era have long been of interest to collectors, the group has historically kept tight control over their early catalog and archival releases. Sharon responded by calling Waters “one of the most twisted, sick individuals I've come across in years.” For now, Simpson's proposed release of Earth: The Legendary Lost Tapes appears stalled, but Sharon's post signals the band's intention to challenge any distribution that doesn't involve Black Sabbath's approval.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>James Pickens Jr. has revealed he's been diagnosed with prostate cancer. In a new interview with Black Health Matters, the actor opened up about his diagnosis and how it has affected several family members. “It's not the kind of news anyone wants to hear, but to be honest, prostate cancer has run through my family. The actor continued: “I've got a 90-year-old first cousin, who's still alive, actually; he had it. A couple of his brothers had it. Pickens —  who has starred on Grey's Anatomy since the show's premiere in 2005, appearing across all 22 seasons — said he has been proactive about getting health screenings. He stressed that prostate cancer is “highly treatable,” but that “early detection is the key” in last week's Grey's Anatomy episode via a PSA. “My urologist said, ‘Because you were so diligent in that piece of your health, it was to your advantage,” he told Black Health Matters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From an outsider's point of view, Hollywood's ongoing efforts to smoosh its various constituent parts together until the entire film and television industry is just one gigantic fatberg lurking in the Los Angeles sewers, periodically releasing toxic gasses and superhero movies in equal measure, can feel like they're already an antitrust nightmare in all but name. Discovery is putting itself up on the sales block has now provoked genuine murmurings of worries about antitrust issues from at least one United States legislator. Specifically—per Variety—that's California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, and, even more specifically, his concerns are about what could happen if streaming giant Netflix comes out on top in the sale. That being said, Issa did raise some interesting points about Netflix in particular in a recent letter to the Trump White House and the Department Of Justice's antitrust division. Prominently, Issa points out that owning both its own streaming base and HBO Max would likely put Netflix over the 30 percent market share line that usually gets monopoly alarms blaring even amongst the most lax of governmental regulatory regimes. Even beyond that, though, the letter raises questions about Netflix's stances toward theaters, specifically. “This consolidation would also diminish incentives to produce new content and major theatrical releases,” Issa writes. “Evidenced by Netflix's own statements dismissing movie theatres as ‘outdated', which could undermine opportunities for the full range of industry professionals both in front of and behind the camera.” Whilst musing demurely about a potential acquisition in recent months, Netflix execs have made it clear that, unlike Paramount's offer, they wouldn't be looking to buy all of Warner Bros. (Netflix is not inclined to suddenly own a bunch of cable networks, for instance.) It's certainly easy to imagine that vast machine being turned away from theatrical releases and toward ever more streaming content, all aimed at the shortest attention spans imaginable, which is a scary thought even amidst the context of other scary thoughts about endless media corporation consolidation.
