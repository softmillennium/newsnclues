                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wilmer Geovanny Chavarría Barre, known as “Pipo,” the alleged leader of drug trafficking gang Los Lobos – Ecuador's most powerful and violent criminal organization – has been arrested in Spain, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa announced on Sunday. “Today we captured ‘Pipo' Chavarría, the most wanted criminal in the region and top leader of Los Lobos,” President Noboa posted on his official X account. The announcement coincided with a national referendum in Ecuador, which includes proposals aimed at combating organized crime, such as the potential reintroduction of foreign military bases. Ecuador's Minister of Defense, John Reimberg, stated that Chavarría was “responsible for at least 400 deaths,” and said the arrest was the result of a coordinated operation between Ecuador's National Police and Spanish authorities. Chavarría is accused of orchestrating assassinations, controlling illegal mining operations, and trafficking narcotics in collaboration with Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). Noboa said the gang leader had “faked his death, changed his identity, and hid in Europe while continuing to direct criminal operations in Ecuador.” Los Lobos - designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. in September 2024 - has been linked to drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, and providing armed support to CJNG in securing key cocaine routes, particularly in the city of Guayaquil. The US Treasury Department  sanctioned the group in June 2024, stating it had “thousands of members” and was a major driver of escalating violence across Ecuador. Authorities suspect Los Lobos of involvement in the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio on August 9, 2023, in Quito. Chavarría's arrest marks a major development in Ecuador's ongoing fight against transnational organized crime.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday called Donald Trump's remarks labeling her a traitor and a lunatic “hurtful” but said she hopes she and the US president can “make up”, despite stark differences over policy and the release of documents about Jeffrey Epstein. Greene, a longtime ally and fierce defender of Trump and the “Make America great again” (Maga) base, pushed back against his name-calling in her first interview since Trump withdrew his support for her on Friday. Greene had said in an X post that “a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world”, without referring to Trump by name, adding it was “the man I supported and helped get elected”. She did not go into further detail on Sunday morning about the nature and sources of such threats. But she added in her TV interview about Trump's attacks, especially the label traitor: “Those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger.” Even though the Senate is expected to kill any such bill, the upcoming vote and last week's release of thousands of documents with revelations about Epstein's ties to Trump, Steve Bannon and other powerful figures, is putting huge pressure on the administration, including from victims of Epstein. Greene also called on Sunday for an end to “toxic infighting” in politics. “I'm sorry for taking part in the toxic politics … put down the knives, be kind to one another … I never wanted to cause any harm,” Greene said. “I would like to see Air Force One parked and staying at home,” she said. But she ended the interview with CNN, when asked if there could be reconciliation with Trump, by saying: “Well, I certainly hope that we can make up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President to overhaul state energy firms after $100m kickback scheme  alleged by anti-corruption investigators Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a plan to clean up Ukraine's energy sector after an $100m (£76bn) kickback scheme was alleged by anti-corruption investigators, in the worst scandal of his presidency. Any scheme uncovered in these companies must receive a swift and just response.” He also promised to appoint new leaders at the top of other energy bodies. Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau announced last Monday that it was investigating a criminal gang behind a scheme whereby Energoatom's counterparties were forced to pay kickbacks of 10-15% in order to avoid having payments blocked or losing their supplier status. Ukrainian media subsequently reported that one of the senior figures involved was Timur Mindich, a businessman and co-owner of a media production company founded by Zelenskyy before he became president. The Ukrainian government is urgently seeking alternatives to compensate for losses caused by relentless Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. The agreement between Greece's state-owned gas company, DEPA Commercial, and its Ukrainian counterpart, Naftogaz, will supply Ukraine with US liquefied natural gas via Greece between December 2025 and March 2026. ‘This winter under Russian drones, missiles, and daily strikes is a major challenge for Ukraine and for the Ukrainian people,” Zelenskyy posted on X during his visit, where he met the Greek president, Constantine Tassoulas, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and the new US ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle. The Ukrainian president expressed his gratitude to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, for the US energy supplied via Greece. The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, told the Associated Press news agency that Zelenskyy had to deal quickly with the corruption allegations, but also praised his wartime leadership and urged European leaders to increase financial and military support for Ukraine. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking progress in Ukraine's EU accession talks, has seized on the anti-corruption investigation, claiming it showed “a wartime mafia network” with “countless ties” to Zelenskyy. They include the president's friend and former business partner Mindich, who fled his Kyiv apartment last Monday hours before investigators came to arrest him. Mindich – who co-founded Zelenskyy's media production company, Kvartal 95 – escaped to Poland in a taxi. Both are implicated in the affair, in which a group of government officials are accused of taking kickbacks from contracts with Energoatom. Ukrainian media have reported that Mindich was allegedly involved in a bid to supply body armour to the defence ministry, via an Israeli firm and shell companies. But Umerov, who denies any improper influence, said a contract was terminated and stressed no items were ever delivered. Nabu officials acknowledge Ukraine has a corruption problem, nearly four years after Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion. But they pointed out the scandal had come to light – something that would be unlikely in neighbouring Russia orHungary, they added. It's about Ukraine's struggle and fight against corruption,” Oleksandr Abakumov, the head of Nabu's investigating team, said.</p>

ATHENS, November 16. /TASS/. Greece is launching a Vertical Corridor to supply gas to Ukraine, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said after a meeting with visiting Vladimir Zelensky.

Earlier in the day, Greek and Ukrainian gas companies signed a memorandum of intent on deliveries of liquefied natural gas from the United States to Ukraine from December 2025 until March 2026.

"Our countries are now acquiring a new critically important aspect of cooperation - a new safe energy mains running from the south to the north, from Greece to Ukraine, via the Vertical Gas Corridor that will link a [LNF regasification] terminal near [Greek city of] Alexandroupoli and Odessa," he said as quoted by the ERT-news television channel. "It means that Ukraine will have immediate access to diversified and reliable sources of energy and Greece will become a hub for American LNG supplies to Central and Eastern Europe."

The Greek prime minister also said that he had discussed with Zelensky further support for Ukraine jointly with the partners and prospects for bilateral cooperation. "One of the most important issues is our support in the post-war restoration of Ukraine involving Greek companies," Mitsotakis added.</p>

Neither Prague nor its partners, however, have put forward a definite plan on keeping the scheme operational in its current form should the new government abandon it. Czech officials say Babis's suggestion to have NATO take over it is not feasible, and that simply passing it over to another country would also be a tall feat. The Czech ammunition initiative, hailed by its proponents as Prague's greatest achievement on the international stage, was launched in early 2024 amid Ukraine's severe ammunition shortage. Czechia said it had delivered 1.5 million shells, including the sorely needed 155 mm and 122 mm calibers, under the initiative last year, and an additional 1.3 million by October 2025. Babis has been ambiguous about the project's future. While initially vowing to cancel it altogether if elected, his party later toned down its rhetoric, calling instead for a review or for the initiative to be passed under NATO's wing. But the outgoing Czech Defense Ministry has already ruled out the option, saying that "NATO does not and cannot buy materiel for Ukraine" and materiel purchases and donations are "always carried out by individual members." Czech news outlet Seznam Zpravy reported that, according to its sources, Estonia is being discussed as a possible candidate. However, Tallinn has ruled out such an option when asked by the Kyiv Independent. "I do not comment on the content of diplomatic talks," Czech Foreign Ministry spokesperson Daniel Drake told the Kyiv Independent. "We rule out that the Czech ambassador to Estonia conducted any such talks." Tomas Kopecny, a Czech official who was one of the initiative's architects, confirmed that talks with partners about the project's future have been underway but denied that transferring it to another country was discussed. Czechia has been leveraging its extensive contacts in the global arms market to oversee the initiative, gathering approximately $4.5 billion from 15 donor countries. While the outgoing Czech government made its staunchly pro-Western and pro-Kyiv policy one of its key pillars, Babis has been dodgy on the topic of Ukraine. Babis said his cabinet would no longer allocate defense aid to Ukraine from the state budget, noting that Kyiv should receive support through the EU instead. As they seek to assess the direction of the incoming Czech government, Ukrainian officials have struck a cautious tone — thanking Prague for its past support and awaiting next steps. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent in October, lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko lauded Czechia's initiative to gather artillery ammunition for Ukraine "when we needed it the most." Both Ukraine and its European partners have ramped up artillery production in recent years, with Kyiv's priorities currently focused on securing additional air defenses in the face of Russian aerial attacks. Merezhko, who heads the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee, said that while the ammunition initiative has been "extremely important" for Kyiv, it would not be a critical loss now if it is scrapped.

"There is no decision at present but we can make the decision tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, two days after tomorrow. We are obliged to finally decide before the next week," he noted. Serbia can make an offer if Moscow and the third party do not agree upon the price, he said. "If Russians fail to come to terms on the price with a third party, my proposal is to consider an option that we offer the best price," Vucic said. Belgrade seeks after avoiding any radical steps, he stressed. "I want to avoid confiscation, nationalization and property seizure at any cost. I want the whole world to see: we do not want to detract something from anyone," Vucic noted. US OFAC told Belgrade earlier about the requirement to completely oust Russian shareholders from NIS. The US said in writing that it does not accept any decisions on change of control without the change of the owner and excluded the possibility for Russian participation to be kept via affiliates of Gazprom or the Russian government sector.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Doug Ford, General Motors Canada outgoing President Scott Bell and François-Philippe Champagne sit in the back of a pickup truck in Oshawa, Ont.Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press It's the spring of 2022 and federal and Ontario government officials are standing on the floor of a General Motors GM-N plant in Oshawa, Ont., to announce they were giving the automaker more than half a billion dollars. Politicians took their turns at the microphone to declare the money would secure high-paying assembly jobs, reduce GM's cost of making cars in Ontario and forge Canada's future as a centre for green-vehicle manufacturing. “Folks, this is just another huge win for the people of Durham and all of Ontario,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters. “Today is proof that Canada's auto sector is here for the long term,” said François-Philippe Champagne, then Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. Fast-forward to today and the picture is very different. In Oshawa, the third shift of workers – including about 700 jobs – is set to be eliminated in January and truck production is declining. Meanwhile, GM has boosted production of the Silverado in Fort Wayne, Ind., and is busily retooling a plant in Orion, Mich., to make more of the pickup trucks by 2027. Similarly, Stellantis NV STLA-N said in October it would move planned production of the Jeep Compass to Illinois from its plant in Brampton. That factory was also being retooled with taxpayer support. ‘We feel betrayed': Laid off for years, Stellantis workers in Brampton confront a grim new reality She declined to provide details of the agreements with governments. Even before Mr. Trump began his campaign of destroying the Canadian auto sector, parts of the industry were not in great shape. But the retreat has gained pace since Mr. Trump took office. Opinion: Canadian leaders are naive to be shocked over Stellantis pulling Jeeps from Brampton The grants GM received from governments were to cover capital expenses of building the Oshawa and Ingersoll assembly lines and related work. Typically, governments give automakers grants worth 20 per cent of their capital budgets. Jason Clemens, executive vice-president of the Fraser Institute, calls the auto subsidies “corporate welfare” and bad public policy that lead to higher taxes with no long-term economic gain. The same can be said for much of Ontario's broader auto sector – its presence has long relied on government aid. Without subsidies, “we would have seen a much bigger decline in our auto industry over the last generation,” said Jim Stanford, economist and director at the Centre for Future Work. For decades, taxpayer aid for the Canadian auto sector has encouraged companies to keep plants running, retool and continue to provide well-paying jobs. In 1987, governments gave GM and partner Suzuki $112-million in grants and incentives to build the Ingersoll plant – the one now shuttered. As EV sales slump, NextStar says it has shifted its focus to stationary batteries – not EVs – as production starts this month. Champagne, as Finance Minister, notified GM he is “disappointed” by GM's production cuts in Ontario and reduced the automaker's tariff-free import quota by 24 per cent, while also reducing Stellantis's quota. Ottawa's move to curb tariff relief for GM, Stellantis will harm country's auto sector, manufacturers say Details of the agreements governments and automakers reach are confidential. Financial aid usually takes a few forms: cash grants, tax breaks or production subsidies. Generally, there are strings attached related to employment, production and amounts spent by the companies themselves. Ontario's legal team is in touch with GM to ensure the funding agreements are respected and enforced, said Jennifer Cunliffe, a spokeswoman for Ontario's Minister of Economic Development Victor Fedeli. She did not address questions about how much of the $259-million has been granted to GM. The U.S.-imposed tariffs and the slowing growth in demand for battery-electric vehicles upended recent government subsidy policies, said Saibal Ray, a professor at McGill University. “Before Trump, you can make a case these were necessary and were perhaps effective, but today it's not clear because there is no guarantee that things will work as they are meant to work,” Prof. Ray said. Peter Frise, a professor at the University of Windsor, said carmakers are good at forecasting how production plans and consumer demand will let them fulfill financial covenants with governments. But the Trump era turned that on its head. He added, “I really don't ascribe bad faith to the companies right now. The money would be better spent reducing taxes and creating conditions for all businesses to succeed, he said. Study and track financial data on any traded entity: click to open the full quote page.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Intervention is latest sign of Donald Trump's willingness to interfere in domestic British affairs Donald Trump's administration is exploring the possibility of extending refugee status to free speech activists who have been prosecuted for their words or for taking part in silent protests outside abortion clinics. A source close to the administration described the plan as “serious” and that while it was not top of the list of concerns, officials are “beginning to consider” offering political asylum to British citizens accused of so-called thought crimes. Mr Trump has already set a precedent for political asylum cases by granting refugee status to white South Africans who claimed they face racial discrimination in their home country. Despite halting nearly all other refugee admissions shortly after returning to office in January, the president swiftly organised a scheme to allow in Afrikaners, the descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, who claim they have been denied jobs and targeted with violence because of their race. The decision was largely influenced by Elon Musk, who has attacked the Government and British police forces for arresting individuals over offences, comments and so-called thought crimes. In October, it was reported that the president may offer political asylum to Europeans who oppose migration. At the United Nations, he warned that their countries were “going to hell” because of unchecked immigration. “They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Earlier this year, Sir Keir's attempts to strike a trade deal with the US were almost stifled over the case of Ms Tossici-Bolt, who was prosecuted for holding a sign near a Bournemouth abortion clinic reading: “Here to talk if you want.” Asked about the comments, a source familiar with trade negotiations told The Telegraph there should be “no free trade without free speech”. The intervention came after the president dispatched US officials to meet British pro-life activists over concerns their right to protest was being stifled. Led by Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the state department, they interviewed a handful of pro-life activists who had been arrested for silently protesting outside abortion clinics across Britain. Since then, the Trump administration has also raised questions about the conviction and sentencing of several high-profile cases, including that of Lucy Connolly. Ms Connolly was jailed over a social media post calling for asylum hotels to be set on fire in the hours after three girls were murdered at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Maga firebrand says she fears for her safety amid row with the US president over Epstein files Marjorie Taylor Greene has accused Donald Trump of inciting death threats against her after the former allies fell out in a bitter public row over the Epstein files on Friday night. The Georgia congresswoman claimed on Saturday that she had been contacted by several private security firms warning of risks to her safety, which she alleged were “egged on” by the US president. “I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected,” Ms Greene wrote in a post on X. It is unclear which companies she was referring to and The Telegraph could not verify her claims. I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world.The man I supported and helped get elected.Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically… She has also been increasingly critical of what she says is the president's lack of focus on domestic policy and solutions to end the recent US government shutdown, claiming that “all our country does is fund foreign countries and foreign wars, and never does anything to help the American people”. “Marjorie ‘Traitor' Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!” he wrote. “Just another Fake politician, no different than Rand Paul Jr. (Thomas Massie), who got caught being a full fledged Republican In Name Only (RINO)! On Friday, he ordered Pamela Bondi, his attorney general, to investigate Epstein's alleged links with Bill Clinton, the former US president. “I never thought that fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are,” she wrote on X. “As a Republican, who overwhelmingly votes for President Trump's bills and agenda, his aggression against me which also fuels the venomous nature of his radical internet trolls (many of whom are paid), this is completely shocking to everyone. CNN reported that, before her election to Congress, Ms Greene liked a social media post saying that a “bullet to the head” was the easiest way to remove then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from power and endorsed a commenter who expressed enthusiasm for hanging Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.</p>

U.S. immigration authorities have surged enforcement operations to Charlotte, North Carolina, and agents were seen making multiple arrests across the city on Nov. 15.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a press statement on Saturday. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have spoken over the phone ahead of the UN Security Council vote on the deployment of peacekeepers in Gaza. The Kremlin said on Saturday that "a thorough exchange of views took place on the situation in the Middle East region, including developments in the Gaza Strip in the context of implementing the ceasefire agreement and the exchange of detainees.” The leaders also discussed Iran's nuclear program and the situation in Syria. Netanyahu's office released a shorter statement, saying that the Israeli prime minister and the Russian president had discussed “regional issues.” Earlier this month, the US circulated a proposed resolution authorizing the deployment of the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza for a period of at least two years and calling for the establishment of the so-called Board of Peace as a transitional governing body. On Friday, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Türkiye, Pakistan, and Indonesia released a joint statement backing the American proposal. Moscow has submitted an alternative proposal tasking the UN secretary general with drawing up options for implementing US President Donald Trump's peace plan. The Russian mission criticized the American plan for lacking “instruments of oversight and control” over the stabilization force and not mentioning the two-state solution. It said that “only a truly equal and inclusive approach” can guarantee peace. Both proposals are expected to be put to a vote on Monday. Read RT Privacy policy to find out more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of suspected Haitian gang members fired this week on American forces protecting the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince, a spokesman said Saturday, in an incident that highlighted the tense security situation in the Caribbean nation. Steven J. Keenan, a spokesman for the US Marines, wrote in an email that the shooting, which came to light this weekend, happened Thursday, adding that the Marines returned fire. Haitian police were not immediately available to comment on the exchange of fire. Gangs control 90% of Haiti's capital, where they extort businesses and fight for territory, using heavy weaponry. The United States continues to operate an embassy in Haiti, but in recent years the State Department has issued numerous warnings telling Americans not to travel there, due to the risk of kidnappings, crimes, terrorist activity and civil unrest. According to the United Nations, gang violence has displaced more than 1.3 million Haitians from their homes in recent years. Security in the nation of nearly 12 million people has deteriorated rapidly since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home by mercenaries. The president's murder has generated a power vacuum that politicians in the nation have struggled to fill, and no elections have been held to replace Moise. In late September, the United Nations Security Council voted to create a gang suppression force of about 5,500 troops that will be deployed to Haiti to fight the nation's heavily armed criminal groups. A smaller force of police officers from Kenya has struggled to contain gangs, which killed 5,600 people last year, according to the UN Human Rights Office.</p>
