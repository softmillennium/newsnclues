                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[Buenos Aires, November 16, 2025], Guardians of the Ball, the pioneering virtual world transforming how fans experience football, today at Polkadot's flagship conference, sub0 Symbiosis, announced the launch of Guardians ID, a global loyalty program that is going to be built on and powered by Polkadot/JAM and re-architected accordingly to the values of the Web3 Foundation. Ready to gamify and elevate the traditional fútbol fan experience, Guardians ID turns passion into participation by connecting clubs, leagues, federations, and brands with fans through a seamless, blockchain-based rewards and engagement ecosystem. The Guardians ID Fan Passport acts as an official credential that allows fans to register as supporters of their favorite clubs, national teams, or leagues. From cashback on official merchandise and tickets to digital tokens redeemable for premium experiences, the Guardians ID ecosystem transforms fandom into a dynamic loop of engagement and benefits, all secured through Polkadot and JAM infrastructure, and looking to provide a solid use case to the recently announced proof of individuality. By integrating with Polkadot, Guardians of the Ball ensures interoperability, scalability, and trust across its expanding world of digital stadiums, live experiences, and official partnerships. The blockchain foundation enables transparent, tamper-proof verification of fan interactions while allowing clubs and brands to design customized campaigns, rewards, and digital assets for their communities. PBA identifies, trains, and supports high-potential founders and projects that demonstrate how blockchain technology can redefine real-world industries. “Today, the only operations we can reliably execute on-chain are transactions that link wallets with digital assets. Like every major product (application) worldwide, the core systems behind Guardians of the Ball and Guardians ID still depend on centralized infrastructures such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Cloudflare, as well as traditional game-engine architectures. When we discovered JAM and its underlying concepts, we realized it offered a path to finally materialize our long-term vision: building a complete technology stack that aligns with the Web3 Foundation's values, with a user-facing application that is decentralized and resilient at its core ” said Alan Cura CEO at Guardians of the Ball. Within its immersive virtual world, users can explore digital twins of real stadiums, themed art galleries featuring renowned artists and athletes, mini-games, live broadcasts, prediction market integrations, and more. Through direct alliances with clubs, national teams, leagues, and federations, Guardians of the Ball connects institutions with millions of fans worldwide. Businesses and sponsors can also integrate seamlessly into the platform, offering official products, services, and rewards through the Guardians ID loyalty program. Next year, during the Final of FIFA World Cup 2026, 80,000 people will be at the stadium, while Billions will be engaged digitally. It seeks to turn every moment that makes up this beautiful game into a playful and rewarding experience, allowing fans around the world to live football from a unique, social, and immersive digital perspective. The Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA) is a globally renowned educational initiative co-founded by Dr. Gavin Wood (founder of Polkadot) in 2022 and designed to train the next generation of blockchain developers, entrepreneurs, and leaders. PBA delivers state-of-the-art blockchain training through both intensive in-person “Campus” programs and online courses. Polkadot is the powerful, secure core of Web3, providing a shared foundation that unites some of the world's most transformative apps and blockchains. Polkadot offers advanced modular architecture that allows devs to easily design and build their own specialized blockchain projects, pooled security that ensures the same high standard for secure block production across all connected chains and apps connected to it, and robust governance that ensures a transparent system where everyone has a say in shaping the ecosystem for growth and sustainability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This crossover is widely viewed in technical analysis as a bearish signal because it reflects weakening short-term momentum relative to the longer trend. However, this can also act as a possible positive signal. Bitcoin is currently down about 25% from its October all time high around $126,000 and this correction has been ongoing for roughly 41 days. In September 2023, bitcoin bottomed near $25,000, in August 2024 during the yen carry trade unwind it found support around $49,000, and then in April 2025, during uncertainty around President Trump's tariff policy, BTC bottomed below $75,000. This current drawdown is less severe than the April correction, when bitcoin dropped below $75,000 during the tariff related turmoil. With current selloff of 25% and 41 days, perhaps further downside still possible. It took until Feb. 9 2019 for bitcoin to recover, approximately two weeks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>J.K. Rowling, the creator of the popular and critically acclaimed Harry Potter series of novels, once expressed genuine confusion about Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), inviting a flood of explanations from prominent figures across the cryptocurrency world. Please explain it to me,” the British novelist asked inquisitively. This post quickly went viral, eliciting thousands of responses from cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Among the many responders was Vitalik Buterin, early blockchain pioneer and co-founder of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH). Tron (CRYPTO: TRX) founder Justin Sun went a step ahead, referencing Rowling's books to drive home the idea. He described Bitcoin as a “magic coin” which “Dumbledore” doesn't understand, but “Harry Potter” is fascinated by. Avoid Overtrading, Wait For These Clear Levels Despite the effort, Rowling found the explanations overwhelming and ultimately said, “I don't think I trust this.” “Things like this are white noise to me. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also waded in, stressing that “massive” currency printing by central banks is making Bitcoin internet monet look “solid.” Rowling's interaction was brief and skeptical, with no endorsement or advocacy for the cryptocurrency from her side yet. Interestingly, Bitcoin has risen 933% since Rowling made those posts. Top stories, top movers, and trade ideas delivered to your inbox every weekday before and after the market closes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum continues to trade inside a deeply compressed downtrend, with repeated rejections from lower-high resistance. While the broader structure remains bearish, signs of sell-side exhaustion and deep liquidity pockets above the price keep the door open for a relief expansion if buyers reclaim key levels. Ethereum has extended its decline within a persistent descending channel, repeatedly failing to break above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, both of which have now turned into dynamic resistance. This region has historically attracted medium-term buyers and is reinforced by a visible positive divergence in the RSI, indicating a slowdown in bearish momentum. On the 4H timeframe, ETH continues to move within a sharp falling wedge. Each attempt to break higher has been rejected at the descending trendline and at the aligned $3.55K and $3.8K supply zones. These stacked supply layers have repeatedly capped upside attempts. Failure at this midpoint would keep the falling-wedge continuation intact and sustain the probability of a retest of $3K or even a brief deviation below it before any meaningful reversal. The two-week liquidation heatmap highlights a dense concentration of resting long liquidations overhead, especially between $3.6K and $3.9K. This bright cluster is the primary liquidity magnet for any upward expansion. Historically, Ethereum tends to gravitate toward these high-liquidity shelves when the market enters a short-term relief phase. Below the price, the liquidity is far thinner, meaning any downward continuation is likely to be sharp but short-lived, driven more by stop-runs than sustained selling. The largest imbalance sits at $3.8K–$3.9K, suggesting that if Ethereum manages to reclaim structure at $3.45K, a swift squeeze into that band becomes the most probable scenario.

Stepping back, Figure Technology Solutions is an investment for those who believe blockchain can fundamentally change consumer finance and capital markets. The latest quarterly results reinforce this theme, with record revenues and profit from rapid adoption of its blockchain-enabled lending marketplace and emerging products like Democratized Prime. The confidential filing for a blockchain-native equity share class now shifts attention to how Figure might lead in digitizing public capital markets infrastructure, potentially unlocking entirely new business lines. This news could accelerate some catalysts, such as broader ecosystem adoption and institutional partnerships, while also intensifying execution risk, regulatory uncertainty, and market volatility as investors digest ambitious innovation claims. Still, share price volatility, high valuation levels, a relatively inexperienced management team, and recent insider selling keep risk squarely in focus. Whether the recent financial momentum translates into lasting market leadership remains an open question. On the other hand, leadership in such a fast-moving space carries elevated regulatory and operational risks investors should watch closely.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chainlink and Aster have grabbed headlines lately, with recent recommendations from analysts. But in the shadows of these familiar names, one altcoin known as Opter is quietly building momentum. The new Decentralized Perpetuals Exchange has already drawn investors, and its presale is selling rapidly. Find out more about the recent developments of LINK, $ASTER and  OPTER token, which have experts recommending them as three of the best altcoins to include in your investment portfolio. While SEC approval is still pending, history shows that DTCC listings often precede greenlights, giving the market reason to be optimistic. Traders will be watching key levels, and this development sets the stage for potential gains once LINK regains momentum and breaks above $16.80. This signals confidence and sets the stage for potential upside momentum. The bullish sentiment has also been reinforced by recent buybacks, which got rid of a staggering 2.4 million tokens. A good breakout from there might even be possible due to the aforementioned strategic market accumulation. This new Decentralized Perpetuals Exchange is already competing with top CEXs like Binance or Coinbase by offering non-custodial access. This means traders can keep full control of their funds— a rare level of transparency and self-custody in today's perpetuals market. The perpetual trading platform also introduces an innovative Opter XP System, which rewards traders with 800 OPTER for every $100,000 volume traded. There's also a one-click trading UX, which enables users to very easily execute trades and concentrate on strategy as opposed to blockchain delays. Early supporters also gain access to daily staking rewards and deflationary mechanisms. There's also a staking APR ranging from 40% to 110%, giving traders both short-term yield and long-term growth potential. While Chainlink continues to gain attention with its ETF milestone and Aster rallies with strategic whale accumulation, Opter stands out as a next-level opportunity for traders seeking both utility and rewards. You'll benefit not just from its presale and advanced trading platform, but also via its Opter XP System and multiple Opter Airdrops.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin traded near $95,648, up +0.04%, while Ethereum hovered around $3,168, a small gain of 0.16%. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, told his audience on X that he has no plans to sell his Bitcoin or gold, despite the sharp decline in prices. A:  The real reason I am not selling is because the… Kiyosaki also warned that what he calls “The Big Print” is coming, echoing Lawrence Lepard's view that governments may resort to heavy money creation to manage rising debt. 1:  I willl buy more Bitcoin when crash is over. Bitcoin, meanwhile, slipped below its short-term trend line this week as a bearish crossover formed on the daily chart. Traders often treat this setup as a possible “death cross.” In past cycles, similar crossovers lined up with local bottoms that later produced strong rebounds. If Bitcoin is still tracking its usual cycle, past patterns suggest buyers tend to appear within a few days of a death cross. DISCOVER: 9+ Best High-Risk, High-Reward Crypto to Buy in November2025 It has been slightly steadier than Bitcoin on the weekly chart, but there's still no real signal of a recovery. A key on-chain signal shows that traders have little reason left to lock in profits. Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) has slipped to 0.23, its lowest reading since July 1. NUPL measures how much unrealized gain or loss sits across the market and helps track shifts in sentiment. It moves through phases such as capitulation, when most wallets hold losses, and belief or denial, when confidence starts to build. The split highlights a market caught between caution and conviction, leaving Ethereum's short-term direction unclear. Ethereum's short-term trend still points lower, and Crypto Tony says a liquidity sweep may come before any solid recovery. The chart places ETH near $3,170, moving within a clear corrective structure. That area lines up with the previous swing low marked as wave (a), where many stops are likely resting. The chart also shows a rising wedge that broke down earlier in the move, a sign that momentum had already weakened. ETH failed to push past the wave (b) high near $3,250 and turned lower soon after, showing sellers still have control.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our team is working diligently to resolve the issue. It takes a lot of electricity to mine Bitcoin. When electricity costs are high, it can be unprofitable to mine. The coin has a built-in mechanism to help that situation translate into higher prices. Traditional valuation methods intended for valuing stocks or other assets simply aren't very useful, as the coin has no cash flows or balance sheet. In fact, one of those valuation methods suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued by around 70%. Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. As you probably know, Bitcoin is produced by an army of miners. Those miners buy specialized crypto mining hardware, and then operate it, using other inputs like water and electricity along the way to ultimately produce Bitcoins, which the miners can then sell to recoup their costs. In short, more energy committed over time, with all else equal, implies a higher intrinsic value per coin. One financial model of this dynamic, created by Capriole Investments, suggests that Bitcoin should be priced at around $175,400, as the energy expenses required to mine a single coin are currently on the high side. So by Capriole's energy-based valuation methodology, Bitcoin has upside of around 70% or more, as it's currently undervalued. If it behaves like in prior instances of a disconnect between electricity costs and Bitcoin price, this gap won't exist for very long, which suggests that there's an opportunity for those who buy it now. Numerous other energy-based valuation methodologies for Bitcoin exist, and they aren't a new approach; some may produce results that disagree with each other as a result of making different assumptions about costs. Furthermore, these models depend on assumptions about average mining hardware efficiency and average electricity costs in the places where mining is performed with the most intensity. So treat these valuations as compasses rather than oracles. One of the reasons this valuation method is effective is that Bitcoin's mining difficulty self-balances depending on how many miners are participating in the network. The protocol adjusts difficulty every 2,016 blocks to keep average block time near 10 minutes. When the overall mining hash rate falls, mining difficulty then automatically ratchets a bit lower, which reduces the energy required per block and stabilizes miner economics. That mechanism links energy input to price through incentives. If price sinks below miners' breakeven level for long enough, weaker operators switch off machines, energy input falls, and the energy value declines toward price. So, knowing this, is Bitcoin worth buying while it's supposedly on the cheap side? This valuation metric points to a good outlook over the next 12 months or so. But beyond that, the picture actually gets better for those who are holding Bitcoin. New issuance drops every halving, which gradually tightens available float. Then, less fresh supply means the same dollar of incremental demand can move price more than before. While halvings occur about every four years, the takeaway is that accumulating scarce assets when forward supply is shrinking often has a favorable payoff if you can hold through noise. And in Bitcoin's case, the payoff has been quite favorable indeed; its price is up by 502% in the last three years. Therefore if your investing horizon is years, not weeks, the energy consumption valuation lens strengthens the investment thesis to hold and accumulate this asset. A practical plan is to dollar-cost average (DCA) a fixed amount, then add more on material drawdowns when sentiment is sour.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This monumental step is not just a nod to the legitimacy of digital currencies; it paves the way for fresh investment horizons for individual traders. SoFi's decision to launch cryptocurrency trading services—including mainstream tokens like Bitcoin and Ether—heralds a new chapter in banking. CEO Anthony Noto's characterization of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as "super cycle technology" is striking, drawing a potent comparison to the disruptive wave of artificial intelligence. In tandem with its trading services, SoFi is set to unveil SoFi USD—a stablecoin fully backed by reserves—aiming to seamlessly blend digital assets into everyday banking. For retail investors, this changing landscape shines a spotlight on projects boasting real utility and trustworthiness, such as DeepSnitch AI. As SoFi blazes the trail in crypto trading, savvy investors are keenly examining the best crypto opportunities, with promising ventures like DeepSnitch AI drawing attention. DeepSnitch AI confronts significant obstacles faced by traders, including information overload and the specter of market scams. By harnessing cutting-edge data analysis strategies, the platform fine-tunes trading approaches while effectively mitigating risks. Currently priced at $0.02289, DeepSnitch AI's presale has already amassed more than $525,000, prompting experts to predict extraordinary returns—potentially reaching an impressive 100x by 2026. It's crucial to highlight that broad validation—evident in SoFi's embrace of crypto—could pose hurdles for smaller Web3 startups. Research indicates that companies failing to prioritize robust payment systems often suffer from significant operational hiccups. Therefore, it's vital for crypto enterprises to reinforce their backend processes—a critical element frequently eclipsed by speculative trading distractions. Recent trends suggest a pivot towards utility-driven tokens underpinned by resilient technologies—an area where DeepSnitch AI excels. As institutional players re-engage with crypto investments, attention is shifting back towards intrinsic project value, moving away from mere speculative impulses. The developments surrounding SoFi Technologies and DeepSnitch AI signal a groundbreaking shift in cryptocurrency trading, enhancing its appeal for everyday investors. SoFi's unprecedented role as the first nationally chartered bank venturing into crypto trading affirms the resilience of digital currencies and sets a roadmap for future finance integration. Meanwhile, initiatives like DeepSnitch AI exemplify a forward-thinking narrative focused on utility and practical applications, expertly navigating the crowded cryptocurrency arena. As investors, staying attuned to broader market trends is imperative. By prioritizing fundamentally strong projects with tangible applications—like DeepSnitch AI—individual traders can strategically position themselves for growth in the dynamic digital finance landscape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WisdomTree's head of digital assets, Will Peck, anticipates that exchange-traded funds (ETF) that hold diversified baskets of cryptocurrencies will fill a significant gap in the market in the coming years. “It does seem like that's going to be one of the next waves of adoption,” Peck told Cointelegraph at The Bridge conference in New York City on Wednesday. “Crypto we talked about as an asset class, but it's really a technology, and the underlying return drivers of each of these tokens are actually quite different, even though they're correlated, generally, just because that's where the market is,” he explained. It comes as several crypto index ETFs have launched this year. Most recently, on Thursday, asset manager 21Shares launched two crypto Index ETFs, which are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Just a couple of months prior, on Sept. 25, asset manager Hashdex expanded its Crypto Index US ETF to include XRP (XRP), SOL (SOL), and Stellar (XLM), following the generic listing rule change from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Peck said the timing of broader adoption for crypto index ETFs is “tough exactly to forecast,” but suggested it may be inevitable given the straightforward utility of having a product that provides such exposure. Peck expects a surge in new crypto ETF launches as ETF issuers compete for early advantage, which he said may erode the idea that an ETF automatically signals the cryptocurrency token has any authority or credibility. “I think it's going to be a shift, like, where, five years ago, you said, Oh, if something has an ETF, like, Bitcoin is going to get one, maybe it's the first one, it must have some sort of institutional stamp of, like, approval,” he said. And it's really going to be on clients making the right choices with their own money,” Peck added. Meanwhile, Peck said that the “overall success” of spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January 2024 has surpassed his expectations. CUSIP Database provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc.
