                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People protest against federal immigration enforcement Saturday, Nov. 15, 2025, in Charlotte, N.C. (AP Photo/Erik Verduzco) People protest against federal immigration enforcement Saturday, Nov. 15, 2025, in Charlotte, N.C. (AP Photo/Erik Verduzco) A top Border Patrol commander touted dozens of arrests in North Carolina's largest city on Sunday as Charlotte residents reported encounters with federal immigration agents near churches and apartment complexes. The Trump administration has made the Democratic city of about 950,000 people its latest target for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime, despite fierce objections from local leaders and down trending crime rates. Gregory Bovino, who led hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents on a similar operation in Chicago, took to social media to document some of the arrests he said had reached more than 80. He posted pictures of people the Trump administration commonly dubs “criminal illegal aliens,” for people living in the U.S. without legal permission who have alleged criminal records. “We arrested him, taking him off the streets of Charlotte so he can't continue to ignore our laws and drive intoxicated on the same roads you and your loved ones are on,” Bovino wrote on X. The effort was dubbed “Operation Charlotte's Web” as a play on the title of a famous children's book that isn't about North Carolina. But the flurry of activity immediately raised questions, including where detainees would be held, how long the operation would run and what agents' tactics that have been heavily criticized elsewhere would look like in North Carolina. Democratic leaders in both cities said that agents' presence inflamed community tensions and led to violence. Bovino and other Trump administration officials have called the use of force appropriate for growing threats on agents' lives. Bovino's spokesman did not return a request for comment Sunday. Elsewhere, DHS has not offered many details about who it is arresting. For instance in Chicago, the agency only provided names and details on a handful of its more than 3,000 arrests in the metro region from September to last week. In several instances U.S. citizens were handcuffed and detained during operations and dozens of demonstrators were also charged, often in community clashes over arrests or protests. By Sunday, reports of CBP activity were “overwhelming” and difficult to quantify, Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said in an email. “The past two hours we've received countless reports of CBP activity at churches, apartment complexes and a hardware store,” he said. City council member-elect JD Mazuera Arias said federal agents appeared to be focused on churches and apartment complexes. “These are sanctuaries for people who are looking for hope and faith in dark times like these and who no longer can feel safe because of the gross violation of people's right to worship.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Epstein files: After months of delay — and despite resistance from President Donald Trump — the House will vote this week on whether to release more files from the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. President Nicolás Maduro has condemned the military buildup near South America as US forces target alleged drug-trafficking operations. Why this matters: The Trump administration has been building up military assets in the region and conducting deadly strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats. The US president is now weighing a potentially scaled-up campaign, possibly including land strikes inside Venezuela or an effort to oust President Nicolás Maduro. Maduro has condemned any US intervention and other regional leaders have warned of potential destabilization. “Ready, if asked”: US Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said today that the US military is standing by if ordered to take action in Venezuela. And I can speak from the Army's perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world. We would be ready to act on whatever the president and secretary of war needed,” Driscoll said in an interview with CBS News' Margaret Brennan on “Face the Nation.” He declined to specify whether any order had been given, saying, “We would be ready, if asked.” GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had a wide-ranging conversation with CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” today, marking her first interview since President Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of her and attacked the lawmaker online as a “traitor.” There's nothing to hide,” Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday.” It is a political exercise, and we're going to dispense with that this week,” he said. If the bill were to pass through the upper chamber, it would still need Trump's signature unless it earns a veto-proof majority, which would require a huge number of GOP defections. Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna says he's concerned that President Donald Trump's demand for a Justice Department investigation into high-profile figures, including some of his political enemies, will get in the way of releasing more files from the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “Look, I'm all for investigation wherever it leads, in terms of whether it's Democrat or Republican,” the California congressman, who is a co-sponsor of a House bill to release the files, said today on NBC's “Meet the Press.” “My concern is that he is doing this to prevent a release of the files, because some people are saying that when you can say there's an active investigation, you don't have to release the file.” Khanna said he's hoping around 40 Republican lawmakers will vote to release all the Epstein files this week. He said Trump is “sowing the seeds for his own lame duck presidency” by going after Republicans in Congress that support the documents' release, like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. “He's out of touch with his own base,” Khanna said. “All these people who were on his side are now saying, ‘Mr. Scott said Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, the strongman leader who remains in office following an election that was marked by widespread accusations of fraud, is not a duly elected leader. The big picture: Trump suggested last week that he has made up his mind on a course of action in Venezuela following multiple high-level briefings this week and a mounting US show of force in the region, where his administration has already been carrying out deadly strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats. The US president is now weighing the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign, potentially including land strikes inside Venezuela or an effort to oust Maduro. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene apologized for her role in “toxic politics” during an exclusive interview with CNN today. It came as the Georgia lawmaker says she's facing death threats due to her growing rift with President Donald Trump. “The most hurtful thing (Trump) said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor, and that is, that is so extremely wrong, and those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” Greene told anchor Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” Bash pushed back: “We have seen these kinds of attacks or criticism from the president at other people — it's not new — and with respect, I haven't heard you speak out about it until it was directed at you.” Greene, who embraced far-right conspiracy theories during her rise into politics, said she realizes she has participated in or supported rhetoric that resulted in threats toward others, and that it has been a point of reflection for her. Ties to White nationalist: Greene also defended her association with White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, including her appearance at a conference hosted by Fuentes in 2022. “Actually, I never had a conversation at all with the president about running for Senate or running for Georgia, and those were decisions I came to on my own,” the lawmaker told Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” “I don't know if he's being fed wrong information. I honestly have no idea in that area, but it is absolutely factually not true,” she said, adding that White House call logs would show she has not spoken to him. That perceived focus on foreign issues over domestic priorities — in addition to Trump's handling of the Epstein files — has been central to recent public criticism from Greene on media outlets including CNN and ABC's “The View.” Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene lamented the fracture between her and President Donald Trump, saying today that the rift centers on her push to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Greene said her relationship with the president deteriorated because she has been among a handful of conservatives adamant about releasing all files related to the Epstein investigation. Rep. Thomas Massie, the lead GOP co-sponsor of a bill to release more Jeffrey Epstein case files, predicted today that a large number of Republicans in the House could break with President Donald Trump and back the documents' release when it comes up for a vote as soon as Tuesday. I'm hoping to get a veto-proof majority on this legislation when it comes up for a vote,” he said on ABC's “This Week.” Massie said he thinks Trump is “trying to protect a bunch of rich and powerful friends, billionaires, donors to his campaign, friends in his social circles” and told his fellow GOP lawmakers that the “record of this vote will last longer” than Trump's presidency. “I would remind my Republican colleagues who are deciding how to vote: Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement, but in 2030 he's not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles,” he said. Keep in mind: While the House bill to release the files is expected to pass, it awaits an uncertain fate in Congress' upper chamber. President Donald Trump's nationwide deportation push has come to Charlotte, North Carolina, this weekend. Federal officials confirmed yesterday that a surge of immigration enforcement in the state's largest city has begun, as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations. Local officials including Mayor Vi Lyles criticized the crackdown, saying in a statement that it is “causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.” What residents are saying: Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed the doors to his family's bakery yesterday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the popular shop on Central Avenue, he told CNN. Betancur said he doesn't want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents — not when they're just trying to buy some Colombian cakes or pastries. I need to protect myself and my family,” he said. Security video viewed by CNN shows agents chasing two people down on foot outside the bakery. After coming to the United States with just $900 in his pocket, Betancur has become a US citizen, owns three businesses and employs almost 35 people — proof that the American dream exists, he said. Elsewhere: The focus on Charlotte comes as Texas National Guard troops ready to leave Chicago, according to a source familiar with the planning. The Associated Press and CNN's Dalia Faheid contributed to this report. We're also monitoring the fallout from a major political breakup, which boiled over this week after stewing for several weeks: President Donald Trump announced Friday he is officially rescinding his endorsement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. The president attacked Greene in personal terms, claiming she has “gone Far Left” and calling her a “ranting Lunatic.” How we got here: The onetime allies have grown apart as Greene criticized Trump on a number of fronts, including his handling of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his perceived focus on foreign affairs. Greene has publicly warned in recent weeks that Trump has spent too much time on foreign policy and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home, taking her message to outlets like CNN and ABC's “The View.” Trump has repeatedly and emphatically described calls for transparency around his ties to Epstein as a “hoax.” Greene has said her focus is on justice for Epstein's victims and exposing the “deep state,” including shared Democratic foes. Safety fears: The Georgia Republican says she is facing threats fueled by Trump's rhetoric. “I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected,” Greene wrote on X. In today's coverage, we'll be looking ahead to this week's House vote on the release of more files from the Jeffrey Epstein case. If you haven't been following the latest political drama surrounding documents related to the late convicted sex offender, here's what to know: But here's why it's pivotal: House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump have been resisting this vote anyway. And a large margin appears to be what many are anticipating. CNN reported this week that House GOP leadership is expecting mass defections. This would place tremendous pressure on the senators who face a vote next. Read CNN's full breakdown of the stakes in this week's vote. Another key element of President Donald Trump's agenda we'll be tracking today involves growing tensions in the Caribbean, where the administration has been mounting a show of force as it targets alleged drug traffickers in the region. Trump mulls options: The president suggested last week that he has made up his mind on a course of action in the South American country following multiple high-level briefings this week. Officials briefed Trump on options for military operations inside Venezuela, four sources told CNN, as he weighs the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign to potentially oust President Nicolás Maduro. The president indicated Friday he was drawing closer to a path forward on his attempts to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — and the possibility of regime change. What Maduro is saying: In remarks at a Caracas rally yesterday, Maduro accused the US of pursuing a “criminal war” and decried recently announced US military drills in Trinidad and Tobago as “irresponsible.” On Friday, Maduro warned that US military intervention could lay the groundwork for what he described as “another Gaza,” a “new Afghanistan” or “Vietnam again.” Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, in turn, has said Caracas is launching a “massive mobilization” of military personnel, weapons and equipment. “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America,” one GOP congressional staffer told CNN. CNN's Zachary Cohen, Jim Sciutto, Mary Triny Mena, Stefano Pozzebon, Isa Cardona and Mitchell McCluskey contributed to this report.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels — after U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Tehran long has maintained its atomic program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organized nuclear weapons program up until 2003. “There is no undeclared nuclear or enrichment facility in Iran. All of our facilities are under the safeguards and monitoring” of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, center, attends a conference titled “International Law Under Assault: Aggression and Self-Defense,” in Tehran, Iran, Sunday, Nov. 16, 2025. TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's foreign minister said Sunday that Tehran is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program. Answering a question from an Associated Press journalist visiting Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered the most direct response yet from the Iranian government regarding its nuclear program following Israel and the United States' bombing of its enrichment sites in June during a 12-day war. Asked what it would take for Iran to continue negotiations with the U.S. and others, Araghchi said Iran's message on its nuclear program remains “clear.” “We have this right, and we continue to exercise that, and we hope that the international community, including the United States, recognize our rights and understand that this is an inalienable right of Iran. Iran's government issued a three-day visa for the AP reporter to attend a summit alongside journalists from major British outlets and other media. Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels — after U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Tehran long has maintained its atomic program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003. European nations also pushed through a measure to reimpose United Nations sanctions on Iran over the nuclear program in September. The IAEA's Board of Governors is set to meet this week and could vote on a new resolution targeting Iran over its failure to cooperate fully with the agency. He told journalists at the summit that the U.S. administration's approach does not suggest they are ready for “equal, fair negotiations to reach mutual interests.” “What we have seen from the Americans so far has actually been an effort to dictate their demands, which are maximalist and excessive. We see no chance for dialogue in the face of such demands.” Titled “International Law Under Assault: Aggression and Self-Defense,” the conference included papers by Iranian political analysts offering Tehran's view of the 12-day war in June, many seizing on comments from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz praising Israel for having done the “dirty work” in launching its attack. “Iran's defensive response was remarkable, inspiring, historic and above all, pure,” wrote Mohammad Kazem Sajjadpour, an international relations professor. But Iran finds itself in a difficult moment after the war. Meanwhile, economic pressures and societal change continue to challenge Iran's Shiite theocracy, which so far has held off on making decisions about whether to enforce its mandatory hijab laws or raise the price of government-subsidized gasoline, both of which have sparked nationwide protests in the past.</p>

Europe, meanwhile, will require ‘'sisu,'' a Finnish word meaning endurance, resilience and grit, to get through the winter months, he said, as Russia continues its hybrid attacks and information war across the continent. Stubb also needs that quality as one of the key European interlocutors between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In the 1940s, after two wars with Russia, Finland lost about 10% of its territory to Moscow and agreed to become militarily neutral. But Finland's losses were much less than they could have been as Finnish troops displayed “sisu” and inflicted heavy losses on the Soviet army, despite being vastly outnumbered. Finland's neutral stance only reversed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when the Finns joined NATO. Stubb leverages his good relationship with Trump — the two men have played golf together and speak regularly — to argue the case for Ukraine. “I can explain to President Trump what Finland went through or how I see the situation on the battlefield, or how do you deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin? Stubb spoke to AP Saturday at a military base north of the capital Helsinki, where he observed Finnish volunteers take part in defense training. Wearing a jacket with the word “sisu” emblazoned across the back, he watched as volunteers practiced evacuating wounded soldiers from a conflict zone in freezing temperatures. Stubb told AP that Zelenskyy must deal quickly with allegations of kickbacks and embezzlement, saying the scandal plays into the hands of Russia. Nonetheless, he urged European leaders to look at boosting financial and military support for Kyiv, which is also facing creeping gains by Russia on the battlefield. “I'm not very optimistic about achieving a ceasefire or the beginning of peace negotiations, at least this year,” Stubb said, adding it would be good to “get something going” by March. The three big questions on the road to a ceasefire are security guarantees for Ukraine, rebuilding its economy and coming to some sort of understanding about territorial claims, he said. Putin “basically wants to deny the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” aims that have not altered since the war began nearly four years ago, Stubb said. Stubb praised Trump for sanctioning the major Russian energy companies Lukoil and Rosneft in October, saying he did “an excellent job,” but argued more must be done to give Ukraine the capacity to hit Russia's “military or defense industry.” Last month, Trump denied a Ukrainian request for long-range Tomahawk missiles that would theoretically allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia – although Kyiv does not currently have any launchers or platforms from which to fire them. Ukraine is still negotiating with the U.S. for more firepower, Stubb indicated. In mid-October, the White House announced Trump would meet Putin in Budapest before abruptly canceling the meeting less than a week later. The decision came after a call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, where Rubio probably realized that “the Russians haven't moved an inch,” Stubb said, and there was “no point in taking President Trump into a situation whereby he doesn't get a deal or anything.” A ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before the spring and European allies need to keep up support despite a corruption scandal which has engulfed Kyiv, President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press (AP video shot by Kostya Manenkov). “I've tried personally to focus on things such as: We need security guarantees for Ukraine. I guess you need ‘sisu' in these types of negotiations as well.” But, he said, the work is paying off and the military options for guaranteeing Ukraine's security once a ceasefire or peace negotiation is reached are now “clear,” with various countries having committed resources — although he declined to give more details, citing confidential military planning. Despite some of Ukraine's missteps, Stubb is unstinting in his praise for Zelenskyy. You learn a lot from other human beings in that situation,” he said. When it comes to dealing with Donald Trump, Stubb is in a better position than many European leaders. While Trump and Zelenskyy have a notoriously tempestuous relationship, Stubb said he and other European leaders can help act as a bridge between them. But when it comes to Putin, only one person should negotiate directly and publicly with him and that's Trump, Stubb indicated, suggesting the European Union is unlikely to open a direct channel of communication with the Russian leader any time soon. At the same time, Trump is leading negotiations with Putin, multiple European countries have faced incursions from Russian drones, suspected or confirmed, as well as fighter jets and an alleged widespread Russian sabotage campaign. Russia is not only conducting a kinetic war in Ukraine but also a hybrid war in Europe, Stubb told AP. “The line between war and peace has been blurred,” Stubb said “In other words, be cool, calm, collected and have a little bit of that ‘sisu.</p>

Arrington Vineyards winemaker Chase Vienneau and co-founder Kip Summers reveal why their Tennessee location provides the perfect climate for a red wine that can be sampled through the Fox News Wine Shop. Some 30 minutes south of Nashville, Arrington Vineyards is proving that good wine doesn't have to come from California. Co-founder Kip Summers and winemaker Chase Vienneau have spent nearly two decades coaxing character out of Tennessee soil — and now, through the Fox News Wine Shop, they're sharing it nationwide. Once he did, he met Vienneau while they were working together at a small family winery north of Nashville. Arrington Vineyards was soon born, closer to Nashville in Williamson County, where he partnered with Kix Brooks — one half of the award-winning country music duo Brooks & Dunn. "We started the winery down here with the idea of providing a place for people to enjoy a little bit of wine country," Summers said — "but in Middle Tennessee." "This time of year, we've got cool nights and warm days, and a lot of dry weather. It's a lot more humid and tropical during the summer. So, for us, it kind of boils down to which grapes can we grow here successfully?" Arrington Vineyards is known as "Nashville's wine country." "The wine that's part of this Fox Wine Club is made from a grape called Chambourcin, which is well-known in Virginia and New York, and a lot of the areas in the eastern United States," Summers said. The result is a "really good, consistent dry red wine for us every year," he said. "That's one of the reasons we wanted that wine to be a part of the wine club, because it really is a true representation of what we've been doing here for three years." "It's really versatile, too, for us," Vienneau added. We've made a really nice sparkling, French-method wine out of it." "When we talk about us being Nashville's wine country, we're really one of the few places you can go if you're in Nashville, and if you said to yourself, 'I'd really like to go out and hang out in a vineyard and have a bottle of wine with some cheese and a charcuterie tray — and enjoy the scenery, walk among the vines and just have a nice afternoon,'" Summers said. Tennessee's Arrington Vineyards is close enough to Nashville that visitors can enjoy music and wine in one trip. Our proximity to Nashville makes it a no-brainer." Since Arrington Vineyards is situated near Nashville and owned by a country music star, the soundtrack matters, too. "You don't have to sacrifice the musical experience if you want to come out here on a weekend. You can do wine and music at the same time." "It brings us all together," Vienneau added. The Fox News Wine Shop bottle is also a chance to introduce Tennessee wine to more Americans. "I'm just excited that people get to try — and will have an opportunity to try — really good wine from the state of Tennessee," he said. Just giving people that opportunity is going to be fun."

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot joins 'Special Report' to discuss China's efforts to expand their military assets. Chinese coast guard ships sailed through the Senkaku Islands in what it called a "rights enforcement patrol" on Sunday, continuing to ramp up tensions with Japan. The move is the latest sign of Beijing's displeasure with Japan, which administers the islands, after newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi gave a full-throated defense of Taiwan's independence earlier this month. She vowed that any attack by Beijing on Taiwan would warrant a military response from Japan. This was a lawful patrol operation conducted by the China Coast Guard to uphold its rights and interests," China's coast guard said in a statement. In the days since Takaichi's Nov. 7 statement on Taiwan, Chinese officials have summoned Japan's ambassador and warned Chinese citizens against traveling to Japan. China's defense ministry also vowed that any Japanese intervention would be ineffective in protecting Taiwan. An aerial view of a China coast guard ship like the ones that sailed through Japan's Senkaku Islands. The most vicious response came from China's consul general in Osaka, who appeared to threaten to decapitate Takaichi in a now-deleted post on social media. The official, Xue Jian, wrote, "That filthy neck that barged in on its own – I've got no choice but to cut it off without a moment's hesitation. Japan's government condemned the statement, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara calling it "extremely inappropriate" and confirming that Tokyo had lodged a formal protest with Beijing. Kihara said Xue had made "multiple" inflammatory remarks in the past and urged China to take disciplinary action. Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi angered Beijing with a vow to protect Taiwan from attack. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters Monday that Xue's words came in response to Takaichi's "wrongful and dangerous" comments, which he said misrepresented China's position on Taiwan.

The self-governed island said it monitored 30 Chinese military aircraft and seven naval ships operating nearby, according to NBC News. Fox News' Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.

Civilians practice military skills on a training ground in Kharkiv region, Ukraine, Saturday, Nov. 15, 2025. KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is working to resume prisoner exchanges with Russia that could bring home 1,200 Ukrainian prisoners, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday, a day after his national security chief announced progress in negotiations. “Many meetings, negotiations and calls are currently taking place to ensure this.” Rustem Umerov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said Saturday he held consultations mediated by Turkey and the United Arab Emirates on resuming exchanges. The Istanbul agreements refer to prisoner-exchange protocols established with Turkish mediation in 2022 that set rules for large, coordinated swaps. Umerov said technical consultations would be held soon to finalize procedural and organizational details, expressing hope that returning Ukrainians could “celebrate the New Year and Christmas holidays at home — at the family table and next to their relatives.” In other developments, energy infrastructure was damaged by Russian drone strikes overnight into Sunday in Ukraine's Odesa region, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. Combined missile and drone strikes on the power grid have coincided with Ukraine's efforts to hold back a Russian battlefield push aimed at capturing the eastern stronghold of Pokrovsk. Russia fired a total of 176 drones and one missile overnight, Ukraine's air force said Sunday, adding that Ukrainian forces shot down or neutralized 139 drones. On the front line, Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday that its forces had taken two settlements in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region. Russia's bigger and better-equipped army has scaled up its attacks, placing the short-handed Ukrainian military under severe strain. Russia has paid a high price in casualties and armor for its war of attrition, however, and Ukraine has held it to incremental battlefield gains. Ukrainian forces struck a major oil refinery in Russia's Samara region, along with a warehouse storing drones for the elite Rubicon drone unit in the partially Russian-occupied Donetsk region, Ukraine's general staff said Sunday. Months of Ukrainian long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries have aimed to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue the war. Russia's defense ministry said Sunday that its forces shot down 57 Ukrainian drones overnight. Follow AP's coverage of the war in Ukraine at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine</p>

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has more on the worsening humanitarian crisis in Haiti on 'America Reports.' U.S. Marines protecting the American embassy in Haiti exchanged gunfire with suspected gang members last week, a Marine spokesman said. Steven J. Keenan told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement Sunday that Marines supporting embassy security operations were fired upon by suspected gang members in the capital of Port-au-Prince and returned fire on the evening of Nov. 13. Kenyan police stand guard outside the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on July 5, 2024, as armed gangs cause unrest in nearby areas. Neither the State Department nor the U.S. Embassy in Haiti immediately responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment. The Caribbean nation has been plagued by gang violence, with armed groups reportedly controlling up to 90% of Port-au-Prince, according to the United Nations. The groups block access roads, attack infrastructure, and terrorize civilians through kidnappings, rapes and killings. There has been no elected government in Haiti since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021. The U.N. said a gang suppression force of 5,550 was set to begin operations in Haiti on Oct. 2, working alongside Haitian authorities to neutralize gangs, secure infrastructure and support humanitarian access. Protesters in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, march on April 2, 2025. It remains unclear which countries will contribute personnel, though the force will be funded primarily through voluntary contributions from U.N. member states. The State Department has a "Level 4: Do Not Travel" warning for Haiti on its website due to the risks of kidnapping, crime, terrorist activity and civil unrest. It ordered nonemergency U.S. government employees and their family members to leave the country in July 2023 due to security risks. The country has been under a state of emergency since March 2024. Protesters pass burning tires while marching to demand stronger government action on security in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on April 2, 2025. Ashley Carnahan is a writer at Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But what was once the home of a Christian Scientist church, is now the holy grail of Internet history — the Internet Archive, a non-profit library run by a group of software engineers and librarians, who for nearly 30 years have been saving the web one page at a time. The Wayback Machine, a tool used by millions every day, has proven critical for academics and journalists searching for historical information on what corporations, people and governments have published online in the past, long after their websites have been updated or changed. For many, the Wayback Machine is like a living history of the internet, and it just logged its trillionth page last month. The White House in January ordered vast amounts of government webpages to be taken down. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is blurring the line between what's real and what's artificially generated — in some ways replacing the need to visit websites entirely. And more of the internet is now hidden behind paywalls or tucked in conversations with AI chatbots. “We are here to try to provide a record of what happened, so that people can learn and build on that to build a better future, or to build new ideas that are worthy of being in the (Internet Archive's) library,” said Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle. Kahle created the archive in 1996 when a year's worth of saved pages could fit on about 2 terabytes worth of hard drives, the amount of storage you can get today in an iPhone. Now, the archive is saving closer to 150 terabytes, or hundreds of millions worth of web pages, per day. But more importantly, he said it's a symbol of permanence and a reference to the Library of Alexandria in Egypt. “That was the first time somebody tried to go and collect everything ever written by humans,” Kahle said. It also saves the technical architecture — the HTML, CSS, JavaScript codes and more — so that it can attempt to “replay the page as it existed” even if the server is no longer functioning, said Wayback Machine Director Mark Graham. In addition to web pages, the Internet Archive now captures AI-generated content, like ChatGPT answers and those summaries that appear at the top of Google search results. The Internet Archive team, which is made up of librarians and software engineers, are experimenting with ways to preserve how people get their news from chatbots by coming up with hundreds of questions and prompts each day based on the news, and recording both the queries and outputs, Graham said. But there are political considerations behind this approach, as well. The Trump administration has exerted pressure over content it disagrees with by filing lawsuits against media companies or by way of the Federal Communications Commission. So let's design for it,” Kahle said. “Let's go and live up to the moment and make it so that there's different points of view stored and made permanently accessible in different environments.” The Trump administration implemented a massive overhaul of government websites that included taking down countless pages on everything from health policies to the achievements of minority members of the military. It was the archive, which has been saving webpages during the transition of presidential administration websites since 2004, which enabled journalists to understand what had been altered. Whole sections of the web came down,” Kahle said. “(The administration) has a new point of view, and that's why we have libraries to go and have the record.” By displaying the servers, he hopes “that people understand that we're all part of the collective protection for our knowledge.” Archivists use bespoke machines to digitize books page by page,  livestreaming their work on YouTube for all to see (alongside some lo-fi music). Record players churn out vintage tunes from 1920s and 1940s, and the building houses every type of media console for any type of content imaginable, from microfilm, to CDs and satellite television. (The Internet Archive preserves music, television, books and video games, too). The former church's main sanctuary also boasts more than 100 three-foot statues of employees who have been on staff for at least three years – a reference to the famous Chinese terracotta army from thousands of years ago. There's a cyberpunk atmosphere,” Annie Rauwerda, a Wikipedia editor and social media influencer, said at a party thrown at the Internet Archive's headquarters to celebrate reaching a trillion pages “The internet (feels) quite corporate when I use it a lot these days, but you wouldn't know from the people here.” The headquarters might feel something like a living history exhibit. But the Internet Archive's goal, says Kahle, is to preserve the web so that it can continue to have a future, not to be the arbiters of truth. “It's trying to be a resource to make it so that other people can come up with their own ideas.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity. Lately, it feels like people, specifically senior and mid-level managers who do not have engineering experience, are pushing the adoption and development of various AI tools. I consider myself a conscientious objector to the use of AI, especially generative AI; I'm not fully opposed to it, but I constantly ask who actually benefits from the application of AI and what its financial, human, and environmental costs are beyond what is right in front of our noses. Worse, I feel that even voicing such concerns, admittedly running against the almost blind optimism that I assume affects most marketing companies, is turning me into a pariah in my own workplace. So my question is this: Considering the difficulty of finding good jobs in AI, is it “worth it” trying to encourage critical AI use in my company, or should I tone it down if only to keep paying the bills? You're definitely not alone in hating the uncritical rollout of generative AI. I bet there are people in your own company who hate it, too. But they're not speaking up — and, of course, there's a reason for that: They're afraid to lose their jobs. And it's the reason why I'm not going to advise you to stick your neck out and fight this crusade alone. If you as an individual object to your company's AI use, you become legible to the company as a “problem” employee. But I also don't want to see you lose your moral integrity. The real question here is not, “Should you voice your concerns about AI or stay quiet?” It's, “How can you build solidarity with others who want to be part of a resistance movement with you?” Teaming up is both safer for you as an employee and more likely to have an impact. “The most important thing an individual can do is be somewhat less of an individual,” the environmentalist Bill McKibben once said. “Join together with others in movements large enough to have some chance at changing those political and economic ground rules that keep us locked on this current path.” Now, you know what word I'm about to say next, right? If your workplace can be organized, that'll be a key strategy for allowing you to fight AI policies you disagree with. If you need a bit of inspiration, look at what some labor unions have already achieved — from the Writers Guild of America, which won important protections around AI for Hollywood writers, to the Service Employees International Union, which negotiated with Pennsylvania's governor to create a worker board overseeing the implementation of generative AI in government services. Meanwhile, this year saw thousands of nurses marching in the streets as National Nurses United pushed for the right to determine how AI does and doesn't get used in patient interactions. “There's a whole range of different examples where unions have been able to really be on the front foot in setting the terms for how AI gets used — and whether it gets used at all,” Sarah Myers West, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, told me recently. If it's too hard to get a union off the ground at your workplace, there are plenty of organizations you can join forces with. There are also grassroots groups like Stop Gen AI, which aims to organize both a resistance movement and a mutual aid program to help those who've lost work due to the AI rollout. You can also consider hyperlocal efforts, which have the benefit of creating community. “It's where we have seen many people fighting back in their communities — and winning,” Myers West told me. “They're fighting on behalf of their own communities, and working collectively and strategically to say, ‘We're being handed a really raw deal here. Already, local activists have blocked or delayed $64 billion worth of data center projects across the US, according to a study by Data Center Watch, a project run by AI research firm 10a Labs. Yes, some of those data centers may eventually get built anyway. Yes, fighting the uncritical adoption of AI can sometimes feel like you're up against an undefeatable behemoth. But it helps to preempt discouragement if you take a step back to think about what it really looks like when social change is happening. In a new book, Somebody Should Do Something, three philosophers — Michael Brownstein, Alex Madva, and Daniel Kelly — show how anyone can help create social change. The key, they argue, is to realize that when we join forces with others, our actions can lead to butterfly effects: Minor actions can set off cascades that lead, in a surprisingly short time, to major structural outcomes. This reflects a general feature of complex systems. Sometimes they build nonlinearly, allowing seemingly small events to produce disproportionately large changes. The authors explain that, because society is a complex system, your actions aren't a meaningless “drop in the bucket.” Adding water to a bucket is linear; each drop has equal impact. Complex systems behave more like heating water: Not every degree has the same effect, and the shift from 99°C to 100°C crosses a tipping point that triggers a phase change. But that doesn't mean change is not happening. Though we have not yet seen AI-related protests on that scale, we do have data indicating the potential for a broad base. A full 50 percent of Americans are more concerned than excited about the rise of AI in daily life, according to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center. So, even though you might feel alone in your workplace, there are people out there who share your concerns. Come up with a positive vision for the future of tech.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Democrats bet big that President Donald Trump would cave to their healthcare demands in a protracted government shutdown fight. Those same deal-makers, who claimed victory by creating a national conversation on healthcare, are tempering expectations heading into negotiations with Republicans ahead of next month's promised vote and further enraging Democratic colleagues and voters. The latest indictment of Democratic leaders by the progressive wing played out in theatrical fashion Thursday, when demonstrators from the liberal activist group Our Revolution hand-delivered a petition with thousands of digital signatures to Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) Washington office, calling on him to step down as minority leader. “Unfortunately, messaging doesn't provide healthcare to the 20 million folks that are going to lose it because of this, and they give up with a promise of a vote that is absolutely not going to pass,” Our Revolution Deputy Director Paco Fabien told the Washington Examiner. The deal has become fodder for Senate candidates from Maine to Iowa accusing Schumer of capitulation and calling on him to resign from leadership, mirroring the outrage in a March funding battle that also ended in defeat for Democrats. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), among the eight Democratic-caucusing senators to strike a deal that ended the 43-day shutdown on Wednesday, said prolonging it “wouldn't deliver a better outcome.” “It would only mean more harm for families in New Hampshire and all across the country,” she said. “This wasn't about making healthcare an issue,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a Progressive Caucus vice chairman. There is a notable bright spot from Democrats in the weeks ahead as they search for a pared-back extension of subsidies that could win over enough Senate Republicans. Democrats are more united on healthcare messaging, as Republicans grapple with how seriously to negotiate over a program they believe is the cause of high insurance costs rather than the solution. “This is a fight that the Republicans need to understand is not just happening in Nevada,” said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), a centrist who helped cut the shutdown deal. “It is happening across the country in every state, including those red states.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The suspects, among others, are accused of using encrypted messaging and social media apps “to share extremist and ISIS-related materials that encourage attacks” in the US, including on the LGBTQ+ community in Michigan, according to a criminal complaint. The Michigan plot, which may have been planned for Halloween, was intended to be possibly on the scale of the 2015 Paris terror attacks before it ultimately was foiled, authorities say. The arrests illustrate “how people are self-radicalizing, operating in echo chambers online,” NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence & Counterterrorism Rebecca Weiner told CNN. “This isn't as simple as there is an entity called ISIS that's operating overseas that's reaching into our homeland, recruiting and radicalizing people,” Weiner said. “This is a much more nuanced dynamic, where people are finding each other online, doing that mutually reinforcing self-radicalization, finding like-minded people overseas, some of whom may have connections to the actual terrorist organization. So it's much more muddy, but it is also much more dangerous than a simple model that we've dealt with before.” CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller, Weiner's predecessor at the NYPD, interviewed Weiner on Monday about the case. Miller: We just saw this domino series of cases in rapid succession, with a common theme that they were connected to ISIS, radicalized online, conspiring online. Weiner: So, you have multiple elements at play, many of which we're familiar with. All of them together, this is an incredibly significant disruption. At the same time, an overlapping network of would-be foreign fighters looking to join ISIS, allegedly in Syria overseas. We've seen a sustained focus on ISIS-inspired plotting. But this is broader in scope and extends farther in geography than most recent disruptions for the last several years. Miller: So, draw a chronological map for me. At the same time, you have an ongoing investigation, a network of individuals in New Jersey, in Seattle, overseas, who were planning allegedly to travel overseas to Syria to join ISIS. Miller: What were, between all of these people and places, the different kinds of attacks that were discussed? Weiner: You had targeting allegedly of the LGBTQ community. You had targeting potentially of (the) Jewish community. Weiner: This is a classic case of what terrorism looks like in 2025, when you have social media enabling not just the radicalization, the consuming of propaganda, the echo chamber of driving people toward more and more extremist content and discussion, but active planning and coordination. But that wasn't all you had, as outlined in the complaint against one of the defendants in New Jersey. Travel, real-life engagement and interaction between these groups of people. Miller: What was the NYPD's role in this case? Weiner: NYPD worked extensively with (the) FBI on the New Jersey piece on the defendants and their potential overseas travel, and of course, we have officers assigned to our JTTF (Joint Terrorism Task Force) who support FBI field offices across the country, as well as human intelligence and open-source support from our intelligence division. Miller: A long time ago, many people declared ISIS and al Qaeda effectively dead. Weiner: So it never really went away, and since October 7, we've been contending with renewed interest in joining ISIS among inspired people here across the West, but also an increase in ISIS operational tempo overseas. You had people here talking to people there and other arrests that makes this beyond just the United States. It's quite easy to coordinate your travel or coordinate your attack plotting across different states, across different countries, in the era of the group chat, and that's what we see in this case and that's what we're seeing in our cases more broadly. Weiner: I think some of those questions are being answered as we speak. But it was a combination of both, and that's what makes it particularly potent and also gives us the urgency to do the disruption, not just the digital communication, but the physical as well, and frankly, it doesn't even matter if they never met each other in person until they arrive overseas. Miller: We're seeing in these federal documents a range of people from basically 16 years old maybe to 20. Weiner: It's that young people are increasingly drawn into extremism. Weiner: That's a lot of reasons, partly it's the pandemic and the ongoing hangover from forced social isolation and a lot of time spent online. Partly it's young people and their young brains just marinating in these online ecosystems where you're subjected to, drawn to, consuming and then animated by extreme content. But one through line across all of our cases, regardless of ideology, is younger and younger people being drawn into these webs. Weiner: First and foremost, this is a job really well done by the FBI, working with other law enforcement agencies, by the NYPD, across the country in multiple cities and overseas. So this is exactly what we want our system to do. Second, it's the complexity of this, the breadth of this, how many people involved and across so much space. That's a good wakeup call, that conventional terrorism is unfortunately alive and well, and over the last year, we've been swept up in other threats, the rise in political violence and individual acts of really high-profile targeted violence with no clear ideological underpinning. That is a threat unto itself, but meanwhile, ISIS support, terrorism as we've understood and combated it for the last 24 years, remains a threat that we have to contend with.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two deputies underwent surgery at a Topeka hospital and were in good condition, the KBI said, and the third deputy was discharged. “After being on scene less than 10 minutes, gunfire erupted,” patrol Superintendent Erik Smith said during a news conference at the Carbondale City Library. The shooting stunned neighbors John and Heather Roberts, who live about a mile north of where it occurred on the same two-lane road. They never sensed any problem in any of the family members, such as drugs, alcohol abuse, or violence, and they said the suspect's grandmother gave Christian books to area children she knew. They said it is not uncommon to see law enforcement vehicles on the road outside their home because they live at the line between Osage County, home to Carbondale, and Shawnee County, home to Topeka, and vehicles turn around there or the counties exchange prisoners. John Roberts said he was putting siding on his barn when two law enforcement vehicles flew down the road in the morning. “Both of them were running, I would say, well over 100 miles an hour as they went by,” he said. “Then the city of Topeka officers started going by. They're great people,” Heather Roberts said, adding that she and her husband were praying for the wounded officers too. She said every time the suspect visited their home, he would give her a hug and he was “very respectful.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino has pushed back on a report that claimed a key part of his background check for the top job was waived by Director Kash Patel, calling it a “complete fabrication.” ProPublica reported that Patel granted Bongino a waiver for the polygraph examination, which is required for all new FBI employees. In a statement on Saturday, Bongino, without explicitly mentioning the polygraph exam requirement, insisted he met “all of the background check requirements for my current position.” “Claiming I was hired ‘with no background check' is just a lie. I held a security clearance, while protecting Democrat and Republican presidents, for over ten years. And all of the background check requirements for my current position as Deputy Director of the FBI have been met. Those staffers are Marshall Yates, the FBI's liaison with Congress, and Nicole Rucker, Patel's personal assistant. Patel has received some scrutiny for the move before, most recently when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September. At the time, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) questioned Patel about alleged “disqualifying alerts” on polygraph tests of his “senior executive team,” with Patel declining to comment. In an X post on Friday, Durbin reposted the ProPublica report, writing, “FBI Director Patel refused to respond to whistleblower reports that people failed polygraph tests at the FBI.</p>
