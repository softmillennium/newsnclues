                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nov 16, 2025 at 01:30 PM EST Erling Haaland and Norway will qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Sunday, barring a minor miracle from Italy. Italy requires a minor miracle if it's to bag automatic qualification to the 2026 World Cup on Sunday when it travels to the San Siro to take on Italy. Erling Haaland and company have enjoyed a seamless run through UEFA qualifying thus far and sit atop Group I, three points ahead of Italy and with a far superior goal difference. In short, Norway will most likely keep top spot even if it loses in Milan, with the Azzurri needing to win by nine goals or more in order to overturn the goal difference deficit currently working against them. And that much looks nigh impossible given Stale Solbakken's men won 3-0 when these teams met in Oslo back in June. Italy scored twice in the dying minutes to beat Moldova 2-0 on Thursday and keep its dream of automatic qualification alive for the time being. However, the soccer gods will need to be smiling on Gennaro Gattuso's side if they're to finish any higher than second and somehow manage to avoid the play-off route.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Troy Parrott's hat trick left him in tears as Ireland fans everywhere rejoiced as they finished second in Group F and are now heading to the UEFA playoffs for a spot at their first World Cup finals since 2002. They will play a one-off playoff semifinal in March 2026, then if they win that they will play a final with the winner qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. A few weeks ago Heimir Hallgrimsson's Ireland looked down and out in qualifying but won all of their final three qualifiers, including a memorable 2-0 win against Portugal in Dublin on Thursday thanks to Parrott's double, to keep their World Cup dream alive. That set up a must-win clash in Hungary and Ireland trailed twice, and were 2-1 down with just over 10 minutes to go as Hungary only needed a draw to qualify for the playoffs and sat back to hold on. The Tottenham Hotspur academy product, who is now at AZ Alkmaar in the Netherlands, couldn't hold back the tears as he spoke to RTE Sport after celebrating with his family in the stands in Budapest. I really can't believe it... This is why we love football. So this means the world to me. This is the first time I've cried in years. I really can't believe it... Everyone is crying. I said against Portugal this is what dreams are made of but I don't think I will ever have a better night than this in my life. FT: 🇭🇺 2-3 🇮🇪An emotional Troy Parrott reacts to securing a play-off place for Ireland in Budapest. 'This is why we love football because things like this can happen...

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At both club and international level, it has been a journey for Republic of Ireland forward Troy Parrott to find his way in European football. On November 16, with his nation's 2026 FIFA World Cup hopes in critical condition, he provided a moment that neither Parrott nor Ireland fans will soon forget. Parrott's heroics came at the end of an amazing week in which he had previously outshone Cristiano Ronaldo to give Ireland hope in a World Cup qualifying campaign that had looked certain to end in disappointment. The Sporting News brings you everything you need to know about the former Tottenham youth product who delivered a truly iconic moment of magic for his country. Now 23 years old, Parrott has been a regular for the Republic of Ireland national team for nearly a half-decade. He made his international debut in 2019, logging 63 minutes and bagging an assist in a 3-1 friendly win over New Zealand. After an ankle injury kept him from competing for a starting job for the next year, he would find a way into the Ireland squad on a more permanent basis in 2021, scoring his first two international goals in a 4-1 win over Andorra that summer on just his fifth appearance. While his career began in England, he would not find club success until moving abroad. As a Tottenham Hotspur youth product, he would make just two appearances for the Premier League side while being shipped out to the likes of Millwall, Ipswich Town, MK Dons, Preston North End, and Excelsior on loan. It was that final stop that saw him find a permanent home, as he made waves in the Netherlands by scoring 10 goals in 25 regular-season matches for Excelsior, plus another seven goals in four playoff games at the end of the season. He joined AZ in the summer of 2024 on a €4 million deal from Tottenham, immediately slotting into the starting lineup and excelling almost as soon as he landed back in the Netherlands after his previous productive loan spell. Troy Parrott, take your place on the pantheon of Irish greats 🇮🇪pic.twitter.com/KATKNMZO4g While he will be remembered for that single moment, it was a memorable 90 minutes for Parrott, whose winning goal was his third of the match. Prior to the Hungary game, Parrott had breathed life into Ireland's qualification hopes by leading his side to a surprise 2-0 win over Portugal in Dublin. In a match in which Cristiano Ronaldo was shown a straight red card for violent conduct, Parrott scored twice to secure three invaluable points and give his team a chance ahead of the visit to Budapest. Kyle also does TV broadcasts for Wake Forest soccer, and has had previous stops with NBC Soccer and IMG College. Kyle enjoys playing racquetball and video games when not watching or covering sports.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After watching Scotland's defeat against Greece in the wake of Denmark's disappointing 2-2 draw against Belarus, the Danish national team coach, Brian Riemer, isn't worried ahead of Tuesday's decisive World Cup qualifying clash in Glasgow. They came back into the match at the end through a set piece, which we also have to be aware of." However, not much should go wrong before they can compete with us. Scotland will have great support behind them on Tuesday evening, as Hampden Park is sold out. Brian Riemer also expects intense pressure from the start. "I expect that they will come out firing from the start, but then they will turn into the Scottish team that we know. That's how I imagine the match will be." "I think they're fine with the fact that they haven't necessarily decided the game after ten minutes. Denmark is currently struggling to contain a stomach virus in the camp, which has sidelined Rasmus Hojlund and Joachim Andersen. On Sunday and Monday, the national team trains in Helsingor, before the team travels to Glasgow on Monday afternoon.</p>

The decision, announced on International Day for Tolerance, sends a powerful message: hate and harassment on social media will now carry real-world consequences. According to FIFA, the blacklist will include users who have engaged in racist, discriminatory or threatening behavior on social media during official tournaments. Anyone listed will be blocked from buying tickets for FIFA competitions, including the World Cup in United States, Mexico and Canada. Member associations have already been notified to take action within their jurisdictions. We will continue working with federations, confederations and law enforcement to hold offenders accountable.” Online purchasing platforms will be linked to FIFA's registry of sanctioned users, blocking them from acquiring tickets. The aim is to ensure that stadiums across the United States, Mexico and Canada remain free of violence—not only physical, but digital as well. With this policy, FIFA draws a clear line: your behavior online can determine your access to the biggest stages in world football.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cristiano Ronaldo was among the first to congratulate Portugal on their World Cup qualification after seeing his international colleagues book tickets to that 2026 showpiece in a nine-goal showing against Armenia. CR7 sat that game out through suspension, but will get to grace another major international tournament after barely being missed in a resounding win. There was no need for him to hang around while serving a ban. He tangled with Irish defender Dara O'Shea during that fixture, elbowing the Ipswich centre-half in the back, and is now waiting to discover how many matches he will have to miss. The hope is that one game will be enough for him to learn his lesson. Portugal proved, against limited opposition, that they can cope without their talismanic captain. They wobbled briefly against Armenia, with Renato Veiga's early effort being cancelled out, but ultimately eased over the line at Estadio do Dragao. Manchester United skipper Bruno Fernandes bagged a hat-trick, including two penalties, while Goncalo Ramos, Joao Neves and Francisco Conceicao were also on target. Portugal knew a positive result would be enough to see them top Group F. They finished three points clear of Ireland after making light work of Armenia. Ronaldo had posted ahead of Portugal's final qualification fixture: “Go team! Ronaldo is now preparing to grace his sixth World Cup finals. He will be 41 by the time that tournament rolls around, but has signed a new contract at Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr and shows no sign of slowing down. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. It does, however, remain to be seen whether he will be forced to miss the opening games of that event in Northern and Central America. Martinez said of Ronaldo's dismissal against Ireland: “The red card is just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games. He was 60 minutes or 58 minutes in the box being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed, and obviously, when he tries to get away from the defender...I think the action looks worse than what it actually is. Martinez went on to say, with it possible that FIFA's disciplinary committee will sting Ronaldo with a three-match ban: “After the game it's a difficult time because emotions can be unclear. “And it was a reaction of trying to continue playing. Others might fall to the ground and look for a penalty. Ronaldo has already stated that the 2026 World Cup will be his last. He has sought to clarify comments in which he said that retirement could happen “soon”, with there still at least a couple of years left in the evergreen all-time great.</p>

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. The tournament will be the first to feature 48 teams, expanded from 32 in Qatar, and will also be the first World Cup to be hosted by three countries. The World Cup will begin on 11 June in Mexico's historic Azteca Stadium, the scene of Brazil's 1970 glory inspired by Pele and Argentina's success in 1986 led by Diego Maradona. Here is everything you need to know. The US president Donald Trump is expected to be in attendance. The 48 nations will be divided into 12 groups containing four teams each, one from each of four draw pots. Teams from the same confederation will be kept apart in the group stage, except for Europe where there are more teams (16) than groups. No group will have more than two European nations. The ranking of the third-placed teams will be determined by points, then goal difference, then goals scored. If two or more teams are still level, then “team conduct scores” will come into play (a yellow card is minus one point, a red card via two yellow cards is minus three points, and a straight red card is minus four). Each continental confederation has a set number of nations taking part in the World Cup to decide the first 46 spots. Then a play-off competition will decide the reamining two places. Concacaf (North America): 6 spots (including three hosts) The inter-confederation play-offs take place in March.

This is a second round contested between 16 teams but only four will end up qualifying. The 2-3 score doesn't do justice, as Hungary dominated Ireland in shots, shots on target, ball possession, corners, and pretty much every offensive statistic there is. The team knew it needed to win and it went out there to make sure that if Portugal slipped, it would've done what was needed. Still, it wasn't enough as Ireland's Troy Parrott scored a hat trick to get Ireland the win. Now, Hungary said goodbye to the 2026 World Cup. Will Cristiano Ronaldo play in the 2026 World Cup?

Norway look destined for their first World Cup appearance since 1998, with Løvene needing only to avoid a nine-goal defeat against Italy to secure their place. They have been in imperious form since the start of the 2026 qualifying campaign in March, winning all seven of their matches. Heavy victories over Moldova, Israel and Estonia have underlined their dominance, but it was the 3–0 win over Italy in Oslo that tilted the group in their favour. Erling Haaland has scored 14 goals, while the now-injured Martin Ødegaard had been supplying his compatriot with ease. It may feel like a party atmosphere for the travelling fans on Sunday, but the players know they still have a job to finish. Italy, meanwhile, come into this match with nothing to lose. Their 1–0 win over Moldova on Thursday was a disappointment, and any realistic hope of overturning the goal difference has surely vanished. One bright spot is that Gennaro Gattuso remains unbeaten as Azzurri manager since taking charge in June, and he will hope to extend that run against Norway. Expect an attacking lineup, with Italy certain to give it everything as they attempt to reach their first World Cup since 2014. If they fall short, they will head into March's single-leg play-offs, needing to win two more matches to qualify.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pochettino will make sure to avoid as much heartbreak as possible with the U.S. men's national team when he names his final squad ahead of the official 2026 World Cup roster. While many teams will bring in extra players for a last look during pre-camps ahead of major tournaments, Pochettino wants to avoid that type of heartbreak. As such, he has committed to not over-filling the June roster, keeping it as close to his final World Cup squad as possible to avoid any disappointment. “I think from the beginning, if you say, okay, that is the 26, that is a shock, but this—okay, you accept. But after to be involved and then to go home, I think it's more cruel,” he told reporters earlier this week. “For me, it's easier to call more players than 26, but I think I need to think (terms of) the human being and desire and not to be cruel,” Pochettino added.

In 2014, Landon Donovan admitted to breaking down in tears after Jürgen Klinsmann cut him from the final squad for Brazil, and Jeff Agoos famously burned his kit when he was dropped by Bora Milutinović in 1994, the last time the U.S. were World Cup hosts. It might not be so easy for the Argentine manager, though, especially considering that he has called up 71 different players since taking over as head coach in the fall of 2024. But, with a shift to a back three in recent windows, and some consistent performances, his best possible squad could be emerging. “I think number one is the intensity and the energy and the collectiveness that we showed in this in this game,” said World Cup hopeful Gio Reyna after the Stars and Stripes' recent 2–1 win over Paraguay. “We have a lot of quality around the field.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The USA scored twice on either side of the break and had a 4-0 lead behind goals from Tate Lancaster, Mike Schmid, Samson Abraham and JJ Waterman before conceding two goals in second-half stoppage time. With three points after two matches in three-team Group D, the USA now awaits the final group match between Ukraine and South Korea on Tuesday (2:30 a.m. A draw, Ukraine win, or Korea Republic win by seven goals would secure the USA's advancement to the quarterfinals. An eighth minute free kick by midfielder Braden Anderson on the left from 25 yards out was directed in at the near post by teammate Samson Abraham, but the referee ruled Abraham was a step offside and waived it off. Twelve minutes later, USA right back Philip Cruz headed in a corner from Raul Silva, but the referee also called it off ruling Cruz had pushed off a Korean player. It was Lancaster's third international goal and second in three matches after tallying in last month's 3-1 friendly win against Germany. USA forward Michael Schmid nearly doubled the lead but Korean goalkeeper Taerim Kim came up big off his line to deny. Next it was Lancaster again that came close. Anderson played a short free kick from the right to Silva, who quickly advanced in Lancaster's near post run. Schmid now has 14 career goals, one off the all-time leader Chad Johnson. The game was essentially put away five minutes later when Anderson's corner kick was met by left back JJ Waterman (pictured above) at the back post for his debut goal to extend the lead to 4-0. With a commanding 4-0 lead, the U.S. let up some in added time, as Junyeong Jeong and Jonghun Kim each tallied to take it to 4-2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Wilf speaks to the media Russell Lansford / Imagn Images Years ago, Orlando Pride co-owner and chairman Mark Wilf got a knot in his stomach as he watched his daughter get ready for penalty kicks during a middle school soccer match. “I remember how tense it was,” he tells The Athletic. “She was a goalie, and it came down to penalties.” His daughter's team won. “We always loved sports, playing them and going to games,” he said. “Seeing how much team spirit, being part of sports and what it does for young people and communities, I always dreamt of being, one day, part of a sports team.” Wilf grew up in New Jersey, where sports were a family affair. The family's dream of owning a sports franchise came to fruition in 2005. Wilf, his brother Zygi and their cousin Leonard bought the financially crippled Minnesota Vikings for $600 million. The family was also instrumental in building US Bank Stadium as part of a public-private partnership. Two years later, basketball Hall of Famer Grant Hill — who is a co-owner of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks — and his wife, Grammy-nominated singer Tamia Hill, joined the Orlando Soccer Holdings ownership group. “Everything he has done since aligns with what was observed in our initial meeting.” While building the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minnesota, he was already looking at Major League Soccer. Once the opportunity knocked on their door in Central Florida and Orlando's former owner, Flávio Augusto da Silva, put the team up for sale, he did not hesitate. It first hired former U.S. women's national team manager Tom Sermanni and signed U.S. star Alex Morgan, instantly elevating expectations. However, they failed to find the rhythm they had expected, finishing the inaugural season ninth out of 10 teams. When Wilf first arrived in Orlando in 2021, he was surprised by the amount of work that needed to be done. “The facilities weren't where they needed to be,” he said. We wanted players to walk in and feel this was a first-class organization.” Head coach Amanda Cromwell, hired that season after a celebrated run at UCLA, was placed on administrative leave in June following a joint NWSL/NWSLPA investigation into “alleged retaliation” under the league's workplace misconduct policy. Assistant coach Seb Hines, who had no prior head-coaching experience, stepped in as interim. They ended up finishing the season 10th overall, but there was hope for change. Wilf credits Carter and Hines — and Marta — for transforming the Pride into what he calls “a team with real soul.” “When we came in, Marta was nursing an ACL (injury),” he said. “But she was out there working her tail off, setting an example. They signed Barbra Banda to a four-year deal, paying a reported $740,000 transfer fee — the second-highest in women's football history at the time. “That whole year was something special,” Wilf said. “You win the Shield, but then you still have to survive the playoffs.” He has seen Marta's iconic semifinal goal several times and still gets goosebumps, like he is seeing it for the first time. “Holding on in those final minutes, it's something I'll never forget. To have such a historic season like last year and winning the double like we did, it doesn't happen by accident.” After the championship, a new side of Wilf was uncovered: his dance moves. “Fans might be surprised by Mark's dancing talents after winning championships,” Hill recalled. Hines was named NWSL Coach of the Year, while Emily Sams took home Defender of the Year. The Pride also had five players on the Best XI: Sams, Marta, Banda, Anna Moorhouse, and Kerry Abello. “When you steward a franchise, whether it's the Vikings or the Pride, you're responsible not just for winning, but for creating something the community can be proud of,” Wilf said. Despite Pride's epic run in 2024, the 2025 season has been anything but smooth. The reigning champions clawed their way back to the postseason despite losing last year's championship MVP, Banda, to a season-ending injury, navigating the tricky blend of new and returning players, and absorbing forward Adriana's departure. Off the field, revenue from Pride sponsorships has increased drastically since the first season of Wilf family ownership. “But it's about investing in people and culture.” At the league level, Wilf sits on the NWSL's executive committee, where he's been pushing for continued professionalization. “When we came in, the league wasn't where it needed to be in terms of structure and depth,” he said. “With commissioner Jessica Berman, we've built real momentum. We're still early, but the trajectory is there.” According to SponsorUnited's 2024–2025 NWSL Marketing Partnerships Report, league-wide team sponsorship revenue hit $75 million in 2024, a 16 percent jump from 2022. On average, clubs pulled in about $5 million apiece, with individual deals landing around $170,000. “We're building something that will be world-class. “We brought in two of the highest-paid transfers in women's sports history because we believe it's what the fans want,” he said. The game itself is so exciting,” he said. “The NWSL brings a different kind of excitement for me. It was a league with real potential, essentially at ground level, but ready to take off, and needed to be professionalized. I am very proud to have worked alongside the other owners to help build the league office from the early days and to be part of shaping what we hope will remain a high-growth league for years to come.” On Sunday, the Wilf family will be back in the stands at Inter & Co Stadium, bracing for another nerve-shredding semifinal against Gotham FC  that could send the Pride to a second straight final.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA Club World Cup did not end with any favorable results for Real Madrid. But the loss at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain was an awful setback that had been ignored for far too long. Another was that Gonzalo Garcia earned a first-team promotion, which he eventually received. Another takeaway was the remarkable redemption of left back Fran Garcia, who became both a defensive and offensive standout for Xabi's new team. They wanted Alvaro Carreras, but Benfica's tough negotiations delayed the signing. He played every minute of the six games Real Madrid participated in and finished with a goal and an assist. More than the numbers, he performed as a complete left back, the total opposite of how he looked last season. Fans were shocked, and some even questioned the need to sign Carreras. Carreras is outstanding and fits perfectly in the manager's system. He's sidelined both Fran Garcia and Ferland Mendy. He is a reliable defender who completely neutralized any Lamine Yamal threat in the recent El Clasico, and he also contributes with goals, assists, and chance creation in the final third. Since his arrival, Fran Garcia has been largely confined to the bench. So far this season, he has played only four games, averaging 53 minutes each. Xabi Alonso has made it clear that Garcia is no longer needed. He has Carreras for the balanced fullback role, and although Garcia has a somewhat similar profile, he is visibly riskier and makes more mistakes than his counterpart. Unless Carreras suffers a major injury, I do not see any path to redemption for the sidelined Garcia. His time with Los Blancos is all but over.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CHESTER, Pa. — Mauricio Pochettino has no intention of being cruel when it comes to picking the 26-man roster for the World Cup-bound United States men's national team. But make no mistake: Nobody's roster spot is safe. A pair of friendlies during the November camp are being played without a number of recognizable names, including American stars Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams — both dealing with injuries. That has led the head coach to detail what's at stake for every player in camp. Weston McKennie, Chris Richards and Malik Tillman also have not been with the USMNT this week. And with all of that in mind, Pochettino wants every player to be ready to play if his name is called for the World Cup. “It's a great opportunity in the moment that, [if] we decide to pick another player, choose another player, that player needs to show up and step up and say, ‘Yes, we have the opportunity to be part of the roster for the next World Cup,' ” Pochettino explained. Pulisic, of course, has been a big topic of conversation since the Gold Cup earlier this year — a tournament in which the Pennsylvania native opted not to play, instead choosing to rest after a grueling club season. Pulisic had returned to the national team for the September camp held in New Jersey but was injured in an October match and has been recovering since. He gave a wide-ranging interview with CBS Sports Golazo this week and explained his focus at the moment is on recovery. So, I think it's just the best decision for everyone right now,” he said. After Saturday's match and a friendly against Uruguay in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday, Pochettino's squad will not reconvene until March. “I prefer in a different way to bring the 26 that you believe that are going to be in the squad, and if something happens, you call someone. … But to be involved, then to go home, I think is more cruel that situation than if you call and say we need you because something wrong happened or some player was injured.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scotland slipped into danger after a 3-2 defeat to Greece, leaving them one point behind Denmark in Group C. Both sides now face a winner-takes-all clash on Tuesday, where Scotland must win to avoid missing out on automatic qualification.

CHESTER, Pa. -- Facing a Paraguay side who have accomplished feats such as toppling Brazil and Argentina, the United States men's national team were able to take care of business, winning 2-1 at Subaru Park on Saturday in a game that saw a brawl take place before the final whistle started by Gustavo Gomez and Alex Freeman. Regulars like Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams may not have been with the squad, but Mauricio Pochettino wasn't short on options as Gio Reyna scored his first USMNT goal since March of 2024 while making his first appearance since March of 2025. This is why it was important for Balogun to commit to the USMNT instead of England, and now they're seeing the fruits of his commitment. Even without his full squad, Pochettino's men are getting results as the move to a back three has provided critical room for error. If they can continue this growth, it may become time to believe that they can make a statement at the 2026 World Cup on home soil. It was a long road to get to this point, featuring Pochettino calling in 71 players as he leaves no stone unturned in the player pool, but with unearthly gems such as Diego Luna, Alex Freeman, Max Arfsten, and Tanner Tessemann, that experimentation has worked. Things will be tougher for the USMNT facing Uruguay in on Tuesday, but there's plenty of reason to believe that they can secure a signature win without stars in the side. The fight may mar what was a good game from start to finish but the USMNT will keep their unbeaten streak going as it now reaches four matches. 9' 1-1: It's another header for Paraguay this time as they cut through the USMNT defense and Almiron put the ball on a plate for Arce to head it past Matt Freese in net. After a hard tackle by Paraguay as tempers flared and the benches cleared between the United States and Paraguay. Gustavo Gomez and Alex Freeman were at the center of things, but with no red cards issued to anyone in play, we'll play out the remainder of stoppage time in Chester. We've got some nerve-racking moments to see out as Paraguay will throw everything that they can forward. Pepi had the ball in the box, but a great recovery block from Paraguay kept him from making this 3-1. Mauricio Pochettino is going to the bench again, this time bringing on three players - Ricardo Pepi, Timothy Tillman and Aidan Morris. Coming off are Folarin Balogun, Gio Reyna and Cristian Roldan. This is Pepi's first game for the national team in roughly a year, the forward saddled with injuries for much of that time off. He's someone to keep an eye on, though - the USMNT have a batch of in-form forwards between him, Balogun and Haji Wright, creating a genuine sense of competition for minutes up top. To close this out, the USMNT will be in a back four as Dest comes off for Freeman and Scally comes off for Luna. This is when it's time for Pochettino's tactical flexibility to shine. Diego Liuna and Alex Freeman are getting ready for the USMNT, but there will be a corner kick to take first. Paraguay's defense has been solid, but this lack of penetration into the attacking third is something else. We may not end with each team having 11 on the pitch. Only one player, on both teams, has fewer touches than his eight so far in the match, and that's Matt Freese in the USMNT net with four. Freese can essentially get out a camping chair, but the USMNT needs to get their star forward involved sooner than later. While the USMNT have been in control, these counter attacks are nervy moments. The trio of Reyna, Aaronson, and Dest are making things happen. Dest is playing as an inverted fullback, joining the midfield whenever he can, and Paraguay doesn't have many answers for it. There will be another USMNT goal before long. He hasn't played for the USMNT since March of 2025 and has yet to score a goal for Borussia Monchengladbach, but within five minutes, he finds the back of the net for his country. Just amazing stuff during what is a critical window for the young attacking midfielder. Matt Freese will need to be on alert as players like Julio Ensicso will have a pop from distance to see if they can catch the team off guard, but overall this will be an even affair in Chester. The World Cup is drawing closer, and with goals in his last two starts, Balogun is showing why there was so much promise behind his commitment to the USMNT as a dual national. He's been able to create space for others with his movement and holdup play while putting shots on frame to keep defenses honest. In form for club and country, if the USMNT are going to get results from games in this window, they'll need Balogun at his best but his role will change a bit depending on the lineup. If Reyna does start, his ability on the ball will help create space but otherwise, Balogun will need to operate in smaller windows of space than he has become accustomed to. Gio Reyna may be the headliner but he is one of three players who start today who were not even part of the USMNT's October friendlies, natural for a team with 12 new faces from last month's camp. Gio Reyna earns his first start under Mauriico Pochettino, having only played for the head coach once before - seven months ago as a substitute in the 2-1 defeat to Canada in the Concacaf Nations League third place match. Reyna's inclusion was a mix of a few things - his club situation finally being sorted out with his transfer to Borussia Monchengladbach and Pochettino's insistence on giving players an adequate amount of opportunities before the World Cup. "The way Poch wants us to play, he wants everyone to know their role, he wants everyone to be onboard and he wants nobody to think their postion is gaurenteed so I wouldn't say [regular players missing] affects preperation too much but of course at the same time wer're missing some key players and when we get to the important games and where it matters we're gonna want everyone fit and availible," Folorian Balogun said, speaking ahead of the match. "But the most important thing is to manage what we have, and of course, the players who aren't here get healthy and look after themselves." There will be a large Paraguay presence at Subaru Park, but with Union academy products also returning to the stadium, there will be quite a reception for them. There is no gambling offered on this site.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Germany, Portugal, and Belgium are among the top European footballing nations that are yet to secure their World Cup 2026 qualification spot. All three countries will need to decide their future on matchday 10, which is the final game in their groups next midweek. Julian Nagelsmann's men's shock first qualifier game defeat against Slovakia puts them in a tough spot, as they now have to decide their WC 2026 future in the last game. That's why a win is important to firmly secure their direct World Cup qualification instead of having to go through a tricky playoff situation. Portugal, on the other hand, had every chance to secure their qualification two games earlier, but somehow blew it off. Their failure to beat Hungary last month and their recent shock loss against Ireland put the Selecao das Quinas in a must-win game situation this upcoming midweek as they face Armenia at home. Because of their loss against Ireland, which saw Cristiano Ronaldo get sent off, the Portugal national team are only two points ahead of their rival, Hungary. Similar to Portugal, Belgium also put its direct qualification on hold after only picking up a 1-1 draw against Kazakhstan this weekend. The Red Devils now must grab all three points on their final group match against Liechtenstein, as Rudi Garcia's team are only two points ahead of their rival, North Macedonia, in the standings. Those three teams still have the possibility of having to endure a grueling and troublesome playoff round if they don't get things right in their final group games.</p>
