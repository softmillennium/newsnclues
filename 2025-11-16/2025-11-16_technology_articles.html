                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon's budding satellite internet program is no longer called Project Kuiper. It is now known simply as “Leo.” The name change comes as the company appears to be shifting its focus from “unserved or underserved” communities to securing larger commercial contracts. Leo is a nod to the network's location in what's known as low-Earth orbit, commonly referred to in the space industry as “LEO.” As Amazon worked toward launching the first Kuiper satellites earlier this year, the company boasted that the project was an “initiative to increase global broadband access” with a noble-sounding “mission to bring fast, affordable broadband” to communities that aren't well-served by traditional internet providers. Affordability is mentioned three times throughout, with Amazon calling it a “key principle of Project Kuiper.” “Amazon has a longstanding commitment to low prices, and lots of experience building popular, low-cost devices like Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick,” reads the answer to a question on the archived post about how much Kuiper service will cost. It states that Leo is “Amazon's low Earth orbit satellite network, designed to provide fast, reliable internet to customers and communities beyond the reach of existing networks.” It promotes the ability to make “seamless video calls, stream 4K videos,” and “handle your whole family's internet needs,” as well as the fact that Leo is “[f]lexible, scalable, enterprise-ready.” The idea of using Leo “even in rural and remote locations” is brought up as almost an afterthought on the main website, and there is no mention of cost or affordability.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a new report from the International Energy Agency, the world will spend $580 billion on data centers this year — $40 billion more than will be spent finding new oil supplies. Those numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change. There's no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power, and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. We also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed  $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion, and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan. You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below. Kirsten: Here's what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who's our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. So to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it. But of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil. And another thing that struck me about it was that most of the data centers are coming to cities, or near cities, like populations of a million people, roughly. I think that, to your point, renewables will have to [be a focus] — it's just good business, it's not because of any environmentally friendly policies. A few months ago, I went to their big reveal, and they're taking the old EV batteries that aren't quite ready to be recycled, and then they're creating these microgrids, and then specifically going after AI data centers. The question is: Are other companies going to do this? And how much of an impact could they make? Even if they're not in cities themselves, I feel like the landscape is definitely going to be transformed by construction at this scale. To start with OpenAI, that's a company that a lot of people have been talking about, how much money are they actually making versus the trillions of dollars of capital commitments they have for the next decade.

I wonder what they estimate the "replace with newer" cost to be versus the "figure out how to deploy $modernAndroid fleet wide" costs. Bonus points if you express it as a percentage of CEO's compensation / company wide revenue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Is it time to invest in memory chip manufacturers? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Asus said that its memory inventory for production and those that are already in finished products sit at two months, which should be enough for the remainder of 2025. While most large companies like Asus and MSI typically have contracts with memory chip manufacturers, reports say that they're also now purchasing a lot of inventory in the spot market, where prices are more volatile, presumably to shore up their supply. This is a major change and could be a sign of things to come, as it usually only hosts low-volume purchases from smaller companies or when a major institution needs to acquire more memory modules due to unforeseen demand. These actions in the spot market are increasing pricing pressure, and it's already being felt by retail customers. RAM prices have jumped by 100% or more recently, and we've even heard reports of some Japanese shops limiting sales volume per customer because of limited deliveries, with some products remaining out of stock from distributors. With companies investing billions of dollars in hardware, memory chipmakers are converting existing DRAM lines to take advantage of this lucrative market. Most major memory chip manufacturers have reported record earnings for the 3Q25, with upstream firms also reaping benefits from the massive jump in demand. Unfortunately, they're also wary of market volatility, especially with some experts saying that we're in an AI bubble that can burst anytime. But even if they start construction on new chip fabs right now, it will take several months, if not years, for them to begin operating, and churning out the memory chips we sorely need.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pavan Davuluri acknowledges Windows' “power user” pain points in a flat tweet. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Earlier this month, Microsoft described its vision of Windows evolving into an “agentic” operating system that takes action on your behalf, prompting a wave of backlash from users who argued the company had deprioritized performance in favor of automation that nobody wanted nor asked for. Many pointed to longstanding issues with performance, UX fragmentation, and developer-hostile defaults, asking why those problems weren't being addressed first. In a recent reply posted to X, aimed at an original post by writer and engineer Gergely Orosz, Davuluri acknowledged the volume of complaints but stopped short of directly engaging with the core critiques. “The team (and I) take in a ton of feedback. They don't always match, but both are important,” wrote the Windows exec. He conceded that Microsoft has “work to do on the experience,” citing “inconsistent dialogs” and “power user experiences” as examples, but offered no specifics on what changes might be made or when they would arrive. At no point does he mention the concerns around system bloat, hardware lock-ins, or the sense that Copilot integrations are arriving before longstanding design issues have been resolved. Microsoft has not followed up the agentic OS announcement with any detailed public roadmap or technical explanation of what users can expect in future Windows builds. For both your everyday and power users alike, the gap between messaging and actual, measurable action in response to widespread criticism remains stark.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In recent research, Eli Lilly's experimental treatment eloralintide helped people lose a substantial amount of weight—without needing to use the same approach as existing popular medications like Ozempic. Over a 48-week span, people taking eloralintide lost up to 20% of their baseline body weight, well above the average weight loss experienced by those on placebo. Our pancreas naturally releases amylin alongside insulin into the bloodstream in response to eating food. Like GLP-1, amylin plays a part in regulating our hunger and blood sugar control. But they also have some key distinctions, and that's made amylin a promising new target for obesity treatment. There is an existing amylin-based drug, pramlintide, which was first approved two decades ago as a treatment for diabetes. But it's the newest amylin analogues in development, like eloralintide, that have really excited scientists. These experimental drugs are designed to last much longer in the body than natural amylin, ideally boosting the hormone's effects to help people lose weight and control their blood sugar. Much like semaglutide, eloralintide is intended to be taken once a week via subcutaneous injection. Eli Lilly's phase II trial involved 263 participants without type 2 diabetes who had obesity (a body mass index over 30) or who were overweight (a BMI over 27) with weight-related health conditions. They were randomly assigned to either receive a placebo or varying doses of eloralintide. Ozempic Might Literally Change How Our Bodies Handle Booze, Study Finds People taking the highest weekly dose, nine milligrams, saw the best results, an average 20% weight loss during the study, as did people who steadily increased their dose from six to nine milligrams. It also appeared to be safe and generally well-tolerated. “Eloralintide produced clinically meaningful, dose-dependent reductions in bodyweight over 48 weeks and was generally well tolerated, supporting eloralintide's potential use for obesity treatment,” the study researchers wrote. GLP-1s have greatly changed the field of obesity medicine in recent years. And though these drugs aren't risk-free and can be highly expensive, they've already started to turn back the clock on obesity. For the first time in years, America's obesity rate has noticeably declined as the use of these drugs has steadily climbed. Eloralintide's results are especially tantalizing, though, since the drug is only relying on amylin. That's important because it may mean that eloralintide can eventually become an appealing alternative for people who haven't responded to GLP-1 therapy. But it's worth noting that semaglutide only helped people lose about 15% of their body weight on average in clinical trials. Eli Lilly's existing obesity drug tirzepatide, which pairs GLP-1 and the hormone GIP, has shown weight loss rates hovering around 20%. These early findings will have to be verified by data from larger trials, of course. But if this research continues to show promise, eloralintide could open up a whole new area of obesity treatment. New research suggests that people taking GLP-1 therapy are less likely to die from colorectal cancer. New research continues to show that many people meet the criteria for obesity and associated health problems, even if their BMI looks fine. Severe diverticulitis is becoming a bigger issue for people under 50. New research finds that the reported rise in many cancers isn't just limited to younger adults.</p>

You need something that sounds good, survives your adventures and doesn't die halfway through the day. Bose has built its reputation on delivering premium audio quality and the latest SoundLink Plus proves why that matters. Right now, Amazon has dropped it to $199 from its usual $269, wihch marks an all-time low and makes premium sound more accessible than ever. You can soundtrack an entire camping trip, beach day or backyard party without hunting for outlets. The IP67 rating is not just marketing speak: it means this speaker genuinely handles dust and water immersion up to three feet for 30 minutes. You can rinse off beach sand, survive a poolside splash, or keep playing through unexpected rain without panicking. Bose added shock and rust resistance to the mix, so drops on concrete or salty air exposure won't end your speaker's life prematurely. The rugged exterior takes real abuse which counts when you're hiking, biking, or just leading an active lifestyle where gear gets knocked around. Here's where Bose separates from budget rivals who focus on volume over fidelity: the sound quality. The SoundLink Plus delivers bold, resonant audio with real bass presence that is something smaller speakers can't pull off. You get clear mids for vocals and podcasts, and crisp highs that don't turn harsh at higher volumes-and low-end response adds depth without muddiness. The Bose app lets you tweak bass, mid-range, and treble levels to suit your taste, or adjust performance based on environment. At $199, this is serious value for what you're getting: premium Bose sound engineering, real all-day battery life, military-grade durability and smart features that extend usefulness beyond basic playback.</p>

Intel is currently preparing a serious rival to AMD's Threadripper 9000WX series: Granite Rapids-WS. Granite Rapids-WS now looks to gain even more ground with potentially class-leading specs in the workstation space. Seasoned leaker momomo_us has seemingly found out every SKU that will be part of this lineup, along with a few details that can help us speculate. We didn't get specific core counts, but it's reasonable to expect Intel's next-gen "extreme" Xeon chips to top out at 128 cores, since the current-gen 6980P also rocks the same config, which the 698X is likely an offshoot of. To achieve such a high core count, Intel uses three compute tiles, and the same layout on Granite Rapids-WS should allow it to pass even the flagship Threadripper 9995WX's mighty 96 cores. The architecture itself has tough competition ahead, considering how efficient Zen 5 is. One chip from the GNR-WS lineup already has its first benchmarks out in the wild, thanks to an early GeekBench listing spotted by BenchLeaks. More importantly, we find out that this chip has 18 cores and 32 threads. Interestingly, there's no 18-core SKU in the Granite Rapids server series, so we don't have a direct point of reference. Unfortunately, that's where the details end and speculation begins. A couple of months ago, we covered another Granite Rapids-WS chip with 86 cores and 172 threads, operating at 4.8GHz — we can now safely assume that was the Xeon 678X. Intel's next-gen Xeons are shaping up nicely against AMD's Threadripper, with heated competition on the horizon for the first time in a while.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The developers of the big generative AI chatbots are continuing to push out new features at a rapid rate, as they bid to make sure their bot is the one you turn to whenever you need some assistance from artificial intelligence. These are exactly what they sound like: Tasks that you can get Google Gemini to run automatically, on a schedule. Maybe you want a weather and news report every morning at 7 am, or perhaps you want an evening meal suggestion every evening at 7 pm. It brings Gemini up to speed in this regard with the ChatGPT app, which introduced scheduled tasks several months ago. At the time of writing, this requires a subscription to Google's AI service, which starts at $20 a month for Google AI Pro. The chatbot can keep track of up to 10 scheduled actions at once, so you need to be quite selective about how you use it. Alternatively, your actions can run on a recurring daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They can't be set on a more complicated cadence (such as every second Tuesday in the month), or surprise you at random. Gemini should recognize that you've asked it to schedule something, and will present a recap: What you've asked it to do, when, and how frequently. You can view and manage your scheduled actions on the web by clicking Settings and help in the left-hand navigation bar, then choosing Scheduled actions. In the mobile app, tap your account picture (top right), then Scheduled actions. Whatever platform you're on, you can pause and delete scheduled actions—on the web, there's also an Edit button to make changes to the action or its timing. The process is similar in ChatGPT, though these scheduled jobs are called tasks rather than actions. You can create tasks on the web, and in the apps for Android and iOS, but you do need to be paying for one of ChatGPT's various subscription plans. For individual users, plans start at $20 a month with ChatGPT Plus. You're able to have up to 10 scheduled actions at any one time, and as with Gemini, you can create them simply by describing them: Tell ChatGPT you want it to "generate a poster for a high-concept sci-fi movie every day at 5 pm" for example, or "give me a good reason to go out jogging every Saturday at 8 am." ChatGPT should identify your intention to create a scheduled task, and confirm the details for you. Tasks will run as scheduled, whether or not you're using ChatGPT at the time. To view and modify tasks, you need the web interface. Click the three dots on any task box and pick Manage tasks, or click your account avatar (top right), then Settings > Notifications > Manage tasks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It seems Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has set his sights on a new wild goose to chase. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has made clear his intention to probe whether antidepressant drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, can be blamed for causing mass shootings. Last week, Kennedy announced via a post on X that he would task the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study “the long-taboo question of whether SSRIs and other psychoactive drugs contribute to mass violence.” But while more research into this topic might be worthwhile, the data so far doesn't support a causative link, many experts say. “SSRIs are generally safe and effective medications, and there is no overwhelming evidence that these drugs alone would cause patients who are taking them to commit acts of violence,” Gregory Brown, Chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Communications, told Gizmodo. This isn't the first time that RFK Jr. has brought up SSRIs as a possible factor causing mass violence. In late August, following a school shooting in Minnesota that left two students dead and dozens injured, Kennedy went on Fox News and stated that he would launch studies looking into the role that SSRIs and other drugs used to treat mental illness might play in causing such incidents. In early September, during a conference announcing his “Make America Healthy Again” report on children, he made a similar promise, though he claimed the National Institutes of Health would be in charge of this planned research. The idea that psychiatric medications can set off mass shooters certainly isn't new. Nearly a decade ago, for instance, speculation arose that anti-anxiety drugs fueled Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock's killing spree in 2017. They found that most school shooters had no documented history of taking psychotropic medications. And even in cases when they did, the researchers failed to find a “direct or causal association” with these medications. The California State Association of Psychiatrists (CSAP) also issued an explicit rebuttal of RFK Jr.'s attempt to link SSRIs to mass shootings, following his comments in September. One of these explanations can be severe mental illness, such as psychosis, though probably not to the extent that many would assume. A 2022 study by the same Columbia team found that only about 5% of mass shootings might be linked to severe mental illness, such as psychosis. What does seem to be a substantial mental health factor in mass shootings is suicidality. Roughly half of mass shooters will either kill themselves or try to provoke a lethal confrontation with law enforcement (“suicide by cop”), and perhaps around two-thirds express suicidal ideation before or during the shooting. That factor could help explain why some research has found a potential relationship between antidepressant use and violence in general, according to Girgis. “They find a close relationship because people who are suicidal or violent also have much worse depression. So that's why we see this relationship,” Girgis told Gizmodo. While SSRIs do carry a warning label claiming they might raise the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviors in people under 25, it's a controversial one. Many researchers, including Girgis, now argue otherwise (or at least that the warning has done more harm than good), and some studies have actually found SSRIs can reduce suicide risk in younger people. Notably, Girgis' study this September found no difference in the rate of mass shooters dying by suicide whether they were taking an antidepressant or not. During the Fox News interview in August, RFK Jr. also appeared to claim SSRIs carry a black box warning that they can increase the risk of homicidal intent. Whether he misspoke or deliberately peddled a falsehood, that's just flatly not true. At least some of the reason why people might latch onto SSRIs as a factor behind mass shootings is sensationalism, Girgis argues. That's one reason there's this attention bias to it,” he said. “While I cannot predict results of any future research studies, ongoing research efforts—especially unbiased peer-reviewed research—can often provide useful information about the safety and efficacy of psychotropic medications,” Brown said. He's unilaterally dismissed outside experts on vaccine safety, installed allies sympathetic to the anti-vaccination movement, and allegedly fired former CDC chief Susan Monarez when she refused to rubberstamp policy changes recommended by the latter group. More recently, he and President Donald Trump have tried to officially blame autism on the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy—an explanation that many experts and health authorities do not support. The FDA is trying to initiate a labeling change to acetaminophen products that would warn pregnant women about the supposed autism risk, even as Kennedy has admitted that they don't yet have proof of a causative link. But that alone might not stop Kennedy and the Trump White House from claiming otherwise. Reports suggest that, internally, the Food and Drug Administration is facing a crisis of confidence. Researchers pinpointed an association between maternal covid-19 infections and children being diagnosed with neurodevelopmental issues years later. After a year of ongoing outbreaks, Canada is expected to lose its measles-free status.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company says those cities should see self-driving Waymo vehicles on the road soon as it launches service there in 2026. Oh, and also the frequently icy streets of Detroit. Even though Waymo's cabs (the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace and Zeekr RT) will be in manual mode with a human driver controlling the car at first, the Google spin-off company will be gearing up for autonomous operations soon in those new locales. If Waymo can pull this off, it will be some of the first fully autonomous operations where the roads are slick with wet, slippery ice and visibility is terrible and dark for more hours of the day. Tesla owners have access to Full Self-Driving mode in all of Tesla's EVs, and have been a litmus test for autonomous driving in inclement weather outside of the winter-free zones Waymo (along with Amazon's Zoox in SF and Las Vegas and the now-defunct General Motors-owned Cruise in SF, Phoenix, Miami, Nashville and several Texas cities) has historically operated. As Reddit forums have discussed for the past few years, once the weather gets rough, self-driving mode isn't much help. As one user urged, “…don't rely on a robot to drive you in the snow.” Waymo anticipated concerns and doubts about driving in a place like Detroit known for its “harshest winter” and put out a blog post at the end of last month about driving in all types of weather. It claims its next generation driver tech has trained enough to handle snowy conditions. Waymo says its AI can notice when there's snow, slush or ice versus a normal, dry road and adjusts its behavior accordingly. As Ubicept co-founder and CTO Tristan Swedish explained in a recent call, challenging scenarios like winter puts vision systems and sensor suites to the test. “When you move to a more adverse weather scenario there are ways to overcome those challenges using advanced perception systems,” he said, contrasting the ease of summertime autonomous driving in “well-behaved environments” like SF and Vegas. Swedish noted the trend to add more cameras, radar and LiDAR sensors to fight the limitations of seeing through things like nighttime fog and a snowstorm. “It makes the system less reliable, and more expensive.” Companies like Ubicept want to deploy an AI-based solution: Software that can separate light from a headlight bouncing off fog or a snow bank versus the road. Humans can't do that with the naked eye, but with an approach called gated imaging technology, reliable autonomous driving in more places is theoretically possible. “You don't have to build a new sensor system,” he assured. In California companies like Waymo are regulated through the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and CA DMV, both state-level entities. So while winter is coming, don't expect the autonomous taxis (and the companies that run them) to be ready for it yet. After a cat was reported run over by a Waymo this week, Musk decided to share his thoughts on pet safety and driverless cars. San Francisco was an early adopter of robotaxis, but increasingly the city has become a stage for real-world tests confronting social acceptance. The move is one of several signaling a growing tension between innovation, privacy, and law enforcement power. The move is part of a broader trend of U.S. cities and states gradually opening their roads to autonomous vehicles.</p>
