            Wilmer Geovanny Chavarría Barre, known as “Pipo,” the alleged leader of drug trafficking gang Los Lobos – Ecuador's most powerful and violent criminal organization – has been arrested in Spain, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa announced on Sunday.
    


            “Today we captured ‘Pipo' Chavarría, the most wanted criminal in the region and top leader of Los Lobos,” President Noboa posted on his official X account.
    


            The announcement coincided with a national referendum in Ecuador, which includes proposals aimed at combating organized crime, such as the potential reintroduction of foreign military bases.
    


            Ecuador's Minister of Defense, John Reimberg, stated that Chavarría was “responsible for at least 400 deaths,” and said the arrest was the result of a coordinated operation between Ecuador's National Police and Spanish authorities.
    


            Chavarría is accused of orchestrating assassinations, controlling illegal mining operations, and trafficking narcotics in collaboration with Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG). Noboa said the gang leader had “faked his death, changed his identity, and hid in Europe while continuing to direct criminal operations in Ecuador.”
    


            Los Lobos - designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. in September 2024 - has been linked to drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, and providing armed support to CJNG in securing key cocaine routes, particularly in the city of Guayaquil.
    


            The US Treasury Department  sanctioned the group in June 2024, stating it had “thousands of members” and was a major driver of escalating violence across Ecuador.
    


            Authorities suspect Los Lobos of involvement in the assassination of presidential candidate Fernando Villavicencio on August 9, 2023, in Quito.
    


            Chavarría's arrest marks a major development in Ecuador's ongoing fight against transnational organized crime.

            A group of suspected Haitian gang members fired this week on American forces protecting the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince, a spokesman said Saturday, in an incident that highlighted the tense security situation in the Caribbean nation.
    


            Capt. Steven J. Keenan, a spokesman for the US Marines, wrote in an email that the shooting, which came to light this weekend, happened Thursday, adding that the Marines returned fire. No Marines were hurt in the attack.
    


            Haitian police were not immediately available to comment on the exchange of fire.
    


            Gangs control 90% of Haiti's capital, where they extort businesses and fight for territory, using heavy weaponry.
    


            The United States continues to operate an embassy in Haiti, but in recent years the State Department has issued numerous warnings telling Americans not to travel there, due to the risk of kidnappings, crimes, terrorist activity and civil unrest.
    


            According to the United Nations, gang violence has displaced more than 1.3 million Haitians from their homes in recent years.
    


            Security in the nation of nearly 12 million people has deteriorated rapidly since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home by mercenaries.
    


            The president's murder has generated a power vacuum that politicians in the nation have struggled to fill, and no elections have been held to replace Moise.
    


            In late September, the United Nations Security Council voted to create a gang suppression force of about 5,500 troops that will be deployed to Haiti to fight the nation's heavily armed criminal groups.
    


            A smaller force of police officers from Kenya has struggled to contain gangs, which killed 5,600 people last year, according to the UN Human Rights Office.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have spoken over the phone ahead of the UN Security Council vote on the deployment of peacekeepers in Gaza.

The Kremlin said on Saturday that ""a thorough exchange of views took place on the situation in the Middle East region, including developments in the Gaza Strip in the context of implementing the ceasefire agreement and the exchange of detainees.” The leaders also discussed Iran's nuclear program and the situation in Syria.

Netanyahu's office released a shorter statement, saying that the Israeli prime minister and the Russian president had discussed “regional issues.”

Earlier this month, the US circulated a proposed resolution authorizing the deployment of the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza for a period of at least two years and calling for the establishment of the so-called Board of Peace as a transitional governing body. On Friday, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Türkiye, Pakistan, and Indonesia released a joint statement backing the American proposal.

Moscow has submitted an alternative proposal tasking the UN secretary general with drawing up options for implementing US President Donald Trump's peace plan. The Russian mission criticized the American plan for lacking “instruments of oversight and control” over the stabilization force and not mentioning the two-state solution. It said that “only a truly equal and inclusive approach” can guarantee peace.

Both proposals are expected to be put to a vote on Monday.

The Palestinian people do not exist, Israel's hardline security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, has said ahead of the UN Security Council vote on implementing the next stage of the US-brokered peace plan for Gaza.



The Security Council will vote Monday on a resolution drafted by the US and backed by several Arab and Muslim countries, which they said “offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”



In a lengthy X post on Saturday, Ben-Gvir, who is also the leader of the ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit party, claimed that “there is no such thing as ‘Palestinian people,'” arguing that the nation was “an invention without any historical, archaeological, or factual basis.”



“The collection of immigrants from Arab countries to the Land of Israel does not constitute a nation, and they certainly do not deserve a reward for the terrorism, murder, and atrocities they have spread everywhere, especially in Gaza,” he wrote, adding that the only “real” solution to the conflict was “encouraging voluntary emigration.”

Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich issued a similar appeal, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to “make it clear to the entire world” that a Palestinian state “will never be established.”



The State of Palestine is currently recognized by 157 countries, including four of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.



Although Netanyahu said in September that “there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the Jordan River,” he had previously distanced himself from Ben-Gvir and Smotrich, both of whom were reportedly excluded from the prime minister's war cabinet.



Russia has stressed that the future resolutions on Gaza must reaffirm the two-state solution and a path to a viable Palestinian statehood.

Ukraine has prepared an agreement to import gas from Greece to offset the loss of production during the winter, Vladimir Zelensky has announced.

”This will be another gas supply route to maximally secure Ukraine's gas import routes for the winter. We already have agreements on financing gas imports, and we will cover the need for almost €2 billion,” he wrote on X.

Zelensky also claimed that Ukraine's “European partners” are providing it with financial assistance for the project. He specifically noted Norway's support and mentioned that there is “active work with American partners” to secure full funding.

Earlier this month, Greece agreed to import 700 million cubic meters of US liquefied natural gas per year starting in 2030 in its first long-term deal with Washington, which seeks to replace Russian supplies to Europe.

The US is moving to push Russian energy out of the European Union market and position itself to fill the gap, the Financial Times reported Friday.

At the same time, Ukraine has been experiencing power outages. “This winter will likely be the hardest since the full-scale invasion. We need help. We need help with gas supplies, we need help with supplies for our electric power industry,” Maksim Timchenko, head of the Ukrainian energy holding DTEK, said in early November.

The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that its forces had launched a large-scale strike on Ukraine's energy facilities in response to what it described as “the Kiev regime's terrorist attacks on Russian civilian sites.” Moscow has repeatedly said it does not target civilians.

ATHENS, November 16. /TASS/. Greece is launching a Vertical Corridor to supply gas to Ukraine, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said after a meeting with visiting Vladimir Zelensky.

Earlier in the day, Greek and Ukrainian gas companies signed a memorandum of intent on deliveries of liquefied natural gas from the United States to Ukraine from December 2025 until March 2026.

""Our countries are now acquiring a new critically important aspect of cooperation - a new safe energy mains running from the south to the north, from Greece to Ukraine, via the Vertical Gas Corridor that will link a [LNF regasification] terminal near [Greek city of] Alexandroupoli and Odessa,"" he said as quoted by the ERT-news television channel. ""It means that Ukraine will have immediate access to diversified and reliable sources of energy and Greece will become a hub for American LNG supplies to Central and Eastern Europe.""

The Greek prime minister also said that he had discussed with Zelensky further support for Ukraine jointly with the partners and prospects for bilateral cooperation. ""One of the most important issues is our support in the post-war restoration of Ukraine involving Greek companies,"" Mitsotakis added.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

BELGRADE, November 16. /TASS/. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic urged the government at the Cabinet meeting to consider all the possible options before making the final decision on NIS oil and gas company.

No decision will be made immediately at the current meeting but there is actually no time left for considerations, the Serbian leader said. ""There is no decision at present but we can make the decision tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, two days after tomorrow. We are obliged to finally decide before the next week,"" he noted.

The head of state confirmed readiness to continue communications with the Russian side. Serbia can make an offer if Moscow and the third party do not agree upon the price, he said. ""If Russians fail to come to terms on the price with a third party, my proposal is to consider an option that we offer the best price,"" Vucic said.

Belgrade seeks after avoiding any radical steps, he stressed. ""I want to avoid confiscation, nationalization and property seizure at any cost. I want the whole world to see: we do not want to detract something from anyone,"" Vucic noted.

US OFAC told Belgrade earlier about the requirement to completely oust Russian shareholders from NIS. The US said in writing that it does not accept any decisions on change of control without the change of the owner and excluded the possibility for Russian participation to be kept via affiliates of Gazprom or the Russian government sector.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Congresswoman, a longtime Trump ally, pushes back on president's remarks labeling her a traitor and a lunatic

Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday called Donald Trump's remarks labeling her a traitor and a lunatic “hurtful” but said she hopes she and the US president can “make up”, despite stark differences over policy and the release of documents about Jeffrey Epstein.

Greene, a longtime ally and fierce defender of Trump and the “Make America great again” (Maga) base, pushed back against his name-calling in her first interview since Trump withdrew his support for her on Friday.

She told CNN's State of the Union show: “His remarks, of course, have been hurtful … the most hurtful thing he said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor and that is so extremely wrong.”

Greene said on Saturday she had been contacted by private security firms “with warnings for my safety” since Trump said he was withdrawing his endorsement of her as a Republican member of Congress, following several days of remarks and posts criticizing her.

Greene had said in an X post that “a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world”, without referring to Trump by name, adding it was “the man I supported and helped get elected”.

She did not go into further detail on Sunday morning about the nature and sources of such threats.

But she added in her TV interview about Trump's attacks, especially the label traitor: “Those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger.”

“It has all come down to the ‘Epstein files' and that is shocking and, you know, I stand with these women, I stand with rape victims … and survivors of trafficking … I believe the country deserves transparency in these files,” she said.

Greene plans to join a vote in the House of Representatives later this week to demand the release of all files held by the US government on Epstein, the late financier and sex offender who killed himself in prison while awaiting trial on sex offenses in New York in 2019.

Even though the Senate is expected to kill any such bill, the upcoming vote and last week's release of thousands of documents with revelations about Epstein's ties to Trump, Steve Bannon and other powerful figures, is putting huge pressure on the administration, including from victims of Epstein.

Greene's falling out with Trump was months in the making but matters escalated dramatically in recent weeks.

Greene also called on Sunday for an end to “toxic infighting” in politics. CNN anchor Dana Bash challenged Greene on her track record of past violent rhetoric towards Democrats, including Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama and posts such as an image of herself posing with a gun alongside pictures of the “Squad” group of congressional leftwingers, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

“I'm sorry for taking part in the toxic politics … put down the knives, be kind to one another … I never wanted to cause any harm,” Greene said.

Greene has also diverged from Trump's focus on foreign policy issues, arguing he should be concentrating on bringing down inflation in the US and take an even harder line on immigration.

“I would like to see Air Force One parked and staying at home,” she said.

But she ended the interview with CNN, when asked if there could be reconciliation with Trump, by saying: “Well, I certainly hope that we can make up. I can only speak for myself. I'm a Christian and one of the most important parts of our faith is forgiveness, and that's something I'm committed to.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Long after his conviction for sexual abuse, people in royalty, academia, business, journalism and politics sought his ear

He got by with a little help from his friends. From British royalty to White House alumni, from a Silicon Valley investor to a leftwing academic, connections and influence were the ultimate currency for Jeffrey Epstein.

Yet none appeared to challenge Epstein over his horrific crimes. If silence is complicity, the casual disdain of the elite circles he moved in spoke volumes.

Emails released this week by the House of Representatives' oversight committee revealed how Epstein maintained contact with business executives, reporters, academics and political players despite his 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.

Epstein's death – he was charged with sex trafficking in 2019 and killed himself in prison a month later – has long been a magnet for conspiracy theories but the documents expose a reality less about a shadowy cabal and more about a system of power that operates in plain sight, indifferent to conviction or consequence.

Spanning 2009 to 2019, Epstein's short, choppy emails laden with spelling and grammatical errors do little to implicate his contacts – including Donald Trump – in any criminal activities. But they do show some acquaintances supporting him during legal troubles while others sought introductions or advice on everything from dating to oil prices.

Their bantering, frivolous tone implies that Epstein would have felt still welcome as a member of polite society, receiving no social incentive to change his ways. Far from being ostracised as a sex offender, he was normalised.

In several messages in 2018, he advised longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon on his political tour of Europe that year. Bannon forwarded Epstein a news clip that described the German media as “underestimating” Bannon and saying he was “As Dangerous as Ever”.

“luv it,” Epstein responded.

Epstein wrote that he'd just spoken to “one of the country leaders that we discussed” and that “we should lay out a strategy plan. . how much fun.”

Several months later, Epstein sent some advice: “If you are going to play here , you'll have to spend time, europe by remote doesn't work.”

“its doable but time consuming,” Epstein continued in a follow-up email, “there are many leaders of countries we can organize for you to have one on ones.” Bannon replied: “Agree 100% How do I do that???”

When physicist Lawrence Krauss faced sexual harassment allegations, he emailed Epstein for advice on how to handle a journalist's inquiry. After asking whether Krauss had had sex with the person in question, Epstein advised him not to reply to the journalist.

Larry Summers, who was treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and later president of Harvard University, discussed his interactions with a woman and Epstein offered coaching on his response, writing: “you reacted well.. annoyed shows caring. , no whining showed strentgh.”

In another email, Summers opined: “I'm trying to figure why American elite think if u murder your baby by beating and abandonment it must be irrelevant to your admission to Harvard, but hit on a few women 10 years ago and can't work at a network or think tank. DO NOT REPEAT THIS INSIGHT.”

In a further message, Summers asked: “How is life among the lucrative and louche?” Epstein replied: “When we meet I will endeavor to mesmerize you with stories of D.C. so wild !!!”

Summers was not the only Democrat in Epstein's orbit. Kathryn Ruemmler, a former White House counsel under Barack Obama, sent a message to him calling Trump “so gross”. A portion of that message was redacted, but Epstein replied: “worse in real life and upclose.”

In other emails with Ruemmler, Epstein detailed a whirlwind of well-known people he appears to have been meeting, hosting or speaking with that week, including an ambassador, a tech giant, foreign business people, academics and a film director. “you are a welcome guest at any,” he wrote.

In one message, Ruemmler expressed apparent contempt for the people of New Jersey as she planned a road trip to New York: “Think I am going to drive. I will then stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food for the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people.”

The documents also cast significant doubt on the former prince Andrew's official account of his relationship with Epstein and his accusers. An email from March 2011 shows continued contact four months after Andrew later publicly claimed to have ended the relationship. In a message to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell regarding allegations, Andrew wrote: “I can't take any more of this my end.”

Another email appears to corroborate the famous photograph of Andrew with accuser Virginia Giuffre. Epstein wrote: “Yes, she was on my plane and yes, she had her photo taken with Andrew, as many of my employees have.” This stands in contrast with the prince's public speculation during a 2019 interview that the photograph may have been faked.

Journalist Michael Wolff appears in numerous exchanges, often acting as an informal adviser to Epstein regarding his relationship with Trump. In 2015, Wolff advised Epstein to “let him [Trump] hang himself” if Trump were asked about their relationship during a CNN appearance, suggesting that any denial from Trump would give Epstein “valuable PR and political currency”.

Shortly before the 2016 election, Wolff wrote to Epstein: “There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?”

The emails show that Epstein's role in his network went far beyond social pleasantries. He was treated as a trusted consigliere, a fixer whose judgment on matters of politics, scandal and personal life was actively sought by the powerful.

He even sought to shape foreign policy. In the run-up to Trump's 2018 bilateral meeting with Vladimir Putin, Epstein proposed that Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister, might benefit from his own insights into the then-US president.

“I think you might suggest to Putin that Lavrov can get insight on talking to me,” Epstein wrote in an email to Thorbjørn Jagland, the former Norwegian prime minister who was at the helm of the Council of Europe at the time.

Epstein went on to claim that he had previously discussed Trump with Vitaly Churkin, Russia's ambassador to the UN, before Churkin's death in 2017. “Churkin was great,” Epstein wrote. “He understood Trump after our conversations. It is not complex. He must be seen to get something – it's that simple.”

In January 2010, biotech venture capitalist Boris Nikolic was attending the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and Epstein emailed to ask: “any fun?” Nikolic replied that he had met “your friend” Bill Clinton, as well as then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy and “your other friend”, Andrew, “as he has some questions re microsoft”.

But then Nikolic said he was getting sick of meetings. Later, he wrote Epstein that “it would be blast that you are here”. He mentioned flirting with a 22-year-old woman and wrote that “It turns out she is with her husand. Did not have chance to check him out. But as we concluded, anything good is rented ;)”.

In emails with Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, an Emirati businessman, Epstein complimented Bannon, saying in 2018 that “We have become friends you will like him”.

“Trump doesn't like him,” responded Sulayem.

A year earlier, Sulayem had asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance, asking: “Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump.”

“Call to discuss,” Epstein wrote back.

The list of associates was wide and varied. In 2011, Epstein asked the publicist Peggy Siegal to contact media entrepreneur Arianna Huffington to “champion the dangers of false allegations” and investigate accuser Virginia Giuffre. Siegal called the request “moronic”.

In a 2015 email, Epstein offered Noam Chomsky, a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and political activist, use of his New York and New Mexico residences. Their exchange also covered topics such as currency collapses and behavioral science.

The artist Andres Serrano discussed the 2016 election with him, writing that he was so “disgusted by the outrage over ‘grab them by the pussy' that I may give him my sympathy vote”.

Epstein was also in touch with Peter Thiel, a Silicon Valley investor and ally of JD Vance. Epstein sent Thiel an email in 2014 saying “that was fun , see you in 3 weeks”. Four years later, Epstein asked if Thiel was enjoying Los Angeles, and, after Thiel said he could not complain, replied “Dec visit me Caribbean”. It is unclear whether Thiel ever responded.

The secrets of Epstein's inbox do not reveal an overarching conspiracy but paints a more sobering picture: a world where immense wealth, privileged access and proximity to power can insulate individuals from accountability and consequences. For those inside the circle, the rules of the outside world do not apply.

Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House judiciary committee, said: “This is a guy who I believe gave huge donations to colleges and universities, including Harvard and MIT, and those kinds of gifts can buy you a lot of currency and access in different elite circles.

“People will want to know to what extent all of these different actors understood what was going on. It may be that the people he interacted with at MIT or Harvard did not have the same level of awareness as Prince Andrew or Donald Trump did but everybody should be asked to tell what they knew.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Voters face seemingly extreme choice between communist and rightwing frontrunners, who both promise to fight foreign gangs

Chileans began voting for a new president and parliament on Sunday, in a contest expected to favour the hard right as candidates play on popular fears over organised crime and immigration.

It is the first of an expected two rounds of presidential elections, as polls show none of the candidates clearing the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff scheduled for 14 December.

On the surface, Sunday's election offers Chileans a dramatic choice between two extremes: Jeannette Jara, 51, a card-carrying communist and former labour minister in the leftwing government, and, among other rightwing contenders, José Antonio Kast, 59, an ultraconservative lawyer and former lawmaker who opposes abortion and vows to shrink the state.

But with voters anxious about a rise in gang-driven crime that they blame on a recent surge of illegal immigration from crisis-stricken Venezuela, the campaign has steered the starkly opposed frontrunners toward the shared theme of public insecurity.

Polls opened at 8am and close at 6pm, with results expected throughout the night.

In a feat of political gymnastics, the communist candidate has promoted fiscal restraint while the Catholic father of nine has avoided talk of traditional family values.

Both say a top priority is to fight foreign gangs, such as Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, whose recent push into Chile has fuelled kidnappings, extortion and sex trafficking and shattered the country's self-perception as far safer and more stable than the rest of the region.

“They're talking about things that all voters care about, they're vying for the center,” said Rodolfo Disi, a political scientist at Adolfo Ibáñez University in Santiago.

Polling behind Jara and Kast in the eight-candidate field are Johannes Kaiser, 49, a radical libertarian congressman and YouTuber, and Evelyn Matthei, 72, a veteran centre-right politician.

With the rightwing vote divided and President Gabriel Boric's centre-left coalition united behind its former minister, most experts see the charismatic Jara prevailing in Sunday's first round. Boric is constitutionally barred from seeking a consecutive term.

But an initial win for Jara may yet end in defeat in a runoff against a rightwing rival who promises a harsher security crackdown. “If [Jara] moves toward being tougher on crime, the right can always be tougher,” said Disi. “It's a losing game.”

This is the first time in Chile's history that all eligible citizens will be obliged to vote for the next president.

The country recently reintroduced mandatory voting after ending the practice in 2012. Voter registration is now automatic, so the millions of people who never registered, even when voting was compulsory, will be casting their first ballots in a presidential race. Those who fail to do so face fines of up to $100.

Analysts are divided over the potential effects.

“It's a huge question,” said Robert Funk, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chile. “We have 4 million new voters. Who are they? Are they young people who like Jara? Are they people from marginal neighbourhoods attracted to Kast's hardline stance on crime?”

Chile will also renew the entire lower house of congress and part of the senate on Sunday.

The country has 15.7 million eligible voters, of whom more than 800,000 are immigrants with residency of five years or more, who are exempt from mandatory voting. Polls show that foreigners overwhelmingly favour the right – especially Venezuelans who fled their repressive socialist government.

All frontrunners have taken an iron-fisted approach to illegal immigration. Chile's foreign population has doubled since 2017, with 1.6 million immigrants recorded last year in the nation of 18 million. An estimated 330,000 are undocumented

Kast wants to build a massive wall along Chile's northern border and deport tens of thousands of people who entered illegally. Kaiser wants to hold undocumented people in detention camps and bar their children from attending school. Matthei wants to deploy drones and more armed forces to the border

Jara, too, has sought to burnish her tough-on-crime credentials with promises to build new prisons and expel foreigners convicted of drug trafficking.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

With Russia throwing enormous forces into Pokrovsk to finally capture the eastern coal-mine city, questions are rising over what will happen next and whether Ukraine is ready.

Taking advantage of foggy weather that hampers drones to ramp up the offensive, Russian troops are trying to end the more than a yearlong battle.

After capturing what's left of Pokrovsk, Russian troops would likely push toward the town of Dobropillia to the north, according to Pasi Paroinen, an analyst with the Finland-based open-source analysis organization Black Bird Group.

Paroinen said that while Russia would also likely try to advance deeper into the adjacent Dnipropetrovsk Oblast toward the town of Mezhova to the west, its main focus would remain in Donetsk Oblast. He believes that Russian troops would try to recapture the areas east of Dobropillia that they occupied during the August breach but lost to Ukrainian counterattacks.

But regardless of Russia's fighting capability after the capture of Pokrovsk and a brief operational pause that would likely follow, the condition of Ukrainian units deployed there will set the pace of future battles, Paroinen stressed.

""A lot will depend on what is the state of Ukrainian forces after Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad,"" Paroinen told the Kyiv Independent. ""I think the crucial question is: Was it worth it to hold on to these towns that are now very difficult to hold and defend?""

Russian troops are closing in on the Ukrainian pocket, leaving only about a 10-kilometer (about six miles) gap to allow Ukraine to keep supplying troops and equipment into Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad, according to the Ukrainian open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState. Russia has traditionally relied on an encirclement tactic to eventually force a Ukrainian withdrawal.

Pokrovsk, once a key Ukrainian logistic hub tucked away in the relatively quiet part of Donetsk Oblast, has long remained a focal point of Russia's offensive.

Since capturing Avdiivka, a town about 45 kilometers (about 28 miles) to the southeast, in February 2024, Russian troops have been inching toward Pokrovsk and reached the city's outskirts at the end of the year.

It's unclear how much longer Ukraine can hold on to Pokrovsk. President Volodymyr Zelensky said in late October that Russian troops outnumbered the Ukrainians eight to one in the Pokrovsk sector. The 7th Corps of Ukraine's Air Assault Forces deployed in the area admitted on Nov. 12 that Russia's recent large-scale assault using light vehicles  to attack Pokrovsk was ""partially successful.""

Past Pokrovsk, Ukraine appears to have prepared ""a very complex network"" of numerous anti-tank ditches and Dragon Teeth obstacles to prevent a further Russian breakthrough, Paroinen said, citing satellite images.

While the ""most important"" defense fortifications appear to be built, satellite images do not clearly show small infantry positions, Paroinen said. He said it is ""difficult to imagine"" that Ukraine did not build them, as it had ample time to do so.

Fortifications have long been a weak spot for the Ukrainian army. After Russia captured Avdiivka in 2024, its troops kept advancing, raising concerns about whether Ukraine had adequately prepared for the town's fall. In areas that had been far from the front, such as northeastern Sumy Oblast and Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Russia was able to suddenly open new fronts. Soldiers later voiced anger over what the Ukrainian army and local authorities responsible for building fortifications had been doing while the fighting was raging elsewhere.

Once the battle for Pokrovsk is over, Ukrainian units deployed there will be ""very exhausted and very depleted,"" as defending the round salient requires more forces than a linear front line, Paroinen explained. They have been holding onto the Ukrainian pocket despite the extremely complicated supply routes for over a month now.

It's unclear whether the Ukrainian army can afford to deploy reserves to replace the battle-exhausted brigades that have long fought in the Pokrovsk sector. When Avdiivka was about to fall to Russia, Ukraine was able to send an element of the elite 3rd Assault Brigade in to allow troops to evacuate. Serhiy Hrabskyi, a retired Ukrainian colonel and military analyst, said at the end of October that well-trained reserves are what the military lacks the most.

If it becomes too costly for Ukraine to hold onto a pocket like the one around Pokrovsk, the battle can turn into a ""pretty good"" opportunity for Russia to wage attritional warfare, according to Paroinen.

Many units defending the Pokrovsk sector, such as the 25th Airborne Brigade under the 7th Corps, had been fighting in other hot spots of the war before being sent to Pokrovsk. After fighting battle upon battle, many of these experienced brigades are struggling more than ever to refill the losses, especially in the infantry.

But Pokrovsk's fall would likely not significantly impact the rest of the front line, as Ukraine has already had to relocate its logistic hub elsewhere deeper in the rear, Paroinen assessed.

The question that remains is whether Ukraine will have enough fighting power after its fall to slow down Russia's pace of advance.

Capturing Pokrovsk, home to a railway and highway intersection, would give Russia at least some logistical benefit for future offensives, according to two Western analysts interviewed. The M30 highway is a key route connecting cities further west in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, including Dnipro, with the last Ukrainian strongholds in Donetsk Oblast to the north, such as Kostiantynivka.

While Russian troops have always been trying to encircle Kostiantynivka, a transport hub about 50 kilometers (about 30 miles) to the northeast, they will likely intensify the Kostiantynivka offensive once Pokrovsk falls, according to Paroinen. Kostiantynivka, which was also once considered safe in Donetsk Oblast, is now surrounded on three sides and suffers from heavy Russian attacks.

The expert assessed that it would take a long time before Russia could use the railway to bring in troops and equipment from Donetsk, the regional capital of the region that Russia occupied in 2024. The fighting has to be pushed at least 20-30 kilometers (about 12 to 19 miles) away to prevent the logistics from being hit regularly by Ukrainian artillery and drones, he added.

As Ukraine's mining capital since 2014, Pokrovsk, once home to approximately 60,000 people, also has an extensive mine network deep underground, which could provide a suitable shelter for Russian troops.

Austrian warfare expert Tom Cooper believes that Russia would try to cut off Kramatorsk, now the regional capital since 2014, by moving from Pokrovsk to Pavlohrad in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, while also pushing from the north by advancing toward Izium.

For now, Russia's relentless assaults on Pokrovsk rage on.

Ukrainian military analyst Oleksii Hetman said that Russia is trying to send as many sabotage groups inside Pokrovsk so there would be at least 1,000 people, and then to attack from the inside.

""(Russian troops are) trying to find a weaker defense spot so that they can send a significant amount of forces and resources, which are people and equipment, there,"" Hetman told the Kyiv Independent.

The Ukrainian military's 7th Corps said on Nov. 11 that over 300 Russian troops were inside Pokrovsk.

Hetman stressed the importance of not overestimating Russia's fighting capabilities, explaining that Russia had deployed a fourth of its army to capture Pokrovsk, yet the battle has raged on for a year and a half.

But Cooper is more pessimistic about the future, as the capture of Pokrosk would mean Russia, whose army heavily relies on the railway, would be seizing a key railway junction.

""Pokrovsk is probably going to be a very important place or something like a center from where they intend to continue their advance,"" Cooper told the Kyiv Independent.

""So now the question is whether they are going to advance in a western or northern direction.""

Russian forces launched an armored assault on Novopavlivka, a front-line village on strategic high ground along the Dnipropetrovsk-Donetsk oblast border that has for months blocked Russian attempts to push deeper into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Using poor weather and low visibility, they tried to break through, but Ukrainian forces said they repelled the attack.

On Nov. 14, under cover of thick November fog, Russian forces “established a pontoon crossing between Yalta and Dachnyi and transported about 10 units of equipment,” reported the Ukrainian mapping and analytical group Deep State. 

According to DeepState, the Russian soldiers managed to disperse the troops in the central and southern parts of the village, where they then took shelter in basements. 

In some areas, Russian forces breached Ukrainian defenses, the 42nd Mechanized Brigade confirmed to the Ukrainian military news site Militarnyi. ""The occupiers infiltrated our positions. However, first-person view (FPV) drones, particularly from the 'Perun' drone battalion of the 42nd  Mechanized Brigade, responded quickly to activity near the deployment site,"" the statement said.

The 9th Army Corps also released a video showing the destruction of Russian armored vehicles during an attempted assault by the units of the 42nd Mechanized Brigade and the 46th Airmobile Brigade.

“The assault resulted in significant losses of both equipment and personnel for the enemy. A series of clearing operations are underway. The situation is under the control of the Defense Forces,” they stated.

Currently, whether or not any Russian troops succeeded in digging in inside Novopavlivka is unclear. 

Lying on the edge of an area of strategic high ground, the village of Novopavlivka and the fortified area around it have blocked Russian attempts to push deeper into Dnipropetrovsk Oblast along this section of the regional border with Donetsk Oblast for months. 

But as the Ukrainian defense of the entire front line has become increasingly strained over the fall fighting season, Russian forces have been pressing forward — helped by favorable weather conditions — especially further south in eastern Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted in its Nov. 15 report that Russian forces are exploiting foggy weather conditions to target vulnerabilities in Ukraine's drone-based battlefield defenses. This tactic has been observed across the front, particularly in the Pokrovsk, Velykomykhailivske, and Huliaipole areas.

Russian forces have also used the cover of fog are also to advance into Pokrovsk from the southern outskirts, using light equipment and coming from the occupied areas of Selydove and Donetsk.

The 7th Corps reported that over 300 Russian troops are currently in the city, aiming to reach the northern borders of Pokrovsk and encircle the urban area.

Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares.  Help us reach 25,000 members by the end of 2025.

With Czechia's new government coalition likely to take office in the coming weeks, the question of the country's landmark ammunition initiative for Kyiv remains unanswered.

Populist billionaire Andrej Babis, whose ANO party ousted the pro-Ukraine cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Fiala in the October parliamentary election, has lambasted the project as overpriced and non-transparent.

Neither Prague nor its partners, however, have put forward a definite plan on keeping the scheme operational in its current form should the new government abandon it.

Czech officials say Babis's suggestion to have NATO take over it is not feasible, and that simply passing it over to another country would also be a tall feat.

The Czech ammunition initiative, hailed by its proponents as Prague's greatest achievement on the international stage, was launched in early 2024 amid Ukraine's severe ammunition shortage.

Czechia said it had delivered 1.5 million shells, including the sorely needed 155 mm and 122 mm calibers, under the initiative last year, and an additional 1.3 million by October 2025.

Following the defeat of the Czech governing coalition in the October parliamentary election, European partners have grown anxious about the prospect of the victorious opposition scrapping it.

Babis has been ambiguous about the project's future. While initially vowing to cancel it altogether if elected, his party later toned down its rhetoric, calling instead for a review or for the initiative to be passed under NATO's wing.

But the outgoing Czech Defense Ministry has already ruled out the option, saying that ""NATO does not and cannot buy materiel for Ukraine"" and materiel purchases and donations are ""always carried out by individual members.""

Media and observers have also speculated about the possibility of passing the initiative over to another member state.

Czech news outlet Seznam Zpravy reported that, according to its sources, Estonia is being discussed as a possible candidate. However, Tallinn has ruled out such an option when asked by the Kyiv Independent.

The Estonian Foreign Ministry said that ""no such discussions (are) taking place,"" and the country's Defense Ministry added that Estonia has no plans to take the lead in the initiative.

""I do not comment on the content of diplomatic talks,"" Czech Foreign Ministry spokesperson Daniel Drake told the Kyiv Independent. ""We rule out that the Czech ambassador to Estonia conducted any such talks.""

Tomas Kopecny, a Czech official who was one of the initiative's architects, confirmed that talks with partners about the project's future have been underway but denied that transferring it to another country was discussed.

While the Estonian government pushed for its own ammunition schemes earlier in the war, Kopecny said they turned out to be less time-efficient than the Czech project, which relied on private companies to purchase the shells directly.

Czechia has been leveraging its extensive contacts in the global arms market to oversee the initiative, gathering approximately $4.5 billion from 15 donor countries.

Kopecny clarified that Prague initiated discussions about the initiative's future with foreign partners in early 2025, when ANO began openly discussing the cancellation of the scheme.

""We have been… explaining how likely such a scenario is, what it would mean for the operation, and discussing how to keep the supply mechanism running,"" if the Czech government is no longer interested, the official said, without providing details.

This means that the initiative's future remains shrouded in uncertainty, much like the entire Ukraine policy of the incoming Czech government.

While the outgoing Czech government made its staunchly pro-Western and pro-Kyiv policy one of its key pillars, Babis has been dodgy on the topic of Ukraine.

The government program policy of ANO and its junior coalition partners — the far-right Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party and the anti-environmentalist Motorists — barely touches on the war and makes no mention of continued Czech support.

Babis said his cabinet would no longer allocate defense aid to Ukraine from the state budget, noting that Kyiv should receive support through the EU instead.

His rhetoric has echoed those of Budapest and Washington, urging a diplomatic resolution of the war.

As they seek to assess the direction of the incoming Czech government, Ukrainian officials have struck a cautious tone — thanking Prague for its past support and awaiting next steps.

When SPD leader Tomio Okamura, the new speaker of the Czech parliament, removed a Ukrainian flag from the legislature's building, his Ukrainian counterpart, Ruslan Stefanchuk, reacted by flying the Czech flag in the Verkhovna Rada.

There has been little talk about the Czech initiative's future on the Ukrainian side.

Speaking to the Kyiv Independent in October, lawmaker Oleksandr Merezhko lauded Czechia's initiative to gather artillery ammunition for Ukraine ""when we needed it the most.""

Both Ukraine and its European partners have ramped up artillery production in recent years, with Kyiv's priorities currently focused on securing additional air defenses in the face of Russian aerial attacks.

Merezhko, who heads the Ukrainian parliament's foreign affairs committee, said that while the ammunition initiative has been ""extremely important"" for Kyiv, it would not be a critical loss now if it is scrapped.

The initiative, crucial a year ago, is becoming less important by the day due to one simple reason — the war has changed.

Airports around the world are taking the pain out of travel as they compete to become global hubs. Canadian airports, however, are lagging

Canadians traveling abroad are finding some wonderful surprises when they set foot in certain international airports: clearing security and customs is fast and fuss-free. 

Arriving at London Heathrow, Canadians and citizens from dozens of other countries don't need to stand in line to talk to an agent for passport control. Instead, the traveller scans their passport at an eGate, a machine that uses facial recognition to match the passport's electronic chip and confirm the person's identity. The traveller walks through in seconds. 

At Dubai International Airport, which has built itself into one of the world's biggest travelling hubs, visitors who share their information in advance can land and walk through a “smart tunnel,” which verifies their identity through facial and iris recognition. There's no need to get out a passport or even stop walking.

People leaving Dubai can use its new “red carpet” corridor, where pre-screened travellers are identified through facial recognition in seconds without showing a passport or boarding pass. 

Several decades ago, Canada was considered ahead of the game when it came to facilitation – the efficient yet safe management of the flow of passengers, baggage and cargo through airports. However, Canada has fallen behind. 

There have been improvements in security screening and border clearance in recent years, but Canada's airports lag behind many facilities in the U.S., Europe and Asia, which have made big efforts to modernize technology and streamline processes. These new technologies speed up the queues, and often are more secure. 

The impact of the efficient processing of travellers goes beyond just shaving off a few minutes from the weary traveller's journey. Creating a fast and customer-friendly experience for travellers could give Canada an edge in the competition to build airports into global transportation hubs. 

Dubai, Singapore and Istanbul have seized the opportunity, aggressively upgrading their airports into high-volume transit points. However, Canada's outdated technology and regulations are holding it back from seizing an opportunity to create hubs for travellers going between Asia, South America and Europe. A European traveller, for example, could transfer through Toronto or Montreal on the way to Mexico City or Santiago – routes that might appeal to people seeking to avoid Donald Trump's America. 

The opportunity to build Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal into global crossroads is massive, but it requires vision. These cities can be more than just regional hubs – they can be world-class centres, meeting places for top business travellers and dealmakers from around the world. 

Canadian businesses are having to come to grips with the massive disruption from an increasingly protectionist United States. Building our airports into serious hubs would be a big step forward in the reorientation of our economy to be more outward facing and globally competitive, rather than just relying on selling our products and services to the giant next door.

A co-ordinated effort from the federal government and its agencies to modernize airport technology and regulations – and to reform our airline sector to boost competition – would have benefits beyond the aviation sector. 

Putting Canadian airports on the map would help tourism and provide a much-needed boost to international trade. More flights would make it easier for business travellers to land here, and would improve the ability to ship goods in and out of the country affordably: 30 per cent of the value of cargo currently coming into Canada that isn't from the U.S. arrives in planes, much of it inside passenger aircraft. 

In Canada, pre-board screening is a dog's breakfast. In the U.S., the Transportation Security Administration is both the regulator and operator of security screening, and it closely monitors the time it takes to process travellers. However, in this country, Transport Canada makes the regulations, and CATSA delivers the service. They in turn contract out screening to private companies in each region, such as GardaWorld. 

This results in inconsistency as screeners interpret or sometimes misinterpret CATSA rules. Travellers get mixed instructions on if they should keep their iPads in their bag, or if they can use a store-bought Ziploc for liquids.

At London Gatwick and some other international airports, the security lines have entirely switched to using computed tomography (CT) scanners, the same type of technology used in medical scans, to screen baggage. This means travellers no longer need to go through the dreaded process of removing electronics or liquids from their bags, which speeds up screening. Some airports in Europe now allow passengers to bring in up to two litres of liquids in hand luggage. 

CT scanners produce more accurate 3D images, making it easier to detect explosives and other threats, so there's less need to review items and do manual searches. While some Canadian airports now have CT scanners, the bulk of the screening is done with post-9/11 technology: scanners with fuzzy, two-dimensional images and high false-alarm rates. According to CATSA's 2025 annual report, just 21 out of 300 pre-board screening lines have CT units.

Just like the rule requiring passengers to remove their shoes for screening, which Transport Canada thankfully dropped in July following its elimination in the U.S., Canada is following rather than leading. 

In recent years, the CBSA, which is in charge of border screening, has made more use of passenger information sent in advance to vet travellers heading to Canada while they are still in the air, and they are experimenting with artificial intelligence to hone in on high-risk travellers. However, more can be done. 

When Canadians land at Toronto's Pearson Airport, for example, they can fill out their customs declaration on a kiosk. (These kiosks have experienced a string of outages this fall – a sign of the outdated technology underpinning the current system.) Then the traveller hands the kiosk receipt to a CBSA officer, who takes a quick glance to see if the person matches their passport photo and waves them through. 

While the process is an improvement over the previous one-on-one interviews, it could be streamlined and made more accurate by replacing the officer with an eGate with facial recognition for the bulk of travellers determined to be low-risk based on data sent in advance. Making the entry process simpler for citizens of key trading partners, such as providing eGate access to British citizens the same way they do for Canadians, could help us develop closer trade ties.

In the U.S., 16 states have digital ID, meaning residents can get a digital version of their driver's licence in their Google or Apple Wallet. They can use their phone or Apple Watch to cruise through TSA checkpoints at domestic airports. The U.S. also has an expedited process for people who upload their information to a mobile passport app, where they can check in an entire family from one device. 

The Canadian Airports Council has called on the government to implement regulatory changes to enable digital ID and biometrics in air travel. While biometrics such as facial recognition are being used by Air Canada in the boarding process, the Canadian Airports Council is calling for a biometrics policy across all federal departments and agencies, and the amendment of federal acts and statutes to enable more widespread use.

Of course, these technologies raise serious privacy issues. Any greenlighting should ensure the data is used only for the purpose designed, it isn't permanently stored, and travellers can opt out without being penalized. This technology needs to be handled carefully, but with airports around the world moving to facial recognition – the same technology people use to unlock their iPhones – stalling isn't an option. 

Shaving a few seconds or minutes off passenger journeys adds up, allowing airports to accommodate more travellers each day. This brings big benefits when you consider the large volumes using Canadian airports – 26 million people, for example, passed through Vancouver's YVR last year.

A unified government strategy is key to speeding up airport modernization. But in order for Canadian airports to reach their potential, an overhaul of the aviation industry is also needed. 

While Canada is well positioned geographically to serve as a gateway between Europe, the Americas and Asia, it is weighed down by its “user pay” model, which makes travel more expensive than other jurisdictions. Canadians pay some of the highest air security charges in the world.

The Air Travellers Security Charge, which is added to the price of an airplane ticket, is currently $34.42 for international departures from Canada. The same fee in the U.S. is $7.84 Canadian (US$5.60). The fact that these fees in Canada flow into the federal government's general revenue has raised suspicions that it is being used as a cash cow. Many in the industry would prefer to see the money directly going directly to improve screening through investments in technology and staffing. 

In addition, passengers are dinged with high airport improvement fees, which are added into ticket prices. Departing passengers at Pearson pay $37 plus tax for the airport improvement fee; the fee will rise to $40 in January. (Connecting passengers pay $8.) Many of these fees rose sharply since the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Airlines have hefty bills for fees too. They pay fuel taxes, fees to Nav Canada for air traffic control, and various fees to airports, which contribute to the high cost of flying but aren't broken down in ticket prices. As shown in the graphic below, these fees add up to almost 30 per cent of an airplane ticket price. These fees discourage Canadians, as well as foreigners, from flying in Canada. 

One of the biggest reasons Canadian airports charge such high fees to airlines, in turn, is because they pay high rents to the federal government. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the largest federally owned airports were transferred to airport authorities. Yet while global competitors generally have no rent, the federal government charged Canadian airports a hefty $487-million in 2023. The rents are calculated as a percentage of gross revenue, meaning the airports pay more as they grow. The federal budget said the government would examine airport rent formulas. Instead of tinkering, Ottawa should drop the rents entirely. 

The budget also muses about privatizing airports. (Technically they are already private, but are controlled by not-for-profit corporations.) Developing Canadian airports into serious global hubs would be more likely under true private ownership, creating an incentive to grow and to keep costs down. It would also be more accountable than the current model, where the leadership is selected by boards of trade and various levels of government. 

The government is trying to encourage pension funds to invest in airports, which could help. When it comes to Canadian airlines, further loosening foreign ownership rules to eliminate the current 49 per cent limit for a single investor, as suggested in a recent Competition Bureau report, could attract investors and drive down prices. Relaxing rules around cabotage – allowing foreign airlines to fly between two Canadian cities – would further boost competition.

The potential impacts of turning Canadian airports into global hubs would be transformative. Industries such as warehousing, logistics and manufacturing, which often develop around transportation hubs, would thrive. Shipping costs would drop, boosting exports and reducing import prices. 

Canada faces huge economic challenges across virtually every sector as it seeks to reduce dependency on the U.S. Airports can and should be a key part of that reorientation – quite literally, opening up Canada to the world.

It's the spring of 2022 and federal and Ontario government officials are standing on the floor of a General Motors GM-N plant in Oshawa, Ont., to announce they were giving the automaker more than half a billion dollars.

The Detroit-based carmaker would use the money as part of a $2-billion plan to reopen the Chevrolet Silverado truck plant in Oshawa and retool a factory in Ingersoll, Ont., to build BrightDrop electric parcel vans. 

Politicians took their turns at the microphone to declare the money would secure high-paying assembly jobs, reduce GM's cost of making cars in Ontario and forge Canada's future as a centre for green-vehicle manufacturing. Each government's contribution was up to $259-million. 

“Folks, this is just another huge win for the people of Durham and all of Ontario,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters. 

“Today is proof that Canada's auto sector is here for the long term,” said François-Philippe Champagne, then Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. 

Or not. 

Fast-forward to today and the picture is very different. The Ingersoll plant, known as CAMI, is closed, the BrightDrop scrapped and 1,150 workers are laid off. In Oshawa, the third shift of workers – including about 700 jobs – is set to be eliminated in January and truck production is declining. 

Meanwhile, GM has boosted production of the Silverado in Fort Wayne, Ind., and is busily retooling a plant in Orion, Mich., to make more of the pickup trucks by 2027.

Stellantis announced in October that its plant in Brampton, Ont., will no longer produce the Jeep Compass.Tijana Martin/The Globe and Mail

The moves are spurred by U.S. President Donald Trump's 25-per-cent tariffs on Canadian-made vehicles, and poor sales of the BrightDrop. Similarly, Stellantis NV STLA-N said in October it would move planned production of the Jeep Compass to Illinois from its plant in Brampton. That factory was also being retooled with taxpayer support. 

‘We feel betrayed': Laid off for years, Stellantis workers in Brampton confront a grim new reality

“General Motors appreciates that support from the Canadian and Ontario governments enabled investments in CAMI and Oshawa and is committed to working closely with Unifor and our government partners as we evaluate next steps for the future of CAMI,” GM spokeswoman Jennifer Wright said in an e-mail.

She declined to provide details of the agreements with governments. The automaker has invested more than $2.6-billion in Canada in the past five years, she said, including $280-million in Oshawa.

Even before Mr. Trump began his campaign of destroying the Canadian auto sector, parts of the industry were not in great shape. Long-term production had declined and two assembly plants were idled for retooling: Ford in Oakville and Stellantis in Brampton. But the retreat has gained pace since Mr. Trump took office. Brampton's future is now a question mark, Ingersoll is empty and Oshawa is shrinking.

Opinion: Canadian leaders are naive to be shocked over Stellantis pulling Jeeps from Brampton

The bad news raises questions about the wisdom of taxpayer handouts to carmakers that can walk away when times change, laying off thousands at assembly plants and the parts factories that supply them. 

The grants GM received from governments were to cover capital expenses of building the Oshawa and Ingersoll assembly lines and related work. Typically, governments give automakers grants worth 20 per cent of their capital budgets. 

Jason Clemens, executive vice-president of the Fraser Institute, calls the auto subsidies “corporate welfare” and bad public policy that lead to higher taxes with no long-term economic gain.

But if governments did not come up with the money in 2022, the GM plants would not have reopened and the jobs would be long gone, said one person familiar with the matter, whom The Globe and Mail is not identifying because they are not authorized to speak publicly.

The same can be said for much of Ontario's broader auto sector – its presence has long relied on government aid. 

Without subsidies, “we would have seen a much bigger decline in our auto industry over the last generation,” said Jim Stanford, economist and director at the Centre for Future Work.

For decades, taxpayer aid for the Canadian auto sector has encouraged companies to keep plants running, retool and continue to provide well-paying jobs. Canada competes for these plants with the U.S. and Mexico, which also offer rich subsidies and, in some cases, lower pay and non-union shops. 

Government aid to GM and other automakers in Canada goes back decades and amounts to many billions of dollars. 

In 2009, Canada gave $13.7-billion in aid to GM Canada and Stellantis to help the companies survive the financial crisis. GM's share was $10.8-billion; taxpayers were left with a $2.8-billion loss, according to the Canadian Taxpayers Federation. 

In 1987, governments gave GM and partner Suzuki $112-million in grants and incentives to build the Ingersoll plant – the one now shuttered.

The same year, GM received $220-million in interest-free loans from governments for its plant in Ste-Therese, Que. It left the province in 2002. 

Tens of billions more in government subsidies were earmarked for various EV battery makers in Canada in recent years, just ahead of a slowdown in demand for electric cars. 

That includes aid worth up to $15-billion for Stellantis and LG Energy for the NextStar battery plant in Windsor, Ont. That agreement was announced in 2023, when the assumed pre-eminence of electric cars was unquestioned and Mr. Trump's tariffs unforeseen. As EV sales slump, NextStar says it has shifted its focus to stationary batteries – not EVs – as production starts this month. 

After giving auto makers billions of dollars in subsidies, governments in Canada are trying to figure out how to respond to these companies leaving the country.Fred Lum/the Globe and Mail

Now, Canadian governments are figuring out how to respond to companies they've funded now pulling back from Canada.

In October, Mr. Champagne, as Finance Minister, notified GM he is “disappointed” by GM's production cuts in Ontario and reduced the automaker's tariff-free import quota by 24 per cent, while also reducing Stellantis's quota.

Ottawa's move to curb tariff relief for GM, Stellantis will harm country's auto sector, manufacturers say

Details of the agreements governments and automakers reach are confidential. Financial aid usually takes a few forms: cash grants, tax breaks or production subsidies. Generally, there are strings attached related to employment, production and amounts spent by the companies themselves. 

Ontario's legal team is in touch with GM to ensure the funding agreements are respected and enforced, said Jennifer Cunliffe, a spokeswoman for Ontario's Minister of Economic Development Victor Fedeli. She did not address questions about how much of the $259-million has been granted to GM.

The department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development said $236-million in federal money had been “disbursed” to GM by the end of fiscal year 2023-2024 but declined to say what job guarantees accompanied the funding. 

“The government is actively engaging with General Motors to ensure all outstanding conditions under the ... agreement are fulfilled,” the department said in a statement, describing the funding as “partially repayable.” 

The U.S.-imposed tariffs and the slowing growth in demand for battery-electric vehicles upended recent government subsidy policies, said Saibal Ray, a professor at McGill University. 

“Before Trump, you can make a case these were necessary and were perhaps effective, but today it's not clear because there is no guarantee that things will work as they are meant to work,” Prof. Ray said. 

Peter Frise, a professor at the University of Windsor, said carmakers are good at forecasting how production plans and consumer demand will let them fulfill financial covenants with governments. But the Trump era turned that on its head. 

“They have a very deep insight into what's going [to] happen next and how far they can go and what promises they can make,” Prof. Frise said. “But what has happened this time is they've been completely whipsawed by events in the United States around the tariffs and the dropping of the battery EV rebates.” 

He added, “I really don't ascribe bad faith to the companies right now. I'm not happy with what they've done. But I'm not sure what options they had. I think they feel they have to throw the White House a bone.”

Still, the Fraser Institute's Mr. Clemens said the GM and Stellantis cuts highlight governments' poor track records of selecting winners. The money would be better spent reducing taxes and creating conditions for all businesses to succeed, he said.

Demonstrators said the Mexican government has failed to clamp down on violent crime. However, President Claudia Sheinbaum claimed the protests were ""inorganic"" and orchestrated from abroad.

Thousands of people took to the streets of cities across Mexico on Saturday to protest against government security policies which they say have failed to curb increasing violence in the country.

The protests, which took place under the banner of ""Generation Z"" in the style of other such youth movements around the world, were prompted in particular by the murder of an anti-crime mayor earlier this month.

""Carlos did not die; the government killed him,"" chanted demonstrators in Mexico City, referring to the late mayor of Uruapan in the western state of Michoacan, who was shot dead at a public Day of the Dead (Dia de Muertos) event on November 1.

A small group of hooded protesters even tore down metal fences around the National Palace where Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum lives and works, prompting clashes with riot police who responded with tear gas and fire extinguishers.

""For many hours, this mobilization proceeded and developed peacefully, until a group of hooded individuals began to commit acts of violence,"" Pablo Vazquez, Mexico City's security chief, told reporters.

""This is how you should have protected Carlos Manzo,"" some of the protesters shouted at the security forces, according to the Reuters news agency.

Mexico City's public safety secretary Pablo Vazquez said in a press conference that 100 police officers were injured, including 40 who required hospital treatment.

Another 20 civilians were also injured, 20 arrested and another 20 ""referred for administrative offenses.""

Earlier this week, President Sheinbaum questioned the motivations for the demonstrations and said at her regular morning press conference that the protests were ""inorganic"" and ""paid for.""

""It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,"" the Mexican president said, claiming it was organized in large part by right-leaning political opponents and promoted by bots on social media.

While there were international elements to the protests, such as the pirate flag emblematic of the Japanese manga ""One Piece,"" which has become a symbol of global youth protest, other aspects were distinctly Mexican.

In addition to banners referring to the late Uruapan Mayor Manzo, others called for the removal of Sheinbaum's MORENA party.

Guests at an Istanbul hotel have reportedly been moved after three Germans who stayed there died of suspected poisoning. The source of the apparent poisoning has yet to be established.

A hotel in Istanbul has been evacuated following the deaths of a German-Turkish mother and her two children from suspected poisoning, local media have reported.

Another two tourists staying at the same hotel as the family in the Fatih neighborhood of Turkey's largest city were hospitalized on Saturday after displaying symptoms of nausea and vomiting, BirGun newspaper said.

The father from the family from Hamburg, which was holidaying in Istanbul, remained in ""critical condition"" in hospital, the city's regional health chief Abdullah Emre Guner said late Friday on X.

Although the main focus has so far been on food poisoning as a likely cause of death, investigators have also found that a ground-floor room of the hotel had recently been sprayed with chemicals, likely pesticides, the Hurriyet news website reported Saturday. 

Police have detained a hotel employee and two pest control workers, it added.

The dailies Cumhuriyet and Sabah have both reported that a baker working near the hotel has also been arrested, meaning that eight people have now been arrested in connection with the deaths, 

When asked by CNN Türk about possible food poisoning at the hotel, one of the hotel owners said there was no restaurant there and that only water was available to guests.

Forensic investigators have already taken samples of the drinking water.

The family fell ill after eating stuffed mussels from a street vendor and soup and a dish made from calf intestines, known in Turkish as kokorec, at another shop, according to the daily Sabah newspaper.

They are also known to have bought Turkish delight and water, while the Anadolu news agency reported that they also ate chicken.

The two children, aged 3 and 6, were admitted to hospital on Wednesday and treated for nausea and vomiting, but were initially discharged. All four members of the family were readmitted in the night when the children's condition deteriorated.

The children died shortly afterward, followed by the mother. 

The three were buried on Saturday in a town in the western Turkish province of Afyonkarahisar, according to Anadolu.

Four people who sell street food are among the eight arrested in connection with the case.

China has issued a travel warning for Japan amid an escalating dispute sparked by Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's remarks on  Taiwan.

Japan on Saturday urged China to continue dialogue after Beijing warned its citizens against visiting Japan, Kyodo news agency reported.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara said Japan had ""conveyed the message to China and strongly asked it to take appropriate actions,"" without elaborating, according to the report.

""China's view is not in line with Japan's understanding. It is precisely because differences remain that multilayered communication between Japan and China is essential,"" Kihara told reporters.

Tokyo's appeal comes amid a row over the new Japanese leader's remarks on Taiwan, a self-governing island China claims as its territory.

China cautioned its citizens against visiting Japan, a popular destination for Chinese tourists, ""in the near future"" late Friday.

""Recently, Japanese leaders have made blatantly provocative remarks regarding Taiwan, severely damaging the atmosphere for people-to-people exchanges,"" China's embassy in Japan said in a statement.

It added that the situation presents ""significant risks to the personal safety and lives of Chinese citizens in Japan.""

Following the announcement, three Chinese airlines, Air China, China Southern and China Eastern, offered full refunds or changes to Japan itineraries for free through December 31.

On November 7, Sanae Takaichi, who became prime minister last month, said in parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could amount to a ""survival-threatening situation,"" potentially requiring Japan to activate its forces in self-defense.

She said if an emergency on the self-governing island would entail ""battleships and the use of force, then that could constitute a situation threatening the survival (of Japan), any way you slice it.""

Under the security legislation passed in 2015, Japan can exercise collective self-defense under certain conditions.

Her remarks have prompted strong objections from China.

Despite the escalating diplomatic row, Takaichi has refused to withdraw her statement, which she defended as ""consistent with the government's traditional position.""

But the new Japanese leader, who has been a vocal critic of China and its military build-up in the Asia-Pacific, said she would refrain from making similar comments in the future.

			Intervention is latest sign of Donald Trump's willingness to interfere in domestic British affairs

The White House is considering offering political asylum to British “thought criminals”, The Telegraph understands.

Donald Trump's administration is exploring the possibility of extending refugee status to free speech activists who have been prosecuted for their words or for taking part in silent protests outside abortion clinics.

The censoring of pro-life campaigners Livia Tossici-Bolt and Adam Smith Connor raised particular concerns among the president's key allies.

“There are some people inside the administration that are actively scouting for cases,” a source with knowledge of the decision making said.

The intervention is the latest sign of Mr Trump's willingness to intervene in domestic British affairs amid growing transatlantic concern over the protection of freedom of speech.

A source close to the administration described the plan as “serious” and that while it was not top of the list of concerns, officials are “beginning to consider” offering political asylum to British citizens accused of so-called thought crimes.

The White House is considering offering visas to gender critical activists, immigration critics and pro-abortion campaigners, The Telegraph understands.

Mr Trump has already set a precedent for political asylum cases by granting refugee status to white South Africans who claimed they face racial discrimination in their home country.

Despite halting nearly all other refugee admissions shortly after returning to office in January, the president swiftly organised a scheme to allow in Afrikaners, the descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, who claim they have been denied jobs and targeted with violence because of their race.

The decision was largely influenced by Elon Musk, who has attacked the Government and British police forces for arresting individuals over offences, comments and so-called thought crimes.

In October, it was reported that the president may offer political asylum to Europeans who oppose migration.

Mr Trump is said to have been advised to prioritise Europeans who have been “targeted for peaceful expression of views online, such as opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist' political parties”.

At the United Nations, he warned that their countries were “going to hell” because of unchecked immigration.

He said: “You're destroying your countries. They're being destroyed. Europe is in serious trouble.

“They've been invaded by a force of illegal aliens like nobody's ever seen before. Illegal aliens are pouring into Europe.”

Last Sunday, The Telegraph revealed that the Trump administration was poised to revoke the visa of Imran Ahmed, the boss of a campaign group founded by Sir Keir Starmer's chief of staff after his campaign group pushed for restrictions on what can be published online.

Earlier this year, Sir Keir's attempts to strike a trade deal with the US were almost stifled over the case of Ms Tossici-Bolt, who was prosecuted for holding a sign near a Bournemouth abortion clinic reading: “Here to talk if you want.”

Asked about the comments, a source familiar with trade negotiations told The Telegraph there should be “no free trade without free speech”.

The intervention came after the president dispatched US officials to meet British pro-life activists over concerns their right to protest was being stifled.

The diplomats, from the bureau of democracy, human rights and labour (DRL) travelled to London in March in an effort to “affirm the importance of freedom of expression in the UK and across Europe”.

Led by Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the state department, they interviewed a handful of pro-life activists who had been arrested for silently protesting outside abortion clinics across Britain.

Since then, the Trump administration has also raised questions about the conviction and sentencing of several high-profile cases, including that of Lucy Connolly.

Ms Connolly was jailed over a social media post calling for asylum hotels to be set on fire in the hours after three girls were murdered at a Taylor Swift-themed holiday club in Southport.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has accused Donald Trump of inciting death threats against her after the former allies fell out in a bitter public row over the Epstein files on Friday night.

The Georgia congresswoman claimed on Saturday that she had been contacted by several private security firms warning of risks to her safety, which she alleged were “egged on” by the US president.

“I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected,” Ms Greene wrote in a post on X.

“Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now. This time by the President of the United States.”

It is unclear which companies she was referring to and The Telegraph could not verify her claims.

I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world.The man I supported and helped get elected.Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically…

Ms Greene and Mr Trump have rowed in recent weeks as she pushed for the release of more files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile financier.

She has also been increasingly critical of what she says is the president's lack of focus on domestic policy and solutions to end the recent US government shutdown, claiming that “all our country does is fund foreign countries and foreign wars, and never does anything to help the American people”.

On Friday night, Mr Trump announced that he was withdrawing his support for his formerly staunch ally and would back primary challengers for her seat in the 2026 midterm elections.

The US president continued to post about Ms Greene on his Truth Social account on Saturday, a day after he called her a “ranting lunatic” who had “gone far-Left”.

“Marjorie ‘Traitor' Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!” he wrote.

“Lightweight Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Brown (Green grass turns Brown when it begins to ROT!), betrayed the entire Republican Party when she turned Left, performed poorly on the pathetic View, and became the RINO that we all know she always was.

“Just another Fake politician, no different than Rand Paul Jr. (Thomas Massie), who got caught being a full fledged Republican In Name Only (RINO)! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”

Ms Greene, one of the most powerful and outspoken figures in the Maga movement, claimed that the falling-out resulted from her vocal support for the release of the Epstein files, which include several emails alleging that Mr Trump had spent time with one of Epstein's victims.

Mr Trump has vociferously denied wrongdoing and has called the files a “hoax”, while claiming without evidence that Epstein had deep ties with Democrats.

On Friday, he ordered Pamela Bondi, his attorney general, to investigate Epstein's alleged links with Bill Clinton, the former US president.

Ms Greene said the purported threats against her made her feel a “small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel”.

“I never thought that fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are,” she wrote on X.

“As a Republican, who overwhelmingly votes for President Trump's bills and agenda, his aggression against me which also fuels the venomous nature of his radical internet trolls (many of whom are paid), this is completely shocking to everyone.

“The Political Industrial Complex and the toxic violent nature of American politics must end.”

CNN reported that, before her election to Congress, Ms Greene liked a social media post saying that a “bullet to the head” was the easiest way to remove then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from power and endorsed a commenter who expressed enthusiasm for hanging Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.

Ms Greene did not deny liking the post and replying to the comment, but said in a statement on X in 2021 that many people had managed her social media accounts over the years.

Live Updates


            • Epstein files: After months of delay — and despite resistance from President Donald Trump — the House will vote this week on whether to release more files from the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            • Political breakup: Trump is feuding with GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch ally, who told CNN's “State of the Union” today that the rift “has all come down to the Epstein files.” Greene is among a handful of conservatives who have been adamant about releasing the documents, though more Republican defections are expected in the vote.
    


            • Military buildup: The US military's most advanced aircraft carrier has arrived in the Caribbean as Trump weighs potential operations in Venezuela. President Nicolás Maduro has condemned the military buildup near South America as US forces target alleged drug-trafficking operations.
    


            The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group has entered the Caribbean Sea, according to the US Navy, putting the world's most advanced carrier at the center of deepening tensions in the region.
    


            The group is joining US forces already in the Caribbean as part of the Trump administration's effort to “defeat and dismantle criminal networks,” the Navy said in a news release.
    


            The Ford arrived in the broader US Southern Command area of operations on Tuesday, following orders from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
    


Why this matters: The Trump administration has been building up military assets in the region and conducting deadly strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats. The US president is now weighing a potentially scaled-up campaign, possibly including land strikes inside Venezuela or an effort to oust President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            Maduro has condemned any US intervention and other regional leaders have warned of potential destabilization. The Trump administration has conducted the boat strikes with little transparency.
    


“Ready, if asked”: US Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll said today that the US military is standing by if ordered to take action in Venezuela.
    


                    “The president and secretary of war have spent a lot of time thinking about what is the best thing they can do for the American people. And I can speak from the Army's perspective, which is, we have a lot of training in that part of the world. We're reactivating our jungle school in Panama. We would be ready to act on whatever the president and secretary of war needed,” Driscoll said in an interview with CBS News' Margaret Brennan on “Face the Nation.”
                





            He declined to specify whether any order had been given, saying, “We would be ready, if asked.”
    


CNN's Haley Britzky contributed to this report.



            GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene had a wide-ranging conversation with CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union” today, marking her first interview since President Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of her and attacked the lawmaker online as a “traitor.”
    


If you missed it, you can watch the full interview below:



            House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to concede today that the House will vote this week to release the Epstein files.



                    “We'll just get this done and move it on. There's nothing to hide,” Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday.”
                





            Johnson dismissed the push to release the documents as a political stunt by Democrats, despite a number of lawmakers in his own conference supporting the move, including lead GOP co-sponsor Rep. Thomas Massie.
    


            He said the discharge petition forcing the vote doesn't mention the Epstein estate files, which contains the “treasure trove of documents.”
    


                    “The discharge is totally moot. It is a political exercise, and we're going to dispense with that this week,” he said.
                





Keep in mind: While the House bill to release the files is expected to pass, it awaits an uncertain fate in the Senate.
    


            If the bill were to pass through the upper chamber, it would still need Trump's signature unless it earns a veto-proof majority, which would require a huge number of GOP defections. Massie has voiced confidence that could happen.
    


            Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna says he's concerned that President Donald Trump's demand for a Justice Department investigation into high-profile figures, including some of his political enemies, will get in the way of releasing more files from the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


                    “Look, I'm all for investigation wherever it leads, in terms of whether it's Democrat or Republican,” the California congressman, who is a co-sponsor of a House bill to release the files, said today on NBC's “Meet the Press.” “My concern is that he is doing this to prevent a release of the files, because some people are saying that when you can say there's an active investigation, you don't have to release the file.”
                





            “So what I'm for is transparency. Release the files and then have the accountability for anyone, regardless of their party,” he added.
    


            Khanna said he's hoping around 40 Republican lawmakers will vote to release all the Epstein files this week. He said Trump is “sowing the seeds for his own lame duck presidency” by going after Republicans in Congress that support the documents' release, like Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.
    


                    “He's out of touch with his own base,” Khanna said. “All these people who were on his side are now saying, ‘Mr. President, what happened to you? You ran against a corrupt system, you ran for forgotten Americans. You become part of the swamp that you railed against.'”
                





            Republican Sen. Rick Scott voiced support for President Donald Trump's military intervention in the Caribbean, saying the president is doing “the right thing” in going after drug cartels and that Congress should not stand in the way.
    


            “I'm appreciative that this is a president that cares about the health and safety of America. He's doing everything he can to stop these drugs from coming in and killing our kids,” Scott said on “Fox News Sunday.”
    


            Scott said Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, the strongman leader who remains in office following an election that was marked by widespread accusations of fraud, is not a duly elected leader.
    


                    “It's basically a drug cartel-run country right now. So, I think President Trump's doing the right thing. Congress should not slow him down,” Scott said.
                





The big picture: Trump suggested last week that he has made up his mind on a course of action in Venezuela following multiple high-level briefings this week and a mounting US show of force in the region, where his administration has already been carrying out deadly strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats.
    


            The US president is now weighing the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign, potentially including land strikes inside Venezuela or an effort to oust Maduro.
    


            Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene apologized for her role in “toxic politics” during an exclusive interview with CNN today. It came as the Georgia lawmaker says she's facing death threats due to her growing rift with President Donald Trump.
    


            “The most hurtful thing (Trump) said, which is absolutely untrue, is he called me a traitor, and that is, that is so extremely wrong, and those are the types of words used that can radicalize people against me and put my life in danger,” Greene told anchor Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


            Bash pushed back: “We have seen these kinds of attacks or criticism from the president at other people — it's not new — and with respect, I haven't heard you speak out about it until it was directed at you.”
    


            Greene, who embraced far-right conspiracy theories during her rise into politics, said she realizes she has participated in or supported rhetoric that resulted in threats toward others, and that it has been a point of reflection for her.
    


                    “I think that's fair criticism, and I would like to say, humbly, I'm sorry for taking part in the toxic politics. It's very bad for our country. And I've, it's been something I've thought about a lot,” she said.
                





Ties to White nationalist: Greene also defended her association with White nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, including her appearance at a conference hosted by Fuentes in 2022.
    


            While she acknowledged the speaking engagement, Greene said she doesn't know Fuentes personally and that she doesn't want “anything to do” with “toxic politics” or antisemitism.
    


            Marjorie Taylor Greene is responding to President Donald Trump's claim that her recent criticism of him is because he discouraged her from running for Senate or governor in Georgia, telling CNN that is “absolutely not true.”
    


            “Actually, I never had a conversation at all with the president about running for Senate or running for Georgia, and those were decisions I came to on my own,” the lawmaker told Dana Bash on “State of the Union.”
    


                    “I don't know if he's being fed wrong information. I honestly have no idea in that area, but it is absolutely factually not true,” she said, adding that White House call logs would show she has not spoken to him.
                





            Greene said her disagreements with the president were over other issues, including Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa's visit to the White House, the issuing of H1-B visas and the president's level of involvement in foreign affairs.
    


            That perceived focus on foreign issues over domestic priorities — in addition to Trump's handling of the Epstein files — has been central to recent public criticism from Greene on media outlets including CNN and ABC's “The View.”



            Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene lamented the fracture between her and President Donald Trump, saying today that the rift centers on her push to release files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
    


            In an exclusive interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Greene said her relationship with the president deteriorated because she has been among a handful of conservatives adamant about releasing all files related to the Epstein investigation. Trump has been trying to stop Republicans in the House from voting to release the files.
    


            “Unfortunately, it has all come down to the Epstein files,” Greene said on “State of the Union.”
    


            The Georgia lawmaker said she doesn't understand why the president is fighting against the files being released, as she doesn't believe he has been implicated in anything illegal by any of Epstein's victims.
    


                    “That is the question everyone is asking, is why fight this so hard?” Greene said, saying she would continue to do her “small part” to get the files released.
                





            Rep. Thomas Massie, the lead GOP co-sponsor of a bill to release more Jeffrey Epstein case files, predicted today that a large number of Republicans in the House could break with President Donald Trump and back the documents' release when it comes up for a vote as soon as Tuesday.
    


                    “I think we could have a deluge of Republicans. There could be 100 or more. I'm hoping to get a veto-proof majority on this legislation when it comes up for a vote,” he said on ABC's “This Week.”
                





            Massie touted the predicted success of his discharge petition effort with Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, calling it a big win over the resistance of the House speaker, attorney general and the president himself, among other Trump officials.
    


            Massie said he thinks Trump is “trying to protect a bunch of rich and powerful friends, billionaires, donors to his campaign, friends in his social circles” and told his fellow GOP lawmakers that the “record of this vote will last longer” than Trump's presidency.
    


                    “I would remind my Republican colleagues who are deciding how to vote: Donald Trump can protect you in red districts right now by giving you an endorsement, but in 2030 he's not going to be the president, and you will have voted to protect pedophiles,” he said.
                





Keep in mind: While the House bill to release the files is expected to pass, it awaits an uncertain fate in Congress' upper chamber.
    


            If the bill were to pass through the Senate, it would still need Trump's signature — unless Massie succeeds in earning the veto-proof majority he referenced, with two-thirds of the House. That's nearly 290 votes, if all members are present.
    


            President Donald Trump's nationwide deportation push has come to Charlotte, North Carolina, this weekend.
    


            Federal officials confirmed yesterday that a surge of immigration enforcement in the state's largest city has begun, as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.
    


            Local officials including Mayor Vi Lyles criticized the crackdown, saying in a statement that it is “causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”
    


What residents are saying: Manuel “Manolo” Betancur closed the doors to his family's bakery yesterday after men in green uniforms chased and tackled people outside the popular shop on Central Avenue, he told CNN. He said he isn't sure when he will reopen.
    


            Betancur said he doesn't want his customers to risk a similar encounter with federal agents — not when they're just trying to buy some Colombian cakes or pastries.
    


                    “I need to protect my customers. I need to protect my people. I need to protect myself and my family,” he said.
                





            Security video viewed by CNN shows agents chasing two people down on foot outside the bakery.
    


            After coming to the United States with just $900 in his pocket, Betancur has become a US citizen, owns three businesses and employs almost 35 people — proof that the American dream exists, he said. Now with federal agents on the prowl, he says he's closing the bakery to protect his community.
    


Elsewhere: The focus on Charlotte comes as Texas National Guard troops ready to leave Chicago, according to a source familiar with the planning. The city has been one of the epicenters of resistance to Trump's crackdown, and the administration said it deployed the troops there to help protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and other federal personnel.
    


The Associated Press and CNN's Dalia Faheid contributed to this report.



            We're also monitoring the fallout from a major political breakup, which boiled over this week after stewing for several weeks: President Donald Trump announced Friday he is officially rescinding his endorsement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.
    


            The president attacked Greene in personal terms, claiming she has “gone Far Left” and calling her a “ranting Lunatic.”
    


            Greene, who arrived in Congress in 2021, has until recently been an ardent and outspoken Trump supporter.
    


How we got here: The onetime allies have grown apart as Greene criticized Trump on a number of fronts, including his handling of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his perceived focus on foreign affairs.
    


            Greene has publicly warned in recent weeks that Trump has spent too much time on foreign policy and is not doing enough to sell his domestic agenda at home, taking her message to outlets like CNN and ABC's “The View.”



            Greene is also one of four House Republicans who signed on to a discharge petition to force a vote on release of Justice Department documents pertaining to the Epstein case.
    


            Trump has repeatedly and emphatically described calls for transparency around his ties to Epstein as a “hoax.” Greene has said her focus is on justice for Epstein's victims and exposing the “deep state,” including shared Democratic foes.
    


Safety fears: The Georgia Republican says she is facing threats fueled by Trump's rhetoric.
    


            “I am now being contacted by private security firms with warnings for my safety as a hot bed of threats against me are being fueled and egged on by the most powerful man in the world. The man I supported and helped get elected,” Greene wrote on X.
    


Greene is appearing on CNN's “State of the Union” this morning, and we'll have updates for you on her remarks.



            In today's coverage, we'll be looking ahead to this week's House vote on the release of more files from the Jeffrey Epstein case.
    


            If you haven't been following the latest political drama surrounding documents related to the late convicted sex offender, here's what to know:
    


First, let's set expectations: The looming vote will not mark the end of this saga either way. It's not like the House passes the bill, and suddenly the Justice Department releases the full Epstein case files.
    


            The bill would still need to be passed by the Senate and signed by the president.
    


But here's why it's pivotal: House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump have been resisting this vote anyway.
    


            The fear here seems to be that it 1) creates a very difficult decision for many Republican lawmakers, and 2) could apply pressure on the Senate and the administration to follow suit — particularly if it passes by a large margin in the House.
    


            And a large margin appears to be what many are anticipating. CNN reported this week that House GOP leadership is expecting mass defections.
    


A key threshold: Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, the lead GOP co-sponsor of the discharge petition, has set a threshold for success at two-thirds of the House, or nearly 290 votes, if all members are present. That's the point at which enough members support the measure that it could overcome a presidential veto.
    


            That would indeed be a very symbolic victory. It would not only demonstrate that a wide, bipartisan majority of the House wants the files released, but also suggest that the chamber could override Trump if he attempts to block it. This would place tremendous pressure on the senators who face a vote next.
    


Read CNN's full breakdown of the stakes in this week's vote.



            Another key element of President Donald Trump's agenda we'll be tracking today involves growing tensions in the Caribbean, where the administration has been mounting a show of force as it targets alleged drug traffickers in the region.
    


Here's what to know:



Trump mulls options: The president suggested last week that he has made up his mind on a course of action in the South American country following multiple high-level briefings this week.
    


            Officials briefed Trump on options for military operations inside Venezuela, four sources told CNN, as he weighs the risks and benefits of launching a scaled-up campaign to potentially oust President Nicolás Maduro.
    


            The president indicated Friday he was drawing closer to a path forward on his attempts to cut down on illegal flows of migrants and drugs — and the possibility of regime change.
    


                    “I sort of have made up my mind — yeah. I mean, I can't tell you what it would be, but I sort of have,” Trump told reporters Friday.
                





What Maduro is saying: In remarks at a Caracas rally yesterday, Maduro accused the US of pursuing a “criminal war” and decried recently announced US military drills in Trinidad and Tobago as “irresponsible.”
    


            On Friday, Maduro warned that US military intervention could lay the groundwork for what he described as “another Gaza,” a “new Afghanistan” or “Vietnam again.”
    

In recent weeks, the US has amassed its naval forces in the Caribbean as the Trump administration has launched at least 20 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, in turn, has said Caracas is launching a “massive mobilization” of military personnel, weapons and equipment.


The political stakes: Extended US military involvement runs the risk of upsetting the political coalition that propelled Trump into office on promises of keeping America out of overseas wars. Both Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth served in the military during the Iraq War and have since expressed skepticism about entangling the US in foreign conflicts.
    


            “The American people did not vote for Trump to draw the US into a sustained conflict in Latin America,” one GOP congressional staffer told CNN.

            Just blocks from the Presidio of San Francisco, the national park at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge, stands a gleaming white building, its façade adorned with eight striking gothic columns.
    


            But what was once the home of a Christian Scientist church, is now the holy grail of Internet history — the Internet Archive, a non-profit library run by a group of software engineers and librarians, who for nearly 30 years have been saving the web one page at a time.
    


            Inside the stained-glass-adorned sanctuary, the sounds of church sermons have been replaced by the hum of servers, where the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine preserves web pages.
    


            The Wayback Machine, a tool used by millions every day, has proven critical for academics and journalists searching for historical information on what corporations, people and governments have published online in the past, long after their websites have been updated or changed.
    


            For many, the Wayback Machine is like a living history of the internet, and it just logged its trillionth page last month.
    


            Archiving the web is more important and more challenging than ever before. The White House in January ordered vast amounts of government webpages to be taken down. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence is blurring the line between what's real and what's artificially generated — in some ways replacing the need to visit websites entirely. And more of the internet is now hidden behind paywalls or tucked in conversations with AI chatbots.
    


            It's the Internet Archive's job to figure out how to preserve it all.
    


            “We are here to try to provide a record of what happened, so that people can learn and build on that to build a better future, or to build new ideas that are worthy of being in the (Internet Archive's) library,” said Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle.
    


            Kahle created the archive in 1996 when a year's worth of saved pages could fit on about 2 terabytes worth of hard drives, the amount of storage you can get today in an iPhone. Now, the archive is saving closer to 150 terabytes, or hundreds of millions worth of web pages, per day.
    


            Kahle is the driving force and personality behind the archive, with the exuberance and energy of your favorite science teacher and like an evangelist whose religion is libraries and technology. Sitting for an interview on the original wooden pews of the church, Kahle said he was inspired to purchase the building because it resembles the group's logo. But more importantly, he said it's a symbol of permanence and a reference to the Library of Alexandria in Egypt.
    


            “That was the first time somebody tried to go and collect everything ever written by humans,” Kahle said. “Of course, now that place is the internet, and the Internet Archive serves the whole internet as a library.”
    


            The Wayback Machine tool does more than just screenshot the page. It also saves the technical architecture — the HTML, CSS, JavaScript codes and more — so that it can attempt to “replay the page as it existed” even if the server is no longer functioning, said Wayback Machine Director Mark Graham.
    


            The rise of artificial intelligence and AI chatbots means the Internet Archive is changing how it records the history of the internet. In addition to web pages, the Internet Archive now captures AI-generated content, like ChatGPT answers and those summaries that appear at the top of Google search results.
    


            The Internet Archive team, which is made up of librarians and software engineers, are experimenting with ways to preserve how people get their news from chatbots by coming up with hundreds of questions and prompts each day based on the news, and recording both the queries and outputs, Graham said.
    


            The group keeps copies of its archive in locations around the world in the event of a fire or flood that could damage its servers. But there are political considerations behind this approach, as well. The Trump administration has exerted pressure over content it disagrees with by filing lawsuits against media companies or by way of the Federal Communications Commission. 



            “Libraries are always targeted. The new guys often don't like the old stuff around. So let's design for it,” Kahle said. “Let's go and live up to the moment and make it so that there's different points of view stored and made permanently accessible in different environments.”
    


            The Trump administration implemented a massive overhaul of government websites that included taking down countless pages on everything from health policies to the achievements of minority members of the military. It was the archive, which has been saving webpages during the transition of presidential administration websites since 2004, which enabled journalists to understand what had been altered.
    


            “This change was huge. Whole sections of the web came down,” Kahle said. “(The administration) has a new point of view, and that's why we have libraries to go and have the record.”
    


            Most of the archive's servers live in a large warehouse outside of San Francisco, although a set of servers have been symbolically placed in the main sanctuary of the former church. That placement is intentional, said Kahle. By displaying the servers, he hopes “that people understand that we're all part of the collective protection for our knowledge.”
    


            The headquarters is an homage to the work of the Internet Archive's 200 staff members, which include engineers, librarians and archivists.
    


            Archivists use bespoke machines to digitize books page by page,  livestreaming their work on YouTube for all to see (alongside some lo-fi music). Record players churn out vintage tunes from 1920s and 1940s, and the building houses every type of media console for any type of content imaginable, from microfilm, to CDs and satellite television. (The Internet Archive preserves music, television, books and video games, too).
    


            The former church's main sanctuary also boasts more than 100 three-foot statues of employees who have been on staff for at least three years – a reference to the famous Chinese terracotta army from thousands of years ago.
    


            In some ways, the space captures the quirkiness -— and community — of the internet itself.
    


            “There are a lot of people that are just passionate about the cause. There's a cyberpunk atmosphere,” Annie Rauwerda, a Wikipedia editor and social media influencer, said at a party thrown at the Internet Archive's headquarters to celebrate reaching a trillion pages “The internet (feels) quite corporate when I use it a lot these days, but you wouldn't know from the people here.”
    


            The headquarters might feel something like a living history exhibit. But the Internet Archive's goal, says Kahle, is to preserve the web so that it can continue to have a future, not to be the arbiters of truth.
    


            “It's not a presentation. It's not a museum that has a story,” he said. “It's trying to be a resource to make it so that other people can come up with their own ideas.”

A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.



            In need of a reset on multiple policy fronts, the Trump administration isn't afraid of turning to some good old-fashioned rebranding.
    


            ►  Tired of hearing about how Epstein emails released by a House Democrats feature President Donald Trump?
    


            Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate any Democrats who, like Trump, were Epstein associates and are mentioned in the emails. As the House moves toward a bipartisan demand for the FBI to release its Epstein files, Trump is trying to flip the script on what he's now calling the “Epstein Hoax.”
    


            ►  Need a reset for the unpopular military policy in the Western hemisphere?
    


            Trump's Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave the operation a new name, “Southern Spear.”
    


            ► Hoping to make people believe a militaristic deportation strategy is focused on dangerous criminals instead of the preschool teachers and parents who have featured in recent news stories?
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unveiled “Operation Dirtbag,” in which ICE announces the deportation of previously convicted sex offenders, among mothers, in Florida.
    


            That Noem announcement came the same week a judge in Illinois ordered hundreds of detainees rounded up in ICE's “Operation Midway Blitz” to be released.
    


            On affordability — Trump's most obvious political problem at the moment — he is working hard to reframe his policies around that term to argue that they will drive costs down. In fact, tariffs are likely to drive costs up, and tax cuts passed by Republicans will predominantly benefit the wealthiest Americans.
    


            But it is the new name for Trump's Venezuela policy that has the most obvious feel of a complete relaunch.
    


            Though it has not gotten authorization from Congress, the Pentagon has overseen the apparently extrajudicial killings of 80 alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific — and counting.
    


            The administration says it is protecting Americans from “narco-terrorists,” although it's not clear the strikes will do much to stop the flow of drugs into the country, and it is deeply unpopular — less than a third of Americans said they supported it in a Reuters poll released this week.
    


            It's not clear the strategy has changed, but Hegseth gave the strategy a new name this week.
    


            “Today, I'm announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,” Hegseth said on X from his official “Secretary of War” account.
    


            It seems like “a rebranding of an operation that started back in January of 2025,” military analyst retired Maj. Mike Lyons said Friday on “CNN This Morning.”
    


            “I think the Navy thought they wrapped it up during the summertime,” Lyons added.
    


            CNN has reported that Pentagon briefers went further, laying out military options to Trump for US military action inside Venezuela. Trump on Friday suggested he has made up his mind on a path forward in the country.
    


            Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican and Air Force veteran, has said presidents should make the argument for why military action was in American interests and, when necessary, get authorization from lawmakers, as the Constitution requires.
    


            None of that has happened yet regarding Venezuela or the targeting of suspected drug boats, Bacon told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday.
    


            “I implore the president and his team, make your case to the American people, when you're using our military and you're going to pursue hostilities there has to be support from the people, and you need to get support from Congress,” Bacon said.
    


            Trump could look to the legacy of President George H.W. Bush, who launched the popular Operation Desert Storm to liberate Kuwait from Iraqi invasion in the early ‘90s.
    


            Bush also launched Operation Just Cause in 1989 to arrest and depose Gen. Manual Noriega in Panama. That operation may have played well for him in the US and led to the capture of Noreiga, but Panama today marks its anniversary with a national day of mourning for the hundreds of civilians who were killed.
    


            Trump's strategies for bending public perception are well-documented. He almost never says “Democrats” without also adding “radical left,” for instance.
    


            His go-to method for defusing a controversy and reframe something in the public's mind is to call it a “hoax.”
    


            A serious investigation by a special counsel into contacts between Trump's campaign and Russians during the 2016 election has years later, by force of his constant repetition, been turned into the “Russia Hoax.”
    


            Now he's doing the same thing by trying to turn calls to release the Epstein files into the “Epstein Hoax.”
    


            Republican lawmakers took Trump's cue and officially named the massive tax and spending cut law they passed as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” That's its name in US law.
    


            “That was good for getting it approved, but it's not good for explaining to people what it's all about,” Trump said back in August. He has yet to come up with something better, but he may be more focused today on trying to convince Americans he is addressing the affordability crisis.
    


            He claims prices have fallen, but Americans aren't experiencing that in their daily lives.
    


            Trump has also struggled recently to control his own most famous catchphrase, MAGA, or “make America great again.”
    


            It is his brand, but he was at odds with other MAGA adherents on the subject of immigration.
    


            In a sometimes-contentious interview with the Fox News personality Laura Ingraham, Trump defended the idea of visas for skilled immigrants. He said the US did not have enough workers for certain jobs, which did not sit well with Ingraham. She argued that MAGA believers think the US has plenty of talent.
    


            “Don't forget, MAGA was my idea. MAGA was nobody else's idea,” Trump shot back. “I know what MAGA wants better than anybody else, and MAGA wants to see our country thrive.”
    


            But he may be losing a little bit of control over the MAGA brand.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Terror plot arrests reveal ‘more dangerous' online pathway to ISIS radicalization in America","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/16/us/isis-radicalization-us-terror-plot","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:00:02 GMT","


            They live in New Jersey, Michigan and Washington state — six young men arrested in recent weeks and charged in an alleged ISIS-inspired terror plot.



            The suspects, among others, are accused of using encrypted messaging and social media apps “to share extremist and ISIS-related materials that encourage attacks” in the US, including on the LGBTQ+ community in Michigan, according to a criminal complaint.
    


            The Michigan plot, which may have been planned for Halloween, was intended to be possibly on the scale of the 2015 Paris terror attacks before it ultimately was foiled, authorities say.
    


            The arrests illustrate “how people are self-radicalizing, operating in echo chambers online,” NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence & Counterterrorism Rebecca Weiner told CNN.
    


            “This isn't as simple as there is an entity called ISIS that's operating overseas that's reaching into our homeland, recruiting and radicalizing people,” Weiner said. “This is a much more nuanced dynamic, where people are finding each other online, doing that mutually reinforcing self-radicalization, finding like-minded people overseas, some of whom may have connections to the actual terrorist organization. So it's much more muddy, but it is also much more dangerous than a simple model that we've dealt with before.”
    


            CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller, Weiner's predecessor at the NYPD, interviewed Weiner on Monday about the case.
    


Miller: We just saw this domino series of cases in rapid succession, with a common theme that they were connected to ISIS, radicalized online, conspiring online. What does it all mean?



Weiner: So, you have multiple elements at play, many of which we're familiar with. All of them together, this is an incredibly significant disruption. An alleged cell involved in attack planning, plotting in Detroit. At the same time, an overlapping network of would-be foreign fighters looking to join ISIS, allegedly in Syria overseas.
    


            We've seen a sustained focus on ISIS-inspired plotting. You've had a horrific attack on New Year's Day in New Orleans. Last November, disruption of an ISIS supporter allegedly looking to carry out an attack on Election Day. Last September, a disruption of a Canadian individual who wanted to target a synagogue in Brooklyn. But this is broader in scope and extends farther in geography than most recent disruptions for the last several years.
    


Miller: So, draw a chronological map for me. It starts – as far as the takedowns – it starts in Michigan, so start with Michigan and where does it spread out to?



Weiner: Starting in Michigan, disruption of a cell of individuals who were amassing weapons, ammunition, had done training, talked about a number of different potential outlets for this plot – targets of an imminent potential attack in Michigan. At the same time, you have an ongoing investigation, a network of individuals in New Jersey, in Seattle, overseas, who were planning allegedly to travel overseas to Syria to join ISIS. Of course, the imminence of the potential attack in Michigan being the impetus to bring the whole network down.
    


Miller: What were, between all of these people and places, the different kinds of attacks that were discussed?



Weiner: You had targeting allegedly of the LGBTQ community. You had targeting potentially of (the) Jewish community. You had firearms acquisition, you had discussion of IEDs, you had the potential travel overseas. Really, you name it, you had it amongst these two networks.
    


Miller: And how are the networks connected?



            Weiner: This is a classic case of what terrorism looks like in 2025, when you have social media enabling not just the radicalization, the consuming of propaganda, the echo chamber of driving people toward more and more extremist content and discussion, but active planning and coordination. But that wasn't all you had, as outlined in the complaint against one of the defendants in New Jersey. Travel, real-life engagement and interaction between these groups of people. So these weren't just aspirants talking about notional plans, they were actively coordinating.
    


Miller: What was the NYPD's role in this case?



Weiner: NYPD worked extensively with (the) FBI on the New Jersey piece on the defendants and their potential overseas travel, and of course, we have officers assigned to our JTTF (Joint Terrorism Task Force) who support FBI field offices across the country, as well as human intelligence and open-source support from our intelligence division.
    


Miller: A long time ago, many people declared ISIS and al Qaeda effectively dead. You see something like this and you see something is coming back to life.



            Weiner: So it never really went away, and since October 7, we've been contending with renewed interest in joining ISIS among inspired people here across the West, but also an increase in ISIS operational tempo overseas. The resurgence of potential increase in travel overseas, in this case Syria – we've also seen people more interested in traveling to Africa to join ISIS in Somalia – is a great concern.
    


Miller: What was the UK component here? You had people here talking to people there and other arrests that makes this beyond just the United States.



Weiner: So this is exactly the power of the internet comes to conventional terrorism activity. It's quite easy to coordinate your travel or coordinate your attack plotting across different states, across different countries, in the era of the group chat, and that's what we see in this case and that's what we're seeing in our cases more broadly.
    


Miller: How many of these people knew each other in real life versus met on these platforms?



Weiner: I think some of those questions are being answered as we speak. This is an ongoing investigation. But it was a combination of both, and that's what makes it particularly potent and also gives us the urgency to do the disruption, not just the digital communication, but the physical as well, and frankly, it doesn't even matter if they never met each other in person until they arrive overseas.
    


Miller: We're seeing in these federal documents a range of people from basically 16 years old maybe to 20. Is ISIS particularly targeting young people?



Weiner: It's that young people are increasingly drawn into extremism.
    


Miller: Why?



Weiner: That's a lot of reasons, partly it's the pandemic and the ongoing hangover from forced social isolation and a lot of time spent online. Partly it's young people and their young brains just marinating in these online ecosystems where you're subjected to, drawn to, consuming and then animated by extreme content. But one through line across all of our cases, regardless of ideology, is younger and younger people being drawn into these webs.
    


Miller: What's the significance of all this?



Weiner: First and foremost, this is a job really well done by the FBI, working with other law enforcement agencies, by the NYPD, across the country in multiple cities and overseas. So this is exactly what we want our system to do. Second, it's the complexity of this, the breadth of this, how many people involved and across so much space. That's a good wakeup call, that conventional terrorism is unfortunately alive and well, and over the last year, we've been swept up in other threats, the rise in political violence and individual acts of really high-profile targeted violence with no clear ideological underpinning. That is a threat unto itself, but meanwhile, ISIS support, terrorism as we've understood and combated it for the last 24 years, remains a threat that we have to contend with.

TEHRAN, Iran (AP) — Iran's foreign minister said Sunday that Tehran is no longer enriching uranium at any site in the country, trying to signal to the West that it remains open to potential negotiations over its atomic program.

Answering a question from an Associated Press journalist visiting Iran, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered the most direct response yet from the Iranian government regarding its nuclear program following Israel and the United States' bombing of its enrichment sites in June during a 12-day war.

“There is no undeclared nuclear enrichment in Iran. All of our facilities are under the safeguards and monitoring” of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Araghchi said. “There is no enrichment right now because our facilities — our enrichment facilities — have been attacked.”

Asked what it would take for Iran to continue negotiations with the U.S. and others, Araghchi said Iran's message on its nuclear program remains “clear.”

“Iran's right for enrichment, for peaceful use of nuclear technology, including enrichment, is undeniable,” the foreign minister continued. “We have this right, and we continue to exercise that, and we hope that the international community, including the United States, recognize our rights and understand that this is an inalienable right of Iran. And we would never give up our rights.”

Iran's government issued a three-day visa for the AP reporter to attend a summit alongside journalists from major British outlets and other media.




Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, also attended the summit and told the gathering that Tehran had been threatened over potentially accessing the bombed enrichment sites. Satellite pictures analyzed by the AP since the attack show that Iran has not done any major work at the sites at Fordo, Isfahan and Natanz.

“Our security situation hasn't yet changed. If you watch the news, you see that every day we are being threatened with another attack,” Eslami said. “Every day we are told if you touch anything, you'll be attacked.”

Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity — a short, technical step from weapons-grade levels — after U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in 2018. Tehran long has maintained its atomic program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organized nuclear weapons program until 2003.

European nations also pushed through a measure to reimpose United Nations sanctions on Iran over the nuclear program in September.

The IAEA's Board of Governors is set to meet this week and could vote on a new resolution targeting Iran over its failure to cooperate fully with the agency.

But Araghchi left open the possibility of further negotiations with the U.S. should Washington's demands change.

He told journalists at the summit that the U.S. administration's approach does not suggest they are ready for “equal, fair negotiations to reach mutual interests.”

“What we have seen from the Americans so far has actually been an effort to dictate their demands, which are maximalist and excessive. We see no chance for dialogue in the face of such demands.”

Iran's Institute for Political and International Studies, affiliated with the country's Foreign Ministry, hosted the summit. Titled “International Law Under Assault: Aggression and Self-Defense,” the conference included papers by Iranian political analysts offering Tehran's view of the 12-day war in June, many seizing on comments from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz praising Israel for having done the “dirty work” in launching its attack.

“Iran's defensive response was remarkable, inspiring, historic and above all, pure,” wrote Mohammad Kazem Sajjadpour, an international relations professor. “How can one possibly compare Israel's dirty deeds to the noble and clean actions of the Iranian nation?”

Images of children killed by Israel during the war lined the walkway outside the summit, held inside the Martyr General Qassem Soleimani Building, named for the Revolutionary Guard expeditionary leader killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2020.

But Iran finds itself in a difficult moment after the war. Israel decimated the country's air defense systems, potentially leaving the door open to further airstrikes as tensions remain high over the nuclear program.

Meanwhile, economic pressures and societal change continue to challenge Iran's Shiite theocracy, which so far has held off on making decisions about whether to enforce its mandatory hijab laws or raise the price of government-subsidized gasoline, both of which have sparked nationwide protests in the past.

A ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before the spring and European allies need to keep up support despite a corruption scandal which has engulfed Kyiv, President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press.

HALVALA, Finland (AP) — A ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before the spring and European allies need to keep up support despite a corruption scandal that has engulfed Kyiv, President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press. 

Europe, meanwhile, will require ‘'sisu,'' a Finnish word meaning endurance, resilience and grit, to get through the winter months, he said, as Russia continues its hybrid attacks and information war across the continent.

Stubb also needs that quality as one of the key European interlocutors between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As the leader of one of Europe's smaller countries, but one that shares a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, he is well aware of what's at stake. 

In the 1940s, after two wars with Russia, Finland lost about 10% of its territory to Moscow and agreed to become militarily neutral. But Finland's losses were much less than they could have been as Finnish troops displayed “sisu” and inflicted heavy losses on the Soviet army, despite being vastly outnumbered. 

Finland's neutral stance only reversed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, when the Finns joined NATO. Stubb leverages his good relationship with Trump — the two men have played golf together and speak regularly — to argue the case for Ukraine.

“I can explain to President Trump what Finland went through or how I see the situation on the battlefield, or how do you deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin? And then, you know, if he accepts one out of 10 ideas, that's good,” he said. 




Stubb spoke to AP Saturday at a military base north of the capital Helsinki, where he observed Finnish volunteers take part in defense training. Wearing a jacket with the word “sisu” emblazoned across the back, he watched as volunteers practiced evacuating wounded soldiers from a conflict zone in freezing temperatures. 

Stubb told AP that Zelenskyy must deal quickly with allegations of kickbacks and embezzlement, saying the scandal plays into the hands of Russia. Nonetheless, he urged European leaders to look at boosting financial and military support for Kyiv, which is also facing creeping gains by Russia on the battlefield.

“I'm not very optimistic about achieving a ceasefire or the beginning of peace negotiations, at least this year,” Stubb said, adding it would be good to “get something going” by March.

The three big questions on the road to a ceasefire are security guarantees for Ukraine, rebuilding its economy and coming to some sort of understanding about territorial claims, he said.

To bring peace to Ukraine, Stubb said, Trump and European leaders need to maximize pressure on Russia and on Putin in order to change his strategic thinking. Putin “basically wants to deny the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,” aims that have not altered since the war began nearly four years ago, Stubb said.

To do this, he suggested using tools such as the hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe as collateral to fund Ukraine, as well as increasing military pressure on Moscow.

Stubb praised Trump for sanctioning the major Russian energy companies Lukoil and Rosneft in October, saying he did “an excellent job,” but argued more must be done to give Ukraine the capacity to hit Russia's “military or defense industry.”

Last month, Trump denied a Ukrainian request for long-range Tomahawk missiles that would theoretically allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia – although Kyiv does not currently have any launchers or platforms from which to fire them.

Ukraine is still negotiating with the U.S. for more firepower, Stubb indicated. 



In mid-October, the White House announced Trump would meet Putin in Budapest before abruptly canceling the meeting less than a week later.

The decision came after a call between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, where Rubio probably realized that “the Russians haven't moved an inch,” Stubb said, and there was “no point in taking President Trump into a situation whereby he doesn't get a deal or anything.” 

A ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before the spring and European allies need to keep up support despite a corruption scandal which has engulfed Kyiv, President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press (AP video shot by Kostya Manenkov).

The cancellation was “another example of a strategic mistake by the Russians. They had an opportunity and they blew it,” Stubb said.

Trump has swung back and forth between seeking rapprochement with Putin and applying pressure to him, and has done the same with Zelenskyy. Stubb said he deals with any shifts by being “quite patient” and living with “reality.”

“You can't have illusions about things that you would like to see happening,” the Finnish president said. “I've tried personally to focus on things such as: We need security guarantees for Ukraine. How to build those? We need a ceasefire. How can we get that?

“It's been a bit of a grind. I guess you need ‘sisu' in these types of negotiations as well.” 

But, he said, the work is paying off and the military options for guaranteeing Ukraine's security once a ceasefire or peace negotiation is reached are now “clear,” with various countries having committed resources — although he declined to give more details, citing confidential military planning.

Despite some of Ukraine's missteps, Stubb is unstinting in his praise for Zelenskyy. “I admire a lot of the things that he's doing because to lead a country in a war ... is existential. You learn a lot from other human beings in that situation,” he said. 



When it comes to dealing with Donald Trump, Stubb is in a better position than many European leaders. In his youth, he studied in the United States on a golf scholarship, and the two spent about seven hours playing a round at Mar-a-Lago in March.

Golf was a “door-opener,” and helped him create a bond with the U.S. president, he suggested. While Trump and Zelenskyy have a notoriously tempestuous relationship, Stubb said he and other European leaders can help act as a bridge between them. 

“We interpret President Trump to President Zelenskyy and vice versa,” he said. 

But when it comes to Putin, only one person should negotiate directly and publicly with him and that's Trump, Stubb indicated, suggesting the European Union is unlikely to open a direct channel of communication with the Russian leader any time soon.



At the same time, Trump is leading negotiations with Putin, multiple European countries have faced incursions from Russian drones, suspected or confirmed, as well as fighter jets and an alleged widespread Russian sabotage campaign.

Russia is not only conducting a kinetic war in Ukraine but also a hybrid war in Europe, Stubb told AP.

“The line between war and peace has been blurred,” Stubb said

Russia, he said, is trying to destabilize Europe and “cause havoc and panic,” with attacks including arson, vandalism and propaganda. 

The way to deal with those threats is to “be Finnish,” Stubb said.

“In other words, be cool, calm, collected and have a little bit of that ‘sisu.'”

The Kremlin needs money to keep its finances steady - and it's clear where President Vladimir Putin intends to get it: at the cash register, from ordinary people and small businesses. An increase in value-added tax to 22% from 20% is expected to add as much as 1 trillion rubles, or about $12.3 billion, to the state budget.

After two years of robust growth fueled by military spending on the war in Ukraine, Russia's economy is slowing. Oil revenues are down, the budget deficit is up and defense spending has leveled off. 

The Kremlin needs money to keep its finances steady — and it's clear where President Vladimir Putin intends to get it: at the cash register, from ordinary people and small businesses.

An increase in value-added tax to 22% from 20% is expected to add as much as 1 trillion rubles, or about $12.3 billion, to the state budget. The increase is contained in legislation already making its way through Russia's compliant parliament and would take effect from Jan. 1.

On top of the rate increase, the legislation lowers the threshold for requiring businesses to collect VAT to a mere 10 million rubles (about $123,000) in annual sales revenue, in stages by 2028. That's down from 60 million rubles, or $739,000. That change is aimed in part at tax avoidance schemes in which companies split their operations to skirt the threshold. 

But it also will hit previously exempt businesses like corner convenience stores and beauty salons.

The government also has proposed increasing taxes on spirits, wine, beer, cigarettes and vapes. For instance, the tax on stronger spirits such as vodka would go up by 84 rubles per liter of pure alcohol, which works out to 17 rubles or about 20 U.S. cents for a half-liter bottle, or about 5% of the minimum price of 349 rubles ($4.31). Fees for renewing driver's licenses or getting an international license also are going up, and a key tax break on imported cars is being axed. The government is weighing a tech tax on digital equipment including smartphones and notebooks of up to 5,000 rubles ($61.50) for the highest priced items, the Kommersant news site reported.

The economic slowdown and tax increases are signs that Putin and ordinary Russians will face harder choices in the months ahead between guns and butter — that is, between military spending and consumer welfare after 3 1/2 years of war against Ukraine.

Muscovites interviewed on a main street in the Russian capital by The Associated Press expressed dismay mingled with resignation, saying the higher food prices would be widely felt, especially in poorer regions and among those with low incomes.

Pensioner Svetlana Martynova said making small businesses collect VAT would backfire.

“I think that small and medium businesses will fold,” she said. “The budget will get less, not more.”

The VAT increase comes on top of changes in the recycling fee paid for registering cars, a step that mostly hits high-priced imports. From Dec. 1 individuals can no longer get a concessionary rate of 3,400 rubles ($42) on cars with more than 160 horsepower, but must pay the commercial rate, which can be hundreds of thousands of rubles, or thousands of dollars, per car.

The step, however, was unlikely to boost investment in domestic manufacturing, given high central bank interest rates and the smaller size of the Russian market compared with neighboring China, now the source of most imported cars. That's according to Andrei Olkhovsky, general director of Avtodom, a major auto dealer group. 

As for customers, sales “will decline in the short term, but will recover to current levels within six months,” he said in an answer to emailed questions.

“Increased taxes and fees will influence prices for the end consumer,” he said. “Consumers in turn will factor this into their lifestyle and demand higher wages from their employers. This will increase the cost of everything around us.”

Russia's economy shrank at the start of 2025 and is on course for growth this year of only around 1%, according to government estimates, after growing more than 4% in 2023 and 2024. Growth has suffered from high central bank interest rates, currently at 16.5%, aimed at controlling inflation of 8% fueled by massive military spending. Oil revenues are down about 20% this year mainly due to lower global prices, according to the Kyiv School of Economics Institute. Western sanctions imposed over the war against Ukraine have been an ongoing drag on growth by increasing costs and deterring investment that could expand the economy's productive capacity.

As a result, this year's budget deficit has been revised upward from 0.5% to 2.6%, up from 1.7% last year. That doesn't seem huge in comparison with other countries — but unlike them, Russia can't borrow on international bond markets and must rely on domestic banks for credit.

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said raising revenue was preferable to increasing borrowing, saying excessive borrowing “would lead to a speeding up of inflation, and as a result, to an increase in the key rate” from the central bank that would hurt investment and growth.

The VAT increase could boost inflation at first as merchants change their price lists. But over the longer term, it could lower price pressures by dampening demand for goods — and help the central bank in its battle to keep inflation in check.

The tax and fee increases are a step back from Russia's wartime economy of the two previous years that put more money in people's pockets. Then-higher prices for oil exports filled state coffers, while vast increases in military spending boosted hiring, and paychecks for factory workers kept pace with inflation. Along with that, military recruitment and death bonuses pumped cash into poorer regions.

Putin won't run out of money in the short term, said Alexandra Prokopenko, fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin. 

“Growth is slowing down, but corporates are paying taxes, people are consuming and getting salaries, and paying taxes from this,” she said. “For the coming 12 or 14 months, Putin has enough money to maintain the current war effort and the current level of expenditures.”

After that, she said, “he will need to make tough choices, trade-offs between maintaining military effort or, for example, maintaining consumer abundance so people won't feel 100% that the war is going on.”

Willy Aceituno, a Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was stopped twice by Border Patrol agents in Charlotte, North Carolina. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground.




CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Federal officials confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina's largest city has begun, as agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens hurting them, their families, or their neighbors,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. “We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed.” 

Local officials including Mayor Vi Lyles criticized such actions, saying in a statement that they “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

“We want people in Charlotte and Mecklenburg County to know we stand with all residents who simply want to go about their lives,” the statement said. It was also signed by Mecklenburg County Commissioner Mark Jerrell and Charlotte-Mecklenburg school board member Stephanie Sneed.

Crime is down in the city this year through August, compared with the same months in 2024. Homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts fell by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics. 

But President Donald Trump's administration has seized upon the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with the woman's murder.








The federal government had not previously announced the push. But County Sheriff Garry McFadden said this week that two federal officials told him Customs agents would be arriving soon. 

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. 

Willy Aceituno, a 46-year-old Honduran-born U.S. citizen, was on his way to work Saturday when he saw “a lot of Latinos running,” chased by “a lot of Border Patrol agents.”

Aceituno said he himself was stopped — twice — by Border Patrol agents. During the second encounter, they forced him from his vehicle after breaking the window and threw him to the ground. 

“I told them, ‘I'm an American citizen,'” he told The Associated Press. “They wanted to know where I was born, or they didn't believe I was an American citizen.”

After being forcibly taken into a Border Patrol vehicle, Aceituno said, he was finally released after showing documents proving his citizenship. He had to walk some distance back to his car and later filed a police report over the broken glass.

Spokesperson Paola Garcia of Camino, a bilingual nonprofit serving families in Charlotte, said she and her colleagues have observed an increase in stops by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents since Friday.

“Basically what we're seeing is that there have been lots of people being pulled over,” Garcia said. 

Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said via email that the “significant border patrol activity” was seen Saturday. 

“Most have been extremely quick, targeted arrests; others have been them ‘fishing,'” Asciutto said.





In east Charlotte, two workers were hanging Christmas lights in Rheba Hamilton's front yard in the morning when two Customs and Border Patrol agents walked up. One tried to speak to the workers in Spanish, she said. They did not respond, and the agents left without making arrests.

“This is real disconcerting, but the main thing is we've got two human beings in my yard trying to make a living. They've broken no laws, and that's what concerns me,” said Hamilton, who recorded the encounter on her cellphone.

“It's an abuse of all of our laws. It is unlike anything I have ever imagined I would see in my lifetime,” the 73-year-old said.

Amid reports of the crackdown, she had suggested the work be postponed. But the contractor decided to go ahead.

“Half an hour later, he's in our yard, he's working and Border Patrol rolls up,” she said. “They're here because they were looking for easy pickings. There was nobody here with TV cameras, nobody here protesting, there's just two guys working in a yard and an old white lady with white hair sitting on her porch drinking her coffee.”



JD Mazuera Arias, who was elected to the City Council in September, was among a group standing watch outside a Latin American bakery in his east Charlotte district.

Another bakery nearby closed for fear of the crackdown, he said, showing the harm to livelihoods and the economy.

“This is Customs and Border Patrol. We are not a border city, nor are we a border state. So why are they here?” he said. “This is a gross violation of constitutional rights for not only immigrants but for U.S. citizens.”

Asciutto said many businesses in his part of town were closed and “We're brainstorming ways to keep them afloat, as we don't know how long this is going to last.” 

The Trump administration has defended unprecedented federal enforcement operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago as necessary for fighting crime and enforcing immigration laws. 

Some in North Carolina welcomed the blitz. Mecklenburg County Republican Party Chairman Kyle Kirby said Democratic officials “have abandoned their duty to uphold law and order” and are “demonizing the brave men and women of federal law enforcement.”

“Let us be clear: President Trump was given a mandate in the 2024 election to secure our borders,” Kirby said in a statement. “Individuals who are in this country legally have nothing to fear.”

But several hundred people protested Saturday in a Charlotte park. 

Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said the previous day that the vast majority of people detained in such operations have no criminal convictions, and some are citizens. He urged people to record any “inappropriate behavior” and notify local law enforcement. 

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has emphasized that it is not involved in federal immigration enforcement.

U.S. immigration agents are targeting Charlotte, North Carolina, despite objections from local leaders, prompting activists, elected officials and community groups to monitor any sweeps and support vulnerable residents.

President Donald Trump's administration confirmed Saturday that a surge of immigration enforcement in North Carolina's largest city had begun. Agents were seen making arrests in multiple locations.

It is the latest step in the Trump administration's strategy of putting immigration agents or the military on the streets of several large, Democratic-run cities. The push has caused fear and anxiety, especially among people who lack legal status to be in the country, and sparked a number of lawsuits.

Here's what to know:

Charlotte is a racially diverse city of more than 900,000 residents, including more than 150,000 who are foreign-born, according to local officials. It is run by a Democratic mayor, though North Carolina's two U.S. senators are Republican and Trump won the state in the last three presidential elections. 

Crime was down this year through August, compared with the same eight-month period in 2024, with homicides, rapes, robberies and motor vehicle thefts decreasing by more than 20%, according to AH Datalytics, which tracks crime across the country using local data for its Real-Time Crime Index.

But the Trump administration has seized upon the August fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light-rail train to argue that Democratic-led cities fail to protect residents. A man with a lengthy criminal record has been charged with that murder. 

There is no indication, however, that border agents could or would have a role in enforcing local or state laws.

Critics have characterized the arrival of border agents as an invasion. Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said the agents “are causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty.”

Local groups are training volunteers to protest and to safely document any immigration sweeps. They are also informing immigrants of their rights.

“We've seen what has taken place in other cities across this country when the federal government gets involved,” state Rep. Jordan Lopez said.

Mecklenburg County Commissioner Susan Rodriguez-McDowell urged the public to “meet the moment peacefully” and “reduce panic.”

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has said it has no authority to enforce federal immigration laws and is not involved in such operations.

There is no sign that the guard will go to Charlotte, though three Republican members of North Carolina's congressional delegation have urged Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, to request it.

The governor's office said local police are a better choice to keep neighborhoods safe. 

The Trump administration has deployed the guard to the District of Columbia and the Los Angeles area, citing crime and a need to protect immigration agents, and Memphis, Tennessee. Courts have blocked the guard from operating so far in the Chicago area and in Portland, Oregon.

At a joint briefing with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis in Athens, Zelenskyy said the first gas deliveries from Greece will start in January. He added the deal reached with Athens also includes the transit of American liquified natural gas (LNG) from Greece, using the Mediterranean country's infrastructure.

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — An agreement to supply Ukraine with US liquefied natural gas (LNG) was signed in Athens Sunday during the official visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Greece.

Zelenskyy and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis attended the signing of the deal between Greece's gas supplier DEPA and Ukraine's Naftogas, as did the United States Ambassador to Greece Kimberly Guilfoyle.

The gas will be supplied via pipelines from the northern Greek port of Alexandroupolis to the Ukrainian port of Odesa. Zelenskyy said that the supply of U.S. LNG will begin in January.

Until then, Greece will supply Ukraine with natural gas to cover its needs for the coming winter and to make up for damage to its energy infrastructure from Russian attacks.

Mitsotakis stressed the importance of an Athens energy meeting on Nov. 6-7 in making the LNG deal possible.

In that meeting, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum joined over 80 American officials, EU energy ministers and top LNG executives for talks in Greece hosted by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.

“The United States alone could displace all the Russian gas in Europe with what we're building,” said Burgum at the time, signaling strong U.S. intent to fill the void left by Russian supply cuts.

The push comes as President Donald Trump continues to leverage the U.S. position as the world's top LNG exporter, tying energy supply to trade relations with Europe and efforts to end the war in Ukraine.




Earlier Sunday, Zelenskyy and Mitsotakis held talks that also covered Greece's involvement in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, mostly in construction, health care, digitalization and monument protection. In addition, Zelenskyy made a pitch for Greece to acquire Ukrainian weaponry.

“I talked about our capabilities in producing defensive weapons,” Zelenskyy told reporters after the meeting.

Zelenskyy also thanked Greece for its support of Ukraine's quest to join the European Union and its backing of sanctions against Russia.

“For Greece, border inviolability is non-negotiable. We continue to support, to the best of our ability, the Ukrainian people's heroic resistance,” Mitsotakis said, also expressing his “revulsion at the intensification of Russian attacks (that include) non-military infrastructure and (result in) civilian casualties.”

Zelenskyy, who arrived in Athens early Sunday afternoon, will next visit France, on Monday, and Spain, on Tuesday. It is his second visit to Greece; the first was in August 2023.

Arrington Vineyards winemaker Chase Vienneau and co-founder Kip Summers reveal why their Tennessee location provides the perfect climate for a red wine that can be sampled through the Fox News Wine Shop.

Some 30 minutes south of Nashville, Arrington Vineyards is proving that good wine doesn't have to come from California.

Co-founder Kip Summers and winemaker Chase Vienneau have spent nearly two decades coaxing character out of Tennessee soil — and now, through the Fox News Wine Shop, they're sharing it nationwide.

""I toured a winery in Napa and thought, 'Wow, I think I'm in the wrong business. I need to figure out how to do this,'"" Summers recalled.

Once he did, he met Vienneau while they were working together at a small family winery north of Nashville.

Arrington Vineyards was soon born, closer to Nashville in Williamson County, where he partnered with Kix Brooks — one half of the award-winning country music duo Brooks & Dunn.

""We started the winery down here with the idea of providing a place for people to enjoy a little bit of wine country,"" Summers said — ""but in Middle Tennessee.""

That vision had its challenges.

""They are what they are here in Middle Tennessee,"" Summers said of the region's conditions.

""This time of year, we've got cool nights and warm days, and a lot of dry weather. It's a lot more humid and tropical during the summer. So, for us, it kind of boils down to which grapes can we grow here successfully?""

Vienneau, who followed Summers to Arrington Vineyards in 2008, added, ""It's almost impossible to grow [Cabernet] here in Tennessee.… We've obviously had to switch over to hybrids here, which still make really good wines, and they're a little more resistant to our climate here in Tennessee.""

Arrington Vineyards is known as ""Nashville's wine country."" (Arrington Vineyards)

That local experimentation led to the wine now featured in the Fox News American Wine Club. Antiquity is a red blend that spends a year in used Tennessee whiskey barrels.

""The wine that's part of this Fox Wine Club is made from a grape called Chambourcin, which is well-known in Virginia and New York, and a lot of the areas in the eastern United States,"" Summers said.

The result is a ""really good, consistent dry red wine for us every year,"" he said.

""That's one of the reasons we wanted that wine to be a part of the wine club, because it really is a true representation of what we've been doing here for three years.""

""It's really versatile, too, for us,"" Vienneau added. ""We make a Ruby-style port out of Chambourcin.… We can make a dry Rosé. We've made a really nice sparkling, French-method wine out of it.""

Summers said the setting is part of the appeal.

""When we talk about us being Nashville's wine country, we're really one of the few places you can go if you're in Nashville, and if you said to yourself, 'I'd really like to go out and hang out in a vineyard and have a bottle of wine with some cheese and a charcuterie tray — and enjoy the scenery, walk among the vines and just have a nice afternoon,'"" Summers said.

A Becket Fund for Religious Liberty attorney told Fox News Digital that opposition to Quincy's planned statues of St. Michael and St. Florian misrepresents America's long tradition of honoring public service through art and shared symbolism.

A Massachusetts community is split on allowing two towering bronze statues of Catholic saints outside its new public safety building.

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Joe Davis, senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said Quincy, Massachusetts' plan to erect statues of St. Michael the Archangel and St. Florian reflects a centuries-old artistic and cultural tradition of honoring courage and sacrifice, not a violation of the Constitution's separation of church and state.

""This case is about a city trying to beautify a public space and honor those who put their lives on the line every day,"" Davis said. ""These are figures that are important to firefighters and police officers around the world. The purpose of these statues is to inspire and encourage the people who work there.""

The statues, each roughly 10 feet tall and costing a combined $850,000, were commissioned by Mayor Thomas P. Koch in 2023 and are slated to be installed on the façade of Quincy's new Public Safety Building, a $150 million facility that will house the city's police and fire departments.

The project has ignited months of heated debate across the south of Boston, with critics arguing that using taxpayer money to display Catholic imagery on government property violates both the Massachusetts Constitution and the First Amendment's establishment clause.

In May 2025, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Massachusetts, joined by the Freedom From Religion Foundation and Americans United for Separation of Church and State, filed a lawsuit on behalf of 15 residents from a variety of faith traditions.

The plaintiffs argue that the statues send an ""exclusionary message"" that suggests that non-Catholic residents ""are second-class citizens who should not feel safe or equally respected"" by their own government.

The ACLU had earlier warned city officials in a Feb. 24 letter that the plan ""plainly violates"" the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.

""Placing larger-than-life statues of Catholic saints in front of a public building unequivocally advances one religion to the exclusion of all others,"" the letter stated, noting that the imagery of St. Michael standing on a demon's neck was ""particularly abhorrent"" and ""reminiscent of brutal force.""

Davis rejected those claims, insisting that the city's intent is consistent with long-standing American traditions of civic art that carry religious associations.

""If we say that a symbol cannot be displayed in public just because it has religious associations for some, that's going to require us to take down quite a bit of public imagery across this country,"" Davis said. ""At the U.S. Supreme Court, there's a statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments. It has religious meaning, yes, but it also symbolizes law and justice. The same is true here.""

Davis compared Quincy's statues to the Bladensburg Peace Cross, a World War I memorial in Maryland that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in 2019 as constitutional.

""That cross honored the war dead. Quincy wants to honor firefighters and police officers,"" he said.

The Becket Fund, which specializes in defending religious expression in public life, plans to appeal the injunction that has temporarily halted installation of the statues. Davis said the team hopes the case will clarify whether public symbols with religious origins can exist in civic spaces when used for secular or historical purposes.

""It could either go to the intermediate Massachusetts appeals court or straight to the Supreme Judicial Court, which is the high court of Massachusetts,"" Davis said. ""And that court is going to be asked to address an important question and to set an important precedent, which is whether public symbols can be scrubbed from the public square just because they have religious associations to some people. I don't think that's right. It would set a very dangerous precedent.""

Koch has maintained that the statues were chosen to ""honor and protect"" first responders, noting that many police officers and firefighters carry medals or prayer cards bearing the same saints' images. The works are being sculpted in Italy by artist Sergey Eylanbekov, who also created public monuments of John Adams and John Hancock for the city.

Critics say the mayor commissioned the project without public notice or City Council approval. According to the lawsuit reviewed by Fox News Digital, the first payments to the artist were made in 2023, but most city officials and residents did not learn of the plan until February 2025, when a local newspaper published renderings of the building showing the two saints flanking its entrance.

A petition opposing the statues gathered more than 1,600 signatures, and an interfaith coalition of 19 clergy members from Catholic, Jewish, Unitarian and Protestant congregations issued a public statement warning that the display ""sends a message that there are insiders and outsiders in this community.""

NEW YORK TEEN OPENS UP ABOUT WINNING BATTLE TO DISPLAY BIBLE VERSES ON SCHOOL PARKING SPOT

The lawsuit contends that the statues fail all four parts of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court's test for determining religious neutrality. Although the federal high court abandoned that test in 2022, Massachusetts courts continue to apply it under the state constitution.

Davis, however, said courts have long recognized that government displays can have mixed religious and secular meanings.

""It's very troubling to say that because some people might view something as religious, it therefore has to be taken down. And in fact, that would give a really imbalanced and inaccurate presentation of our history and culture if the religious aspects had to be sort of scrubbed out,"" he said.

The case could soon land before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, where justices will weigh whether public art that incorporates religious imagery violates the state's strict constitutional separation of church and state.

For now, the statues remain in storage overseas, awaiting shipment to Quincy later this year. City officials have said they will ""stay quiet on the affixing front"" while the legal battle plays out.

""Quincy is doing what cities have done for centuries,"" Davis said. ""Using art to honor the people who protect and serve. That's not a religious act. It's an act of gratitude.""

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has more on the worsening humanitarian crisis in Haiti on 'America Reports.' 

U.S. Marines protecting the American embassy in Haiti exchanged gunfire with suspected gang members last week, a Marine spokesman said.

Capt. Steven J. Keenan told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement Sunday that Marines supporting embassy security operations were fired upon by suspected gang members in the capital of Port-au-Prince and returned fire on the evening of Nov. 13.

""U.S. Marines are committed to the safety and security of U.S. embassies worldwide and respond to all threats with professionalism and swift, disciplined action,"" Keenan said.

No service members were injured in the incident, which was first reported over the weekend by The Washington Post.

Neither the State Department nor the U.S. Embassy in Haiti immediately responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The Caribbean nation has been plagued by gang violence, with armed groups reportedly controlling up to 90% of Port-au-Prince, according to the United Nations. The groups block access roads, attack infrastructure, and terrorize civilians through kidnappings, rapes and killings.

There has been no elected government in Haiti since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021.

The U.N. said a gang suppression force of 5,550 was set to begin operations in Haiti on Oct. 2, working alongside Haitian authorities to neutralize gangs, secure infrastructure and support humanitarian access.

The multinational mission, authorized by the U.N. Security Council, aims to ""protect vulnerable populations from escalating violence and prevent the displacement that inevitably causes.""

It remains unclear which countries will contribute personnel, though the force will be funded primarily through voluntary contributions from U.N. member states.

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot joins 'Special Report' to discuss China's efforts to expand their military assets.

Chinese coast guard ships sailed through the Senkaku Islands in what it called a ""rights enforcement patrol"" on Sunday, continuing to ramp up tensions with Japan.

The move is the latest sign of Beijing's displeasure with Japan, which administers the islands, after newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi gave a full-throated defense of Taiwan's independence earlier this month. She vowed that any attack by Beijing on Taiwan would warrant a military response from Japan.

""China Coast Guard vessel 1307 formation conducted patrols within the territorial waters of the Diaoyu Islands. This was a lawful patrol operation conducted by the China Coast Guard to uphold its rights and interests,"" China's coast guard said in a statement.

In the days since Takaichi's Nov. 7 statement on Taiwan, Chinese officials have summoned Japan's ambassador and warned Chinese citizens against traveling to Japan. China's defense ministry also vowed that any Japanese intervention would be ineffective in protecting Taiwan.

The most vicious response came from China's consul general in Osaka, who appeared to threaten to decapitate Takaichi in a now-deleted post on social media.

The official, Xue Jian, wrote, ""That filthy neck that barged in on its own – I've got no choice but to cut it off without a moment's hesitation. Are you prepared for that?""

Japan's government condemned the statement, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara calling it ""extremely inappropriate"" and confirming that Tokyo had lodged a formal protest with Beijing. Kihara said Xue had made ""multiple"" inflammatory remarks in the past and urged China to take disciplinary action.

China instead appeared to defend the diplomat. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters Monday that Xue's words came in response to Takaichi's ""wrongful and dangerous"" comments, which he said misrepresented China's position on Taiwan. Lin accused Japan of ""refusing to face up to its historical responsibilities"" and warned Tokyo not to interfere in ""internal Chinese affairs.""

Taiwan's defense ministry says it has also detected ramped-up aggression from China in recent days. The self-governed island said it monitored 30 Chinese military aircraft and seven naval ships operating nearby, according to NBC News.

Rep, Marjorie Taylor Greene offered begrudging respect for long-serving Democrat Nancy Pelosi, saying that she, unlike GOP leadership, actually accomplished the agenda she was elected for.

Conservative commentator Laura Loomer set off a fresh wave of speculation Saturday by openly teasing a possible move to Georgia after President Donald Trump withdrew his endorsement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene in a blistering late-night Truth Social post.

Loomer, a staunch Trump ally with roughly 1.8 million followers on X, posted that the president told her he wanted Greene ""primaried,"" then asked her audience a pointed question.

""Should I move to Georgia?"" she asked.

Her post, paired with Trump's Truth Social message calling Greene a ""ranting lunatic,"" immediately triggered questions about whether Loomer is positioning herself as a potential challenger in Georgia's 14th Congressional District.

Greene has not responded to Loomer's posts.

Loomer and Greene have publicly attacked each other throughout the year, with their exchanges escalating sharply since summer. In August, the two clashed over Loomer's criticism of Medal of Honor recipient Florent Groberg, sparking a days-long volley of insults.

Saturday's posts show Loomer revisiting and escalating those accusations. She described Greene as ""no friend to MAGA,"" accused her of disloyalty dating back to 2021 and brought up claims about Greene's political alliances during the 2022 midterms.

Several of Loomer's follow-up posts Saturday referenced Greene receiving public support from Democrats, adding fuel to an already volatile public feud.

Trump's public break with Greene, which he delivered in a lengthy statement late Friday, removed one of the Georgia Republican's most valuable political assets, the president's personal endorsement.

In his post, Trump said Greene had become consumed with ""complaining,"" claimed she had ""turned left"" politically and said conservative voters in Georgia were already considering a primary challenge. He added that he would give ""Complete and Unyielding Support"" to the ""right person"" who enters the race.

Trump did not name any potential challengers.

While Loomer has not announced a campaign, her suggestion of a possible move to Georgia came within hours of Trump's statement and quickly fueled speculation online that she could test the waters.

If Loomer relocates and enters the 2026 primary, it would pit two highly visible right-wing firebrands against each other in one of the most closely watched House districts in the country.

Georgia's 14th District remains deeply conservative, meaning the primary is typically the decisive contest. A high-profile rivalry amplified by Trump's public intervention would almost certainly attract national attention, campaign money and intense media coverage.

For now, Loomer has offered no formal announcement, only the question.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Jeffrey Epstein's resentment toward Donald Trump","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/3888590/jeffrey-epstein-resentment-toward-donald-trump/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 01:24:06 GMT","

JEFFREY EPSTEIN'S RESENTMENT TOWARD DONALD TRUMP. There's no doubt Jeffrey Epstein thought he was a very, very smart guy. “He always thought he was the smartest person in the room,” said one associate. Another said Epstein “thought he was smarter than the next guy.” When in 2008 Epstein pleaded guilty to procurement of a minor for prostitution, his defense asked for leniency based on his “unique intellect.”

Someone with such high self-regard can be deeply disturbed if a friend or associate, or a former friend or associate, achieves more, makes more money, and rises higher up society's ladder than the person who feels he is the smartest guy in the room. Reading through Epstein's emails released by Republicans on the House Oversight Committee, one gets the impression that Epstein was troubled by the success of his former friend Donald Trump, as he watched Trump take a wildly improbable path from successful developer to television star to president of the United States. At the same time, of course, Epstein was pleading guilty to sex crimes, struggling to recover, and then finding himself charged with even more serious sex crimes. Suicide in a jail cell was in his future, while Trump was in the White House.

“President Trump's long friendship with Jeffrey Epstein came to an apparent end in the mid-2000s,” wrote the New York Times. “But Mr. Epstein remained intently focused on Mr. Trump for years afterward, seeking to exploit the remnants of their relationship up until his arrest on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019.” As Trump rose, the New York Times said, Epstein tried to regain status by “casting himself as the ultimate Trump translator.” But the smartest guy in the room was fuming over the success of someone he felt was so clearly inferior to himself.

“Your world does not understand how dumb [Trump] really is,” Epstein wrote to former Treasury Secretary and Harvard President Lawrence Summers in May 2017, Trump's fourth month in office. When, in July 2017, former Obama White House counsel Kathryn Ruemmler wrote, “Trump is truly stupid,” Epstein replied with a one-word answer: “Duh.”

In an exchange with New York Times reporter Landon Thomas, Epstein wrote that Trump was “evil beyond belief,” and that he, Epstein, had tried to warn the world about his former friend. “I told everyone from day one,” Epstein wrote. 

“I know how dirty Donald is,” Epstein wrote to Ruemmler in August 2018. “My guess is that non-lawyers, NY biz people have no idea.” Then Epstein boasted to an unknown recipient in December 2018: “I am the one able to take him down.” Meanwhile, Epstein exchanged long emails with adviser Michael Wolff in which Wolff offered Epstein counsel on trying to damage Trump, blackmail Trump, and possibly run him out of office.

It would be an understatement to note that Trump was living rent-free in Epstein's head. “The emails suggest that Trump remained a fixation for Epstein,” CNN wrote, “as he's frequently mentioned numerous times over a span of nearly a decade — including long after their friendship ended.”

By the way, remember when Elon Musk, breaking with Trump, breathlessly announced that Trump was “in the Epstein files”? Of course Trump is in the Epstein files; he's all over this set of Epstein files because he was so deeply in Epstein's head. Trump will be in other Epstein files, too, because Epstein apparently could not stop thinking and talking about him.

Finally, one problem with reading the Epstein emails today is that Epstein was, in the words of one recent assessment in the Atlantic, a “notorious liar.” It is reasonable to take Epstein's statements of opinion at face value — he appeared to really think Trump was dumb — but not his statements of fact. 

So when Epstein says that victim Virginia Giuffre “spent hours at my house with [Trump],” there's no compelling reason to believe him. Giuffre, now dead, wrote a book that said no such thing about Trump and also testified under oath that Trump “didn't partake in any sex with us … [and] never flirted with me.” Giuffre said she never saw Trump and Epstein together. She was asked, “Did you ever see Donald Trump at Jeffrey's home?” and answered, “Not that I remember.” In addition, she said she did not remember seeing Trump at Epstein's island, or his house in New Mexico, or his house in New York.

So what to make of it? First, even though he was a friend of Epstein's for several years up to around 2004, there is still no evidence linking Donald Trump to any wrongdoing. And second, Trump is nevertheless everywhere in the Epstein files because Jeffrey Epstein was out of his mind with resentment toward a former friend who not only succeeded in business but became president of the United States, even as Epstein raced toward ruin.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Democrats bet big that President Donald Trump would cave to their healthcare demands in a protracted government shutdown fight. Now, they're facing a reckoning from the party's base over the miscalculation.

The standoff, which centered on expiring Obamacare subsidies, ended up backing congressional Democrats into a corner and disappointing supporters, who expected them to emerge from the shutdown with an extension of the subsidies despite GOP control of Congress and the White House.

Instead, a group of Senate Democrats settled to reopen the government with only the promise of a future vote on healthcare, an offer Republicans first floated to Democrats a month earlier but was roundly rejected at the time as insufficient.

Those same deal-makers, who claimed victory by creating a national conversation on healthcare, are tempering expectations heading into negotiations with Republicans ahead of next month's promised vote and further enraging Democratic colleagues and voters. There's a “guaranteed vote,” the centrist rebels have repeated, quickly followed with “but not a guaranteed outcome.”

“I think people understand what a betrayal this is to not be able to go back with a victory and, certainly, how cruel Republicans are to refuse to actually fix healthcare for their constituents,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), a leader of the Progressive Caucus.

The latest indictment of Democratic leaders by the progressive wing played out in theatrical fashion Thursday, when demonstrators from the liberal activist group Our Revolution hand-delivered a petition with thousands of digital signatures to Sen. Chuck Schumer's (D-NY) Washington office, calling on him to step down as minority leader.

“Unfortunately, messaging doesn't provide healthcare to the 20 million folks that are going to lose it because of this, and they give up with a promise of a vote that is absolutely not going to pass,” Our Revolution Deputy Director Paco Fabien told the Washington Examiner.

It is estimated that more than 4 million Obamacare recipients out of the 24 million people with marketplace plans will be forced to drop their coverage in the coming years without the continued subsidies.

Schumer opposed ending the shutdown without a policy concession from Republicans and voted against the bipartisan resolution, but he has been unable to avoid the base's wrath, with critics claiming he privately blessed the shutdown-ending deal. Schumer's allies deny that claim.

The deal has become fodder for Senate candidates from Maine to Iowa accusing Schumer of capitulation and calling on him to resign from leadership, mirroring the outrage in a March funding battle that also ended in defeat for Democrats.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), among the eight Democratic-caucusing senators to strike a deal that ended the 43-day shutdown on Wednesday, said prolonging it “wouldn't deliver a better outcome.”

“It would only mean more harm for families in New Hampshire and all across the country,” she said.

Sen. Angus King (I-ME), another of the deal-makers, called the agreement “a win for the American people” after “seven weeks of fruitless attempts,” a characterization that Democrats would have thumbed their nose at heading into the shutdown.

“This wasn't about making healthcare an issue,” said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), a Progressive Caucus vice chairman. “This was about making sure people's premiums aren't going up.”

ACTIVISTS DEMAND SCHUMER STEP DOWN WITH HAND-DELIVERED PETITION TO DC OFFICE

There is a notable bright spot from Democrats in the weeks ahead as they search for a pared-back extension of subsidies that could win over enough Senate Republicans. Democrats are more united on healthcare messaging, as Republicans grapple with how seriously to negotiate over a program they believe is the cause of high insurance costs rather than the solution.

“This is a fight that the Republicans need to understand is not just happening in Nevada,” said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), a centrist who helped cut the shutdown deal. “It is happening across the country in every state, including those red states. If they do choose not to come to the table, they can own the disastrous premium increases that will continue to rise.”

CARBONDALE, Kansas (AP) — Four law enforcement officers were shot Saturday morning while responding to a domestic violence call at a home in a rural area south of Topeka, and a 22-year-old male suspect died of gunshot wounds at the scene.

The suspect's 77-year-old grandfather also was wounded in the gunfire but he and the law enforcement officers are all expected to recover, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation said.

The shooting occurred around 10:30 a.m. Three Osage County sheriff's deputies and one Kansas Highway Patrol trooper were shot, the KBI's director and the patrol's superintendent said.

Two deputies underwent surgery at a Topeka hospital and were in good condition, the KBI said, and the third deputy was discharged. The trooper was transferred from the same hospital to the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas.

“After being on scene less than 10 minutes, gunfire erupted,” patrol Superintendent Erik Smith said during a news conference at the Carbondale City Library.

Carbondale is a town of about 1,300 people about 16 miles south of Topeka, the state capital, off Interstate 75.

The shooting stunned neighbors John and Heather Roberts, who live about a mile north of where it occurred on the same two-lane road. They never sensed any problem in any of the family members, such as drugs, alcohol abuse, or violence, and they said the suspect's grandmother gave Christian books to area children she knew.

They said it is not uncommon to see law enforcement vehicles on the road outside their home because they live at the line between Osage County, home to Carbondale, and Shawnee County, home to Topeka, and vehicles turn around there or the counties exchange prisoners.

John Roberts said he was putting siding on his barn when two law enforcement vehicles flew down the road in the morning.

“Both of them were running, I would say, well over 100 miles an hour as they went by,” he said. “Then the city of Topeka officers started going by. That's when I started to really get concerned.”

He said the suspect visited the shop he has at his home to return tools and was “a good kid.” Roberts added that many families in the area own guns because hunting is a common hobby, and that was the case with this family.

“I love the family. They're great people,” Heather Roberts said, adding that she and her husband were praying for the wounded officers too.

She said every time the suspect visited their home, he would give her a hug and he was “very respectful.”

“I don't know what snapped in him today, but his grandparents loved him very much,” she said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino has pushed back on a report that claimed a key part of his background check for the top job was waived by Director Kash Patel, calling it a “complete fabrication.”

ProPublica reported that Patel granted Bongino a waiver for the polygraph examination, which is required for all new FBI employees. While an FBI spokesperson suggested Bongino wouldn't be required to take the exam due to him being under the category “Schedule C,” or a political appointee, multiple lawyers told the outlet the designation doesn't grant an exemption from the polygraph test.

In a statement on Saturday, Bongino, without explicitly mentioning the polygraph exam requirement, insisted he met “all of the background check requirements for my current position.”

“Claiming I was hired ‘with no background check' is just a lie. It's a complete fabrication. I held a security clearance, while protecting Democrat and Republican presidents, for over ten years. And all of the background check requirements for my current position as Deputy Director of the FBI have been met. Those are simple facts,” Bongino said.

The report also revealed that Patel granted waivers on the exam to two other senior FBI employees. Those staffers are Marshall Yates, the FBI's liaison with Congress, and Nicole Rucker, Patel's personal assistant.

Patel has received some scrutiny for the move before, most recently when he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September.

At the time, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) questioned Patel about alleged “disqualifying alerts” on polygraph tests of his “senior executive team,” with Patel declining to comment.

The FBI director was also asked if he or Attorney General Pam Bondi ever granted a waiver on a polygraph exam, to which Patel replied, “I'll have to get back to you.”

In an X post on Friday, Durbin reposted the ProPublica report, writing, “FBI Director Patel refused to respond to whistleblower reports that people failed polygraph tests at the FBI. Now we know why.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

There's too much news. We help you understand what you really need to know. Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what's happening and why it matters.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?

And what, if anything, should be done about it?

It feels like everyone's mad at billionaires right now.

Maybe it's the disconnect between Americans struggling with grocery prices and health care premiums and the ultrarich sailing on their super yachts and flying on their private jets.

Maybe it's that Elon Musk is on course to become the world's first trillionaire.

Maybe it's that billionaires poured money into trying to defeat Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race.

Maybe it's that members of the three comma club are paying a lower tax rate than the rest of us.

Either way, new survey data shows that 67 percent of Americans say billionaires are making society less fair, up eight points from a year ago.

The anti-billionaire sentiment is high. To understand why, Today, Explained co-host Noel King called up Evan Osnos, a staff writer at the New Yorker. He's spent a lot of time with the very wealthy and published a decade's worth of essays about them in his book The Haves and Have-Yachts: Dispatches on the Ultrarich.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Evan, what are the best and worst parts of hanging out with billionaires?

Unfortunately, the best part is that it is awfully tempting. You begin to realize just how delicious the fresh-squeezed juice really is. The worst part is that you also begin to wonder about some big questions about the small-D democratic health of the country. So, it sends you back into history in ways that can be both funny and thrilling — and also quite disconcerting at times.

If you say billionaire to me, I think Oprah. That is where my mind goes. But Oprah would not be a typical billionaire, demographically. She's an older Black woman. Is there a typical person who represents what a billionaire is?

The median billionaire would look a lot like Elon Musk, which is to say he is a man in his mid-50s who made his money on a combination of technology, inheritance, and the sheer accumulation of giant numbers.

What's really noticeable about today is that it's never been easier for your small billionaire fortune to become a giant billionaire fortune. For the very first time in the history of the species, we have now centibillionaires. Ten years ago, nobody in the world had $100 billion, but today, there are more than a dozen. Elon Musk, for instance. Ten years ago, he didn't have more than $20 billion, and today, he has around $400 billion. So, the numbers have gone through the roof.

Right now, worldwide, there are more than 3,000 billionaires, and you see the growth most sharply in the United States. In 1990, there were about 66 billionaires in this country. Today, there are close to a thousand.

Even more astonishing than that simple number is that the share of wealth that's controlled by billionaires has also soared. It used to be that 0.1 percent of Americans controlled about 7 percent of all the wealth in the country, but today, it's gone up to 18 percent.

And why? The answer has a lot of factors, but the key one is that we've changed the rules over the last century to make it much easier for big fortunes to grow, mostly by reducing the taxes that would chip away at them over time. By one measure, the average tax rate for the top 400 richest Americans is now about half of what it was 50 years ago, while the tax rates for the bottom 90 percent of Americans have really not budged much at all.

So, you make the money or you inherit the money, and then the tax code benefits you in a lot of ways. And so you keep the money. How do you spend the money? What are billionaires buying?

It used to be that there was an expression among the very wealthiest advisors to the rich, which was that, “The whale that never surfaces doesn't get harpooned.“ In other words, if you keep yourself out of sight, then you stand less chance of attracting public outrage or attracting the tax man. But these days, the style has changed. You see the wedding that Jeff Bezos is having in Venice, which is visible for the whole world to see. Or take, for example, the world of superyachts. These are machines that are, in a sense, the most expensive objects that humans have ever figured out how to own, that cost about a half a billion dollars in some cases.

There are also ways that people are figuring out how to spend their money that simply were not possible a generation ago. It used to be, if you had a huge amount of money, and you wanted to see your favorite artist, you might buy a front-row ticket or maybe a skybox. Now, people have so much money, as one musician put it to me, that “people can afford to have the Foo Fighters come to their backyard on a Thursday.” Pop stars are now available for hire.

One thing that's very clear now is that the numbers have gotten so big that people are actually struggling to figure out how to spend it. I spoke to a consultant who caters to what he calls the “bored billionaires,” and he said, “Look, I can come up with ways of people spending their money that they didn't know were possible.”

He'll build a restaurant, for instance, on a sandbar in the Maldives, and it'll be [3D-printed], and they'll have dinner together, and then it'll be washed away. And nobody will ever be able to eat in that particular place in that way again. That, he said, is the kind of thing that you eventually end up spending your money on once you've bought everything else.

Recently, we have all been starting to hear about a sentiment that there shouldn't be billionaires. Talk to me about where this “abolish billionaires” push comes from and where it began.

As a general idea, this has been around since the Russian Revolution in 1917. But in recent years, it's become much more explicit. Bernie Sanders was running for president, and he was talking about the idea that, as he said at the time, billionaires shouldn't exist. And then you had Elizabeth Warren talking about a policy platform that would involve a wealth tax.

The idea that every billionaire is a policy failure has become much more broadly felt in progressive policy circles. And Zohran Mamdani's campaign was, in a sense, the most dramatic example of that, because it was unfolding right there in the financial capital of the United States: New York City.

Not long ago, the singer Billie Eilish got an award from T=the Wall Street Journal, and she said, “Love you all, but there's a few people in here that have a lot more money than me. And, if you're a billionaire, why are you a billionaire? No hate, but yeah, give your money away, shorties.” It made me wonder whether we're seeing more of this kind of conversation in 2025 or whether this is a continuation of the last five, ten years.

It's becoming much more a part of everyday conversation. The example you gave of Billie Eilish talking about this coming from a pop culture perspective is really noticeable for a few reasons.

One, I think we're living through a time now where the fusion of economic power and political power has never been as obvious. We all saw that scene on January 20, the inauguration of the second Trump presidency, in which the crowd was full of billionaires. Many of his biggest political supporters were the richest people in the country, and the richest people in the world. So many were on that stage beside him that there wasn't even room for the leaders of Congress, who were relegated to the audience. Trump went on to then staff his administration with at least a dozen billionaires.

We've never had a moment in which the actual levers of government have been handed over to some of the richest people in the world. This is not an abstraction; it's just a fact. And you see that reflected across the decisions that the government makes.

For instance, the big fiscal bill that passed earlier in the year, known as the “one big beautiful bill,” was calculated to be the single largest transfer of wealth in American history, simply by the way that it closed off avenues for subsidies and support for poorer Americans by creating opportunities for the wealthiest Americans to hold onto more of their money. It's just no longer an abstraction in the background; it's right there, front and center on stage.

In the years after the financial crisis, I remember everyone said that, at some point, there is going to be a class war in the United States. People are fed up, and they're frustrated, and it's right in our faces. The thing that strikes me is that, a decade later, it is so much more in our faces. I wonder where you think American attitudes on this go?

For a long time, I think that Americans tolerated and, in some cases, celebrated inequality, or these giant fortunes at the top, because they felt like they were the emblems of opportunity. They substantiated the myth that really is important to the American idea that you can go from the bottom to the top, the kind of thing that you still do hear from cab drivers on the other side of the world when they hear that you're an American.

But the numbers here at home are very different than that myth suggests. The simple fact is, if you're a person who was born in 1940 in this country, you stood a 90 percent chance of out-earning your parents. But you fast forward to today, and a child who's coming of age today stands less than half that chance of out-earning their parents. And, as a result, there is a feeling of hollowness and of frustration about that mythology. The history on this suggests that, at a certain point, people do get frustrated to the point where they don't accept it anymore.There's a great historian named Ramsay MacMullen who studied the fall of Rome. What he said was that the fall of Rome took 500 years, but you could condense that history into a very concise explanation: “Fewer had more.” In a way, I think that recognition that we're beginning to monkey around with the very foundation of America's democratic sustainability has bled out into the broader population to such an extent that that willingness to celebrate giant fortunes as emblems of opportunity rather than as signs of distress is changing. That pendulum feels as if it is beginning to swing in the other direction.

﻿Resistance to exploitative AI starts with building a movement.

Your Mileage May Vary is an advice column offering you a unique framework for thinking through your moral dilemmas. It's based on value pluralism, the idea that each of us has multiple values that are equally valid but that often conflict with each other. To submit a question, fill out this anonymous form. Here's this week's question from a reader, condensed and edited for clarity.

I'm an AI engineer working at a medium-sized ad agency, mostly on non-generative machine learning models (think ad performance prediction, not ad creation). Lately, it feels like people, specifically senior and mid-level managers who do not have engineering experience, are pushing the adoption and development of various AI tools. Honestly, it feels like an unthinking melee.

I consider myself a conscientious objector to the use of AI, especially generative AI; I'm not fully opposed to it, but I constantly ask who actually benefits from the application of AI and what its financial, human, and environmental costs are beyond what is right in front of our noses. Yet, as a rank-and-file employee, I find myself with no real avenue to relay those concerns to people who have actual power to decide. Worse, I feel that even voicing such concerns, admittedly running against the almost blind optimism that I assume affects most marketing companies, is turning me into a pariah in my own workplace.

So my question is this: Considering the difficulty of finding good jobs in AI, is it “worth it” trying to encourage critical AI use in my company, or should I tone it down if only to keep paying the bills?

Dear Conscientious Objector,

You're definitely not alone in hating the uncritical rollout of generative AI. Lots of people hate it, from artists, to coders, to students. I bet there are people in your own company who hate it, too.

But they're not speaking up — and, of course, there's a reason for that: They're afraid to lose their jobs.

Honestly, it's a fair concern. And it's the reason why I'm not going to advise you to stick your neck out and fight this crusade alone. If you as an individual object to your company's AI use, you become legible to the company as a “problem” employee. There could be consequences to that, and I don't want to see you lose your paycheck.

But I also don't want to see you lose your moral integrity. You're absolutely right to constantly ask who actually benefits from the unthinking application of AI and whether the benefits outweigh the costs.

So, I think you should fight for what you believe in — but fight as part of a collective. The real question here is not, “Should you voice your concerns about AI or stay quiet?” It's, “How can you build solidarity with others who want to be part of a resistance movement with you?” Teaming up is both safer for you as an employee and more likely to have an impact.

“The most important thing an individual can do is be somewhat less of an individual,” the environmentalist Bill McKibben once said. “Join together with others in movements large enough to have some chance at changing those political and economic ground rules that keep us locked on this current path.”

Now, you know what word I'm about to say next, right? Unionize. If your workplace can be organized, that'll be a key strategy for allowing you to fight AI policies you disagree with.

If you need a bit of inspiration, look at what some labor unions have already achieved — from the Writers Guild of America, which won important protections around AI for Hollywood writers, to the Service Employees International Union, which negotiated with Pennsylvania's governor to create a worker board overseeing the implementation of generative AI in government services. Meanwhile, this year saw thousands of nurses marching in the streets as National Nurses United pushed for the right to determine how AI does and doesn't get used in patient interactions.

“There's a whole range of different examples where unions have been able to really be on the front foot in setting the terms for how AI gets used — and whether it gets used at all,” Sarah Myers West, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, told me recently.

If it's too hard to get a union off the ground at your workplace, there are plenty of organizations you can join forces with. Check out the Algorithmic Justice League or Fight for the Future, which push for equitable and accountable tech. There are also grassroots groups like Stop Gen AI, which aims to organize both a resistance movement and a mutual aid program to help those who've lost work due to the AI rollout.

You can also consider hyperlocal efforts, which have the benefit of creating community. One of the big ways those are showing up right now is in the fight against the massive buildout of energy-hungry data centers meant to power the AI boom.

“It's where we have seen many people fighting back in their communities — and winning,” Myers West told me. “They're fighting on behalf of their own communities, and working collectively and strategically to say, ‘We're being handed a really raw deal here. And if you [the companies] are going to accrue all the benefits from this technology, you need to be accountable to the people on whom it's being used.'”

Already, local activists have blocked or delayed $64 billion worth of data center projects across the US, according to a study by Data Center Watch, a project run by AI research firm 10a Labs.

Yes, some of those data centers may eventually get built anyway. Yes, fighting the uncritical adoption of AI can sometimes feel like you're up against an undefeatable behemoth. But it helps to preempt discouragement if you take a step back to think about what it really looks like when social change is happening.

In a new book, Somebody Should Do Something, three philosophers — Michael Brownstein, Alex Madva, and Daniel Kelly — show how anyone can help create social change. The key, they argue, is to realize that when we join forces with others, our actions can lead to butterfly effects:

Minor actions can set off cascades that lead, in a surprisingly short time, to major structural outcomes. This reflects a general feature of complex systems. Causal effects in such systems don't always build on each other in a smooth or continuous way. Sometimes they build nonlinearly, allowing seemingly small events to produce disproportionately large changes.

The authors explain that, because society is a complex system, your actions aren't a meaningless “drop in the bucket.” Adding water to a bucket is linear; each drop has equal impact. Complex systems behave more like heating water: Not every degree has the same effect, and the shift from 99°C to 100°C crosses a tipping point that triggers a phase change.

We all know the boiling point of water, but we don't know the tipping point for changes in the social world. That means it's going to be hard for you to tell, at any given moment, how close you are to creating a cascade of change. But that doesn't mean change is not happening.

According to Harvard political scientist Erica Chenoweth's research, if you want to achieve systemic social change, you need to mobilize 3.5 percent of the population around your cause. Though we have not yet seen AI-related protests on that scale, we do have data indicating the potential for a broad base. A full 50 percent of Americans are more concerned than excited about the rise of AI in daily life, according to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center. And 73 percent support robust regulation of AI, according to the Future of Life Institute.

So, even though you might feel alone in your workplace, there are people out there who share your concerns. Find your teammates. Come up with a positive vision for the future of tech. Then, fight for the future you want.

The core of the modern American dream is cheap stuff, and contrary to the president's suggestion earlier this year, it turns out little girls do need 30 dolls. Or, at least, their families want to be able to afford them, and they don't want the White House telling them otherwise.

The Trump administration's line on its economic policies in the opening months of the president's second go-round was, in essence, deal with it. Yes, tariffs will cause short-term pain, and sure, efforts to reshore manufacturing and curb immigration may increase labor-market uncertainty, but, officials insist, it will all be worth it. That's how we got Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that access to inexpensive goods is ""not the essence of the American dream,"" and President Donald Trump saying that kids should make do with fewer pencils.

The messaging isn't landing. Sacrifice is not a fun thing for consumers to do, especially when the payoff is vague at best and, at worst, contrary to the kind of economy they desire. Prices continue to rise, ""affordability"" is the word of the moment, and consumers are frustrated with the lack of it everywhere they look.

""They had a theory of the case of how the economy would evolve earlier this year,"" says Mike Konczal, senior director of policy and research at the Economic Policy Institute, an economic think tank. The administration thought mass deportations would open up jobs for American workers, DOGE-driven government layoffs would push workers toward private-sector roles, and tariffs would incentivize a manufacturing boom and reshoring. Thus far, most of it hasn't been working out. ""Even nonpolitical people are aware that something's floundering here,"" Konczal says.

Trump, who rode to the White House in no small part on a promise to bring down costs, is scrambling to refocus. He's floating haphazard policy ideas (economists are generally dubious), claiming prices are already down (somewhat true for select products, very much not true for others), and expressing exasperation at the whole situation.

Voters often blame the guy in the Oval Office for their problems, and right now, that guy is Trump. He's learning a lesson the Biden team did: You can't insist your way to a good economy.

As much as conservatives may not like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mandami, they are paying attention to him, especially his campaign's relentless focus on affordability. Whether or not people agree with the democratic socialists' solutions, the overall message resonates: The rent — and the price of everything else — is too damn high.

Americans in New York and across the country are justified in being miffed. Consumer prices have increased by 25% since 2020. While inflation appeared to be slowing around the middle of 2025, it has picked up again and is on track to end the year at about 3% annual growth. The compounding effect of years of price increases is taking a financial and psychological toll.

""It's that cumulative piece of it,"" says Claudia Sahm, the chief economist at New Century Advisors.

Gas and egg prices have come down from their highs earlier in the year, but the price of coffee, beef, and bananas are going in the other direction. Beyond the grocery store, Ernie Tedeschi, a non-resident senior fellow at the Yale Budget Lab, explains that the price of durable goods — think furniture, appliances, and electronics — increased by 1.5% over the first eight months of the year. During the same period last year, durable goods prices fell by 1%, and there was an expectation that prices for these bigger-ticket items would continue into 2025. ""It's not just that they rose at all, it's that we were expecting a decline,"" Tedeschi says. ""That's not pandemic size, but that's a meaningful increase."" Services prices, such as entertainment and transportation, have continued to rise at an elevated pace, too.

The costs of major essentials are especially daunting for many consumers, including healthcare, childcare, and housing. The median home sales price in the US is over $400,000. Just five years ago, it was much closer to $300,000. Childcare costs families thousands of dollars each year. Healthcare costs are expected to rise steeply for many Americans next year.

""People are broadly feeling pretty negative about the economy,"" says Joanne Hsu, the director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. They're ""perfectly aware"" that inflation rates have fallen, she says, but even if goods aren't rising in price quite as fast, consumers can still remember the old sticker price, which is aggravating. Add on the fact that because of tariffs, many people don't think we're out of the woods when it comes to price hikes, either.

Another factor Hsu thinks is worth noting: weakening incomes. People are worried about their job security, the labor market, and their current paychecks. Twenty-nine percent of respondents to the University of Michigan's November survey mentioned softer incomes as a negative factor in their personal finances, compared to 20% the month before. Average wages for most workers are still outpacing inflation, but the job market is stagnant, and many workers are stuck in place.

""The most visible part of this low-hire, low-fire job market is entry level workers being like, 'Oh my God, I've done 5,000 interviews and all I got is this lousy T-shirt,' but the other, smaller violin is people who were job-hopping to get raises for the last few years who just can't do that,"" says Michael Madowitz, the principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank. ""That's actually neither great for them nor for their employers.""

The TL;DR here is people are tired of being surprised at how expensive everything is and increasingly annoyed that their paychecks aren't going as far, too. A Washington Post-ABC News-Pisos poll from October found that 71% of American adults say they're spending more money on groceries compared to a year ago. Many consumers have hoped prices would fall — they don't realize that, in many cases, the best they can hope for is for them to stop rising so much.

""As a former Biden administration official, I will tell you we learned the hard way that consumers do not distinguish between price levels and inflation,"" Tedeschi says.

When people get angry, they look for someone to blame. This time around, that's Trump: the WaPo-ABC poll found 59% think the president is at fault for the current rate of inflation. A Quinnipiac poll from October found that just 38% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of the economy, his lowest point since February 2017.

""I think the American people realize that's just not a priority for this administration,"" Konczal says.

Trump, who campaigned on ""making America affordable again,"" has struggled to counter the disillusionment. Speaking with reporters in early November, Trump touted the reduced cost of this year's Walmart Thanksgiving basket while overlooking that the 2025 edition includes fewer items and brushing aside concerns about prices, at one point declaring, ""I don't want to hear about the affordability."" Days later, Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, in an interview on ABC News' ""This Week,"" said that the administration is making ""substantial progress"" and that prices will come down ""over the coming months and next year."" In a subsequent interview with Fox News, Bessent said the administration would seek to lower coffee and banana prices ""very quickly,"" and at the end of the week, the president signed an executive order dropping reciprocal tariffs on food items such as beef, coffee, and avocados. The White House has also announced deals to cut the prices of weight-loss drugs.

In a post-Mamadani election scramble, Trump has floated a flurry of ideas that could be seen as addressing the cost-of-living problem. There's the idea of sending out $2,000 checks to low- and middle-income Americans as a tariff rebate and making 50-year mortgages a thing. Many economists and real-estate analysts aren't sold on these propositions. Congress would need to agree to send out the checks, and projected tariff revenues wouldn't be enough to cover them. Half-century mortgages would mean homebuyers pay significantly more overall interest and take longer to build equity. It could also increase demand for homes, in turn increasing prices and adding stress to an already crunched supply if we don't end up building more homes.

Even more Trump-friendly voices are doing some sign-tapping around affordability. Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Brett Baier have pressed the president on the issue, asking him to respond to concerns — which he's largely dismissed — about prices. In an interview with CNN, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was up front about her own experience as a consumer. ""I go to the grocery store myself,"" she said. ""Grocery prices remain high. Energy prices are high. My electricity bills are higher here in Washington, DC, at my apartment, and they're also higher at my house in Rome, Georgia.""

In a statement to Business Insider, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that ""cleaning up Joe Biden's inflation and economic disaster has been a top focus since Day One."" He cited lower prices on gas and eggs and touted measures like a ""historic drug pricing deal"" on GLP-1 drugs. ""The Trump administration will continue to implement and emphasize these and other economic policies that are cutting costs, raising real wages, and securing trillions in investments to make and hire in America,"" he said.

Trump, like Biden, finds himself trying to convince a highly skeptical public that the economy is better than meets the eye. Consumers may not know the exact price of everything they buy at the grocery store, but they are aware that their weekly basket is getting pricier. Some consumers are buying less and smaller in order to cut costs, or taking on credit card debt to make ends meet. To some extent, they're taking the White House's advice, albeit not by choice — they are buying less, they are sacrificing.

Admittedly, the price puzzle is a hard one to solve. ""There's no low-hanging fruit here, especially on something like housing,"" Sahm says. Housing policy is generally dealt with at the state and local levels, and there's not much the federal government can do. ""You can look to the White House and Congress to actually go after specific price imbalances,"" Sahm says, but it takes thought and effort.

The president has attacked the Federal Reserve and demanded that it lower interest rates. That could help in some areas — such as bringing down mortgage rates and lending rates, etc. But the Fed's is a blunt instrument, not a precise one, and some of Trump's policies may have ultimately stood in its way.

""They would've lowered interest rates more this year if you hadn't unleashed tariffs,"" Sahm says.

The thing about being president is that you get to take credit for the good things, but that also means people give you credit for the bad. Fairly or not, Americans have been viewing the economy as bad for a while now, and it's up to Trump to fix it.

Zohran Mamdani doesn't want you to shop at Starbucks right now.

The New York City mayor-elect is urging people not to patronize the iconic coffee chain while baristas remain on strike.

""Starbucks workers across the country are on an Unfair Labor Practices strike, fighting for a fair contract,"" Mamdani wrote on X on Thursday evening. ""While workers are on strike, I won't be buying any Starbucks, and I'm asking you to join us.""

The open-ended strike coincided with Red Cup Day, when the chain offers free reusable holiday cups to customers. Historically, it's driven record sales for the company.

On Thursday, when the strike began, roughly 1,000 workers across 65 stores were expected to strike, according to the union.

The work stoppage could expand to more than 500 stores if negotiations do not resume, the union said in a statement on Thursday. In the US, Starbucks has 16,864 stores, according to its most recent earnings report.

Unionized stores represent roughly 9,500 baristas, or 4% of the retail labor force, according to a Starbucks spokesperson.

The strike comes amid stalled contract negotiations at the coffee giant, and also follows the company's announcement of a restructuring that led to the closure of more than 600 stores across the US.

It's the fourth strike that the union has organized since 2023, and it's the third to have taken place since CEO Brian Niccol began leading the company in September 2024.

""Despite Workers United's efforts to cause disruption, more than 99% of our coffeehouses remain open and our partners delivered the strongest Reusable Red Cup Day in company history, building on last Thursday's holiday launch, which was the biggest sales day ever for the company,"" a spokesperson told Business Insider on Friday.

Mamdani lending support to the striking baristas represents an early indication of how he may use the bully pulpit of his office as mayor of New York City. The Democratic socialist state assemblyman has long positioned himself as an ally to labor.

""Together, we can send a powerful message,"" Mamdani wrote on Thursday. ""No contract, no coffee.""

It's not the only hint as to Mamdani's plans for office to have surfaced this week.

The NYC mayor-elect could be seen with his arms around Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former FTC Commissioner Lina Khan, a member of his transition team, in a photo shared on social media on Friday.

In the caption, Mamdani wrote: ""In the fight for working people, you find good company.""

Warren had repeatedly praised Mamdani ahead of the NYC mayoral election, touting his focus on affordability. On Friday, she also expressed her support for the striking Starbucks baristas in a post on X.

""While the Starbucks CEO rolls around in his millions, the workers who actually make your coffee are struggling to get by,"" Warren wrote. ""Workers at world's largest coffee chain deserve a fair contract.""

New York City's next mayor, Zohran Mamdani, promised free childcare to New Yorkers. New Mexico might be writing the blueprint.

New Mexico's new policy, which took effect on November 1, made childcare access universal to parents across the state by eliminating income limits and copays for childcare. Childcare workers are also slated to get a raise.

It could be a model for New York City. Mamdani proposed expanding childcare in the city, starting with creating more slots for kids from six weeks to 5 years old. Some of the city's business executives agreed with his proposal for universal childcare, even if they opposed many of his plans aimed at boosting affordability.

Childcare has increasingly outpaced inflation and forced families to find other cost-effective solutions to day care deserts. Previously, New Mexican parents ineligible for full subsidies were paying an average of $12,00 a year per child. The state's government aims to boost its economy by putting money back into the pockets of parents.

""That's huge to a family's budget,"" said Julie Kashen, senior fellow and director for women's economic justice at The Century Foundation, a progressive, nonpartisan think tank. ""That makes a really big difference in what else they can afford, what they can save for the future, how they can get out of debt.""

It also allows parents to go to work with peace of mind, Kashen added. Without reliable childcare, parents call out of work when their kids are sick or have a day off school. For working parents, ""childcare is the backbone of our economy,"" she said.

One of Mamdani's first challenges — and a challenge to any state or city aiming to expand childcare — is finding funding. His plan is to raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers and on corporations.

Natural resources set New Mexico's funding apart from other cities and states, giving it an advantage in paying for its universal childcare program. As the second-biggest crude oil producer in the country, tax revenue from fracking totaled over $11 billion last year. Oil and natural gas revenue allow the state to invest in its over $30 billion permanent fund for childcare.

The fund is valued at about $10 billion this year and is expected to grow year-over-year to $12.6 billion.

For a similar program in New York City, the Mamdani campaign estimated the cost would be around $6 billion. This would expand the city's free preschool program for 4-year-olds and 3-year-olds.

To bolster employment in the childcare industry, New Mexico also bumped up the minimum wage to $18 per hour for childcare workers, $6 above the state minimum wage. The pay can be enticing for prospective workers, as median wages for childcare workers are lower than 97% of all other jobs.

""They get paid less than dishwashers and dog walkers,"" said Hailey Gibbs, the associate director for early childhood policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan progressive policy institute.

Gibbs explained that direct compensation, healthcare, and retirement benefits will attract more workers to the industry. Current childcare workers are already dedicated to the industry, and strengthening their economic outlook may keep them from looking for jobs elsewhere, she said.

""They don't do it for the money because there isn't money,"" Gibbs said. ""They do it because they're passionate about it, because they care deeply about their communities and the families that they work with.""

In the New York City metropolitan area, median wages for day care workers sit at $18.09 per hour, well below the $28.55 median wage for the metro area. These same workers have the lowest personal income of all other care workers in the city, according to a report from Brad Lander, the city's comptroller. Mamdani has also proposed matching pay with NYC Schools teachers' salaries, around $70,000 for new employees.

Back in 2023, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made an observation about his company:

""I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work,"" he said during a company Q&A session, The Verge reported at the time.

Then came the great flattening. Companies from Meta to Citi began to cull their ranks of middle managers.

Now, the AI age is offering a new twist to the story of middle management.

""I think you're just going to see a different modality within a company, which is an agent manager,"" Jeanne DeWitt Grosser, the chief operating officer at Vercel, told Business Insider.

Agents have become one of the central innovations of 2025. They're commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.

Companies are racing to implement them to help them work faster. Vercel, a $9.3 billion cloud-based developer platform founded in 2015, recently trained an AI agent on its best-performing sales representative. The machine is so effective that the company downsized its 10-person sales team to a single top performer and moved the remaining nine to a different team.

Managing a team of agents requires different skills from managing a team of people.

""You have to understand where you want to go, what the North Star is, what excellence looks like, and be able to explain that to someone,"" Grosser said about managing people. It's a job that typically requires years of experience and a healthy dose of tact. 

Becoming an AI agent manager might have a lower barrier to entry, though it requires different technical skills.

""The future is you might graduate from college and you're a manager now,"" she said. ""We're all going to have to learn to delegate, to break down tasks, etcetera, to produce the type of output that you want from your agent teammate.""

Grosser didn't say whether Vercel will be posting a job like this anytime soon, but said it's something the company is ""contemplating.""

Last month, Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr.com, an online community for founders of SaaS and B2B companies, posted on LinkedIn that the first $200,000 sales development representative role is ""coming.""

The job involves managing ""10+ AI SDR agents"" and requires a candidate to be ""pretty technical,"" he wrote.

Saurabh Sarbaliya, the chief technology officer and AI lead at PwC, told Business Insider that companies will likely try to train their existing workforce to take on this kind of role before recruiting external candidates.

""I need our existing workforce to be able to become agent managers,"" he said. ""We need to be able to actually go and up-skill our people on how to actually go and become good agent managers,"" he said.

Good agent managers should be able to train agents, give them context, review their behavior, and design workflows that are very ""intentional,"" he said. That includes requiring an agent to consult a human before it goes on to execute specific actions, he said.

Chinese shoppers are returning to luxury. Top executives from Prada, Coach, EssilorLuxottica and Value Retail told CNBC they're seeing demand in China stabilize after months of weakness, even as the broader luxury sector continues to report softer spending among Chinese consumers at home and overseas.

China was on track to become the world's largest luxury market during the coronavirus pandemic, but the sector has slowed sharply since then. High youth unemployment, a prolonged property downturn and weaker household confidence have weighed on discretionary purchases, particularly among middle-income shoppers.

Speaking to CNBC's Charlotte Reed at the JPMorgan Global Luxury and Brands Conference in Paris, France, executives said they are beginning to see a change in spending patterns. Andrea Bonini, chief financial officer of Prada Group, said the company is ""cautiously optimistic.""

""We do see things stabilizing, indeed,"" Bonini told CNBC, adding that ""the structural trends in this industry are still there, and are still there in China as well.""

Prada's CFO said a more ""normalized"" backdrop may only emerge in 2026 after the sharp swings that followed the pandemic.

Coach is also seeing strong momentum. CEO and brand president Todd Khan told CNBC: ""We had a fabulous quarter. Our China business grew by 20%,"" a trend he said has held for several quarters. Coach's positioning has helped attract a more cautious consumer, he said, adding: ""Our sweet spot in China, particularly if the consumer is more cautious, really resonates.""

The company is deepening its on-the-ground presence, with 25 years in the market, co-design studios in China, and expansion in regional hubs such as Wuhan. Coach has also been somewhat insulated from U.S. tariff exposure.

""So, 40% of our growth is international. So, for international, those U.S. tariffs that you're referencing have no impact,"" Khan said.

Recent earnings support that view. UBS research shows Burberry's Greater China sales rose 3% last quarter, beating expectations for flat growth, while Richemont said sales to Chinese customers were ""almost flat"" — a sharp improvement from earlier double-digit declines. UBS added that Richemont delivered 10% APAC growth and saw improving momentum into year-end.

LVMH, for its part, has pointed to early signs of stabilization. Last month, the luxury giant reported 1% growth in the third quarter — its first quarterly increase this year — with CFO Cécile Cabanis telling analysts that ""mainland China turned positive in Q3,"" according to Reuters.

Still, analysts have warned against assuming a full rebound.

Chiara Battistini, JPMorgan's head of European luxury, told CNBC it is ""early to call it a turnaround and a complete inflection,"" noting that the apparent improvement came against ""a particularly easy"" comparison base. Some of the uplift, she said, reflected spending being repatriated back into mainland China rather than a broad-based acceleration.

The overall picture across the ""total Chinese consumer"" in Asia remained ""more mixed,"" Battistini said, with China's macro backdrop still ""quite complex.""

Global brands are being pushed to localize far more aggressively as competition from Chinese labels intensifies. As CNBC's Evelyn Cheng reported a few weeks ago, many are increasing China-focused marketing — in some cases to more than 40% of revenue, according to WPIC's Jacob Cooke — while speeding up product cycles and tailoring designs using local consumer data. 

The rise of social media platforms Xiaohongshu and Douyin has also forced companies to rethink content and product strategy.

The change is slowly trickling down to retailers and big luxury companies that are seeing modest growth from the region. Outlet operator Value Retail has seen solid traction. Chairman Scott Malkin said the company's China properties ""are going very well right now,"" noting that global brands had encouraged the company to expand into China to ensure the ""correct presentation of authentic surplus.""

Malkin said outlets continue to attract the ""aspirational buyer who will become a full-price customer again in a different moment.""

The same holds true for eyewear group EssilorLuxottica, that is reporting broad-based growth too. CFO Stefano Grassi said: ""We were double digit in North America, double digits in Europe, and double digits in Asia.""

""We see consumer not trading down. We see consumers attracted by product innovation,"" Grassi said. Luxury bosses agree China is stabilizing, but not yet rebounding.

With brands reshaping strategy and analysts urging caution, the recovery remains a slow grind. Still, as Prada's Bonini said, the ""structural trends"" powering Chinese luxury haven't gone away — they're just taking longer to re-emerge.

Paris Hilton is successful many times over. The reality TV star turned entrepreneur is the founder and CEO of 11:11 Media, a global entertainment company she aims to become ""the next Disney"" that combines her passions in music, beauty, fashion and philanthropy.

But people haven't always believed in her business savvy.

""For a long time, I felt like people had an idea of who I was that didn't reflect the real me,"" Hilton told CNBC Make It over email following an appearance at the American Express Leadership Academy. ""Early in my career, I leaned into the character I created on 'The Simple Life,' but behind the scenes, I was laser-focused on building my brand.""

Now, the multi-hyphenate and CNBC Changemaker says she's been able to ""take back my narrative"" through career achievements like launching her company in 2021 and using her platform to advocate for kids in what's known as the ""troubled teen industry.""

""I've learned that the best way to overcome being underestimated is to let your work speak for itself and to show up authentically,"" Hilton said.

The businesswoman said authenticity is a key trait in the people she decides to work with, in addition to being passionate and creative. ""And kindness is non-negotiable for me,"" Hilton added. ""It shows people's true character, and I want my brand and everyone who represents it to lead with kindness.""

Authenticity also guides her philanthropy. ""Every cause I champion comes from my lived experience, and I would never fight for something I didn't believe in wholeheartedly,"" she said.

In recent years, Hilton has used her spotlight to advocate for children harmed by America's child welfare, juvenile justice, education and health-care systems. Last year, she appeared before Congress and helped to pass the bipartisan Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act.

Hilton encouraged other young entrepreneurs to meaningfully integrate philanthropy into their work. ""Impact shouldn't be an afterthought; it should be part of your mission from the very beginning,"" Hilton said, adding that the second hire she made for her company was 11:11 Media's head of impact Rebecca Grone.

""I'd also encourage young entrepreneurs to think creatively about impact and truly listen to the communities they want to serve,"" Hilton said. ""When you have a platform or influence, you can inspire your audience to take action alongside you, and that's a powerful way to create lasting change.""

The U.S. stock market continues to be volatile due to concerns about valuations of tech and artificial intelligence stocks and an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. Given this scenario, investors seeking passive income can add some dividend stocks to their portfolios.

At the same time, investors might find it challenging to pick the right stock from the vast universe of dividend-paying companies. In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors select attractive dividend stocks with strong fundamentals. These experts assign their ratings after in-depth analysis of a company's financials and growth potential.

Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

First on this week's list is Diamondback Energy (FANG), an independent energy company focused on onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. The company recently reported better-than-expected third-quarter results. Diamondback returned $892 million of capital to shareholders (50% of adjusted free cash flow) via share repurchases and dividends in the third quarter. It declared a base cash dividend of $1.00 per share for the period, payable on Nov. 20. At an annualized dividend of $4 per share, FANG offers a yield of 2.8%.

In reaction to the third-quarter print, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on Diamondback stock with a price forecast of $173. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on FANG stock with an ""outperform"" rating and a price target of $156.

Hanold continues to view Diamondback as a core long-term holding in the energy space, given that it stands out with one of the top core inventory durations in the Permian Basin and the lowest breakeven levels of $37 to $38 per barrel (WTI, unhedged, and inclusive of capitalized costs).

""FANG remains among the most resilient E&P, with leading edge operational, capital, and production performance,"" said Hanold.

The 5-star analyst expects Diamondback to gain from the renewed gas-fired power prospects in the Permian Basin, supported by its strong footprint and natural gas exposure. Hanold noted that FANG is a part of the Competitive Power Ventures project, where the company has agreed to supply 50 million cubic feet per day to a 1,350-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine. He added that management is optimistic about securing more power/data center deals.

Hanold ranks No. 69 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.2%. 

Hanold is also bullish on another dividend-paying energy company, Permian Resources (PR). The independent oil and gas company delivered upbeat earnings for the third quarter, citing its dominance in the Delaware Basin. Permian declared a base dividend of 15 cents per share for the fourth quarter, payable on Dec. 31. At an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share, PR stock offers a yield of 4.5%.

Impressed by the results, Hanold reaffirmed a buy rating on Permian Resources stock with a price target of $18. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on PR stock with a price target of $14.50.

The top-rated analyst stated that continued ""proficient operational and financial performance has become a hallmark"" for Permian, which he believes the company can continue in the years ahead. Hanold highlighted PR's robust operational performance that reflected a solid growth in organic production with no increase in spending.

Hanold noted that the implied fourth-quarter oil guidance is up 2% to 3% from the prior consensus forecast. Accordingly, he now expects 188 Mb/d (oil) for the fourth quarter, which is 3% above his previous estimate. The analyst added that management seems confident about keeping capital spending steady at current levels while generating solid free cash flow, with dividend payment supported even at around $40 per barrel.

Additionally, Hanold sees the possibility of an increase in Permian's fixed dividend in early 2026. He also expects the company to make opportunistic stock buybacks. The analyst expects Permian to use the remaining free cash flow to further bolster an already solid balance sheet (0.8x leverage ratios). 

Finally, let's look at Duke Energy (DUK), an energy holding company that generates and distributes electricity and natural gas. The company recently reported better-than-anticipated adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter, citing the implementation of new rates and riders, along with increased retail sales volumes.

Last month, Duke Energy declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.065 per share, payable on Dec. 16. At an annualized dividend of $4.26 per share, DUK stock offers a yield of 3.4%.

Noting the third-quarter performance, Evercore analyst Nicholas Amicucci reaffirmed a buy rating on DUK stock with a price target of $143. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on Duke Energy stock with a price target of $135.

Amicucci noted Duke Energy's strong third-quarter results and an early look into its updated capital plan expected to be announced in February 2026. Notably, the company mentioned a $95 billion to $105 billion plan for 2026 to 2030, with an equity funding target of 30% to 50%.

Furthermore, the 5-star analyst highlighted that management sees continued momentum into the next year, expecting to turn large load economic opportunities into tangible projects with signed energy service agreements. Amicucci added that Duke Energy is well-positioned to add at least 8.5 gigawatt of new dispatchable generation across its service areas, including about 1 GW of uprates and 7.5 GW of new natural gas assets.

Overall, Amicucci remains bullish on Duke's future growth, driven by its premium service areas, solid pipeline of new projects, and the fact that about 90% of its electric capital spending qualifies for efficient-recovery mechanisms, ""alleviating seemingly all regulatory lag.""

Amicucci ranks No. 693 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 79% of the time, delivering an average return of 48.1 %.

In this article

DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is swapping its 1950s ""Glass House"" headquarters for a new, modern industrial facility to promote collaboration and better appease thousands of employees who have returned to offices in recent years after remote working.

The new 2.1-million-square-foot facility in Dearborn, Michigan, is ceremoniously opening Sunday, although construction is expected to continue into 2027.

It replaces a 12-story, rectangular-shaped headquarters roughly three miles away in the city that is expected to be demolished. The new building marks Ford's sixth headquarters since its founding in 1903.

Currently nicknamed ""The Hub,"" the new headquarters will consolidate thousands of employees and several prior locations under one — albeit very large — roof. It is eventually expected to be home to up to 4,000 executives and employees involved with daily business operations, design and product development.

From an operational basis, the new headquarters is roughly split evenly between design and industrial operations. Design includes massive studios with hidden courtyards and a large showroom. The other half is set to be used for general business operations such as executive offices and common work and meeting areas.

There are very few actual offices outside of those for top executives, according to the company. The idea is for employees to be able to work as they choose in different areas, or ""neighborhoods,"" depending on what they're working on that day, officials said. Domain staking, where employees attempt to make a space their permanent workplace, will be discouraged, said Jennifer Kolstad, global design and brand director for Ford Land, the automaker's property management group.

""It's not just a building. This is a space that is a tool for our employees to be more productive, to be more collaborative, and really help deliver the Ford+ plan,"" said Jim Dobleske, Ford Land chair and CEO, during a tour of the building.

The Ford+ plan was introduced by CEO Jim Farley as a turnaround and efficiency plan for the automaker in 2021.

As of the end of last year, Ford employed roughly 30,500 white-collar salaried workers in the U.S. The company continues to own or utilize other properties throughout the U.S., including large bases in Dearborn and surrounding areas.

Many salaried employees are expected in offices at least four days a week, as of earlier this year, after many of them had a more loose hybrid office-home schedule following the end of the pandemic.

""We're inviting them back into a space that is a tool to help them do their best work. And that best work tends to come with collaboration with other teams,"" Dobleske said.

Some of that collaboration is expected to occur over food.

The new headquarters includes a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight ""kitchen concepts"" that will feature rotating menus as well as take-home options such as pizza and $6 whole rotisserie chickens, decadent desserts and a juice bar complete with a herb garden.

""We have guests coming in from all over the world, so we wanted to make sure we have designed our menus to kind of play homage to that diversity,"" said Grant Vella, executive chef for the new ]headquarters. ""We wanted to do something different, push the boundary of business dining.""

Outside of the kitchens and dining areas, vegetation and outdoor spaces are meant to make for a more walkable-friendly campus compared with the automaker's prior, largely street- and parking lot-locked facility.

""This headquarters is the cornerstone of our campus redevelopment, but there's been a tremendous amount of work that we have done throughout the campus to really connect it and make it much more walkable for our employees,"" Dobleske said, pointing to several facilities and areas, including a test track and 18-acre ""Horsepower Park,"" surrounding the building.

Inside the building are six courtyards, including a dual-level one at the center of the company's new design studios to allow designers to take products outside to view them outdoors in natural light. Those design courtyards are exclusive areas that can only be viewed by the surrounding, private studios.

Most of the four-story building features outside natural light from the exterior glass walls as well as skylights and other windowed areas.

In addition to making a more walkable exterior campus, Ford wants employees to use purposefully designed stairs rather than elevators and escalators that are the primary modes of transportation in its most-recent 12-story headquarters.

Craig Dykers, founding partner of Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta that worked on the building, said each staircase in the building, especially in its 14 different arrival areas, are prominent and meant to be inviting to use.

""Obviously people don't naturally want to climb a stair, so you have to design it very carefully so that people feel good about using the stair,"" he said. ""Part of the trick is that as you go up one flight, you don't necessarily see the next flight, so it's kind of a journey.""

Stairs inside the main lobby of the building are extremely wide and feature seating areas alongside the actual low-rise stairs. There's also a coffee bar on a large landing above the main lobby.

The coffee bar overlooks a white artwork that features vehicle parts — one of many prominent pieces of art Ford purchased or has curated for the new facility. Others are photos or drawings of vehicles, while some are simply non-automotive artistic pieces.

Inside the company's design operations are large studios with advanced clay milling machines, a spacious showroom that will operate as a modern design dome and a 64-foot screen showing virtual reviews and testing.

What employees will not see much of is the company's logo, the well-known blue oval surrounding the ""Ford"" name. There will be a massive Ford blue oval logo on the outside of the building but not on its interior. Unless you look closely.

On some exterior glass walls, such as the company's design operations, there's a glass pattern that features the ovals accompanied by hidden numbers that represent Ford patents.

Ford declined to discuss the capital spent to build its new headquarters and design center, which was part of a previously announced $1 billion campus transformation that began under former CEO Jim Hackett, who previously led furniture company Steelcase.

Here's a look inside the new world headquarters:

As more companies brazenly declare AI-driven layoffs in 2025, the first jobs on the chopping block appear to be junior positions and entry-level jobs.

Graduate schemes and internships are at risk of becoming a thing of the past as major firms slash headcount in a push to deploy AI. Recently, Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees as it aims to invest in its ""biggest bets"" which includes generative AI.

Other companies that are leaning on AI and cutting jobs include Accenture, Salesforce, Lufthansa and Duolingo.

Now, concerns are mounting over whether AI can do the work of entry-level workers and graduates, thereby raising the barrier for entry.

In fact, 62% of U.K. employers expect that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will most likely be lost to AI, according to a new survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)

And further data shows that the number of graduate roles available has declined in the past year. In the U.S., postings for entry-level jobs have declined about 35% since January 2023, per data from labor research firm Revelio Labs.

In the U.K., the Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that just under 17,000 graduate vacancies in the U.K. had received 1.2 million applications highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people.

As companies cut back on hiring junior workers, Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at Oxford Internet Institute, pointed out that recruiting entry-level workers is actually an ""investment"" in the future.

Although they tend to make mistakes and require hands-on training, experts told CNBC why replacing junior workers with AI will actually backfire on companies in the long-term.

Healthy organizations cultivate their own talent and it's not feasible to hire for all positions externally, according to Chris Eldridge, UKI and North America CEO of tech recruitment firm Robert Walters

""If you remove too many junior roles, you can starve the internal talent pipeline,"" Eldridge said.

""Entry-level, junior-level roles are the breeding ground for the leadership of the future. I think if you overcut that junior layer, you will have a talent bottleneck at some point in the business that leads invariably to an increase in hiring costs.""

If a company doesn't have enough young talent, it will be forced to hire from the outside in the future and will create a ""talent doom cycle"" which will result in increased costs, salary inflation, and a dependency on the external talent market.

""I represent a talent consultancy, however, we would advise every organization to have several routes to talent in the market, and one of them is to create your own,"" Eldridge said.

""Also talent retention is very important through the training development and opportunities you can give people… but you're missing a significant aspect of growth if you shut down the pipeline on bringing junior or entry-level talent into an organization,"" he added.

Companies that don't nurture young talent will eventually lose touch with consumers and mainstream culture, according to Oxford Internet Institute's Stephany.

""A firm is part of society, and if it doesn't reflect society adequately, it's very hard for me to imagine a business model or product that doesn't need this generational bridge…and young people bring in fresh ideas that bring a new perspective,"" Stephany said to CNBC Make It.

Firms that fail to adapt and hire junior employees will become ""like an elderly homes company,"" Stephany said. ""It's like a company of soon to be retired people because… they might not have the edge and the vibe that you need to bring in a new product to the market.""

Eldridge agreed noting that there's a stereotype that all good ideas come from the top but ""a very healthy percentage of great ideas in the company come from people within their first two or three years in an organization because they see it with fresh eyes.""

An additional bonus of having young people in an organization is the opportunity for reverse mentoring, particularly as young people bring a crucial knowledge of technology, and losing that would be a ""genuine threat"" to organizations.

""If anything erodes that opportunity for mentorship both ways and that knowledge transfer both ways, it will drive down institutional knowledge or create institutional gaps,"" he said.

Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, told CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange"" last week that the tech firm plans to hire 11,000 interns in the age of AI in order to upskill the next generation but also bring fresh new ideas.

""50-year-old CEOs like myself aren't going to be the ones to teach companies how to take advantage of AI. We need to learn from the next generation,"" Prince said.

""Tacit knowledge"" is an important element to keeping an organization healthy, according to Stephany. It refers to the implicit and unspoken information about a company's culture that colleagues' share.

""There are so many things that make a company work that are nowhere to be written down,"" he said. ""They emerge from the network of people, those people that sit sometimes in the cafeteria that say 'I've been with the company for 25 years, I can explain you what what's going on, why X has a problem with Y.

""That's the type of company wisdom of tacit knowledge that's a lubricant for the economic wellbeing of the company,"" he said.

Robert Walters' Eldridge added that young people are sponges and ""absorb the best of a business"" including this type of tacit knowledge that can only be passed on through people.

""They're the culture carriers of the future as well so if you're not bringing that cohort in that what does that mean down the road in terms of culture?""

""I think businesses rely on that upwards pressure, where you bring in a cohort of inexperienced people, they are hungry, they want to learn. They ask an awful lot to organizations, which sometimes test them and keeps a company on its toes. if you don't have that it could potentially end up being a detriment to the culture and to the performance of an organization,"" Eldridge added.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

As winter's chill settles in across the U.S., and electricity bills become a bigger budgeting issue, most Americans will rely on their usual sources of warmth, such as home heating oil, natural gas, and electric furnaces. But in a few cases, crypto is generating the heat, and if some of the nascent crypto heat industry's proponents are correct, someday its use as a source within homes and buildings will be much more widespread.

Let's start with the basics: the computing power of crypto mining generates a lot of heat, most which just ends up vented into the air. According to digital assets brokerage, K33, the bitcoin mining industry generates about 100 TWh of heat annually — enough to heat all of Finland. This energy waste within a very energy-intense industry is leading entrepreneurs to look for ways to repurpose the heat for homes, offices, or other locations, especially in colder weather months.

During a frigid snap earlier this year, The New York Times reviewed HeatTrio, a $900 space heater that also doubles as a bitcoin mining rig. Others use the heat from their own in-home cryptocurrency mining to spread warmth throughout their house.

""I've seen bitcoin rigs running quietly in attics, with the heat they generate rerouted through the home's ventilation system to offset heating costs. It's a clever use of what would otherwise be wasted energy,"" said Jill Ford, CEO of Bitford Digital, a sustainable bitcoin mining company based in Dallas. ""Using the heat is another example of how crypto miners can be energy allies if you apply some creativity to their potential,"" Ford said.

It's not necessarily going to save someone money on their electric bill — the economics will vary greatly from place to place and person to person, based on factors including local electricity rates and how fast a mining machine is — but the approach might make money to offset heating costs.

""Same price as heating the house, but the perk is that you are mining bitcoin,"" Ford said.

A single mining machine — even an older model — is sufficient. Solo miners can join mining pools to share computing power and receive proportional payouts, making returns more predictable and changing the economic equation.  

""The concept of using crypto mining or GPU compute to heat homes is clever in theory because almost all the energy consumed by computation is released as heat,"" said Andrew Sobko, founder of Argentum AI, which is creating a marketplace for the sharing of computing power. But he added that the concept makes the most sense in larger settings, particularly in colder climates or high-density buildings, such as data centers, where compute heat shows real promise as a form of industrial-scale heat recapture.

To make it work — it's not like you can transport the heat somewhere by truck or train — you have to identity where the computing heat is needed and route it to that place, such as co-locating GPUs in environments from industrial parks to residential buildings.

""We're working with partners who are already redirecting compute heat into building heating systems and even agricultural greenhouse warming. That's where the economics and environmental benefits make real sense,"" Sobko said. ""Instead of trying to move the heat physically, you move the compute closer to where that heat provides value,"" he added.

There are plenty of skeptics.

Derek Mohr, clinical associate professor at the University of Rochester Simon School of Business, does not think the future of home heating lies in crypto and says even industrial crypto is problematic.

Bitcoin mining is so specialized now that a home computer, or even network of home computers, would have almost zero chance of being helpful in mining a block of bitcoin, according to Mohr, with mining farms use of specialized chips that are created to mine bitcoin much faster than a home computer.

""While bitcoin mining at home — and in networks of home computers — was a thing that had small success 10 years ago, it no longer is,"" Mohr said.

""The bitcoin heat devices I have seen appear to be simple space heaters that use your own electricity to heat the room ... which is not an efficient way to heat a house,"" he said. ""Yes, bitcoin mining generates a lot of heat, but the only way to get that to your house is to use your own electricity,"" Mohr said.

He added that while running your computer non-stop would generate heat, it has a very low probability of successfully mining a bitcoin block.

""In my opinion, this is not a real opportunity that will work. Instead it is taking advantage of things people have heard of — excess heat from bitcoin mining and profits from mining — and is giving false hope that there is a way for an individual to benefit from this,"" Mohr said.

But some experts say more widespread use of plug-and-play, free-standing mining rigs, might make the concept viable in more locations over time. In the least, they say it is worth studying the dual use economic and environmental benefits based on the underlying fact that crypto mining generates significant heat as a byproduct of the computer processing.

""How can we capture the excess heat from the operation to power something else? That could range from heating a home to warming water, even in a swimming pool. As a result, your operating efficiency is higher on your power consumption,"" said Nikki Morris, the executive director of the Texas Christian University Ralph Lowe Energy Institute.

She says the concept of crypto heating is still in its earliest stages, and most people don't yet understand how it works or what the broader implications could be. ""That's part of what makes it so interesting. At Texas Christian University, we see opportunities to help people build both the vocabulary and the business use feasibility with industry partners,"" Morris said.

Because crypto mining produces a digital asset that can be traded, it introduces a new source of revenue from power consumption, and the power source could be anything from the grid to natural gas to solar to wind or battery generation, according to Morris. She cited charging an electric vehicle at mixed-use buildings or apartment complexes as an example.

""Picture a similar scenario where an apartment complex's crypto mining setup produces both digital currency and usable heat energy. That opens the door to distributed energy innovation to a broader stakeholder base, an approach that could complement existing heating systems and renewable generation strategies,"" Morris said.

There are many questions to explore, including efficiency at different scales, integration with other energy sources, regulatory considerations, and overall environmental impact, ""but as these technologies evolve, it's worth viewing crypto heating not just as a curiosity, but as a small window into how digital and physical energy systems might increasingly converge in the future,"" Morris said.

The crypto-heated future may be unfolding in the town of Challis, Idaho, where Cade Peterson's company, Softwarm, is repurposing bitcoin heat to ward off the winter.

Several shops and businesses in town are experimenting with Softwarm's rigs to mine and heat. At TC Car, Truck and RV Wash, Peterson says, the owner was spending $25 a day to heat his wash bays to melt snow and warm up the water.

""Traditional heaters would consume energy with no returns. They installed bitcoin miners and it produces more money in bitcoin than it costs to run,"" Peterson said. Meanwhile, an industrial concrete company is offsetting its $1,000 a month bill to heat its 2,500-gallon water tank by heating it with bitcoin.

Peterson has heated his own home for two-and-a-half years using bitcoin mining equipment and believes that heat will power almost everything in the future. ""You will go to Home Depot in a few years and buy a water heater with a data port on it and your water will be heated with bitcoin,"" Peterson said.

Gold profits are glittering in 2025 — but cashing in may trigger a bigger tax bill than you might think.

The price of gold futures hit $4,000 per ounce in October, for the first time ever. While the precious metal dropped in price on Friday as part of a broader market decline, year-to-date returns still sat at nearly 50%, with a price around $4,100.

Exchange-traded funds backed by physical gold — like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Gold Trust (IAU), and abrdn Physical Gold Shares ETF (SGOL) — are up by a similar amount.

By comparison, the S&P 500 U.S. stock index is up about 15% in 2025, as of Friday's close.  

Heady returns in 2025 follow a year in which gold recorded its best annual performance since 2010, about 26%, according to the World Gold Council.

But investment profits from physical gold and funds that track gold are taxed differently from those of traditional assets like stocks and bonds, according to tax experts.

Here's a look at more coverage of CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list of top financial advisory firms for 2025:

The upshot is that investors — especially those in the top tax brackets — may pay a higher federal tax rate on gold profits relative to assets like stocks and bonds.

That could leave gold investors with a surprise tax bill.

""I've seen missteps quite a few times, especially this year with the run that gold has had,"" said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, which was No. 69 on the CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025.

""Long-term"" tax rates on investment profits — known as capital gains — are preferential relative to the marginal income tax rates that investors might pay on wages and other income, for example.

For example, the top federal rate on long-term capital gains, 20%, is lower than the top marginal income tax rate, 37%.

Long-term capital gains rates apply when an investor has owned an asset for more than one year.

However, physical gold and funds backed by physical gold are treated as collectibles for tax purposes — and collectibles have a top 28% rate on long-term capital gains.

""There's no getting around that [collectibles rate] just because it's held in an ETF wrapper,"" Lucas said.

This also applies to other precious metals like silver.

Funds that hold gold futures contracts — instead of physical gold — have yet a different tax structure, with a top federal tax rate of 26.8%, said Jeffrey Levine, a certified public accountant and certified financial planner based in St. Louis.

""Just because you have a gold ETF doesn't mean it's going to be taxed exactly the same,"" said Levine, the chief planning officer at Focus Partners Wealth.

In both cases — collectible and futures — investors in the top tax bracket would pay a higher rate on long-term profits than a traditional asset like a stock, he said.

Of course, this tax discussion only applies to gold held in a taxable brokerage account and sold for a profit. It doesn't apply to investors who hold gold ETFs in a tax-preferred retirement account, like an IRA.

There are three long-term capital-gains rates: 0%, 15% and 20%, depending on an investor's annual income.

Short-term capital gains, which apply to assets held for a year or less, are different. Profit on such sales is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, like those that apply to wages, for example. There are seven marginal tax rates, ranging from 10% up to 37%.

Collectibles are taxed like short-term capital gains but are capped at 28%. That means an investor in the 32%, 35% or 37% income tax brackets wouldn't own more than 28% in long-term capital gains on collectibles profits.

Meanwhile, capital gains for futures contracts are assessed based on a 60/40 tax structure, said Levine. That is, 60% of their profits are taxed as long-term capital gains, and the remaining 40% as short-term capital gains.

In the case of gold futures funds, here's how the math works for someone in the top tax bracket: 60% of 20%, which is the top long-term rate for capital gains, is 12%; and 40% of 37%, the top marginal income tax rate, is 14.8%.

Added together, that's a top capital-gains rate of 26.8% for gold futures contracts, Levine said.

While some higher-income investors might think it's a better idea from a tax perspective to buy gold futures funds, there are also downsides, he said.

For example, such investors would get a K-1 tax form since the funds are often structured as partnerships, Levine said. That could make it more challenging and costly to file an annual tax return, he said.

Quantum computers can't break Bitcoin's encryption today, but new advances from Google and IBM suggest the gap is closing faster than expected. Their progress toward fault-tolerant quantum systems raises the stakes for “Q-Day,” the moment when a sufficiently powerful machine could crack older Bitcoin addresses and expose more than $711 billion in vulnerable wallets.

Upgrading Bitcoin to a post-quantum state will take years, which means the work has to begin long before the threat arrives. The challenge, experts say, is that no one knows when that will be, and the community has struggled to agree on how best to move forward with a plan.

This uncertainty has led to a lingering dread that a quantum computer that can attack Bitcoin may come online before the network is ready.

In this article, we will look at the quantum threat to Bitcoin and what needs to change to make the number one blockchain ready.

A successful attack would not look dramatic. A quantum-enabled thief would start by scanning the blockchain for any address that has ever revealed a public key. Old wallets, reused addresses, early miner outputs, and many dormant accounts fall into that category.

The attacker copies a public key and runs it through a quantum computer using Shor's algorithm. Developed in 1994 by mathematician Peter Shor, the algorithm gives a quantum machine the ability to factor large numbers and solve the discrete logarithm problem far more efficiently than any classical computer. Bitcoin's elliptic-curve signatures rely on the difficulty of those problems. With enough error-corrected qubits, a quantum computer could use Shor's method to calculate the private key tied to the exposed public key.

As Justin Thaler, research partner at Andreessen Horowitz and associate professor at Georgetown University, told Decrypt, once the private key is recovered, the attacker can move the coins.

“What a quantum computer could do, and this is what's relevant to Bitcoin, is forge the digital signatures Bitcoin uses today,” Thaler said. “Someone with a quantum computer could authorize a transaction taking all the Bitcoin out of your accounts, or however you want to think of it, when you did not authorize it. That's the worry.”

The forged signature would look real to the Bitcoin network. Nodes would accept it, miners would include it in a block, and nothing on-chain would mark the transaction as suspicious. If an attacker hit a large group of exposed addresses at once, then billions of dollars could move within minutes. Markets would start reacting before anyone ever confirmed that a quantum attack was happening.

In 2025, quantum computing finally started to feel less theoretical and more practical.

Bitcoin's signatures use elliptic-curve cryptography. Spending from an address reveals the public key behind it, and that exposure is permanent. In Bitcoin's early pay-to-public-key format, many addresses published their public keys on-chain even before the first spend. Later pay-to-public-key-hash formats kept the key hidden until the first use.

Because their public keys were never hidden, these oldest coins, including roughly 1 million Satoshi-era Bitcoin, are exposed to future quantum attacks. Switching to post-quantum digital signatures, Thaler said, takes active involvement.

“For Satoshi to protect their coins, they'd have to move them into new post-quantum-secure wallets,” he said. “The biggest concern is abandoned coins, about $180 billion worth, including roughly $100 billion believed to be Satoshi's. Those are huge sums, but they're abandoned, and that's the real risk.”

Adding to the risk are coins tied to lost private keys. Many have sat untouched for more than a decade, and without those keys, they can never be moved into quantum-resistant wallets, making them viable targets for a future quantum computer.

No one can freeze Bitcoin directly on-chain. Practical defenses against future quantum threats focus on migrating vulnerable funds, adopting post-quantum addresses, or managing existing risks.

However, Thaler noted that post-quantum encryption and digital signature schemes come with steep performance costs, since they're far larger and more resource-intensive than today's lightweight 64-byte signatures.

“Today's digital signatures are about 64 bytes. Post-quantum versions can be 10 to 100 times larger,” he said. “In a blockchain, that size increase is a much bigger issue because every node must store those signatures forever. Managing that cost, the literal size of the data, is far harder here than in other systems.”

Developers have floated several Bitcoin Improvement Proposals to prepare for future quantum attacks. They take different paths, from light optional protections to full network migrations.

Taken together, these proposals sketch a step-by-step path to quantum safety: quick, low-impact fixes like P2TRH now, and heavier upgrades like BIP-360 or STARK-based compression as the risk grows. All of them would need broad coordination, and many of the post-quantum address formats and signature schemes are still early in discussion.

Thaler noted that Bitcoin's decentralization—its greatest strength—also makes major upgrades slow and difficult, since any new signature scheme would need broad agreement across miners, developers, and users.

“Two major issues stand out for Bitcoin. First, upgrades take a long time, if they happen at all. Second, there are the abandoned coins. Any migration to post-quantum signatures has to be active, and owners of those old wallets are gone,” Thaler said. “The community must decide what happens to them: either agree to remove them from circulation or do nothing and let quantum-equipped attackers take them. That second path would be legally gray, and the ones seizing the coins likely wouldn't care.”

Most Bitcoin holders don't need to do anything right away. A few habits go a long way in reducing long-term risk, including avoiding reusing addresses so your public key stays hidden until you spend, and sticking with modern wallet formats.

Today's quantum computers aren't close to breaking Bitcoin, and predictions of when they will vary wildly. Some researchers see a threat within the next five years, others push it into the 2030s, but continued investments could speed up the timeline.

Bitcoin has been a top-performing asset in the past.

Despite its phenomenal historical performance, Bitcoin (BTC 2.16%) is having a subpar showing in 2025. As of Nov. 14, the digital asset's price is up just 8%. It's currently trading 25% below its peak from early October as selling pressure drives the narrative.

Investors are thinking about the future. Where will the world's top cryptocurrency go next?

It's anyone's guess where Bitcoin will be trading a year from now. Factors like interest rates, unemployment, Federal Reserve commentary, geopolitical developments, regulatory changes, and crypto and Bitcoin industry trends can all have a sizable impact on price action. These variables are totally unpredictable.

At the end of 2026, Bitcoin could be worth much more than it is today. It's also possible that the digital asset is lower due to another crypto winter happening. 

While it's easy to get caught up in what could happen over the next 12 months, the best investors keep their attention on the next five or 10 years. In the past, Bitcoin has performed exceptionally well over extended periods of time, even though it has been a very volatile asset.

I believe annualized returns going forward will continue to come down, but the gains will still be impressive, as more capital rushes to own a scarce asset. Looking out to 2030 or 2035, Bitcoin should be worth much more.

It takes a lot of electricity to mine Bitcoin.

When electricity costs are high, it can be unprofitable to mine.

The coin has a built-in mechanism to help that situation translate into higher prices.

Putting a valuation on a crypto asset like Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is harder than it sounds. Traditional valuation methods intended for valuing stocks or other assets simply aren't very useful, as the coin has no cash flows or balance sheet.

But there are a few creative ways to figure out if Bitcoin is overpriced or underpriced that don't rely on a gut feeling or a biased impression of recent price action. In fact, one of those valuation methods suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued by around 70%. Let's take a closer look at what the signal is here and whether it means the coin is worth purchasing.

Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue »

As you probably know, Bitcoin is produced by an army of miners. Those miners buy specialized crypto mining hardware, and then operate it, using other inputs like water and electricity along the way to ultimately produce Bitcoins, which the miners can then sell to recoup their costs. Given that the prices of all of these inputs are easily known, it's possible to calculate a ballpark figure for the all-in costs required for a miner to produce a Bitcoin.

From this understanding, it's also possible to estimate the fair value of Bitcoin expressed as a function of the total joules of energy (electricity) expended by miners, in light of the protocol's supply growth rate and a conversion factor that maps energy costs to dollars. In short, more energy committed over time, with all else equal, implies a higher intrinsic value per coin.

One financial model of this dynamic, created by Capriole Investments, suggests that Bitcoin should be priced at around $175,400, as the energy expenses required to mine a single coin are currently on the high side. In the past, the coin's price hasn't strayed too far above or below the value of all the energy required to produce 1 BTC, with deviations between the two typically resolving within 18 months, both to the upside and to the downside. So by Capriole's energy-based valuation methodology, Bitcoin has upside of around 70% or more, as it's currently undervalued. If it behaves like in prior instances of a disconnect between electricity costs and Bitcoin price, this gap won't exist for very long, which suggests that there's an opportunity for those who buy it now.

But there are a few caveats.

Numerous other energy-based valuation methodologies for Bitcoin exist, and they aren't a new approach; some may produce results that disagree with each other as a result of making different assumptions about costs. Furthermore, these models depend on assumptions about average mining hardware efficiency and average electricity costs in the places where mining is performed with the most intensity. So treat these valuations as compasses rather than oracles.

One of the reasons this valuation method is effective is that Bitcoin's mining difficulty self-balances depending on how many miners are participating in the network. The protocol adjusts difficulty every 2,016 blocks to keep average block time near 10 minutes. When the overall mining hash rate falls, mining difficulty then automatically ratchets a bit lower, which reduces the energy required per block and stabilizes miner economics. When hash rate rises, the reverse occurs.

That mechanism links energy input to price through incentives. If price sinks below miners' breakeven level for long enough, weaker operators switch off machines, energy input falls, and the energy value declines toward price. If price rises, more machines come online, the total energy spent climbs, and then it rises toward price.

So, knowing this, is Bitcoin worth buying while it's supposedly on the cheap side? In a word, yes.

This valuation metric points to a good outlook over the next 12 months or so. But beyond that, the picture actually gets better for those who are holding Bitcoin. New issuance drops every halving, which gradually tightens available float. Then, less fresh supply means the same dollar of incremental demand can move price more than before.

While halvings occur about every four years, the takeaway is that accumulating scarce assets when forward supply is shrinking often has a favorable payoff if you can hold through noise. And in Bitcoin's case, the payoff has been quite favorable indeed; its price is up by 502% in the last three years.

Therefore if your investing horizon is years, not weeks, the energy consumption valuation lens strengthens the investment thesis to hold and accumulate this asset. A practical plan is to dollar-cost average (DCA) a fixed amount, then add more on material drawdowns when sentiment is sour.

Before you buy stock in Bitcoin, consider this:

The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Bitcoin wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.

Consider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $599,784!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $1,165,716!*

Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 1,035% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 191% for the S&P 500. Don't miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.

Ethereum might get all the attention from crypto investors, but don't sleep on Solana.

Over the past decade, Ethereum (ETH 4.38%) has been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies in the world. Over that time period, it is up a head-spinning 120,000%.

But there are now a growing number of highly regarded Ethereum challengers, and one of the best is Solana (SOL 4.44%). So which is the better investment right now: the entrenched market incumbent (Ethereum) or the upstart rival (Solana)?

Based on past performance, Ethereum would appear to have the advantage over Solana. Its track record over the past five years is particularly impressive. In 2020, Ethereum skyrocketed by 472%, and then followed that up with an equally stellar 2021, when it soared by 395%. In 2023, Ethereum increased in value by 93%, and followed that up with a robust 46% return in 2024.

The only down year for Ethereum was 2022, when it lost 68% of its value. If you gave up on Ethereum during the crypto winter of 2022, you probably lost everything. But if you held on to your position, you are likely sitting on a hefty profit right now.

Solana has been much more volatile than Ethereum. After launching in 2020, Solana nearly doubled in value. It followed that up with an even more impressive 2021, when it was one of the top crypto performers on the planet, up more than 11,000%. However, in 2022, Solana lost more than 94% of its value. Many gave up on it entirely.

While Solana rebounded with a sizzling 919% return in 2023, and an 86% return in 2024, it no longer looks like the slam-dunk investment it once did. In 2025, Solana is still down nearly 20% for the year.

Here too, Ethereum appears to have the clear advantage. It has become the preferred blockchain of Wall Street, due to its market dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi). And new crypto legislation in the U.S. could make Ethereum even more dominant. That's because Ethereum is far and away the top blockchain when it comes to stablecoins, which have emerged as one of the hottest growth categories in the crypto market.

While Solana shows signs of upending Ethereum's market-leading role in DeFi, it is nowhere close to challenging Ethereum. For example, Ethereum accounts for 63% of all total value locked (TVL), a key metric for measuring DeFi strength. Solana ranks a distant second, with a market share of only 8%.

But there are a few factors that could tip the scales in Solana's favor. One of them is its blazing-fast transaction speeds. While the core Ethereum blockchain can only handle 15-30 transactions per second, Solana just demonstrated the ability to handle 100,000 transactions per second. In November 2023, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest suggested that Solana's superior speed, combined with its lower costs, might be enough to migrate developers, users, and institutions over to Solana.

There's already been evidence of this within the world of DeFi. Ethereum once dominated in terms of 24-hour trading activity on its decentralized exchanges, but Solana surpassed Ethereum in late 2024, and hasn't looked back since. Much of this has to do with a surge of interest in meme coin trading, where Solana is the clear market leader.

Also, in terms of revenue it is creating, Solana is growing at a faster pace than Ethereum. According to a report from 21Shares, the Solana blockchain ecosystem generated nearly $3 billion in revenue over the most recent 12-month period.

It's hard to pick against Ethereum. It has been so good, for so long, and has an obvious first-mover advantage over other Layer-1 blockchain networks such as Solana. For good reason, it is the world's second-most popular cryptocurrency, with a hefty market cap of $410 billion.

But, if cryptocurrencies are valued the way tech stocks are, then investors also need to focus on future growth prospects and future cash flows. And this is where Solana appears to have the edge. Over time, Solana's superior transaction processing speeds should give it an edge in any area where speed matters, including DeFi and artificial intelligence.

If you're investing only for the short term, Ethereum is the no-brainer pick. But if you're investing for the long haul, it's worth giving Solana a closer look. Over time, I'm expecting it to grow at a faster pace than Ethereum, with a good chance to outperform it over the next decade.

On Nov. 16, Tom Lee — executive chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors and chief investment officer at Fundstrat Capital — said in a post on X that ether is “embarking on that same supercycle” that produced a 100x gain in bitcoin since his 2017 client recommendation. 

He noted bitcoin endured six drawdowns greater than 50% and three greater than 75% over the past 8.5 years, arguing crypto's volatility reflects markets “discounting a massive future” and that investors had to hold through “existential moments.”

The call drew pushback. A prominent bitcoin influencer known as ""The Bitcoin Therapist"" asked what utility ether offers that “hundreds of other coins don't,” questioned Ethereum's moat beyond market penetration and whether traditional finance would actually run on Ethereum rails for 24/7 trading. “I would never want my assets on the ethereum blockchain,” he wrote.

Lee did not provide timing targets or valuation markers for the ether thesis, beyond cautioning that “the path higher is not a straight line.” His comments extend a long-running view that crypto cycles can reward patience but come with severe interim drawdowns.

Looking ahead, sustained growth in on-chain activity on Ethereum and its Layer-2s alongside expanded institutional use cases, will help test the thesis.

Ethereum continues to trade inside a deeply compressed downtrend, with repeated rejections from lower-high resistance. While the broader structure remains bearish, signs of sell-side exhaustion and deep liquidity pockets above the price keep the door open for a relief expansion if buyers reclaim key levels.

By Shayan

Ethereum has extended its decline within a persistent descending channel, repeatedly failing to break above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, both of which have now turned into dynamic resistance. The most recent rejection from the $3.8K supply cluster confirms the dominance of sellers in the upper half of the structure.

The asset has now stabilized directly inside the $3K–$3.1K demand block. This region has historically attracted medium-term buyers and is reinforced by a visible positive divergence in the RSI, indicating a slowdown in bearish momentum. However, unless the price reclaims the $3.45K–$3.55K breaker block, the market remains vulnerable to continued pressure toward the deeper $2.6K demand zone.

If a daily close returns above the broken trendline and the 200-day MA, the broader structure could shift, opening the path for a mid-trend recovery toward the $3.8K liquidity band.



On the 4H timeframe, ETH continues to move within a sharp falling wedge. Each attempt to break higher has been rejected at the descending trendline and at the aligned $3.55K and $3.8K supply zones. These stacked supply layers have repeatedly capped upside attempts.

The price is now trading close to the wedge's lower boundary and just above the main liquidity pool spanning the $3K zone. The presence of long downside wicks indicates aggressive buyer absorption, matching the corrective nature of the wedge. If Ethereum manages to reclaim the $3.35K intraday pivot, a short-term shift toward the $3.55K region becomes likely.

Failure at this midpoint would keep the falling-wedge continuation intact and sustain the probability of a retest of $3K or even a brief deviation below it before any meaningful reversal.



By Shayan

The two-week liquidation heatmap highlights a dense concentration of resting long liquidations overhead, especially between $3.6K and $3.9K. This bright cluster is the primary liquidity magnet for any upward expansion. Historically, Ethereum tends to gravitate toward these high-liquidity shelves when the market enters a short-term relief phase.

Below the price, the liquidity is far thinner, meaning any downward continuation is likely to be sharp but short-lived, driven more by stop-runs than sustained selling. The largest imbalance sits at $3.8K–$3.9K, suggesting that if Ethereum manages to reclaim structure at $3.45K, a swift squeeze into that band becomes the most probable scenario.

Bitcoin news and Ethereum price held steady over the past day as traders kept one eye on price and the other on new policy signals from Washington and London. 

Bitcoin traded near $95,648, up +0.04%, while Ethereum hovered around $3,168, a small gain of 0.16%.

Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, told his audience on X that he has no plans to sell his Bitcoin or gold, despite the sharp decline in prices. 

BITCOiN CRASHING:

— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 15, 2025



He said what he calls the “everything bubbles” are now starting to burst. He argued that the deeper problem behind the market drop is a global cash shortage. 

“The cause of all markets crashing is the world is in need of cash,” he wrote.

Kiyosaki also warned that what he calls “The Big Print” is coming, echoing Lawrence Lepard's view that governments may resort to heavy money creation to manage rising debt. 

He reiterated the point in a separate update and stated that his long-term stance remains the same. “I will buy more Bitcoin when crash is over,” he wrote, again pointing to Bitcoin's fixed supply of 21M coins.

TWO  MORE THINGS:

1:  I willl buy more Bitcoin when crash is over.  

There are only 21 million Bitcoins. 

2:  If you have a Cashflow Game form a Cashflow Club and bring Birds of Feather together…. Teach and learn together.

— Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 15, 2025



Bitcoin, meanwhile, slipped below its short-term trend line this week as a bearish crossover formed on the daily chart. 

The fast-moving average dropped under the 200-day line after several weeks of slowing momentum near $110,000. 



(Source: X)

Traders often treat this setup as a possible “death cross.” In past cycles, similar crossovers lined up with local bottoms that later produced strong rebounds.

This time, the setup looks weaker. Bitcoin has slipped firmly below the 200-day moving average for the first time since late 2023, and the drop has pushed prices into the high-$90,000 range. 

The chart also shows a lower high forming below the spring peak, indicating that momentum has waned.

If Bitcoin is still tracking its usual cycle, past patterns suggest buyers tend to appear within a few days of a death cross. 

But if the market doesn't bounce in the coming week, the next move may be another slide before any attempt to climb back toward the 200-day line.

As per Coingecko data, the Ethereum price is down -18.5% in the past month and another 5.2% this week. 

It has been slightly steadier than Bitcoin on the weekly chart, but there's still no real signal of a recovery.

A key on-chain signal shows that traders have little reason left to lock in profits. Net Unrealized Profit and Loss (NUPL) has slipped to 0.23, its lowest reading since July 1. 

NUPL measures how much unrealized gain or loss sits across the market and helps track shifts in sentiment.

It moves through phases such as capitulation, when most wallets hold losses, and belief or denial, when confidence starts to build.

Gate's ETH-USDT liquidation map shows short positions stacked at $2.36Bn, with long positions still notable at $1.05Bn. 



(Source: Coinglass)

The split highlights a market caught between caution and conviction, leaving Ethereum's short-term direction unclear.

Ethereum's short-term trend still points lower, and Crypto Tony says a liquidity sweep may come before any solid recovery. 

The chart places ETH near $3,170, moving within a clear corrective structure.

Price action is forming an ABC pattern, with the latest pullback opening the door for another move down toward the $3,105–$3,110 support zone. 

That area lines up with the previous swing low marked as wave (a), where many stops are likely resting.



(Source: X)

The chart also shows a rising wedge that broke down earlier in the move, a sign that momentum had already weakened. 

ETH failed to push past the wave (b) high near $3,250 and turned lower soon after, showing sellers still have control.

The expected path on the chart suggests a deeper drop into the liquidity pocket, followed by a possible rebound toward $3,260 if buyers step in. 

For now, Ethereum stays in a corrective phase, and traders are watching for a sweep of the lower range before looking for long positions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","Altcoins on the Edge as Bitcoin Takes a Dive","https://www.onesafe.io/blog/bitcoin-price-correction-altcoin-market","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:19:19 GMT","

Just when you thought stability had graced the cryptosphere, Bitcoin unleashes yet another price correction, leaving traders and investors grasping for solid ground. With Bitcoin's recent decline reverberating through the altcoin arena, it's time for anyone dabbling in crypto to take stock of the turbulent waters ahead. This exploration unravels the depths of ongoing market struggles, effects on short-term investors, and strategies for Web3 startups to stay afloat in these stormy seas.

Picture this: a staggering 95% of the top 500 altcoins are currently red. Yes, you read it right—only a mere fraction of altcoin investments are reaping any rewards right now. This ominous trend signals a dramatic downturn, casting the median altcoin profit supply deep into what the analysts ominously term the historical capitulation zone. As uncertainty gnaws at the core of altcoin holders, they're mirroring the growing anxiety around Bitcoin, which has plunged 23% from its peak. 

The figures don't lie. Markets are caught in a whirlwind of liquidations, with a staggering $2.3 billion recently erased. For those who bet on up-and-coming coins during previous bullish escapades, the stakes are high. With prices slipping, the potential for frantic sell-offs looms large, threatening to further cripple an already precarious market liquidity.

While Bitcoin is certainly feeling the pressure, it's a lifeboat of sorts compared to its altcoin counterparts. About 69.5% of Bitcoin's supply remains profitable, a stark contrast to altcoins whose profit figures plunge below the disheartening 20% mark. This discrepancy emphasizes that, despite its own struggles, Bitcoin holds a semblance of stability amid the chaos characterizing the altcoin scene.

Compounding these woes, the Coinbase premium index has been pushing downwards, a grim indicator that U.S. investors are scrambling to sell. This enduring negative premium showcases how dire the current correction is, highlighting the volatility that defines the altcoin market.

As the cryptocurrency wave crashes against critical support, the uphill struggle becomes more evident. Liquidated positions reveal an exhausting market landscape. Recent analysis from Glassnode lays bare a harsh truth: nearly 99% of Bitcoin acquired in the last 155 days is now in a losing position. Such dire circumstances invite the fear of capitulation, though historically these very phases can precede substantial recoveries when the tides finally settle.

For those invested in altcoins, being acutely aware of liquidation data is crucial. These figures don't just serve as red flags; they may also represent savvy entry points when sentiment shifts in a more favorable direction.

In the eye of this market storm, Web3 startups and offshore crypto initiatives have a rare opportunity to sharpen their financial instruments. The emergence of automated crypto-to-fiat conversion platforms provides essential strategies for shielding businesses amid heightened volatility.

When faced with turmoil, the ability to lock in favorable exchange rates and execute immediate settlements becomes invaluable for company stability. This risk mitigation tactic acts as a bastion, ensuring operational continuity while allowing startup ecosystems to navigate bearish trends without compromising operational integrity.

To grasp the full scope of the current market, one must dissect the psychological undercurrents fueling cryptocurrencies. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which indicates extreme fear, vividly captures investor sentiment—an environment steeped in pessimism. Yet, amidst this backdrop, discerning investors might spot prime buying opportunities.

Despite prevailing fears, analysts retain a cautious eye on the foundational strength of Ethereum and particular altcoins that may facilitate recovery as liquidity begins to improve. Watching for altcoins with minimal selling pressure could unveil promising trends, especially for those willing to take calculated risks within the volatile landscape.

The altcoin market is navigating a fraught period, heavily influenced by Bitcoin's price fluctuations that have shaken investor confidence. While the immediacy of price movements grips attention, the operational resilience strategies remain pivotal for both Web3 startups and traders. With Bitcoin sporting a more solid profit base than its altcoin rivals, understanding the market's psychological pulse and adjusting financial strategies may position investors favorably in these challenging circumstances. As the crypto landscape evolves, staying alert to liquidity shifts and operational flexibility will be vital for weathering the storm and paving the way to recovery.

Chainlink and Aster have grabbed headlines lately, with recent recommendations from analysts. But in the shadows of these familiar names, one altcoin known as Opter is quietly building momentum. The new Decentralized Perpetuals Exchange has already drawn investors, and its presale is selling rapidly.

Find out more about the recent developments of LINK, $ASTER and  OPTER token, which have experts recommending them as three of the best altcoins to include in your investment portfolio.

Bitwise's Chainlink ETF has just hit a major milestone, now officially listed on the DTCC under the ticker CLNK. This step brings the first-ever Chainlink ETF closer to launch, offering both retail and institutional investors a direct way to gain exposure to LINK.  While SEC approval is still pending, history shows that DTCC listings often precede greenlights, giving the market reason to be optimistic.



Source: TradingView

Despite LINK slipping 19% monthly due to broader market weakness, the ETF news points to a promising upside. Traders will be watching key levels, and this development sets the stage for potential gains once LINK regains momentum and breaks above $16.80.

Aster is showing signs of bullish strength as its price eyes a retest of the $1.20 resistance level. The token's resilience above the $1 mark comes amid strategic accumulation, with a major whale acquiring 8.4 million ASTER tokens. This signals confidence and sets the stage for potential upside momentum.

Source: Coin Journal

The bullish sentiment has also been reinforced by recent buybacks, which got rid of a staggering 2.4 million tokens. Assuming ASTER breaks the target market of $1.20, the short-term outlook may lead to a rise towards the $1.25 to $1.50 mark. A good breakout from there might even be possible due to the aforementioned strategic market accumulation.

Opter is not just any perpetual trading platform, thanks to its unique hybrid trading engine. This new Decentralized Perpetuals Exchange is already competing with top CEXs like Binance or Coinbase by offering non-custodial access. This means traders can keep full control of their funds— a rare level of transparency and self-custody in today's perpetuals market.

The perpetual trading platform also introduces an innovative Opter XP System, which rewards traders with 800 OPTER for every $100,000 volume traded. XP is earned through trading volume, PnL, and position duration, with prestige ranks unlocking multipliers and Opter Airdrops.

To alleviate any security concerns, transactions are recorded on-chain, and contracts are audited by some of the leading firms.  There's also a one-click trading UX, which enables users to very easily execute trades and concentrate on strategy as opposed to blockchain delays.

Now to the presale: Stage 1 is live, and early access is critical. The OPTER token can be bought directly at $0.02 or farmed through live trading on the DEX. Early supporters also gain access to daily staking rewards and deflationary mechanisms. There's also a staking APR ranging from 40% to 110%, giving traders both short-term yield and long-term growth potential.

While Chainlink continues to gain attention with its ETF milestone and Aster rallies with strategic whale accumulation, Opter stands out as a next-level opportunity for traders seeking both utility and rewards. So if you're looking to diversify alongside Chainlink and Aster, don't hesitate to choose $OPTER. You'll benefit not just from its presale and advanced trading platform, but also via its Opter XP System and multiple Opter Airdrops.

PANews reported on November 16th that, according to Glassnode data, the relative profitability of altcoins (Top 500) is stabilizing in the deep capitulation zone, with only about 5% of the supply in a profitable state, while Bitcoin's profitability has just begun to decline sharply.

This news could accelerate some catalysts, such as broader ecosystem adoption and institutional partnerships, while also intensifying execution risk, regulatory uncertainty, and market volatility as investors digest ambitious innovation claims. Still, share price volatility, high valuation levels, a relatively inexperienced management team, and recent insider selling keep risk squarely in focus.

The crypto market is paying close attention after Hedera (HBAR) CEO Mance Harmon warned that the race toward tokenization could repeat the same mistakes seen in DeFi if transparency and regulation are ignored. HBAR remains steady, but investors are now shifting some focus to Remittix (RTX). It is a PayFi project that has quietly raised over $28 million and could become one of the most practical plays in real-world finance.





At a current price of $0.155, Hedera's CEO stated that tokenization could disrupt real-world assets (RWAs) and accelerate institutional blockchain adoption faster than expected. However, he cautioned that a lack of regulatory clarity could harm the industry. He urged networks like Hedera to lead responsibly to avoid repeating speculative manias that previously hurt DeFi markets.

Despite his warning, HBAR continues to attract enterprise users for rapid settlements and scalable Web3 infrastructure. Analysts note that its expanding partnerships with banks and supply-chain platforms could support gradual price recovery.

The HBAR price has hovered near $0.15, finding support after a modest dip earlier this month. If buying pressure grows around this level, analysts expect a short-term target of $0.18–$0.20. On the downside, failure to hold $0.14 may trigger a retest of $0.12. Long-term sentiment remains cautiously bullish as tokenization gains traction across financial institutions and government-backed projects.



While Hedera builds the enterprise framework for tokenization, Remittix (RTX) is executing on a real-world utility model. The project has raised over $28 million, sold 685 million tokens, and maintains a price point of $0.1166.

It secured listings on BitMart after surpassing $20 million in raised funds and on LBank after reaching $22 million, with a third exchange now in the pipeline. The wallet beta is now live, allowing users to send cryptocurrency directly to bank accounts in over 30 countries with live foreign exchange conversion.

Here are some reasons why whales are betting on Remittix:

This combination of compliance, robust working infrastructure, and strong token metrics has made RTX a favorite among early whales seeking the next real-world finance breakout. As HBAR advances enterprise tokenization, Remittix is positioning itself as the consumer-facing PayFi layer of this trend.

Both HBAR and RTX are shaping the tokenization narrative, with one coming from the enterprise side and the other from direct global payments. While HBAR works toward regulated asset networks, Remittix already enables people to move money across borders using blockchain rails. For investors seeking the best crypto to buy now, the two together provide a clear picture of where utility and adoption are headed next.

Compliance & Regulation

Nov 17, 2025
                                Hubbis





The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) today announced the successful completion of a live trial for settlement of interbank overnight lending transactions using wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) on the Singapore Dollar Test Network [1]. 

SGD Testnet is an operational shared ledger infrastructure that enables financial institutions (FIs) to test the settlement of tokenised financial assets using wholesale CBDC. The trial involved DBS, OCBC, and UOB as participating FIs, and featured the first live issuance of Singapore dollar wholesale CBDC, with transactions recorded in the banks' official books and regulatory filings.

The SGD Testnet provides three core functionalities for participating FIs:

• Common Settlement Asset: Enable the issuance, transfer and redemption of Singapore dollar wholesale CBDC to settle tokenised asset transactions, reducing settlement risk and market fragmentation. 
• Programmability: Develop and deploy conditional logic associated with counterparty agreements governing payment arrangements to ensure real-time execution of contractual terms based on predefined conditions. 
• Multi-Asset: Support atomic settlement of both cash and securities components of transactions, eliminating settlement risk that exists when cash and securities settle at different times or through different systems.

 

MAS will build on this CBDC settlement pilot, and plans in a future trial, to issue tokenised MAS Bills to Primary Dealers which will be settled using CBDC. More details of this future trial will be shared in 2026.

**

[1] MAS announced on 4 Nov 2024 plans to advance asset tokenisation through commercial networks, market infrastructure development, industry frameworks, and the facilitation of access to common settlement assets.

President Trump pitched himself to voters on the campaign trail as the next “crypto president”. His administration has ushered in favourable regulation, a crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission, and a pardon for Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the Binance exchange. 

However, so far, that hasn't translated into stellar returns for holders of bitcoin, the world's largest digital currency.

The price of bitcoin fell 3.7 per cent to $96,022 in morning trading in New York on Friday, below the $102,195 level seen on the day of Trump's inauguration on January 20.

• Michelle Kirschner: Regulating crypto will be a balancing act

Bitcoin has underperformed the S&P 500 since the start of the year, rising 2.7 per cent compared with a gain of 15 per cent for the index of America's largest listed companies.

The notoriously volatile digital asset snapped a seven-year streak of monthly gains in October, falling nearly 5 per cent after Trump spooked investors and triggered the largest crypto liquidation yet by announcing a 100 per cent tariff on Chinese imports and threatening export controls on critical software.

Bitcoin fell as low as $104,783 between October 10 and 11, having set a record high a few days earlier above $126,000. Analysts at 10x Research, a digital assets research firm, think that the crypto industry has entered a bear market.

In a note this week the firm said: “It is admittedly hard to turn aggressively bearish when equity indices sit near all-time highs and AI momentum remains intact.

“However, crypto positioning tells a different story: [exchange-traded fund, or ETF] buyers appear exhausted, trading desks are still recovering from the October 10 liquidation event, and retail investors have taken substantial hits this year.”

For its critics, bitcoin has little point beyond the gamble that its price will rise. Its supporters have suggested it can have everyday utility as a digital store of wealth and a payment method but the development of its practical usefulness has been agonisingly slow.

Tom Essaye, president of Sevens Report, said: “I think what's happened is that people got a little bit ahead of themselves on declaring bitcoin anything other than essentially a risk asset, which it still is at this point.

“In many ways, Trump is the bitcoin president. There are advances going into the legitimacy of bitcoin, of using it in everyday commerce, but those are our slow-moving but important advances. They will show up in overall demand metrics years from now. I think people thought bitcoin's moment had arrived. It has not yet.”

Global markets have been volatile. A rally in US equities at the start of the week as investors found comfort in the ending of the US government shutdown has faded.

On Thursday the Nasdaq fell 2.3 per cent, with steep losses in AI-related stocks including Nvidia and Palantir Technologies as investors faced renewed uncertainty over interest rate cuts owing to inflation worries and disunity among central bankers about the US economy's health.

Bitcoin ETFs recorded net outflows of about $870 million on Thursday, the second-largest daily withdrawal since their debut, Bloomberg reported.

The next US Federal Reserve rate-setting event on December 10 is expected to be an important date for the sector. 

Matthew Tuttle, a bitcoin investor and chief executive of Tuttle Capital Management, said: “I think people are starting to get worried that the Fed is going to be on hold at that meeting, which I think is at least part of today's [Thursday's] sell-off.”

He said that while the price of bitcoin has been falling, he has been “buying the dip”. “You know, I think intermediate term, longer term, I'm bullish,” he said.

However, he said: “When bitcoin got into the $120s, that was great, but that was too far, too fast, and just like anything else, you can be the biggest bitcoin bull ever, but you're sitting on massive profits. And the old adage: take your profits before somebody else takes them from you — that applies to everything, including bitcoin. People like to talk about bitcoin as some magical asset, but it really isn't.”

• HMRC warns crypto investors as tax crackdown looms

The $100,000 level is regarded as an important psychological threshold for investors. Investor nerves are reflected in the wider crypto market. 

Many retail participants “are deeply underwater, which reduces their risk appetite and limits fresh capital inflows into crypto”, analysts at 10x Research said. 

Reuters has claimed that Trump's family made more than $800 million from sales of crypto assets in the first half of 2025. However, the Trump meme coin, launched in January using the $TRUMP ticker, has collapsed in value from a range of between $60 and $65 to $8. 

The Bullish and Gemini cryptocurrency exchange IPOs have each fallen by about 68 per cent since their listing peaks on August 13 and September 12. Meanwhile, Circle has tumbled 67 per cent from its peak on June 23. 

It can't have been the kind of performance the president had in mind when he spoke about making the US the “crypto capital of the world” in July.

Ripple's (XRP) new stablecoin RLUSD reached $1B market cap within a year of its December 2024 launch.

RLUSD transaction volume jumped 210% over 30 days to over $4B.

Ripple is piloting RLUSD with Mastercard and WebBank to settle credit card transactions on the XRP Ledger.

If you're thinking about retiring or know someone who is, there are three quick questions causing many Americans to realize they can retire earlier than expected. take 5 minutes to learn more here

Ripple's new USD stablecoin, RLUSD (Ripple USD), grabbed crypto headlines fast. Launched in December 2024, RLUSD hit a market cap above $1 billion within a year, cracking the Top 10 among U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins.

This rapid climb raises a key question: could RLUSD become a catalyst for Ripple's native token XRP (CRYPTO: XRP)? Analysts are split on whether rising RLUSD demand will lift XRP prices by expanding XRPL activity, or whether stablecoins serve entirely separate roles.

Here's what RLUSD's growth means for XRP.

RLUSD's growth has been remarkable. The dollar-backed stablecoin was introduced on the XRP Ledger in late 2024 under New York's strict trust charter. Within a year, RLUSD hit a $1 billion market cap, making it the 10th-largest dollar stablecoin globally. By November 2025, its circulating supply reached about $1 billion, split between Ethereum ($819 million) and the XRPL ($203 million).

That milestone came faster than almost any other stablecoin. Several years are typically needed to reach $1 billion, but RLUSD's quick climb suggests Ripple leveraged its existing customer base and global network.

Institutional demand has been a key driver. Ripple President Monica Long says rising corporate use of its payment services has translated into more RLUSD flows, calling RLUSD the ""primary stablecoin"" for Ripple's payment rails.

Data show that RLUSD transaction volume jumped 210% over 30 days, to over $4 billion, even as the number of transactions (on both chains) climbed 26%. CryptoSlate reports ""987% growth since its December 2024 launch,"" reaching $839.9 million supply (just before $1 billion).

This growth has been fueled by rising institutional demand, expanding payment flows, and recent acquisitions (e.g., Hidden Road prime brokerage and GTreasury), which created new distribution channels.

Here are the three key factors driving RLUSD's rapid rise:

Ripple's acquisitions (such as GTreasury) are creating direct pipelines from corporate treasuries into RLUSD. GTreasury supports the cash workflows of Fortune 500 companies, enabling them to hold tokenized cash and settle payables instantly.

CryptoSlate explains that tapping these corporate treasurers could transform RLUSD from an exchange-centric token into enterprise financial infrastructure, significantly boosting volume. RLUSD is being positioned as digital cash for companies' short-term funds.

RLUSD is being tested in live payment systems. In October 2025, Ripple announced a pilot with Mastercard, WebBank, and Gemini to settle credit card transactions using RLUSD on the XRPL.

This high-profile partnership (unveiled at Ripple's Swell conference) would be one of the first times a regulated U.S. bank uses a public blockchain and stablecoin to settle real-world card payments.

If successful, such initiatives could dramatically broaden RLUSD's use case beyond crypto trading, locking in more stablecoin demand.

RLUSD's strict regulatory framework has attracted institutional investors. It's issued by a New York trust charter company, fully backed by reserves, with transparent attestations. CoinDesk notes that ""Ripple says it has already surpassed $1 billion in circulation"" of RLUSD, and the currency is ""regulated under New York's Trust Charter.""

This compliance gives firms confidence to use it for regulated flows. Many stablecoins are treated warily by banks. Analysts have pointed to the trust structure and audits as differentiators that help RLUSD gain market share.

Here's how RLUSD could influence XRP's price:

Widespread RLUSD adoption would drive more activity on the XRPL, creating deeper liquidity and visibility for XRP. If Fortune 500 companies start settling transactions through RLUSD on the XRPL, some of that flow could route via XRP as a bridge asset, boosting demand.

Traders like Skipper have speculated that real-world pilots could make multi-hundred-dollar price targets plausible (in a recent Binance article, a $750 year-end XRP target was mentioned). Messari's analysts suggest that as Ripple's institutional stack grows, XRP would benefit from network effects alongside RLUSD.

RLUSD growth proceeds moderately, and XRP gains remain tied to broader market factors (ETFs, regulation). RLUSD could stabilize and become a reliable on-ramp asset without dramatically moving the needle on XRP's price, which often swings with crypto sentiment.

Current technical indicators (e.g., a recent ""double-bottom"" pattern noted by analysts) hint at a potential rebound toward the mid-$2 range, but nothing guarantees a sustained breakout. Here, RLUSD is simply one of several catalysts that might support XRP's consolidation.

RLUSD could cannibalize some XRP use cases. If global enterprises and banks strongly prefer regulated stablecoins over cryptocurrencies for most cross-border needs, XRP might remain a niche choice for only the most latency-sensitive transactions. XRP's price could underperform relative to the hype around Ripple's network as a whole.

Some critics suggest that RLUSD's strong presence on Ethereum and other platforms could overshadow XRPL itself, though supporters argue that cross-chain ""atomic swaps"" can mitigate that concern. Regulatory or technical hurdles could also stall RLUSD adoption. If RLUSD grows without pulling XRP along, XRP's rally might peter out.

You may think retirement is about picking the best stocks or ETFs, but you'd be wrong. See even great investments can be a liability in retirement. The difference comes down to a simple: accumulation vs distribution. The difference is causing millions to rethink their plans.

The good news? After answering three quick questions many Americans are finding they can retire earlier than expected. If you're thinking about retiring or know someone who is, take 5 minutes to learn more here.

J.K. Rowling, the creator of the popular and critically acclaimed Harry Potter series of novels, once expressed genuine confusion about Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), inviting a flood of explanations from prominent figures across the cryptocurrency world.

Back on May 15, 2020, Rowling was tagged in a Bitcoin-related post on Twitter, now called X. 

“I don't understand Bitcoin. Please explain it to me,” the British novelist asked inquisitively. This post quickly went viral, eliciting thousands of responses from cryptocurrency enthusiasts. 

Among the many responders was Vitalik Buterin, early blockchain pioneer and co-founder of Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH).

“It's a digital currency. There's ~18m units of it. It's not backed by anything, it's just valuable because it is, like collectibles,” Buterin explained.

Tron (CRYPTO: TRX) founder Justin Sun went a step ahead, referencing Rowling's books to drive home the idea. He described Bitcoin as a “magic coin” which “Dumbledore” doesn't understand, but “Harry Potter” is fascinated by.

Despite the effort, Rowling found the explanations overwhelming and ultimately said, “I don't think I trust this.”

“Things like this are white noise to me. I cannot and will not ever understand Bitcoin, but I love you for thinking that I can or will,” she added.

Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk also waded in, stressing that “massive” currency printing by central banks is making Bitcoin internet monet look “solid.”

Rowling's interaction was brief and skeptical, with no endorsement or advocacy for the cryptocurrency from her side yet. 

Interestingly, Bitcoin has risen 933% since Rowling made those posts. Whether she missed out on a fortune is something only she can decide.

The world of cryptocurrency is in the midst of a revolution, and at the forefront is SoFi Technologies, making history as the first nationally chartered bank to introduce crypto trading for consumers. This monumental step is not just a nod to the legitimacy of digital currencies; it paves the way for fresh investment horizons for individual traders. As we explore this critical transformation, we will spotlight innovators like DeepSnitch AI, underscoring why they present remarkable investment prospects heading into 2026.

SoFi's decision to launch cryptocurrency trading services—including mainstream tokens like Bitcoin and Ether—heralds a new chapter in banking. CEO Anthony Noto's characterization of blockchain and cryptocurrencies as ""super cycle technology"" is striking, drawing a potent comparison to the disruptive wave of artificial intelligence. His strong endorsement serves to affirm the legitimacy of digital currencies and highlights a key shift towards broader acceptance within the financial ecosystem.

In tandem with its trading services, SoFi is set to unveil SoFi USD—a stablecoin fully backed by reserves—aiming to seamlessly blend digital assets into everyday banking. The rise of stablecoins illustrates a growing trend towards a hybrid financial model, amalgamating traditional banking and innovative digital alternatives. For retail investors, this changing landscape shines a spotlight on projects boasting real utility and trustworthiness, such as DeepSnitch AI.

As SoFi blazes the trail in crypto trading, savvy investors are keenly examining the best crypto opportunities, with promising ventures like DeepSnitch AI drawing attention. This forward-thinking intelligence platform employs five specialized AI agents designed to decode the complexities of the cryptocurrency world, providing traders with invaluable real-time insights. In stark contrast to the often baffling traditional trading experience, DeepSnitch AI streamlines the process, helping users uncover genuine opportunities.

DeepSnitch AI confronts significant obstacles faced by traders, including information overload and the specter of market scams. By harnessing cutting-edge data analysis strategies, the platform fine-tunes trading approaches while effectively mitigating risks. Currently priced at $0.02289, DeepSnitch AI's presale has already amassed more than $525,000, prompting experts to predict extraordinary returns—potentially reaching an impressive 100x by 2026.

The accelerated pace of institutional engagement in cryptocurrencies, fueled by innovative products like Chainlink's upcoming spot ETF, signals a seismic shift in investment paradigms. It's crucial to highlight that broad validation—evident in SoFi's embrace of crypto—could pose hurdles for smaller Web3 startups. These emerging players must navigate the heightened fragmentation and integration demands to flourish amid both decentralized and traditional financial systems.

Research indicates that companies failing to prioritize robust payment systems often suffer from significant operational hiccups. Therefore, it's vital for crypto enterprises to reinforce their backend processes—a critical element frequently eclipsed by speculative trading distractions.

The cryptocurrency market's inherent volatility has underscored the necessity of a more prudent investment approach. Recent trends suggest a pivot towards utility-driven tokens underpinned by resilient technologies—an area where DeepSnitch AI excels. As institutional players re-engage with crypto investments, attention is shifting back towards intrinsic project value, moving away from mere speculative impulses.

The developments surrounding SoFi Technologies and DeepSnitch AI signal a groundbreaking shift in cryptocurrency trading, enhancing its appeal for everyday investors. SoFi's unprecedented role as the first nationally chartered bank venturing into crypto trading affirms the resilience of digital currencies and sets a roadmap for future finance integration. Meanwhile, initiatives like DeepSnitch AI exemplify a forward-thinking narrative focused on utility and practical applications, expertly navigating the crowded cryptocurrency arena.

As investors, staying attuned to broader market trends is imperative. By prioritizing fundamentally strong projects with tangible applications—like DeepSnitch AI—individual traders can strategically position themselves for growth in the dynamic digital finance landscape. Now is the moment to secure your stake in the next wave of cryptocurrency innovation.

WisdomTree's head of digital assets, Will Peck, anticipates that exchange-traded funds (ETF) that hold diversified baskets of cryptocurrencies will fill a significant gap in the market in the coming years.

“It does seem like that's going to be one of the next waves of adoption,” Peck told Cointelegraph at The Bridge conference in New York City on Wednesday. “It solves a need, I think,” he added.

Peck explained that although many new investors now understand the concept of Bitcoin (BTC), they often struggle to judge the “next 20 range of assets.” He said a multi-asset crypto basket provides them with exposure to the sector while mitigating the “idiosyncratic risk” of investing in individual tokens.

Will Peck says index ETF investors will be backing the tech

“Crypto we talked about as an asset class, but it's really a technology, and the underlying return drivers of each of these tokens are actually quite different, even though they're correlated, generally, just because that's where the market is,” he explained. 

It comes as several crypto index ETFs have launched this year. Most recently, on Thursday, asset manager 21Shares launched two crypto Index ETFs, which are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 

Just a couple of months prior, on Sept. 25, asset manager Hashdex expanded its Crypto Index US ETF to include XRP (XRP), SOL (SOL), and Stellar (XLM), following the generic listing rule change from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Peck said the timing of broader adoption for crypto index ETFs is “tough exactly to forecast,” but suggested it may be inevitable given the straightforward utility of having a product that provides such exposure.

Peck expects a surge in new crypto ETF launches as ETF issuers compete for early advantage, which he said may erode the idea that an ETF automatically signals the cryptocurrency token has any authority or credibility.

Bitcoin ETF success “surpassed” Will Peck's expectations

“I think it's going to be a shift, like, where, five years ago, you said, Oh, if something has an ETF, like, Bitcoin is going to get one, maybe it's the first one, it must have some sort of institutional stamp of, like, approval,” he said.

“I don't think that's necessarily how the SEC should be, a merit-based regulator in that regard, right? And it's really going to be on clients making the right choices with their own money,” Peck added.

Meanwhile, Peck said that the “overall success” of spot Bitcoin ETFs since their launch in January 2024 has surpassed his expectations. 

“It's remarkable to me how big the Bitcoin ETF categories, crypto in general, is one of the most competitive parts of the US ETF market,” he said.

Since the launch of US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs, the products have accumulated around $58.83 billion in net inflows, according to Farside.

On Nov. 16, Tom Lee — executive chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors and chief investment officer at Fundstrat Capital — said in a post on X that ether is “embarking on that same supercycle” that produced a 100x gain in bitcoin since his 2017 client recommendation. 

He noted bitcoin endured six drawdowns greater than 50% and three greater than 75% over the past 8.5 years, arguing crypto's volatility reflects markets “discounting a massive future” and that investors had to hold through “existential moments.”

The call drew pushback. A prominent bitcoin influencer known as ""The Bitcoin Therapist"" asked what utility ether offers that “hundreds of other coins don't,” questioned Ethereum's moat beyond market penetration and whether traditional finance would actually run on Ethereum rails for 24/7 trading. “I would never want my assets on the ethereum blockchain,” he wrote.

Lee did not provide timing targets or valuation markers for the ether thesis, beyond cautioning that “the path higher is not a straight line.” His comments extend a long-running view that crypto cycles can reward patience but come with severe interim drawdowns.

Looking ahead, sustained growth in on-chain activity on Ethereum and its Layer-2s alongside expanded institutional use cases, will help test the thesis.

BTC Approaches 'Death Cross' as Market Tests Key Historical Pattern","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/11/16/bitcoin-approaches-death-cross-as-market-tests-major-historical-pattern","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 17:41:38 GMT","

Glassnode data shows that bitcoin's ""death cross,"" a technical analysis term that may indicate a bearish signal, is imminent, but with a catch.

The 50-day moving average for bitcoin at $110,669 is now on the verge of slipping below the 200-day moving average at $110,459, potentially triggering the death cross. This crossover is widely viewed in technical analysis as a bearish signal because it reflects weakening short-term momentum relative to the longer trend. 

However, this can also act as a possible positive signal. Bitcoin is currently down about 25% from its October all time high around $126,000 and this correction has been ongoing for roughly 41 days. Despite the reputation of the death cross, this would be the fourth occurrence of the death cross since the cycle started back in 2023 and each previous instance has aligned with a major local bottoms. In September 2023, bitcoin bottomed near $25,000, in August 2024 during the yen carry trade unwind it found support around $49,000, and then in April 2025, during uncertainty around President Trump's tariff policy, BTC bottomed below $75,000. In the current setup, bitcoin has fallen to $94,000 and in all four prior instances the market put in its low just before the death cross formed, raising the question of whether the same pattern may be unfolding again. 

This current drawdown is less severe than the April correction, when bitcoin dropped below $75,000 during the tariff related turmoil. 

The April correction was both deeper and longer than the current correction, with bitcoin falling about 30% from the January peak near $109,000 and spending around 79 days trending lower before bottoming in the first week of April. With current selloff of 25% and 41 days, perhaps further downside still possible. However, the broader environment now includes the end of the United States government shutdown on Nov. 12. The closest comparison is the 2019 shutdown, when bitcoin fell more than 9% five days after the government reopened on Jan. 25 2019. 

It took until Feb. 9 2019 for bitcoin to recover, approximately two weeks. 

This time around bitcoin has already dropped as much as 10% since the reopening. The question now is whether the same pattern will play out again.

Both major meme-assets traded through high-velocity volatility windows, with Dogecoin rebounding sharply from a heavy-volume flush while Shiba Inu broke key support before staging an aggressive intraday reversal.

Broader crypto markets continued their risk-off rotation as sentiment remained pressured by AI-bubble concerns, $800M in Bitcoin ETF outflows, and tightening liquidity across speculative assets. The weak macro backdrop left meme-coins particularly exposed to volatility shocks.

Despite this, large-holder behavior diverged across DOGE and SHIB. Dogecoin saw an uptick in institutional accumulation following two weeks of heavy whale positioning, while SHIB faced elevated retail-driven selling before buyers stepped in aggressively at intraday lows.

No major token-specific catalysts drove the session's moves, though traders monitored continued ETF-related discussions and whale positioning trends as key sentiment drivers.

DOGE climbed 3.0% to close at $0.1641, rebounding from a sharp early-session decline that flushed price to $0.1551.• Volume spiked to 613M during the support test — 186% above the 214M average• Breakout above $0.1640 established an ascending intraday trendline• Late-session trading held DOGE in a $0.1638–$0.1643 consolidation band

The rebound produced a clear higher-lows pattern, confirming momentum rotation despite broader market weakness.

SHIB fell 2.0% from $0.000009233 to $0.000009045, breaking daily support at $0.000009240.• Heavy selling at 08:00 GMT surged to 412.35B tokens — 67% above average• Price dropped to $0.000008975 before reversing violently• A V-shaped spike back to $0.000009082 printed on 32.34B hourly volume

The intraday recovery reclaimed short-term resistance at $0.000009060, signaling stability despite the broader downtrend.

Support/Resistance:• Major support validated at $0.1551• New support: $0.1638–$0.1640• Resistance: $0.1650, then $0.1680

Volume:• 613M peak confirms institutional buying• Recovery maintained above baseline, signaling sustained demand

XRP faced intense selling pressure at key support levels before a dramatic, high-volume V-shaped reversal signaled potential exhaustion of downward momentum.

The decline unfolded against a backdrop of mixed institutional signals and heightened macro uncertainty. Crypto markets remain trapped in a medium-term downtrend, with sentiment pinned in the fear zone as volatility spikes across majors.

Canary Capital's newly launched U.S. spot XRP ETF (XRPC) registered $58.6 million in first-day volume, far exceeding analyst expectations of $17 million. Yet the strong debut failed to stabilize XRP, as derivatives markets flashed stress signals. Roughly $28 million in XRP liquidations hit within 24 hours, with long positions accounting for nearly $25 million of the wipeout.

Market analysts warn that institutional flows remain conflicted—ETF inflows show interest, but broader risk-off pressure continues suppressing crypto liquidity and momentum.

XRP dropped 4.3% from $2.31 to $2.22 during the 24-hour session ending November 16 at 02:00 UTC. The decline carved a $0.10 range with a clear sequence of lower highs confirming bearish structure.

The most aggressive selling hit at 00:00 UTC, when 74M XRP traded—69% above the 24-hour average—breaking the $2.24 support. Price slid to $2.22, marking the session low. Three separate volume spikes above 57M during decline phases validated sustained distribution.

Despite the ETF catalyst, the selloff accelerated as price rejected $2.31 and failed to find support near prior consolidation zones. The pair settled into a tight $2.22–$2.23 consolidation after the breakdown.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Dark matter acts surprisingly normal in a new cosmic test","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251115095924.htm","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 08:59:39 GMT","

Does dark matter behave according to the same physical rules that apply to ordinary matter? This question remains one of the major puzzles in modern cosmology, since this invisible form of matter (which neither emits nor reflects any light) is still hypothetical and extremely difficult to study directly. Researchers from the University of Geneva (UNIGE) and collaborating institutions aimed to see whether dark matter follows familiar behavior on the largest scales, or whether other forces might influence it. Their study, published in Nature Communications, indicates that dark matter appears to act much like ordinary matter, although they cannot yet rule out the possibility of an additional, previously unknown interaction. Because dark matter is thought to be five times more common than ordinary matter, even a small new insight helps clarify its role in shaping the Universe.

Ordinary matter is affected by four known fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak forces within atoms. The question is whether dark matter responds to the same set of forces. While dark matter is invisible and difficult to detect, it may still follow these familiar laws or possibly be influenced by a fifth force that scientists have not yet identified.

Investigating How Dark Matter Moves Through Gravitational Wells

To explore this possibility, the UNIGE-led team examined whether dark matter sinks into gravitational wells the way ordinary matter does on cosmic scales. Massive objects distort the structure of space, forming these wells. Ordinary matter -- planets, stars and galaxies -- falls into them according to established physical principles that include Einstein's general relativity and Euler's equations. The team wanted to know whether dark matter behaves in the same predictable way.

""To answer this question, we compared the velocities of galaxies across the Universe with the depth of gravitational wells,"" explains Camille Bonvin, associate professor in the Department of Theoretical Physics at UNIGE's Faculty of Science and co-author of the study. ""If dark matter is not subject to a fifth force, then galaxies -- which are mostly made of dark matter -- will fall into these wells like ordinary matter, governed solely by gravity. On the other hand, if a fifth force acts on dark matter, it will influence the motion of galaxies, which would then fall into the wells differently. By comparing the depth of the wells with the galaxies' velocities, we can therefore test for the presence of such a force.""

Dark Matter Appears to Follow Euler's Equations

Using this method on modern cosmological data, the researchers found that dark matter moves into gravitational wells in the same manner as ordinary matter, meaning it is consistent with Euler's equations. ""At this stage, however, these conclusions do not yet rule out the presence of an unknown force. But if such a fifth force exists, it cannot exceed 7% of the strength of gravity -- otherwise it would already have appeared in our analyses,"" says Nastassia Grimm first author of the study and former postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Theoretical Physics at UNIGE's Faculty of Science who has recently joined the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth.

What Comes Next in the Search for New Physics

These early findings represent an important step in refining our understanding of dark matter. The next key objective is to determine whether a subtle fifth force truly affects it. ""Upcoming data from the newest experiments, such as LSST and DESI, will be sensitive to forces as weak as 2% of gravity. They should therefore allow us to learn even more about the behavior of dark matter,"" concludes Isaac Tutusaus, researcher at ICE-CSIC and IEEC and associate professor at IRAP, Midi-Pyrénées observatory, University of Toulouse, co-author of the study.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Chimps shock scientists by changing their minds with new evidence","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251115095928.htm","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 07:32:39 GMT","

Chimpanzees may share more with human thinkers than researchers once realized. A new study published in Science presents compelling evidence that chimpanzees can revise their beliefs in a rational way when they encounter new information.

The study, titled ""Chimpanzees rationally revise their beliefs,"" was carried out by an international team that included UC Berkeley Psychology Postdoctoral Researcher Emily Sanford, UC Berkeley Psychology Professor Jan Engelmann and Utrecht University Psychology Professor Hanna Schleihauf. Their results indicate that chimpanzees, similar to humans, adjust their decisions based on how strong the available evidence is, which is a central component of rational thinking.

At the Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Uganda, the researchers designed an experiment involving two boxes, one of which contained food. The chimps were first given a hint about which box held the reward. Later, they received a clearer and more convincing clue that pointed to the other box. Many of the animals changed their choice after receiving the stronger information.

""Chimpanzees were able to revise their beliefs when better evidence became available,"" said Sanford, a researcher in the UC Berkeley Social Origins Lab. ""This kind of flexible reasoning is something we often associate with 4-year-old children. It was exciting to show that chimps can do this too.""

Testing Whether Chimps Are Reasoning or Acting on Instinct

To confirm that the animals were truly engaging in reasoning rather than reacting on impulse, the researchers used tightly controlled experiments combined with computational modeling. These methods helped rule out simpler explanations, such as the chimps favoring the most recent clue (recency bias) or simply responding to the easiest cue to notice. The modeling showed that their decisions followed patterns consistent with rational belief revision.

""We recorded their first choice, then their second, and compared whether they revised their beliefs,"" Sanford said. ""We also used computational models to test how their choices matched up with various reasoning strategies.""

This work challenges long-held assumptions that rationality, defined as forming and updating beliefs based on evidence, belongs only to humans.

""The difference between humans and chimpanzees isn't a categorical leap. It's more like a continuum,"" Sanford said.

Broader Implications for Learning, Childhood Development and AI

Sanford believes these findings may influence how scientists think about a wide range of fields. Learning how primates update their beliefs could reshape ideas about how children learn and even how artificial intelligence systems are designed.

""This research can help us think differently about how we approach early education or how we model reasoning in AI systems,"" she said. ""We shouldn't assume children are blank slates when they walk into a classroom.""

The next phase of the project will apply the same belief revision tasks to young children. Sanford's team is now gathering data from two- to four-year-olds to see how toddlers handle changing information compared to chimps.

""It's fascinating to design a task for chimps, and then try to adapt it for a toddler,"" she said.

Expanding the Study to Other Primates

Sanford hopes to broaden the work to additional primate species, creating a comparative view of reasoning abilities across evolutionary branches. Her previous research spans topics from empathy in dogs to numerical understanding in children, and she notes that one theme continues to stand out: animals often demonstrate far more cognitive sophistication than people assume.

""They may not know what science is, but they're navigating complex environments with intelligent and adaptive strategies,"" she said. ""And that's something worth paying attention to.""

Other members of the research team include: Bill Thompson (UC Berkeley Psychology); Snow Zhang (UC Berkeley Philosophy); Joshua Rukundo (Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary/Chimpanzee Trust, Uganda); Josep Call (School of Psychology and Neuroscience, University of St Andrews); and Esther Herrmann (School of Psychology, University of Portsmouth).

Tensor operations are a form of advanced mathematics that support many modern technologies, especially artificial intelligence. These operations go far beyond the simple calculations most people encounter. A helpful way to picture them is to imagine manipulating a Rubik's cube in several dimensions at once by rotating, slicing, or rearranging its layers. Humans and traditional computers must break these tasks into sequences, but light can perform all of them at the same time.

Today, tensor operations are essential for AI systems involved in image processing, language understanding, and countless other tasks. As the amount of data continues to grow, conventional digital hardware such as GPUs faces increasing strain in speed, energy use, and scalability.

Researchers Demonstrate Single-Shot Tensor Computing With Light

To address these challenges, an international team led by Dr. Yufeng Zhang from the Photonics Group at Aalto University's Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering has developed a fundamentally new approach. Their method allows complex tensor calculations to be completed within a single movement of light through an optical system. The process, described as single-shot tensor computing, functions at the speed of light.

""Our method performs the same kinds of operations that today's GPUs handle, like convolutions and attention layers, but does them all at the speed of light,"" says Dr. Zhang. ""Instead of relying on electronic circuits, we use the physical properties of light to perform many computations simultaneously.""

Encoding Information Into Light for High-Speed Computation

The team accomplished this by embedding digital information into the amplitude and phase of light waves, transforming numerical data into physical variations within the optical field. As these light waves interact, they automatically carry out mathematical procedures such as matrix and tensor multiplication, which form the basis of deep learning. By working with multiple wavelengths of light, the researchers expanded their technique to support even more complex, higher-order tensor operations.

""Imagine you're a customs officer who must inspect every parcel through multiple machines with different functions and then sort them into the right bins,"" Zhang says. ""Normally, you'd process each parcel one by one. Our optical computing method merges all parcels and all machines together -- we create multiple 'optical hooks' that connect each input to its correct output. With just one operation, one pass of light, all inspections and sorting happen instantly and in parallel.""

Passive Optical Processing With Wide Compatibility

One of the most striking benefits of this method is how little intervention it requires. The necessary operations occur on their own as the light travels, so the system does not need active control or electronic switching during computation.

""This approach can be implemented on almost any optical platform,"" says Professor Zhipei Sun, leader of Aalto University's Photonics Group. ""In the future, we plan to integrate this computational framework directly onto photonic chips, enabling light-based processors to perform complex AI tasks with extremely low power consumption.""

Path Toward Future Light-Based AI Hardware

Zhang notes that the ultimate objective is to adapt the technique to existing hardware and platforms used by major technology companies. He estimates that the method could be incorporated into such systems within 3 to 5 years.

""This will create a new generation of optical computing systems, significantly accelerating complex AI tasks across a myriad of fields,"" he concludes.

The study was published in Nature Photonics on November 14th, 2025.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","I Ditched Alexa and Upgraded My Smart Home","https://www.wired.com/story/heres-how-i-ditched-alexa-and-upgraded-my-smart-home/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Until recently, my smart home setup was in chaos. After years of testing, buying, and upgrading to the latest smart home gadgets in an attempt to make my life easier, it became a bloated mess that was actually making it more complicated.

My Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home apps were awash with dead devices, duplicates, and automations that simply didn't work. My Hue Bridge, trying desperately to tie it all together, was creaking at the seams. And the more advanced platforms I hadn't quite committed to, such as Homey and SmartThings, were fighting each other for bandwidth on an already congested network.

I was basically employed as full-time tech support in my own house, just to stop the kids moaning that their lights weren't working … again. It was time for a reset—a chance to embark on a total rethink of what a comprehensive smart home in 2025 should look like. If that sounds daunting, it needn't be. Here's how I gave my smart home a much-needed reboot and brought harmony to my house once more.

A lot of people reading this probably walked the same path I did, of adding devices to Alexa early on because it was easy, then losing control as the smart home boom outpaced the platform that was meant to keep everything in sync.

This meant I ended up running a network of prosumer-grade smart home products on an operating system that, let's face it, was designed to add dishwasher tablets to a shopping list and remind the kids to brush their teeth. It's not ever really been cut out to manage low-latency state changes across a hundred different devices.

Alexa has got better for moderate smart home users though, with Amazon adding things like Zigbee radios, Matter controller and Thread Border Router features to the mix in recent years—all of which give it a bit more flexibility. But it is still more of a great digital assistant than dedicated smart home system, and anyone looking to build something serious should look elsewhere.

I had already started porting some stuff over to HomeKit a while ago and Apple's ecosystem is actually a vastly superior one to Amazon's for the smart home—it's well worth considering if you're all in on iOS and devices like Apple TV and HomePod, especially with the Thread radio now built into most modern iPhones too.

But even that wasn't quite up to the task of building a DIY smart home to rival professional installations from the likes of Control4 and Crestron; installations that people spend an absolute fortune on.

What I needed was a proper way to manage everything, while at the same time keeping it easy for my family to control our devices using the voice commands and smart buttons that have become normal for them in the past few years. And while I was keen to move on from Alexa as a platform, it is still the assistant my family uses to control all of our smart home.

That's because we've got an Amazon Echo Show smart display in most rooms, which not only work as intercoms so we don't need to shout up and down the stairs, but also manage a bunch of routines that anyone can trigger with simple voice commands. For the sake of ease, I didn't want to change that.

But using Alexa for this required constant care and attention. Not only does it not tell you when a device is offline until you try to use it—which is incredibly frustrating—but in Amazon's quest to make our smart homes easier, it has actually made things harder for anything more than the simplest setups. And the biggest issue for me was duplicate devices.

This is because when you're setting up new devices in your smart home system, Alexa not only uses its cloud-based Skills feature to pair with them, but it also adds certain brand's devices directly when they connect to Echo smart speakers—without you doing anything. This was especially problematic for me with Philips Hue bulbs, when I ended up with four or five variations of the same bulb showing up in the Alexa app.

Not only did this make managing routines a nightmare, it also made voice control unusable. Every time I heard, “I found multiple devices with that name. Try renaming them, or putting them in a group,” a small part of me died.

Trying to keep on top of this chaos was only made all the more difficult when Amazon killed the Alexa web portal in 2022, which was the only place it was possible to mass delete devices. It also rejigged the Alexa app so that all the devices connected—even ones that had been manually disabled—were listed in the same place.

Deleting devices one by one is a huge time suck, and often requires a factory reset of an Echo speaker to clear long-dead devices from its cache. (Pro tip: turn off the Device Discovery option in an Echo speaker's settings before attempting a big Alexa tidy-up.)

What I really needed was to ditch the cloud and make everything run locally. That's always been the goal for smart home “enthusiasts,” but until recently it was easier said than done for anyone unfamiliar with what a YAML file is.

After a shaky start, the emergence of Matter as a serious force for smart home interoperability has made things a lot simpler, but the big driver for me was the fact that Home Assistant is now vastly more user-friendly than it ever has been. It's no longer the Raspberry Pi hacking project of yesteryear; the open-source smart home gold standard is finally plug and play.

That's not to say it's been dumbed down (a criticism that Samsung has faced with its SmartThings platform); it's still incredibly powerful (and incredibly confusing) if you go beyond the surface level.

But for anyone with even the slightest bit of tech savviness, it's now straightforward to have Home Assistant running your smart home, especially with a device like the Home Assistant Green, which is kind of an official Home Assistant hub, and the easiest option for getting started with the platform.

It really is as simple as plug and play, with the Home Assistant OS already loaded and ready to go the moment it's plugged into your router. Once I fired up the app it found a lot of my connected devices automatically and I was able to manually configure pretty much everything else through the vast catalogue of ""Integrations"".

You will need extra antennas to add things like Zigbee and Z-Wave to the mix (which simply plug in via USB) but Home Assistant doesn't really care what the communication protocol is it's using; it lets you mix and match to your heart's content. And for the few things there wasn't official support for, I was able to plug the gap with Matter.

The combination of Home Assistant and Matter means that I have got the bulk of my devices working locally now, which is great for security and stability of course, but also means things like motion sensors triggering lights happen much quicker.

In Home Assistant you don't just see devices as a whole either—instead they are split down into their features so you can just use certain aspects of them. Home Assistant calls these “entities” and it means that you can do things like use the humidity reading from your thermostats or radiator TRVs kick-start your AC, or have a smart speaker remind you to open a window if the air quality drops.

Yes, technically, Alexa can do this too, but it's unreliable and heavily cloud-based. With Home Assistant, I have found it just works because it was built that way from the start.

You can also use these data points to track patterns over time—think energy usage, average temperatures in bedrooms, the amount of times a fridge door is opened every day; there's an endless amount of info that you are able to dive into. And since everything is tracked locally, there are no worries of Big Tech spying on you and your habits.

Home Assistant now powers 90 percent of my automations, a number that could hit 100 percent if I sign up to its $6.50/month cloud subscription. That would let me import Home Assistant automations directly into Alexa (as Scenes) and trigger them by voice.

Getting Home Assistant up and running has also allowed me to start sorting a load of other smart home issues that have been on my to-do list for ages. I had a lot of orphan devices that weren't really connected to anything, and a bunch of discontinued stuff that really needed replacing.

The most high-profile casualties were my Google and Nest devices. I went in pretty hard on Google Home early on, and we could easily have gone down that route as a family instead of Alexa.

But while Google Home has stagnated (with some light on the horizon via Gemini for Home), I still had a bunch of Nest Protect smoke alarms and Nest Cams that needed clearing out. The Protects are now discontinued, and the Cams are pretty poor now, compared to the competition.

The jury is still out on the smoke alarms (I'm currently testing models from Aqara, Shelly and X-Sense, plus First Alert's new smart detector), but for cameras, I've been moving everything to Reolink. Its cameras are packed with features at competitive prices, don't require subscriptions for full functionality, and offer local storage to keep things out of the cloud.

We are now a few months into our new setup and to be honest, my family hasn't noticed much difference. And of course, they weren't supposed to. They are still using Alexa as their voice assistant, as they always have, to turn lights on, adjust the heat, disarm the alarm, or open the blinds.

But for me, as the unofficial house IT manager, removing Alexa as the platform that everything runs on, and streamlining the process has been the long overdue smart home upgrade we needed. The combination of a user-friendly voice assistant out front and a powerful smart home operating system in the background is a huge step up in keeping things running smoothly day in day out. If you've been putting it off, don't. It's easier than you think, and it'll save you a ton of hassle in the long run.

The developers of the big generative AI chatbots are continuing to push out new features at a rapid rate, as they bid to make sure their bot is the one you turn to whenever you need some assistance from artificial intelligence.

One of the latest updates to Google Gemini gives you the ability to set up scheduled actions. These are exactly what they sound like: Tasks that you can get Google Gemini to run automatically, on a schedule. Maybe you want a weather and news report every morning at 7 am, or perhaps you want an evening meal suggestion every evening at 7 pm. Anything you can already get Gemini to do, you can schedule.

It brings Gemini up to speed in this regard with the ChatGPT app, which introduced scheduled tasks several months ago. The idea here is more or less the same: The bot can carry out your commands at a specific point in the future, and keep repeating them if you need to. Here's how the feature works on both platforms.

At the time of writing, this requires a subscription to Google's AI service, which starts at $20 a month for Google AI Pro. The chatbot can keep track of up to 10 scheduled actions at once, so you need to be quite selective about how you use it. You can use scheduled actions in Gemini on the web, and in the mobile apps for Android and iOS.

All you need to do to create a scheduled action in Gemini is to describe it, and include the scheduling details in the prompt. For example, you might tell Gemini to ""generate an image of a cat playing with a ball of yarn, every Monday at 12 pm,"" or ""give me a general knowledge trivia question every evening at 7 pm.""

Scheduled actions can be set to happen once—like next Friday at 3pm, so something happens on a specific day at a specific time. Alternatively, your actions can run on a recurring daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They can't be set on a more complicated cadence (such as every second Tuesday in the month), or surprise you at random.

Gemini should recognize that you've asked it to schedule something, and will present a recap: What you've asked it to do, when, and how frequently. Assuming it's got all of this information correct, you don't need to do anything else. The action runs regardless of whether you have Gemini open at the time, and you'll be alerted to an action running by a notification on your devices (if you've got them turned on) and an email.

You can view and manage your scheduled actions on the web by clicking Settings and help in the left-hand navigation bar, then choosing Scheduled actions. In the mobile app, tap your account picture (top right), then Scheduled actions. Whatever platform you're on, you can pause and delete scheduled actions—on the web, there's also an Edit button to make changes to the action or its timing.

The process is similar in ChatGPT, though these scheduled jobs are called tasks rather than actions. You can create tasks on the web, and in the apps for Android and iOS, but you do need to be paying for one of ChatGPT's various subscription plans. For individual users, plans start at $20 a month with ChatGPT Plus.

You're able to have up to 10 scheduled actions at any one time, and as with Gemini, you can create them simply by describing them: Tell ChatGPT you want it to ""generate a poster for a high-concept sci-fi movie every day at 5 pm"" for example, or ""give me a good reason to go out jogging every Saturday at 8 am."" You can tell ChatGPT to set up recurring tasks, or set them as one-offs for some point in the future.

ChatGPT should identify your intention to create a scheduled task, and confirm the details for you. On the web, you get a little summary box too, inside the chat, and you can click the three dots on this box to make any required changes, and to temporarily pause or permanently delete the task. Tasks will run as scheduled, whether or not you're using ChatGPT at the time.

To view and modify tasks, you need the web interface. Click the three dots on any task box and pick Manage tasks, or click your account avatar (top right), then Settings > Notifications > Manage tasks. The same Notifications panel also lets you choose how you want to be notified when tasks are carried out: Via email alerts, via push notifications on your devices, or via both methods together.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","How Genes Have Harnessed Physics to Grow Living Things","https://www.wired.com/story/how-genes-have-harnessed-physics-to-grow-living-things/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Sip a glass of wine, and you will notice liquid continuously weeping down the wetted side of the glass. In 1855, James Thomson, brother of Lord Kelvin, explained in the Philosophical Magazine that these wine “tears” or “legs” result from the difference in surface tension between alcohol and water. “This fact affords an explanation of several very curious motions,” Thomson wrote. Little did he realize that the same effect, later named the Marangoni effect, might also shape how embryos develop.

In March, a group of biophysicists in France reported that the Marangoni effect is responsible for the pivotal moment when a homogeneous blob of cells elongates and develops a head-and-tail axis — the first defining features of the organism it will become.

The finding is part of a trend that defies the norm in biology. Typically, biologists try to characterize growth, development, and other biological processes as the result of chemical cues triggered by genetic instructions. But that picture has often seemed incomplete. Researchers now increasingly appreciate the role of mechanical forces in biology: forces that push and pull tissues in response to their material properties, steering growth and development in ways that genes cannot.

Modern imaging and measurement techniques have opened scientists' eyes to these forces by flooding the field with data that invites mechanical interpretations. “What has changed over the past decades is really the possibility to watch what happens live, and to see the mechanics in terms of cell movement, cell rearrangement, tissue growth,” said Pierre-François Lenne of Aix Marseille University, one of the researchers behind the recent study.

The shift toward mechanical explanations has revived interest in pre-genetic models of biology. For example, in 1917 the Scottish biologist, mathematician, and classics scholar D'Arcy Thompson published On Growth and Form, which highlighted similarities between the shapes found among living organisms and those that emerge in nonliving matter. Thompson wrote the book as an antidote to what he thought was an excessive tendency to explain everything in terms of Darwinian natural selection. His thesis—that physics, too, shapes us—is coming back into vogue.

“The hypothesis is that physics and mechanics can help us understand the biology at the tissue scale,” said Alexandre Kabla, a physicist and engineer at the University of Cambridge.

The task now is to understand the interplay of causes, where genes and physics somehow act hand in hand to sculpt organisms.

Mechanical models of embryo and tissue growth are not new, but biologists long lacked ways of testing these ideas. Just seeing embryos is difficult; they are small and diffusive, bouncing light in all directions like frosted glass. But new microscopy and image analysis techniques have opened a clearer window on development.

Lenne and his coworkers applied some of the new techniques to observe the motion of cells inside mouse gastruloids: bundles of stem cells that, as they grow, mimic the early stages of embryo growth.

Sham Tlili (left), Pierre-François Lenne (right), and their Aix Marseille University colleagues Simon Gsell and Matthias Merkel have unraveled a Marangoni-like flow pattern that occurs in the early stages of embryogenesis.

Their observations revealed that cells flow up the sides of the gastruloid, then form a stream of tissue flowing down the middle. For Lenne, the system brought to mind a droplet, and on reviewing the literature on the surface tension in a moving droplet, he hit upon the Marangoni effect.

James Thomson's 1855 description of the Marangoni effect explained how, when two liquids that have different surface tensions meet, the fluid with the higher surface tension will pull on the other. This happens because surface tension is just the tendency of the outermost molecules in a fluid to be drawn inward by neighboring molecules. When two fluids meet, the higher-tension fluid will have a stronger pull, so the lower-tension fluid will move in the higher-tension fluid's direction. In a wineglass, the alcohol on the wetted sides of the glass evaporates quickly, leaving a more watery liquid behind. Water has a higher surface tension than alcohol, so the watery sides drag the wine in the glass up to the top of the wetted area. It eventually drips down under its own weight, forming “tears.”

This flow of the wine up the sides and down again is similar to the flow of the tissue in the gastruloid. Indeed, when the team tested a model of Marangoni-type gastruloid tissue flow, they found what they considered a striking fit with their experimental data.

The Marangoni flow is a mechanical effect, but genes are involved, too: They set up the surface tension difference. At first, genes produce a higher concentration of two particular proteins in one part of the blob of cells. These proteins lead to lower surface tension, and so tissue flows away from that region. The tissue moves around the periphery of the gastruloid before recirculating down its center—just as wine tears drip back down the side of a glass. The process elongates the gastruloid. It's “a very nice example of how mechanics, coupled with all the intrinsic complexity of molecular and cellular biology, has a very important role in shaping organisms,” Kabla said.

In 2017, Alan Rodrigues and Amy Shyer couldn't find what they were looking for. The pair, co-leaders of Rockefeller University's Laboratory of Morphogenesis, had been trying to figure out how the regular spacing of a bird's feathers comes about. The popular theory at the time was that bird embryos secrete special molecules called morphogens across their skin tissues. These morphogens would then prompt genes to produce proteins at the right places to form follicles. But the researchers couldn't find any genetic signal that would start the process.

Amy Shyer and Alan Rodrigues, co-leaders of Rockefeller University's Laboratory of Morphogenesis, have homed in on the role of mechanics in shaping bird feather follicles.

They came to suspect that mechanical and tensile forces were playing a significant role. In a 2023 report in Science, their team found that morphogens were indeed secreted just before a feather follicle started to bud. But the morphogens didn't seem to be influencing development on the level of individual cells. Instead, they were influencing larger swaths of tissue. The morphogens affected the tissue's material properties, setting the stage for mechanical forces to push and pull on the tissue for follicle patterning.

“What's really amazed us is that you might be able to get by with a relatively simple amount of instruction from the genetic and molecular level,” said Rodrigues. “Because you have additional emergent processes and properties happening at other levels.”

For Rodrigues, the big issue is how the various processes work together across length scales, from genes to cells to tissues. It's not that everything starts on the smallest scales and builds from there. In the case of avian feather follicle development, changes at the molecular and tissue levels emerge together. The work “challenges the general view across much of biology,” Rodrigues said, “that regulation or causation emerges at the molecular level and then feeds upward across scales to dictate high-level properties such as form.”

Some proteins do affect material properties within individual cells, setting the stage for mechanical forces to act at that level, too. For instance, during the embryogenesis of a fruit fly, cells in the embryo don't just rearrange themselves; Kabla and his coauthors discovered that the cells also stretch. This stretching appears to be directly attributable to gene activity that results in a curious characteristic of the cells' stretchiness.

Take a spring or an elastic material like a rubber band, and the material will extend in proportion to the force applied. This relationship is known as Hooke's law, and it holds quite generally. Unless, that is, the object being stretched is in some kind of viscous fluid, in which case the amount of extension also depends on time. (Think of stirring molasses: It's hard to stir fast.)

Figures from D'Arcy Thompson's 1917 tome On Growth and Form.

Biological organisms appear to share this dependence on time. Several groups have measured the stretching of certain cells in the fruit fly embryo and found that their extension depends on the square root of the amount of time the force is applied. The question then becomes: Where does this behavior come from?

In a paper in Physical Review Letters in June, Konstantin Doubrovinski and colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center explain it in terms of the production of actin, one of the most abundant proteins in these cells. They suggest that the actin filaments effectively pull on the cell like springs as they are produced, creating resistance to the force that stretches the cells and giving rise to the observed behavior.

Doubrovinski and his team verified the role of actin by repeating the experiment using drugs that prevent the actin protein from assembling. “Essentially, the elastic response more or less completely goes away,” he said.

Kabla says that while the study makes a strong case, discussion of the stretching behavior continues. One of the challenges facing biology, he points out, is figuring out what is causing what, and whether a given phenomenon is a key driver of change, a contributing factor, or an unimportant consequence.

These questions echo similar debates over the biological significance of the geometric similarities D'Arcy Thompson cataloged more than 100 years ago. But Thompson's central argument that these geometric forms result from underlying physical forces is standing up to modern scrutiny.

“To many of us,” Kabla said, “it seems natural that where there's motion, mechanics is likely to be involved.”

8/10

NordVPN is probably the most recognizable name in the VPN world. It ranks on just about every list of the best VPNs (including our own), and it's obvious to anyone with an internet connection and vague interest in tech just how aggressive NordVPN's marketing strategy is. It has a high bar to live up to, and thankfully, it does.

Even in the face of a public hack and PR disaster in 2019, not to mention the massive target on its back given how prominent NordVPN is, the core service is still excellent. The speeds can go toe-to-toe with the best VPNs on the market, and Nord's privacy and security practices have been tested and proven effective, even against the company's will.

Further, it has largely led the market on large feature packages alongside its VPN service, which we've seen mimicked by competitors like ExpressVPN. NordVPN still stands tall today, and despite being a little more expensive than I'd like, it feels worth the price.

NordVPN has slowly built up multiple plans at varying prices, each unlocking a new set of features. It doesn't offer a free plan, which is a shame in the face of options like Proton VPN and Nord's own free NordPass password manager. You'll need to pay to get your foot in the door.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

NordVPN's Basic plan is on the expensive side, and as the name suggests, it doesn't come with many extras. You get the VPN, 10 simultaneous connections, and Nord's DNS servers to help combat ads. However, you don't get Threat Protection Pro, which includes more sophisticated ad blocking, as well as malware/scam protection in your browser.

For that, you'll need to upgrade to the Plus plan, which not only includes Threat Protection Pro but also the paid version of NordPass, which is a big upgrade. NordVPN's Basic plan is more expensive than Mullvad and Windscribe, but the Plus plan is more in line with the rest of the market. Compared to Proton, for example, it is an extra $1 per month on the monthly plan.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

Above Plus, there are two more plans, but I wouldn't recommend them for most people. Complete adds 1 terabyte of encrypted cloud storage—Proton offers 500 GB with its cheaper plan—and Prime adds NordProtect, which is an identity theft protection service with $1,000,000 in identity theft insurance.

Plus is where I draw the line, and even with that plan, it's more expensive than most of the market, short of VPNs like ExpressVPN. NordVPN doesn't make much sense month-to-month. It really comes out ahead with multi-year discounts. The biennial plan gives you a massive boost of savings for your initial term—it's a little over $100 for the first 27 months—before transitioning to the full price.

NordVPN has a ton of apps, which is becoming increasingly important, especially when it comes to streaming. Nord has apps for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, and it has extensions available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. It officially maintains Linux clients for a handful of distributions, including Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, and there are even more community-maintained apps. I was able to get NordVPN working on CachyOS, for instance, which is an Arch-based Linux distribution.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

The native apps for Google TV and Apple TV are the gamechangers. For me, it's Google TV, but native apps for smart TV operating systems are quickly becoming a key feature among VPN services. After all, one of the biggest use cases for a VPN is to get around streaming georestrictions, and without a native app, you have to resort to the restrictive, time-intensive process of setting up a VPN on your router.

On desktop, NordVPN still has a solid app, but recent updates have made it worse, not better. It can feel like a walking advertisement if you're not subscribed to NordVPN's Complete plan, with dedicated buttons for features like encrypted cloud storage and Threat Protection Pro in the menu, even if you don't have those features.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

NordVPN has a lot of servers, and it has a lot of specialty servers for things like Tor. Navigating through them—especially among several modules with different Nord Security features—is frustrating. Profiles would go a long way for quick connections, something Proton VPN offers.

One of the features I like in the desktop app is Meshnet. It allows you to create your own private network between devices, up to 10 of your own devices, plus an additional 50 from other NordVPN users. It allows you to transfer files, remotely access devices, and more, all without ever sending your data to the cloud. Nord announced that it would shut the feature down on December 1, but after community backlash, the company changed course.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

I've gotten a lot more mileage out of the Chrome extension. You don't get the server map (you have to select from a list), but there's a condensed list of features compared to the desktop app that are easier to manage. You get Threat Protection to filter ads and malicious websites, as well as split tunneling. The split tunneling works great, allowing you to quickly add websites or IP addresses to bypass the VPN tunnel.

One of the unique features you unlock through the extension is timezone spoofing. If your browser and connection have different timezone details, that can throw up red flags, whether you're logging into your banking service or trying to score a preorder the moment it drops. It's off by default, but turning on spoofing will automatically match your timezone whenever you're connected to the VPN.

NordVPN, like any VPN worth its salt, claims a no-logs policy. More important than that policy, however, is NordVPN's stature within the cybersecurity world. Its privacy and security practices have been tested, not only via third-party audits but also with a very public hack the company experienced in 2019.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

That's the only place to start, not only because it was a public debacle, but also because it was a situation rife with misunderstandings. Like most VPN services, NordVPN does not own all of its servers. Some smaller VPN providers do, but just about every large VPN service rents at least some of the servers it uses.

At a data center in Finland, one of Nord's servers was breached, and the company attributes that breach to improper configuration on the part of the data center provider. Regardless, no user account credentials were compromised, and the breach showed that NordVPN doesn't keep logs, true to its privacy policy. It's easy to be skeptical of a company's word, but I'd like to contrast NordVPN's breach with the public breach of LastPass. The fallout of LastPass' breach is still rippling to this day, and it's responsible for millions of dollars in losses. There's been no evidence of monetary losses related to NordVPN's breach in the past six years.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

A breach is never a good sign, regardless of the circumstances, but the important thing is how NordVPN acted (and continues to act) in light of its breach. Not only was it transparent immediately, but it also put a security plan into action that we've seen play out. That included colocated servers, which NordVPN fully owns and operates, and disk-less servers, where logs literally can't be stored because there's no hard drive to store them on. There was also a security audit, and NordVPN has gone through an audit annually since its breach, with the latest arriving in February of 2025.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

Beyond the basics, NordVPN includes additional security features. You get NordPass, which ranks among the best password managers, and Threat Protection. The Basic plan includes Threat Protection, which is limited. It can block ads and steer you away from sketchy websites, but there are plenty of free browser extensions that accomplish the same thing. Threat Protection Pro is only included with Plus and above, but it does a lot more. It can scan your PC for malware similar to an antivirus program, and it comes with a URL cleaner to strip out tracking information when clicking links.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

One of my favorite new additions isn't on the desktop app, though. NordVPN recently introduced scam call protection on Android, with an iOS version planned for the future. I've been using it for months, and it has easily flagged more than a hundred spam calls to my phone. It works a treat, even if it's not one of NordVPN's big advertised features.

NordVPN is fast. It's not the fastest VPN I've tested—that's Proton VPN—but that's more of a rounding error than a notable difference in speed. Across five US locations, NordVPN dropped 15.32 percent of my unprotected speed on average. For context, Proton dropped 15.23 percent. Surfshark, which is also owned by Nord Security, dropped 18.84 percent, while Mullvad closed in on 24 percent.

So, NordVPN is fast, but more importantly, it's consistent. Across the locations I tested, it never posted a slowdown of more than 20 percent, and in one location (Chicago), it only dropped a meager 6.6 percent of my unprotected speed. Overall, though, that 15 percent drop is a good representation of the speeds you can expect, at least in the US.

NordVPN Plus

Rating: 8/10

Speed testing with any VPN is tricky. There are a ton of factors that influence speeds beyond the server you're connecting to. My speed testing—and any VPN speed testing, for that matter—is a snapshot in time. It provides insight into the kind of speeds you can expect on average, not a concrete number you should expect from every server at every time of day. To get the most accurate snapshot possible, I tested across five US locations at three different times of day over the course of a week. Before each test, I ran three passes of my unprotected speed to get an accurate comparison, and I threw out any results with a greater than 10 percent deviation between passes.

The best way to get around speed hurdles is to change servers, and NordVPN is solid on that front. It has around 7,400 servers, but the exact number is constantly changing. It maintains a database of its servers and locations, complete with details on the features those servers support and whether they're virtual or physical servers.

NordVPN lives up to its monumental name. It still has a massive network, fast speeds, and a ton of features, and despite its infamous data breach, it has continued to double down on security measures. The main issue with Nord is the price. You can score a good deal on a two-year discount, but that price jumps up significantly when it comes time to renew. This is why I rank it slightly below Proton VPN, despite the two services going toe-to-toe on features and speeds. Proton Unlimited clocks in at the same monthly price as NordVPN Basic, and it comes with Proton Pass, Proton Mail, and a handful of other apps.

NordVPN Plus

Shopping for gifts for the gym bros in your life? These aren't your average gym-goers. You know the type. If they're always trying to hit a PR (personal record), chug pre-workout like water, and have invisible lat syndrome, then you've got a gym bro on your gift list. They may be deep in their CrossFit era or setting fitness goals for 2026, but these holiday gifts will speak their language: practical, durable, and guaranteed to make them say, “Bro, this is clutch.” Let's pass on the gift card to Dick's Sporting Goods this year; here are the best fitness gifts for gym bros.

Be sure to check out our other gift guides as well, including Adventurous Gifts for Hikers, Backpackers, and Outdoorsy People, the Best Gifts for Rock Climbers, and the Best Gifts for Men, Manly Men, and Menly Man Men.

Hyperice

Amazon

Hyperice

REI

Your gym bro never stops moving. Monday: chest. Tuesday: back. You can't skip leg day, and real ones don't forget about cardio. With that kind of split, muscle recovery is a nonnegotiable. The Hyperice Hypervolt 2 is the best value massage gun for when the hammies are crying louder than his “Get Swole” playlist. It's lighter and quieter than a Theragun but still powerful with its 60-watt brushless motor. They'll get five attachments, three hours of battery life, and Bluetooth connectivity for guided routines in the Hyperice app.

Check out our guide to the Best Massage Guns for more gift ideas.

Whoop

Whoop (One)

Whoop (Peak)

Whoop (Life)

Real bros don't read screens on their fitness trackers. (Real bros don't read, amirite? No?) The Whoop MG is the bro-iest fitness tracker because its proprietary algorithm doesn't measure sissy little metrics like how many steps you took. The Whoop doesn't care if you got up every hour! Instead, Strain is a scale from 1 to 21 based on the Borg rating of perceived exertion. Strain takes into account your previous day's recovery, so the Strain score you earn day to day, even from the same activities, will be different. It's also not linear, so getting your Strain score from 16 to 17 is much harder than getting your score from 4 to 5.

Took 17,000 steps? Not enough. Spent 2 hours rock climbing? Also not enough for your gains. Even gym bros need a break from powerlifting every day, so this year Whoop did introduce new features like Healthspan, Pace of Aging, and other cardiac features with the Whoop MG and the Whoop Life membership to help a bro monitor more than just their muscle growth.—Adrienne So

Transparent Labs

Transparent Labs

Amazon

For the gym bro who talks about macros like I talk about the Real Housewives. Transparent Labs is one of the few supplement brands that tests both ingredients and finished products for heavy metals, and it posts the results online. (Because nothing ruins a pump quite like lead poisoning.) The Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate is sourced from hormone-free cows and skips the dyes and artificial sweeteners. Each serving delivers 28 grams of protein, but if your broski's deep in a bulking era, the Mass Gainer comes with 50 grams of protein and 100 grams of carbs. Consumer Reports has vetted the Sweet Vanilla flavor for daily consumption.

If you're thinking protein powders, but maybe not this one, check out some of our other tested favorites.

BlueAnt

Amazon

Our favorite gym workout headphones, the BlueAnt Pump X have a pretty remarkable standout feature. You can swap out the regular ear pads for cooling gel ear pads that you can keep in the fridge. If your bro has ever found that keeping noise-canceling headphones on his head while he concentrates on his form makes him too sweaty, these are worth a shot. These work remarkably well, even if the condiment drawer in the fridge is a weird place to store workout equipment.—Adrienne So

BlenderBottle

BlenderBottle

Amazon

Rule number one: a gym bro can never have too many shaker bottles. It's a gym essential and the perfect gift when you don't know too much about your homie. The BlenderBottle Classic is the OG of shaker bottles: measurement markings, a spout guard to prevent spills, and a carry loop for keeping grubby hands off the mouthpiece (or clipping on keys). Its rounded base and BlenderBall whisk crush clumps, so every sip is smooth(ish), depending on the protein powder, of course. It's BPA- and phthalate-free, dishwasher-safe, and available in three sizes (20, 28, and 45 ounces).

Thorne

Thorne

Amazon

When it comes to gifting wellness supplements, don't surprise them with new products. Think restocks and upgrades, not reinventing their diet. And even the newbies know about creatine. Creatine won't turn you into the Rock overnight, but when paired with weightlifting and a nutritious diet, it can help preserve strength and lean body mass. There are several versions out there, but stick to monohydrate; it's the most studied, the most reliable, and usually, the most affordable. Thorne's flavorless powder is perfect for blending into smoothies or mixing with water before a workout. Pro tip: when they hit you with a “Bro, I'm looking swole lately” after three days on creatine, maybe don't mention it's mostly water weight. Let them have this one.

R.A.D.

R.A.D.

Yes, your bro has been lifting in Chuck Taylors for his whole life and they're fine. But if he needs an upgrade, may we suggest R.A.D. shoes, which are designed for gym, HIIT, CrossFit, and hybrid workouts and are soft enough to run on the treadmill. The rubber rand protects his feet for ropework and like his beloved Chucks, the sole is flat for stability with lifting and doing drills like box jumps. Also, they look the best. (Don't like them? Check out our guide to running shoes here.)—Adrienne So

Body scales—like dietary supplements—should be a request, not a surprise; I would only gift one if they've explicitly said they want one. Nevertheless, this is for the gym rat who tracks macros in their sleep. If they're logging every rep, meal, and REM cycle, they'll love the Runstar FG2015 Smart Scale. Unlike a standard foot-only scale, this one has a retractable handle with electrodes that scan your whole body and analyze muscle mass, water weight, and visceral fat. Does that average person need that level of detail? No, but if they're bodybuilding, bulking, or just like to boast about their body fat percentage in decimals, it's a total game-changer.

For more recommendations, we've weighed in on some more smart scales in this guide.

Manduka

Amazon

Manduka

Real gym bros are not afraid to stretch. The Manduka ProLite is my personal favorite because it's versatile enough for mobility work, hot mat pilates, and strength training. The closed-cell PVC surface keeps out sweat, bacteria, and whatever else's festering on the gym floor. Dense enough to cushion knees without feeling squishy, and latex- and phthalate-free. Also, an awesome addition to their home gym (because you know they have one).

More yoga mat options can be found here.

Hydro Flask

Amazon

Hydro Flask

The Hydro Flask is the ultimate gift for a gym lover. Built like a dumbbell, it can survive being dropped, dented, and yeeted into any gym bag or back seat. It keeps water cold for hours, and comes in a ton of sizes and colors. Order directly from the site, and you can customize the lid, strap, and bottle; you can also engrave their name so no one accidentally walks off with their bottle again.

For more recommendations, we have a Best Reusable Water Bottles guide.

According to a new report from the International Energy Agency, the world will spend $580 billion on data centers this year — $40 billion more than will be spent finding new oil supplies.

Those numbers help to illustrate some big shifts in the global economy, and comparing data centers and oil seems particularly apt given concerns about how generative AI might accelerate climate change.

Kirsten Korosec, Rebecca Bellan, and I discussed the report's findings on the latest episode of TechCrunch's Equity podcast.

There's no question that these new data centers are going to be hungry for power, and that they could place even more stress on already taxed electrical grids. But Kirsten pointed to a potential upside, with solar poised to power many of these new projects, which could also create new opportunities for startups pursuing innovative approaches to renewable energy.

We also discussed how these projects will be funded, with OpenAI saying it has committed  $1.4 trillion to building data centers, Meta committing $600 billion, and Anthropic recently announcing a $50 billion data center plan.

You can read a preview of our conversation, edited for length and clarity, below.

Kirsten: Here's what I think is the potential upside. So Tim De Chant, who's our climate tech reporter, has done a ton of reporting about not just data centers, but actually how a lot of data centers are turning to renewables because in terms of regulatory [hurdles] and cost, they are the go-to. It's a lot easier to get a permit to throw up a bunch of solar panels adjacent to a data center.

So to me, the one upside is that it could really mean a positive for any kind of company that is doing interesting things around renewables or data center design and some of the technology to reduce the global emissions component of it.

But of course, the sheer number to me is what really stood out. As a former energy reporter myself, I know how much is spent on trying to find new oil.

Rebecca: I mean, it's a lot. And a lot of that's coming from the U.S. I think that report found that half of the electricity demand will be coming from the U.S., and the rest is a mix of China and Europe.

And another thing that struck me about it was that most of the data centers are coming to cities, or near cities, like populations of a million people, roughly. So that means there's a lot more challenge with the grid connection and with connection pathways. I think that, to your point, renewables will have to [be a focus] — it's just good business, it's not because of any environmentally friendly policies.

Kirsten: Redwood Materials' new business unit, Redwood Energy, is going to be an interesting company to watch with this. A few months ago, I went to their big reveal, and they're taking the old EV batteries that aren't quite ready to be recycled, and then they're creating these microgrids, and then specifically going after AI data centers. And that, to me, would alleviate the problem or the concern that you just mentioned.

The question is: Are other companies going to do this? Are there other Redwood Energies out there that are trying to do the same thing? And how much of an impact could they make? Because I do think that like the pressure on the electrical grid, especially during certain times of the year, like in the middle of the summer, for instance, places like Texas that have rolling brownouts and blackouts, that is going to be a real concern. And it could spur a whole new kind of investment into companies doing what Redwood is doing.

Anthony: It also underlines this question about what is that going to do to the spaces that we live in? Even if they're not in cities themselves, I feel like the landscape is definitely going to be transformed by construction at this scale.

And then, of course, there's also this question of how much of [the planned data centers are]  actually going to get built because there's definitely very ambitious plans that require huge amounts of spending.

To start with OpenAI, that's a company that a lot of people have been talking about, how much money are they actually making versus the trillions of dollars of capital commitments they have for the next decade. And then there was this whole controversy over their CFO saying, “The government should backstop our loans to build these data centers.” And then she's like, “No, no, no, no, no, I didn't mean backstop, that was a poor choice of words,” but it does look like they have been asking for an expansion of tax credits from the CHIPS Act. 

I think that this is going to be an effort that's not just going to fall on the companies, but also on the government — or at least that's going to be a question that the government is considering over the next few years.

Maybe I've just had bad luck, but since I started hosting my own websites back around 2005 or so, my servers have always been attacked basically from the moment they come online. Even more so when you attach any sort of DNS name to it, especially when you use TLS and the certificates, guessing because they end up in a big index that is easily accessible (the ""transparency logs""). Once you start sharing your website, it again triggers an avalanche of bad traffic, and the final boss is when you piss of some organization and (I'm assuming) they hire some bad actor to try to make you offline.Dealing with crawlers, bot nets, automation gone wrong, pissed of humans and so on have been almost a yearly thing for me since I started deploying stuff to the public internet. But again, maybe I've had bad luck? Hosted stuff across wide range of providers, and seems to happen across all of them.

I never felt this made the internet ""unsafe"". Instead, it just reminded me how I messed up. Every time, I learned how to do better, and I added more guardrails. I haven't gotten popped that obviously in a long time, but that's probably because I've acted to minimize my public surface area, used star-certs to avoid being in the cert logs, added basic auth whenever I can, and generally refused to _trust_ software that's exposed to the web. It's not unsafe if you take precautions, have backups, and are careful about what you install.If you want to see unsafe, look at how someone who doesn't understand tech tries to interact with it. Downloading any random driver or exe to fix a problem, installing apps when a website would do, giving Facebook or Tiktok all of their information and access without recognizing that just maybe these multi-billion-dollar companies who give away all of their services don't have your best interests in mind.

That said, we can likely do better. Cloudflare does good in part because Cloudflare runs so much traffic, so they have a lot of data across the internet. Smaller operators just don't get enough traffic to really deal with banning abusive IPs without banning entire ranges indefinitely, not ideal. I hope to see a solution like Crowdsec where reputation data can be crowdsourced to block known bad bots (at least for a while since they are likely borrowing IPs) while using low complexity (potentially JS-free) challenges for IPs with no bad reputation. It's probably too much to ask for Anubis upstream which is probably already too busy dealing with the challenges of what it already does at the scale it is operating, but it does leave some room for further innovation for whoever wants to go for it.In my opinion there is at least no reason why it is not plausible to have a drop-in solution that can mostly resolve these problems and make it easier for hobbyists to run services again.

I really don't understand why they do this, and it's mostly some shady origins, like vps game server hoster from Brazil and so on.I'm at the point where i capture all the traffic and looks for SYN packets, check the RDAP records for them to decide if I then drop the entire subnets of that organization, whitelisting things like Google.Digital Ocean is notoriously a source of bad traffic, they just don't care at all.

The conclusion back then was that it's impossible to make a threshold that is both low enough and high enough.You need some other mechanism that can distinguish bad traffic from good (even if imperfectly), and then adjust the threshold based on it. See, for instance, ""Proof of Work can Work"": https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~rich/class/cs293b-cloud/papers/lu...

It's possible that the services that reward users for running proxies (or are bundled with mobile apps with a notice buried in the license) would also start rewarding/hiding compute services as well. There's currently no money in it because proof-of-work is so rare, but if it changes, their strategy might too.

Very crudely if you think that a request costs the server ~10ms of compute time and a phone is 30x slower then you'd need 300ms of client compute time to equal it which seems very reasonable.The only problem is you would need a cryptocurrency that a) lets you verify tiny chunks of work, and b) can't be done faster than you can do it on a phone using other hardware, and c) lets a client mine money without being to actually spend it (""homomorphic mining""?).I don't know if anything like that exists but it would be an interesting problem to solve.

I still think it is possible with some customized variant of RandomX. The server could even make a bit of money by acting as a mining pool by forcing the clients to mine a certain block template. It's just that it would need to be installed as a browser plugin or something, it wouldn't be efficient running within a page.

because if you make the requirement like that, its basically cancel out the other effect

Maybe the long-term solution for such attacks is to hide most of the internet behind some kind of Proof of Work system/network, so that mostly humans get to access to our websites, not machines.

reply

The web is really stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to this.  Proof of work helps website owners, but makes life harder for all discovery tools and search engines.An independent standard for request signing and building some sort of reputation database for verified crawlers could be part of a solution, though that causes problems with websites feeding crawlers different content than users, an does nothing to fix the Sybil attack problem.

International law enforcement on the Internet would also subject you to the laws of other countries. It goes both ways.Having to comply with all of the speech laws and restrictions in other countries is not actually something you want.

Maybe pseudo-anonymity and “punishment” via reputation could work. Then an oppressive government with access to a subversive website (ignoring bad security, coordination with other hijacked sites, etc.) can only poison its clients' reputations, and (if reputation is tied to sites, who have their own reputations) only temporarily.

reply

Already happens. Oppressive governments already punish people for visiting ""wrong"" websites. They already censor internet.There are no technological solutions to coordination problems. Ultimately, no matter what you invent, it's politics that will decide how it's used and by whom.

I don't think you need world-wide law-enforcement, it'll be a big step ahead if you make owners & operators liable. You can limit exposure so nobody gets absolutely ruined, but anyone running wordpress 4.2 and getting their VPS abused for attacks currently has 0 incentive to change anything unless their website goes down. Give them a penalty of a few hundred dollars and suddenly they do. To keep things simple, collect from the hosters, they can then charge their customers, and suddenly they'll be interested in it as well, because they don't want to deal with that.The criminals are not held liable, and neither are their enablers. There's very little chance anything will change that way.

Another potential cause: It's way easier for pretty much any person connected to the internet to ""create"" their own automation software by using LLMs. I could wager even the less smart LLMs could handle ""Create a program that checks this website every second for any product updates on all pages"" and give enough instructions for the average computer user to be able to run it without thinking or considering much.Multiply this by every person with access to an LLM who wants to ""do X with website Y"" and you'll get an magnitude increase in traffic across the internet. This been possible since what, 2023 sometime? Not sure if the patterns would line up, but just another guess for the cause(s).

How about a reputation system?Attached to IP address is easiest to grok, but wouldn't work well since addresses lack affinity.  OK, so we introduce an identifier that's persistent, and maybe a user can even port it between devices.  Now it's bad for privacy.  How about a way a client could prove their reputation is above some threshold without leaking any identifying information?  And a decentralized way for the rest of the internet to influence their reputation (like when my server feels you're hammering it)?Do anti-DDoS intermediaries like Cloudflare basically catalog a spectrum of reputation at the ASN level (pushing anti-abuse onus to ISP's)?This is basically what happened to email/SMTP, for better or worse :-S.

20+ years ago there were mail blacklists that basically blocked residential IP blocks as there should not be servers trying to send normal mail from there. Now you must try the opposite, blacklist blocks where only servers and not end users can come from, as there is potentially bad behaved scrapers in all major clouds and server hosting platforms.But then there are residential proxies that pay end users to route requests from misbehaved companies, so that door is also a bad mitigation

Services need the ability to obtain an identifier that:- Belongs to exactly one real person.- That a person cannot own more than one of.- That is unique per-service.- That cannot be tied to a real-world identity.- That can be used by the person to optionally disclose attributes like whether they are an adult or not.Services generally don't care about knowing your exact identity but being able to ban a person and not have them simply register a new account, and being able to stop people from registering thousands of accounts would go a long way towards wiping out inauthentic and abusive behaviour.The ability to “reset” your identity is the underlying hole that enables a vast amount of abuse. It's possible to have persistent, pseudonymous access to the Internet without disclosing real-world identity. Being able to permanently ban abusers from a service would have a hugely positive effect on the Internet.

It would be way to easy for the current regime (whomever that happens to be) to criminalize random behaviors (Trans People?  Atheists? Random nationality?)  to ban their identity, and then they can't apply for jobs, get bus fare, purchase anything online, communicate with their lawyers, etc.

It's very explainable. And somehow, like clockwork, there are always comments to say “there is nothing new, the Internet has always been like this since the 80s”.You know, part of me wants to see AI proliferate into more and more areas, just so these people will finally wake up eventually and understand there is a huge difference when AI does it. When they are relentlessly bombarded with realistic phone calls from random numbers, with friends and family members calling about the latest hoax and deepfake, when their own specific reputation is constantly attacked and destroyed by 1000 cuts not just online but in their own trusted circles, and they have to put out fires and play whack-a-mole with an advanced persistent threat that only grows larger and always comes from new sources, anonymous and not.And this is all before bot swarms that can coordinate and plan long-term, targeting specific communities and individuals.And this is all before humanoid robots and drones proliferate.Just try to fast-forward to when human communities online and offline are constantly infiltrated by bots and drones and sleeper agents, playing nice  for a long time and amassing karma / reputation / connections / trust / whatever until finally doing a coordinated attack.Honestly, people just don't seem to get it until it's too late. Same with ecosystem destruction — tons of people keep strawmanning it as mere temperature shifts, even while ecosystems around the world get destroyed. Kelp forests. Rainforests. Coral reefs. Fish. Insects. And they're like “haha global warming by 3 degrees big deal. Temperature has always changed on the planet.” (Sound familiar?)Look, I don't actually want any of this to happen. But if they could somehow experience the movie It's a Wonderful Life or meet the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, I'd wholeheartedly want every denier to have that experience. (In fact, a dedicated attacker can already give them a taste of this with current technology. I am sure it will  become a decentralized service soon :-( )

In the early days I put Google Analytics on the site so I could observe traffic trends. Then, we were all forced to start adding certificates to our sites to keep them ""safe"".While I think we're all doomed to continue that annual practice or get blocked by browsers, I have often considered removing Google Analytics. Ever since their redesign it is essentially unusable for me now. What benefit does it bring if I can't understand the product anymore?Last year, in a fit of desperation, I added Cloudflare. This has a brute force ""under attack"" mode that seems to stop all bots from accessing the site. It puts up a silly ""hang on a second, are you human"" page before the site loads, but it does seem to work. It is great UX? No, but at least the site isn't getting hammered by various locations in Asia.

1) Most of the civilized world no longer has hereditary dictators (such as ""kings""). Because they were removed from power by the people and the power was distributed among many individuals. It works because malicious (anti-social) individuals have trouble working together. And yes, oversight helps.But it's a spectrum and we absolutely can and should move the needle towards more oversight and more power distribution.2) Corporate power structures are still authoritarian. We can change that too.

That's not how culture evolves. You don't necessarily need to have a problem so that a solution is developed. You can very well have a technology developed for other purposes, or just for exploration sake, and then as this tech exists uses for it start to pop post hoc.You therefore ignore the immense benefit of access to information that technology has, something that wasn't necessarily a problem for the common man but once its there, the popularization of the access to information, they adapt and grow dependent on it.

A friend of mine, who had a similar opinion on technology, once watched a movie that seemed to reinforce it in his eyes, and tried to persuade me as if it was the ultimate proof that all technology is evil.The plot depicted a happy small tribe of indigenous people deep in the rainforest, who never ever saw any artifacts of civilization. They never knew war, homicide, or theft. Basically, they knew no evil. Then, one day, a plane flies over and someone frivolously tosses an emptied bottle of Coca-Cola out of the window (sic!). A member of the tribe finds it in the forest and brings back to the village. And, naturally, everyone else wants to get hold of the bottle, because it's so supernatural and attractive. But the guy decides he's the only owner, refuses and then of course kills those who try to get it by force, and all hell breaks loose in no time.""See"", - concludes my friend triumphally, - ""the technology brought evil into this innocent tribe!""But don't you think that evil already lurked in those people to start with, if they were ready to kill each other for shiny things?"" - I asked, quite baffled.""Oh, come on, so you're just supporting this shit!"" was the answer...

I haven't booked too deep into the research on it, but because powerful agricultural interests are involved, I'm sure nobody is looking too closely at externalities and would prefer to keep it that way.

https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1716995115> Despite numerous experiments spanning several decades, no direct observations of this process exist. Here, measurements from radars and aircraft-mounted cloud physics probes are presented that together show the initiation, growth, and fallout to the mountain surface of ice crystals resulting from glaciogenic seeding. These data, by themselves, do not address the question of cloud seeding efficacy, but rather form a critical set of observations necessary for such investigations. These observations are unambiguous and provide details of the physical chain of events following the introduction of glaciogenic cloud seeding aerosol into supercooled liquid orographic clouds.Apparently the goal is to turn supercooled water droplets into ice crystals. This makes a more physical sense than what was my first guess, seeding condensation nuclei. But seeding condensation would release a lot of heat, since the heat of condensation is pretty big, while the heat of fusion is quite a bit smaller.

While the thing the chemtrail people claim that seems dubious is the scale and other nuances - claiming that all contrails are chemtrails.  It's the scale that we don't know and that I assume it's pretty small because it seems expensive and pointless to do it constantly.  But I don't know how I could ascertain the scale at which it's done either.

Iran has desalination facilities(75 in 2022 to be exact). But not enough and obviously only by the water. Iran has way less energy production than Saudi Arabia, which per capita would put it at a 4th or so. That's with the fact that Iran is a massively industrialized economy which none of the states in the area are. A lot of the UAE and especially the modern desalination plants are built in collaboration with France, Spain, China and Japan. Desalination technology transfer and construction by third parties in Iran is specifically restricted by the US.One of the things that would have helped Iran's energy problems is nuclear energy and we all know how that goes. It's kinda cute how you don't think that every single one of these facilities is a target for the US and Israel if Iran does not have any weapons deterrent. Iraq's civil infrastructure was leveled by the US in the beginning of the war in 2003.

That trend is a consequence. A consequence of people being too lazy to think for themselves. Critical thinking is more difficult than simply thinking for yourself, so if someone is too lazy to make an effort and reaches for an LLM at once, they're by definition ill-equipped to be critical towards the cultural/moral ""side-channel"" of the LLM's output.This is not new. It's not random that whoever writes the history books for students has the power, and whoever has the power writes the history books. The primary subject matter is just a carrier for indoctrination.Not that I disagree with you. It's always been important to use tools in ways unforeseen, or even forbidden, by their creators.Personally, I distrust -- based on first hand experience -- even the primary output of LLMs so much that I only reach for them as a last resort. Mostly when I need a ""Google Search"" that is better than Google Search. Apart from getting quickly verifiable web references out of LLMs, their output has been a disgrace for me. Because I'm mostly opposed even to the primary output of LLMs, to begin with, I believe to be somewhat protected from their creators' subliminal messaging. I hope anyway.

Ablation in post isn't good enough - it usually does 10% of ""expunge the data you want expunged"", 70% of ""make the data you want expunged less accessible"", and 20% of ""collateral damage"". Training for refusals doesn't damage the capabilities much - it just make them harder to access. If someone has access to model weights, neither holds.

Spending $200 on a computer doesn't have to mean settling for some sort of sluggish Chromebook that stutters on simple tasks and forces you into cloud-only workflows. If you're okay connecting a few cables and pairing your own keyboard and mouse, mini PCs deliver serious computing power in a package smaller than most textbooks. The GMKtec Nucbox G3S (512GB SSD, 16GB RAM, Intel N95 CPU) just dropped to an all-time low of $189 on Amazon, down from its usual $249.

See at Amazon

The Nucbox G3S runs on Intel's 12th generation Alder Lake N95 processor that is a quad-core chip with four threads and 6MB of cache that turbos up to 3.4GHz when you push it. This processor represents a significant 36% performance improvement over older N5105 and N5095 chips that populate budget mini PCs, giving you noticeably faster application launches and smoother multitasking. The architecture handles everyday computing tasks without the lag or stuttering that cheaper processors introduce.

GMKtec equipped this mini PC with 16GB of DDR4 RAM and squarely plants it within the productivity sweet spot where memory is rarely your bottleneck. That much capacity lets you keep dozens of browser tabs open, run virtual meetings while taking notes, and switch between applications without waiting for programs to reload from scratch. The 512GB M.2 2242 SSD provides fast storage that boots Windows in seconds and loads files almost instantly compared to traditional spinning hard drives. SSDs access data electronically rather than waiting for physical disk platters to rotate into position which transforms the entire computing experience from frustratingly slow to pleasantly responsive.

The two HDMI 2.0 ports support 4K displays running at 60Hz simultaneously and give you a huge workspace across two monitors with no performance compromises. If you are a professional that works with several open documents, or a designer who wants to refer to images while they create, and anybody who has consistently alt-tabbed through windows, the option for two full screens will immediately come in handy. With the upgraded Intel graphics at their maximum of 1000MHz, 4K video playback is really smooth.

Connectivity options cover modern needs with three USB 3.2 ports that transfer data at up to 10Gbps, and make external drive backups and file transfers genuinely fast rather than overnight affairs. The gigabit Ethernet RJ45 port delivers rock-solid wired network speeds of 1000Mbps, perfect for large downloads, video conferencing, or situations where WiFi congestion slows everyone down. WiFi 5 handles wireless connectivity when you can't run a cable, and Bluetooth 5.0 connects your wireless keyboard, mouse, headphones, and other peripherals without creating a tangle of cables on your desk. The 3.5mm audio jack supports wired headphones or external speakers when you want better sound than monitor speakers typically provide.

Setting this mini PC up requires you to bring your own monitor, keyboard, and mouse, but most people have those peripherals already on hand or can pick up budget options that still serve up perfectly functional performance. At $189, you're building a complete Windows desktop system for less than the cost of a single RAM upgrade in many pre-built machines.

It seems Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has set his sights on a new wild goose to chase. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services has made clear his intention to probe whether antidepressant drugs like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, can be blamed for causing mass shootings.

Last week, Kennedy announced via a post on X that he would task the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to study “the long-taboo question of whether SSRIs and other psychoactive drugs contribute to mass violence.” But while more research into this topic might be worthwhile, the data so far doesn't support a causative link, many experts say.

“SSRIs are generally safe and effective medications, and there is no overwhelming evidence that these drugs alone would cause patients who are taking them to commit acts of violence,” Gregory Brown, Chair of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Communications, told Gizmodo.

This isn't the first time that RFK Jr. has brought up SSRIs as a possible factor causing mass violence.

In late August, following a school shooting in Minnesota that left two students dead and dozens injured, Kennedy went on Fox News and stated that he would launch studies looking into the role that SSRIs and other drugs used to treat mental illness might play in causing such incidents. In early September, during a conference announcing his “Make America Healthy Again” report on children, he made a similar promise, though he claimed the National Institutes of Health would be in charge of this planned research.

The idea that psychiatric medications can set off mass shooters certainly isn't new. Nearly a decade ago, for instance, speculation arose that anti-anxiety drugs fueled Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock's killing spree in 2017.

Contrary to Kennedy's insinuation that scientists are afraid to study the topic, however, several studies have tried to look for a possible association between the use of these drugs and mass violence.

In a 2019 study, for instance, researchers combed through reports of school shootings recorded by the FBI between 2000 and 2017 (49 in total). They found that most school shooters had no documented history of taking psychotropic medications. And even in cases when they did, the researchers failed to find a “direct or causal association” with these medications.

In another 2019 report, which examined data from 167 mass shootings collected by The Violence Project, researchers found that about 20% of shooters had used psychotropic medications, comparable to the rate of use among the general public (around 17%, per a 2017 study).

And this September, a team of researchers led by Ragy Girgis, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, studied data from over 800 mass shootings in the U.S. They found that just 4% of shooters had any lifetime history of using antidepressants, well below the typical rate of use in the general public (12%), and that 6.6% had used any psychotropic drug at all.

The California State Association of Psychiatrists (CSAP) also issued an explicit rebuttal of RFK Jr.'s attempt to link SSRIs to mass shootings, following his comments in September.

“This is simply not true. What worries us most is that such statements can scare people away from getting the care they need and deserve,” the CSAP stated.

Mass shootings are a complex phenomenon, and for many who carry out these acts, there are likely to be several explanations why.

One of these explanations can be severe mental illness, such as psychosis, though probably not to the extent that many would assume. A 2022 study by the same Columbia team found that only about 5% of mass shootings might be linked to severe mental illness, such as psychosis.

What does seem to be a substantial mental health factor in mass shootings is suicidality. Roughly half of mass shooters will either kill themselves or try to provoke a lethal confrontation with law enforcement (“suicide by cop”), and perhaps around two-thirds express suicidal ideation before or during the shooting.

That factor could help explain why some research has found a potential relationship between antidepressant use and violence in general, according to Girgis.

“They find a close relationship because people who are suicidal or violent also have much worse depression. And people with worse depression are more likely to be treated with antidepressant medications. So that's why we see this relationship,” Girgis told Gizmodo. “But it's not causative.”

While SSRIs do carry a warning label claiming they might raise the risk of suicidal ideation and behaviors in people under 25, it's a controversial one. Many researchers, including Girgis, now argue otherwise (or at least that the warning has done more harm than good), and some studies have actually found SSRIs can reduce suicide risk in younger people. Notably, Girgis' study this September found no difference in the rate of mass shooters dying by suicide whether they were taking an antidepressant or not.

During the Fox News interview in August, RFK Jr. also appeared to claim SSRIs carry a black box warning that they can increase the risk of homicidal intent. Whether he misspoke or deliberately peddled a falsehood, that's just flatly not true.

At least some of the reason why people might latch onto SSRIs as a factor behind mass shootings is sensationalism, Girgis argues.

“I think these sorts of events, when there are reports of a mass shooter taking a psychiatric medication or having a psychiatric condition, tend to make the event more of a headline and more attention grabbing. That's one reason there's this attention bias to it,” he said.

Still others might want to blame mental health or the drugs used to treat it for these incidents because it'll deflect attention from more relevant factors, such as the wide proliferation of firearms in the U.S. or the ease with which someone can obtain them.

All that said, the experts I spoke to still welcome more research into this topic, provided that it's done well.

“While I cannot predict results of any future research studies, ongoing research efforts—especially unbiased peer-reviewed research—can often provide useful information about the safety and efficacy of psychotropic medications,” Brown said.

The trouble is, we're talking about RFK Jr. here. Since taking over HHS, Kennedy has repeatedly steamrolled over the scientific process to get his agenda across. He's unilaterally dismissed outside experts on vaccine safety, installed allies sympathetic to the anti-vaccination movement, and allegedly fired former CDC chief Susan Monarez when she refused to rubberstamp policy changes recommended by the latter group.

Science Keeps Dismantling Trump's Tylenol-Autism Scare

More recently, he and President Donald Trump have tried to officially blame autism on the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy—an explanation that many experts and health authorities do not support. The FDA is trying to initiate a labeling change to acetaminophen products that would warn pregnant women about the supposed autism risk, even as Kennedy has admitted that they don't yet have proof of a causative link.

The above could be the most illustrative example of what may happen if RFK Jr. gets his SSRI study off the ground. The overall evidence to date doesn't point to these drugs being a major culprit in mass shootings. But that alone might not stop Kennedy and the Trump White House from claiming otherwise.

Add San Diego and Las Vegas to the list of cities getting the Waymo treatment. The company says those cities should see self-driving Waymo vehicles on the road soon as it launches service there in 2026.

Oh, and also the frequently icy streets of Detroit.

Even though Waymo's cabs (the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace and Zeekr RT) will be in manual mode with a human driver controlling the car at first, the Google spin-off company will be gearing up for autonomous operations soon in those new locales. Waymo already has driverless operations in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix, Arizona, and is driving with safety drivers in New York City and Denver and in partnership with Uber in Atlanta and Austin. Plans for more autonomous taxi trips include Washington, D.C. and more of the San Francisco Bay Area.

But if the mention of Detroit and Denver alongside the sun-soaked streets of Chandler, Arizona and Santa Monica, California seems out of place, well, it sure is. If Waymo can pull this off, it will be some of the first fully autonomous operations where the roads are slick with wet, slippery ice and visibility is terrible and dark for more hours of the day.

Tesla owners have access to Full Self-Driving mode in all of Tesla's EVs, and have been a litmus test for autonomous driving in inclement weather outside of the winter-free zones Waymo (along with Amazon's Zoox in SF and Las Vegas and the now-defunct General Motors-owned Cruise in SF, Phoenix, Miami, Nashville and several Texas cities) has historically operated. As Reddit forums have discussed for the past few years, once the weather gets rough, self-driving mode isn't much help. As one user urged, “…don't rely on a robot to drive you in the snow.”

Waymo anticipated concerns and doubts about driving in a place like Detroit known for its “harshest winter” and put out a blog post at the end of last month about driving in all types of weather. It claims its next generation driver tech has trained enough to handle snowy conditions.

Waymo says its AI can notice when there's snow, slush or ice versus a normal, dry road and adjusts its behavior accordingly. “Each vehicle essentially acts as a mobile weather station, gathering data to inform its own driving decisions and share with the rest of the fleet in the city,” the post reads.

The need to conquer winter was inevitable. The robofleets can only drive around the same SF streets for so long battling the occasional sprinkle and late-night fog bank. Advanced imaging company Ubicept has been preparing imaging tech for more challenging conditions. And wondering when companies like Waymo would want to expand beyond the sun belt and coastal California. As Ubicept co-founder and CTO Tristan Swedish explained in a recent call, challenging scenarios like winter puts vision systems and sensor suites to the test.

“When you move to a more adverse weather scenario there are ways to overcome those challenges using advanced perception systems,” he said, contrasting the ease of summertime autonomous driving in “well-behaved environments” like SF and Vegas.

Swedish noted the trend to add more cameras, radar and LiDAR sensors to fight the limitations of seeing through things like nighttime fog and a snowstorm. But, “the more sensors you have the more likely you have to fail,” he said. “It makes the system less reliable, and more expensive.”

Companies like Ubicept want to deploy an AI-based solution: Software that can separate light from a headlight bouncing off fog or a snow bank versus the road. Humans can't do that with the naked eye, but with an approach called gated imaging technology, reliable autonomous driving in more places is theoretically possible. “You don't have to build a new sensor system,” he assured.

But more robotaxis in more places during more times of the year might not be what people want. After a Waymo struck and killed a neighborhood cat in San Francisco last month, a local supervisor introduced a resolution to give counties more say about robotaxi activity. In California companies like Waymo are regulated through the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and CA DMV, both state-level entities.

So while winter is coming, don't expect the autonomous taxis (and the companies that run them) to be ready for it yet.

The race to develop the next generation of weight loss drugs has taken an interesting new turn. In recent research, Eli Lilly's experimental treatment eloralintide helped people lose a substantial amount of weight—without needing to use the same approach as existing popular medications like Ozempic.

Earlier this month in The Lancet, Eli Lilly researchers and others published the latest phase II trial results of eloralintide. Over a 48-week span, people taking eloralintide lost up to 20% of their baseline body weight, well above the average weight loss experienced by those on placebo. Eloralintide's early success so far is all the more notable because it isn't a GLP-1 drug.

Eloralintide mimics the hormone amylin. Our pancreas naturally releases amylin alongside insulin into the bloodstream in response to eating food. Once released, amylin helps tell our body that it's full, tamps down our appetite, and slows the passage of food through our digestive system.

How Ozempic Works—and What's Still a Mystery

The most effective weight loss drugs today, such as semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy), are long-acting mimics of the hormone GLP-1. Like GLP-1, amylin plays a part in regulating our hunger and blood sugar control. The two hormones even share some overlap in how they affect the body to carry out these functions. But they also have some key distinctions, and that's made amylin a promising new target for obesity treatment.

There is an existing amylin-based drug, pramlintide, which was first approved two decades ago as a treatment for diabetes. But it's the newest amylin analogues in development, like eloralintide, that have really excited scientists. These experimental drugs are designed to last much longer in the body than natural amylin, ideally boosting the hormone's effects to help people lose weight and control their blood sugar. Much like semaglutide, eloralintide is intended to be taken once a week via subcutaneous injection.

Eli Lilly's phase II trial involved 263 participants without type 2 diabetes who had obesity (a body mass index over 30) or who were overweight (a BMI over 27) with weight-related health conditions. They were randomly assigned to either receive a placebo or varying doses of eloralintide. Some were given the same dosage of the drug throughout the study, while others were given gradually escalating dosages.

Ozempic Might Literally Change How Our Bodies Handle Booze, Study Finds

People on eloralintide, no matter the dosing strategy, saw greater improvements in weight loss over 48 weeks on average compared to the placebo group, the study showed. People taking the highest weekly dose, nine milligrams, saw the best results, an average 20% weight loss during the study, as did people who steadily increased their dose from six to nine milligrams.

It also appeared to be safe and generally well-tolerated. The adverse events typically associated with the drug were gastrointestinal, similar to the known side effects of GLP-1 therapy. The most common adverse event was nausea, with about a third of people on the highest dose reporting the symptom.

“Eloralintide produced clinically meaningful, dose-dependent reductions in bodyweight over 48 weeks and was generally well tolerated, supporting eloralintide's potential use for obesity treatment,” the study researchers wrote.

GLP-1s have greatly changed the field of obesity medicine in recent years. And though these drugs aren't risk-free and can be highly expensive, they've already started to turn back the clock on obesity. For the first time in years, America's obesity rate has noticeably declined as the use of these drugs has steadily climbed.

There are now plenty of obesity drugs in development, many of which are iterations of GLP-1. Other drugs are combining GLP-1 with other hunger-related hormones, including amylin. Eloralintide's results are especially tantalizing, though, since the drug is only relying on amylin. That's important because it may mean that eloralintide can eventually become an appealing alternative for people who haven't responded to GLP-1 therapy.

It's far too early to be sure, especially without a study directly comparing these medications in a trial. But it's worth noting that semaglutide only helped people lose about 15% of their body weight on average in clinical trials. Eli Lilly's existing obesity drug tirzepatide, which pairs GLP-1 and the hormone GIP, has shown weight loss rates hovering around 20%.

These early findings will have to be verified by data from larger trials, of course. But if this research continues to show promise, eloralintide could open up a whole new area of obesity treatment.

Not everyone wants an iPad, and plenty of people prefer to stick with the Android ecosystem that they already know from their Samsung phones and other devices. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ delivers that familiar Android experience on an 11-inch screen without forcing you to pay Apple's premium pricing or learn a completely different operating system. Amazon just dropped this 128GB WiFI tablet to an all-time low of $209, slashed from its usual $269 price, which makes it one of the absolute best value propositions in the tablet market right now.

See at Amazon

The 11-inch display offers actual screen space for reading, watching videos, browsing the web and working with documents without squinting or constantly zooming in. That size nails it between portability and usability-large enough to replace a laptop for casual tasks and light enough to hold comfortably while reading in bed or watching shows on the couch. Samsung optimized the panel for reduced eye strain during extended viewing sessions, which matters when you're binging a series or working through a long research session.

Quad speakers position the audio sources at each corner of the tablet, and create spatial sound that actually surrounds you, rather than blasting from a single tinny speaker. The difference becomes immediately apparent the first moment one plays video content: dialogue, music, and sound effects all separate into distinct channels instead of mushing together into flat audio.

Samsung replaced the chipset in this 2024 model which has noticeably faster app launches, smoother multitasking, and better gaming compared to the other A-series tablets. The processor handles multiple apps open at once with no lag or stutter and lets you keep browser tabs open while streaming music and editing documents. That improved processing power also translates to everyday interactions, like scrolling through social media feeds, opening up the camera, or switching between apps, making the entire tablet feel responsive rather than sluggish.

The Multi Window Display splits your screen into sections, and runs different apps side by side for genuine productivity work. You can watch YouTube videos while browsing Reddit, take notes during video calls, or reference a recipe while messaging with friends to plan dinner. The ability to multitask like this really makes the tablet useful for getting work done when you need to reference information from one app while you are working in another.

Full compatibility with US carriers, apps, and services is guaranteed with the 2024 US version with no regional or software restrictions. You will also receive timely security updates, have complete access to the Google Play Store library and warranty support via Samsung's US customer service channels.

For $209, you're getting an 11-inch screen, upgraded performance, and 128GB storage for less than half what comparable iPads cost.

Portable Bluetooth speakers flood the market these days, but not all of them deliver what they promise. You need something that sounds good, survives your adventures and doesn't die halfway through the day. Bose has built its reputation on delivering premium audio quality and the latest SoundLink Plus proves why that matters. Right now, Amazon has dropped it to $199 from its usual $269, wihch marks an all-time low and makes premium sound more accessible than ever.

Battery life is what separates the weekend warriors from the weekend worriers, and SoundLink Plus delivers a full 20 hours on a single charge. You can soundtrack an entire camping trip, beach day or backyard party without hunting for outlets. The speaker charges fully in about five hours via USB-C, which means you can top it up overnight and forget about power anxiety. Even better, that same USB-C port works as a charge-out for your phone and turns your speaker into a backup power bank when your device runs low.

The IP67 rating is not just marketing speak: it means this speaker genuinely handles dust and water immersion up to three feet for 30 minutes. You can rinse off beach sand, survive a poolside splash, or keep playing through unexpected rain without panicking. Bose added shock and rust resistance to the mix, so drops on concrete or salty air exposure won't end your speaker's life prematurely. The rugged exterior takes real abuse which counts when you're hiking, biking, or just leading an active lifestyle where gear gets knocked around.

Here's where Bose separates from budget rivals who focus on volume over fidelity: the sound quality. The SoundLink Plus delivers bold, resonant audio with real bass presence that is something smaller speakers can't pull off. You get clear mids for vocals and podcasts, and crisp highs that don't turn harsh at higher volumes-and low-end response adds depth without muddiness. The Bose app lets you tweak bass, mid-range, and treble levels to suit your taste, or adjust performance based on environment. Outdoor spaces eat sound differently than indoor rooms, so having EQ control means you can optimize performance wherever you're listening.

Compact in size, it fits in most bags without taking up too much room and the weight also remains manageable for all-day carrying. When you want to extend your sound, you can pair two SoundLink Plus speakers together or connect to other Bose Bluetooth speakers. Stereo Mode creates true left-right separation for more immersive listening, while Party Mode syncs multiple speakers to fill larger spaces with synchronized audio.

At $199, this is serious value for what you're getting: premium Bose sound engineering, real all-day battery life, military-grade durability and smart features that extend usefulness beyond basic playback. The $70 discount brings this recently launched speaker down to a point where the quality-to-cost ratio becomes exceptional.

Gunning for Threadripper's crown.

Intel is currently preparing a serious rival to AMD's Threadripper 9000WX series: Granite Rapids-WS. The company has been mainly out of competition with AMD in the server market, with Granite Rapids restoring core parity between the two only last year. Granite Rapids-WS now looks to gain even more ground with potentially class-leading specs in the workstation space. Seasoned leaker momomo_us has seemingly found out every SKU that will be part of this lineup, along with a few details that can help us speculate.

According to the post and its reply, Granite Rapids-WS will reportedly have at least 11 models in total, with the Xeon 698X being the flagship, clocked at 2.0 GHz (base), and carrying 336 MB of combined cache. On the other hand, the Xeon 634 will be the lowest-end offering, with only a 48 MB cache pool and a base clock of 2.7 GHz. We didn't get specific core counts, but it's reasonable to expect Intel's next-gen ""extreme"" Xeon chips to top out at 128 cores, since the current-gen 6980P also rocks the same config, which the 698X is likely an offshoot of.

GNR-WS 🤔678X : 2.40GHz 192M676X : 2.80GHz 144M674X : 3.00GHz 144M658X : 3.00GHz 144M656 : 2.90GHz 72M654 : 3.10GHz 72M638 : 3.20GHz 72M636 : 3.50GHz 48M634 : 2.70GHz 48MNovember 15, 2025

To achieve such a high core count, Intel uses three compute tiles, and the same layout on Granite Rapids-WS should allow it to pass even the flagship Threadripper 9995WX's mighty 96 cores. On the server side, EPYC 9965 has Xeon beat, though, so the Blue Team can pull a reverse and take the lead in the workstation market. Granite Rapids-WS is expected to be fabricated on the Intel 3 process and will work on the company's W980 platform. The architecture itself has tough competition ahead, considering how efficient Zen 5 is.

One chip from the GNR-WS lineup already has its first benchmarks out in the wild, thanks to an early GeekBench listing spotted by BenchLeaks. The mid-tier Xeon 654 scored 2,634 points in the single-core test and 14,743 points in the multi-core test. More importantly, we find out that this chip has 18 cores and 32 threads. Interestingly, there's no 18-core SKU in the Granite Rapids server series, so we don't have a direct point of reference. The processor boosted to 4.77 GHz with a minimum reported speed of 2.9 GHz, close enough to the 3.1 GHz base clocks the leak mentioned.

 




Unfortunately, that's where the details end and speculation begins. A couple of months ago, we covered another Granite Rapids-WS chip with 86 cores and 172 threads, operating at 4.8GHz — we can now safely assume that was the Xeon 678X. Granite Rapids-WS seems to have significantly less cache across the board, likely to manage costs for a workstation audience, compared to data centers that can pay much more. Intel's next-gen Xeons are shaping up nicely against AMD's Threadripper, with heated competition on the horizon for the first time in a while.

Pavan Davuluri acknowledges Windows' “power user” pain points in a flat tweet.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Earlier this month, Microsoft described its vision of Windows evolving into an “agentic” operating system that takes action on your behalf, prompting a wave of backlash from users who argued the company had deprioritized performance in favor of automation that nobody wanted nor asked for. Many pointed to longstanding issues with performance, UX fragmentation, and developer-hostile defaults, asking why those problems weren't being addressed first.

In a recent reply posted to X, aimed at an original post by writer and engineer Gergely Orosz, Davuluri acknowledged the volume of complaints but stopped short of directly engaging with the core critiques.

Hey Gergely, I am responding here, and I think this applies to a bunch of the comments that people have made. I mean, a lot of comments 🙂.The team (and I) take in a ton of feedback. We balance what we see in our product feedback systems with what we hear directly. They don't…November 15, 2025

“The team (and I) take in a ton of feedback. We balance what we see in our product feedback systems with what we hear directly. They don't always match, but both are important,” wrote the Windows exec.

Davuluri added that he had “read through the comments and see focus on things like reliability, performance, ease of use and more.” He reiterated that Microsoft “cares deeply about developers” and said the company discusses ""these pain points and others in detail, because we want developers to choose Windows.""

He conceded that Microsoft has “work to do on the experience,” citing “inconsistent dialogs” and “power user experiences” as examples, but offered no specifics on what changes might be made or when they would arrive.

The response is, as has unfortunately become par for the course, underwhelming and empty. While Davuluri's tone is measured and conciliatory, the post doesn't clarify Microsoft's agentic OS roadmap or address the developer sentiment that prompted the backlash. At no point does he mention the concerns around system bloat, hardware lock-ins, or the sense that Copilot integrations are arriving before longstanding design issues have been resolved.

Microsoft has not followed up the agentic OS announcement with any detailed public roadmap or technical explanation of what users can expect in future Windows builds. For both your everyday and power users alike, the gap between messaging and actual, measurable action in response to widespread criticism remains stark.

As it stands, the post appears more focused on de-escalation than engagement. Davuluri closed with a call to connect privately, but public replies suggest many in the community are still waiting for more than a DM.

Is it time to invest in memory chip manufacturers?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Major PC brands, system integrators, and memory makers are now panic-buying memory chips and modules as the DRAM and NAND chip shortage is taking hold. According to DigiTimes, numerous companies are in a race to build up their stocks as data centers are swallowing up supply, leaving the consumer industry scrambling to get memory modules. Asus said that its memory inventory for production and those that are already in finished products sit at two months, which should be enough for the remainder of 2025. However, unless the situation changes, the company will start feeling the pinch of the shortage by 2026, requiring it to adjust its prices accordingly.

While most large companies like Asus and MSI typically have contracts with memory chip manufacturers, reports say that they're also now purchasing a lot of inventory in the spot market, where prices are more volatile, presumably to shore up their supply. This is a major change and could be a sign of things to come, as it usually only hosts low-volume purchases from smaller companies or when a major institution needs to acquire more memory modules due to unforeseen demand. These actions in the spot market are increasing pricing pressure, and it's already being felt by retail customers.

RAM prices have jumped by 100% or more recently, and we've even heard reports of some Japanese shops limiting sales volume per customer because of limited deliveries, with some products remaining out of stock from distributors. Even memory kit makers are reportedly delaying the launch of new models due to the memory supply crunch, with products scheduled for launch in the last quarter of 2025 being moved to 2026.

The global infrastructure build-out of AI data centers is driving the massive demand for HBM and RDIMM, pushing out the supply for consumer memory and causing a “pricing apocalypse” that could last a decade. With companies investing billions of dollars in hardware, memory chipmakers are converting existing DRAM lines to take advantage of this lucrative market. Most major memory chip manufacturers have reported record earnings for the 3Q25, with upstream firms also reaping benefits from the massive jump in demand.

Unfortunately, they're also wary of market volatility, especially with some experts saying that we're in an AI bubble that can burst anytime. Because of this, most of them aren't willing to invest billions of dollars in additional facilities to increase RAM production. But even if they start construction on new chip fabs right now, it will take several months, if not years, for them to begin operating, and churning out the memory chips we sorely need.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:medicalnewstoday.com","Vitamin D: 3 potential benefits for health, longevity","https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/3-ways-vitamin-d-may-boost-longevity-according-to-research-edited","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 06:55:48 GMT","

Vitamin D is a hormone essential for a variety of bodily functions, such as immune responses and regulating inflammation.

It is naturally present in some foods, added to others, and available as a dietary supplement. The skin also produces vitamin D in response to sun exposure.

Still, vitamin D deficiency is one of the most common nutritional deficiencies worldwide, with nearly 42% of adults in the United States having this deficiency.

The recommended daily amount for most people is around 15 micrograms (mcg), or 2,000 international units (IU). However, it is important to note that too much vitamin D can also be harmful.

Medical News Today looks at three recent studies to examine the possible role vitamin D may have in supporting health and boosting longevity.

A recent literature review of 50 studies and more than 1 million participants suggest that vitamin D may help decrease the risk of colorectal cancer and also improve survival for the condition.

Published in Nutrients in April 2025, the review found that higher serum vitamin D levels were associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Additionally, among those with colorectal cancer, higher vitamin D levels were linked to improved survival and reduced mortality.

The authors of the review suggested that vitamin D helps the immune system and may assist with decreasing inflammation.

Vitamin D may also possess specific anticancer properties, such as supporting programmed cell death and stopping uncontrolled cell growth. The authors added that vitamin D may be a useful adjunctive option alongside other cancer treatments.

However, despite these promosing associations, the researchers noted that more research is still necessary, particularly large-scale, randomized clinical trials.

While some research noted that both dietary vitamin D and vitamin D supplements have beneficial effects on colorectal cancer, other studies did not find a significant relationship between vitamin D and colorectal cancer.

Some studies highlighted that results may differ due to factors such as body mass index (BMI), sex, and nutritional status. It may be helpful for further research to explore components like how people's genetics, lifestyle choices, and use of other treatments play a role in vitamin D's effects on cancer.

Wael Harb, MD, a board-certified hematologist and medical oncologist at MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA, who was not involved in the study, commented to MNT that:

“For patients with [colorectal cancer], ensuring adequate vitamin D levels may help support immune surveillance and potentially improve outcomes when used alongside standard therapies. Importantly, this review highlights the need for personalized approaches, as individual vitamin D requirements can vary based on genetics, baseline levels, and comorbidities.”

Telomeres describe repetitive DNA sequences that protect the ends of chromosomes, preventing them from damage. Telomere length shortens with age, and telomere shortening is associated with age-related diseases.

A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in July 2025 suggested that vitamin D supplemention could preseve the length of telomeres in white blood cells, which may help to slow down biological aging.

For this study, researchers used data from the large-scale VITAL trial in the U.S. This trial included a representative sample of adults receiving vitamin D3 supplements, omega-3 fatty acid supplements, or both for around 5 years.

Participants were randomized, with half receiving 2,000 IU, or 50 mcg, of vitamin D daily, and the remaining receiving a placebo.

The findings indicated that in those receiving vitamin D3, telomere shortening in leukocytes, a type of white blood cells, over the study period was significantly less compared with the placebo. The authors estimated this effect to be equivalent to about a 3-year reduction in biological aging.

Further analysis suggested that the effect of vitamin D was more evident in participants who did not have obesity, those not taking cholesterol-lowering medications, and in participants of different ethnicities. Omega-3 fatty acids supplementation appeared to have no significant impact on telomere length.

Yoshua Quinones, MD, a board-certified internist with Medical Offices of Manhattan and contributor to LabFinder, who was not involved in the study, explained that:

“As we know already, vitamin D supports bone, immune system and reduces inflammation, but this study is linked directly with telomere preservation which ties into aging and disease prevention. This [study] gives more of a general idea that vitamin D3 could do more than just helping your bones but actually slowing down the cellular age, impressive!”

However, the researchers acknowledge that the analysis was a post-hoc examination of the VITAL trial, which was not originally designed to look at the effects of supplements on leukocyte telomere length.

Additionally, most participants were white and older adults, so it may not be possible to generalize the findings to other groups.

Previous research has suggested a link between low levels of vitamin D and poor cardiovascular health, and a newer study now indicates that vitamin D3 supplementation may help to drastically reduce the risk of having a second heart attack.

Intermountain Health researchers presented their study at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2025, and its results are not yet published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The TARGET-D trial involved 630 participants, most of which were males with an average age of 63, who enrolled within a month of having a heart attack. The researchers randomly selected the control group and who would receive targeted vitamin D3 treatment.

At enrollment, 87% of participants had low vitamin D levels and the average vitamin D level was 27 nanograms/milliliter (ng/ml).

The researchers tailored vitamin D3 supplementation by measuring blood vitamin D levels and adjusting the dose so that individuals reached a target serum level of approximately 40 ng/ml.

The researchers monitored vitamin D3 levels throughout the trial and would adjust doses to maintain the target level. They also kept track of major cardiovascular events throughout the trial.

Although there was no significant difference between groups in overall cardiac events, the rate of follow-up heart attacks was 3.8% in the vitamin D3 treatment group compared to 7.9% in the control group.

Overall, while the results suggest that targeted vitamin D3 supplementation may not reduce all major cardiac outcomes, it did cut the risk of repeat heart attacks by more than half.

Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board-certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center, who was not involved in this study, explained that while past research has linked higher blood levels of vitamin D with lower heart disease rates, “it mostly appears that the relationship between vitamin D3 and heart health is that of correlation rather than that of causation.”

He noted that vitamin D3 may still offer some cardiovascular benefits, such as “decreasing inflammation and lowering blood pressure.”

However, he cautioned that the evidence remains mixed. He added that if larger studies confirm the recent finding that targeted vitamin D3 treatment could reduce the risk of recurrent heart attacks, “it would be quite significant.”

NWSL

Mark Wilf speaks to the media Russell Lansford / Imagn Images

Years ago, Orlando Pride co-owner and chairman Mark Wilf got a knot in his stomach as he watched his daughter get ready for penalty kicks during a middle school soccer match.

“I remember how tense it was,” he tells The Athletic. “She was a goalie, and it came down to penalties.” His daughter's team won.

Last year, that knot returned, as did the jubilation, during the final minutes of the NWSL Championship when the Pride lifted the trophy thanks to a goal from forward Barbra Banda against the Washington Spirit at CPKC Stadium in Kansas City, Mo.   

“We always loved sports, playing them and going to games,” he said. “Seeing how much team spirit, being part of sports and what it does for young people and communities, I always dreamt of being, one day, part of a sports team.”

Wilf grew up in New Jersey, where sports were a family affair. His father, a Holocaust survivor, embraced the NFL in his new country and frequently took his family to football games whenever possible. And it wasn't just American Football. The Wilfs were among the 77,000 people watching Pele in 1977, when the soccer legend played for the now-defunct NASL's crown jewel, the New York Cosmos, at Giants Stadium. 

The family's dream of owning a sports franchise came to fruition in 2005. Wilf, his brother Zygi and their cousin Leonard bought the financially crippled Minnesota Vikings for $600 million. At the Vikings practice facility, a replica Viking ship sat in the parking lot, its wood rotting. The brothers' first decision was to rebuild the ship and fix the HVAC system for the locker rooms, ensuring that fans understood they were investing in the team and for the players long-term. The family was also instrumental in building US Bank Stadium as part of a public-private partnership.

Sixteen years later, Wilf led the 2021 acquisition of Orlando City in MLS, the Orlando Pride in NWSL and Exploria Stadium in a deal valued at roughly $400 million. The DeVos family, owners of the Orlando Magic, took a minority stake. Two years later, basketball Hall of Famer Grant Hill — who is a co-owner of the NBA's Atlanta Hawks — and his wife, Grammy-nominated singer Tamia Hill, joined the Orlando Soccer Holdings ownership group.

“When we did meet, it became evident that Mark's vision, passion and commitment to the franchise's success would form the foundation for sustainable achievement,” Hill told The Athletic. “Everything he has done since aligns with what was observed in our initial meeting.”

Wilf was soccer curious all along. While building the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minnesota, he was already looking at Major League Soccer. Once the opportunity knocked on their door in Central Florida and Orlando's former owner, Flávio Augusto da Silva, put the team up for sale, he did not hesitate. 

The Pride has been part of the NWSL since 2016 as an expansion club. It first hired former U.S. women's national team manager Tom Sermanni and signed U.S. star Alex Morgan, instantly elevating expectations. However, they failed to find the rhythm they had expected, finishing the inaugural season ninth out of 10 teams. In 2017, they brought in Brazilian soccer phenom Marta. The impact was instant. 

Orlando climbed to third place before losing in the playoffs to the Portland Thorns, who took home the silverware that year. However, the team failed to reach the postseason in the following campaigns, finishing no higher than seventh until last year.

When Wilf first arrived in Orlando in 2021, he was surprised by the amount of work that needed to be done. 

“The facilities weren't where they needed to be,” he said. “We've spent a lot of time upgrading locker rooms, making sure the players have the right facilities around the fields, everything. We wanted players to walk in and feel this was a first-class organization.”

The 2022 season wasn't smooth. Head coach Amanda Cromwell, hired that season after a celebrated run at UCLA, was placed on administrative leave in June following a joint NWSL/NWSLPA investigation into “alleged retaliation” under the league's workplace misconduct policy. She was dismissed in October. Assistant coach Seb Hines, who had no prior head-coaching experience, stepped in as interim. They ended up finishing the season 10th overall, but there was hope for change.

Ahead of the 2023 season, the Pride made Hines the head coach and hired former Houston Dash goalkeeper Haley Carter as the club's general manager. Wilf credits Carter and Hines — and Marta — for transforming the Pride into what he calls “a team with real soul.” 

“When we came in, Marta was nursing an ACL (injury),” he said. “But she was out there working her tail off, setting an example. She's radiant. She's a leader in every sense.”

The Pride's 2024 campaign became a defining moment for the club. 

They signed Barbra Banda to a four-year deal, paying a reported $740,000 transfer fee — the second-highest in women's football history at the time. Carter overhauled the personnel; she is currently the club's vice president of soccer operations and sporting director, and Hines started honing the 4-3-2-1 formation. The best news was that Marta was back on her feet again. 

Last year, speaking with The Athletic, Carter shared her thoughts on the success of the team and gave credit to the ownership style of the Wilf family: “Invested and in regular communication, but not overly fiddly or micro-managey,” she said, explaining what helped Pride reach the playoffs after so many years. 

“That whole year was something special,” Wilf said. “You win the Shield, but then you still have to survive the playoffs.” He has seen Marta's iconic semifinal goal several times and still gets goosebumps, like he is seeing it for the first time. 

In the final, Orlando outlasted the Spirit to lift its first major trophy. “It was a crescendo,” Wilf said. “Holding on in those final minutes, it's something I'll never forget. To have such a historic season like last year and winning the double like we did, it doesn't happen by accident.” 

The win capped a storybook season for the club, which shattered multiple league records, including the most points, most wins and most clean sheets. The Pride went unbeaten at home in the regular season and adding two more postseason victories in the quarterfinals and semifinals.

After the championship, a new side of Wilf was uncovered: his dance moves. 

“Fans might be surprised by Mark's dancing talents after winning championships,” Hill recalled. “After we clinched the title last year in Kansas City, he appeared briefly on the dance floor. I'd rate him an 8.5 out of 10.” 

Pride's dominance on the pitch and the dance floor showed up everywhere, including the NWSL awards in 2024. Hines was named NWSL Coach of the Year, while Emily Sams took home Defender of the Year. The Pride also had five players on the Best XI: Sams, Marta, Banda, Anna Moorhouse, and Kerry Abello.

“When you steward a franchise, whether it's the Vikings or the Pride, you're responsible not just for winning, but for creating something the community can be proud of,” Wilf said. “That's what my parents taught us.” 

Despite Pride's epic run in 2024, the 2025 season has been anything but smooth. The reigning champions clawed their way back to the postseason despite losing last year's championship MVP, Banda, to a season-ending injury, navigating the tricky blend of new and returning players, and absorbing forward Adriana's departure. 

Off the field, revenue from Pride sponsorships has increased drastically since the first season of Wilf family ownership. Following the 2024 season, the club has sold more new season ticket memberships for 2025 than it did for 2024, 2023, and 2022 combined, according to the team, and according to Forbes, the Pride is valued at $92 million. The club also became the first NWSL team to surpass one million social-media followers. 

“Winning helps,” Wilf said. “But it's about investing in people and culture.”

At the league level, Wilf sits on the NWSL's executive committee, where he's been pushing for continued professionalization. 

“When we came in, the league wasn't where it needed to be in terms of structure and depth,” he said. “With commissioner Jessica Berman, we've built real momentum. Better media deals, stronger sponsorships, smarter governance. We're still early, but the trajectory is there.”

According to SponsorUnited's 2024–2025 NWSL Marketing Partnerships Report, league-wide team sponsorship revenue hit $75 million in 2024, a 16 percent jump from 2022. On average, clubs pulled in about $5 million apiece, with individual deals landing around $170,000.

“Women's soccer in the U.S. is in the first half of its potential,” Wilf said, in NFL terms. “We're building something that will be world-class. More fans, more investment, global talent wanting to come here.” 

After Banda's record-breaking transfer in 2024, the Pride signed Jacqueline ‘Jackie' Ovalle, the Mexican forward nicknamed La Maga (the magician), in a world-record transfer for women's football over the summer, worth $ 1.5 million in fees. 

“We brought in two of the highest-paid transfers in women's sports history because we believe it's what the fans want,” he said. 

Owning an NWSL team is different from owning an NFL franchise, but Wilf sees parallels. 

“The NFL is the NFL. It's such a premier sport. The product is so incredible, and it builds cities and brings people together. The game itself is so exciting,” he said. 

“The NWSL brings a different kind of excitement for me. It was a league with real potential, essentially at ground level, but ready to take off, and needed to be professionalized. I am very proud to have worked alongside the other owners to help build the league office from the early days and to be part of shaping what we hope will remain a high-growth league for years to come.”

On Sunday, the Wilf family will be back in the stands at Inter & Co Stadium, bracing for another nerve-shredding semifinal against Gotham FC  that could send the Pride to a second straight final. 

The tension, the roar, the whole roller coaster will be there, and if things break Orlando's way, Wilf might just find himself back on the dance floor, chasing that perfect 10.

CHESTER, Pa. — There wasn't much love at the end of the U.S. men's national team's friendly with Paraguay at the home of the MLS team that represents the City of Brotherly Love.

Tempers flared in the final minutes of the match when Alex Freeman and Paraguay's Gustavo Gómez tussled over a ball after it had been kicked out of bounds, leading to a benches-clearing brawl that included USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino getting knocked to the ground.

Pochettino said he had been looking in another direction when he heard the scuffle break out, but when he turned to try and intervene, he was knocked down. “Lucky that [Paraguay coach] Gustavo Alfaro saw me and say, wait, and helped me with some staff.”

Initially, Freeman and Gómez were the only ones involved, but quickly, both teams came rushing over and punches were thrown amid the melee. 

At one point, Freeman shoved a Paraguayan player outside of the main scrum after that player had a hold of the American defender.

A bottle was thrown toward the pitch from the stands as the scuffle was happening.

USMNT goalkeeper and New York City FC star Matt Freese said that he was happy to see his teammates rally and come to the aid of each other during the fight, but wasn't happy about some of the things that occurred from the Paraguay side during it.

“There were a few cheap shots thrown from their end, to be honest,” he said. “But that's part of being a team and we're going to be standing up for each other no matter the end of the game, beginning of the game, middle of the game, on the sideline like that. That's what it means to be a team.”

Freese joked that he's never moved as quickly as he did to jump into the fray, but declined to say if he got a shot in. 

“I'll keep it diplomatic,” he responded.

Six yellow cards combined were assessed due to the fight and Omar Alderete was given a red card.

Pochettino called the melee a “very dangerous situation.”

“I don't like this type of situation,” he said.

FUKUSHIMA, Japan (November 16, 2025) - The U.S. Men's Deaf National Team defeated Korea Republic in convincing fashion Sunday evening in the team's second group match of the Deaflympics. The USA scored twice on either side of the break and had a 4-0 lead behind goals from Tate Lancaster, Mike Schmid, Samson Abraham and JJ Waterman before conceding two goals in second-half stoppage time.

With three points after two matches in three-team Group D, the USA now awaits the final group match between Ukraine and South Korea on Tuesday (2:30 a.m. ET). A draw, Ukraine win, or Korea Republic win by seven goals would secure the USA's advancement to the quarterfinals.

The USA was in complete control of the match from the onset, and took advantage of set pieces to put four balls in the net - although two were called back for infractions. 

An eighth minute free kick by midfielder Braden Anderson on the left from 25 yards out was directed in at the near post by teammate Samson Abraham, but the referee ruled Abraham was a step offside and waived it off. Twelve minutes later, USA right back Philip Cruz headed in a corner from Raul Silva, but the referee also called it off ruling Cruz had pushed off a Korean player. 

The next one counted.

In the 21st, Anderson lined a corner kick that defender and captain Tate Lancaster headed in at the near post after losing his mark on a dashing run from the top of the box to put the USA ahead. It was Lancaster's third international goal and second in three matches after tallying in last month's 3-1 friendly win against Germany.

USA forward Michael Schmid nearly doubled the lead but Korean goalkeeper Taerim Kim came up big off his line to deny. Next it was Lancaster again that came close. Anderson played a short free kick from the right to Silva, who quickly advanced in Lancaster's near post run. The USA captain turned and shot while falling away and saw his shot hit off the crossbar. 





The second goal finally came just before the break. Again a free kick started the possession near the left side of midfield, with Anderson taking the pass and moving down the center before finding Abraham on the left, who sent a cross into the area that Schmid (pictured above) lunged forward to redirect past the ‘keeper. Schmid now has 14 career goals, one off the all-time leader Chad Johnson.

The second half has was much of the same. And the third goal came after 15 minutes - and a great effort from Abraham. The speedy attacking player pressured a Korean defender to pass the ball back to his goalkeeper Taerim Kim, then Abraham chased the ball and caused the ‘keeper to misplay it - the ball falling to Abraham to put away from close range for his second international goal.



The game was essentially put away five minutes later when Anderson's corner kick was met by left back JJ Waterman (pictured above) at the back post for his debut goal to extend the lead to 4-0. 

With a commanding 4-0 lead, the U.S. let up some in added time, as Junyeong Jeong and Jonghun Kim each tallied to take it to 4-2.

CHESTER, Pa. – There's a new skill that Gio Reyna has identified and been working to add to his building arsenal, and on Saturday night against Paraguay, the 23-year-old midfielder reaped the reward.

The payoff occurred Nov. 15 in the U.S. Men's National Team friendly against World Cup-bound Paraguay. Reyna, earning his 33rd cap, nodded home the opening goal, the first time in his five-year professional career that Reyna has scored with his head.

“I'm 6-foot-2, and I like to think that I can jump pretty well,” he said. “The last few weeks, I've been working at my club with [Borussia Mönchengladbach] to stick around for a bit longer to practice some headers and finishing in the air. I'm happy to see that it's paying off a bit.”

Reyna's goal arrived in the fourth minute of the match played in front of more than 17,000 supporters at Subaru Park. The setup man was fullback Max Arfsten who whipped a dangerous cross into the box following his own recycled corner kick. Two shot attempts caused the Paraguayan defense to scramble, and Reyna made the most of the momentary disorganization. 

At the edge of the six-yard box, Reyna slipped in between two Paraguay defenders and created a pocket of space in the frenzy. Then, the midfielder used his length and excellent timing to connect with Arfsten's cross. He delivered a finely placed header that dinged the underside of the crossbar and came down across the line.

“I just tried to be myself, play what the game gave me and work with the other very talented players around me,” Reyna said after the match. “They made my life easy, and I tried to help them out too. An overall great night for the team.”

The early finish settled the young playmaker seeing his first international minutes in nearly eight months and making his first start for the U.S. since July 1, 2024. Reyna's most recent appearance for the U.S. prior to the Paraguay match was in the Concacaf Nations League back in March.

Reyna returned to the mix for November camp ready to contribute. He's melded with a group that's been in good form in the lead-up to the FIFA 2026 World Cup hosted on home soil, helping the team extend its unbeaten streak against World Cup-bound opponents to four straight matches. 

“We can see today that he was great, he scored and assisted,” USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said. “The way that he always has the capacity to read the game and find the free space in between the lines, it was a nightmare for Paraguay. I think he did a very good job.”

“It's just a Gio performance,” echoed midfielder Brenden Aaronson. “It's a very mature performance. He's an unbelievable player technically. He's very smart, finding pockets, stuff like that. I couldn't be happier for him. He's an amazing player. He always shows up for the national team.”

Reyna and teammates connected from the get-go and continued doing so the rest of the night. Not only did he score the opener just four minutes into the match, the attacking midfielder set up the game-winner later in the second half. Reyna sent in the low, firm cross from the left wing that glanced off Paraguay's Damián Bobadilla before striker Folarin Balogun pounced to pull the U.S. ahead in the 71st minute.

“Me and Flo have a great relationship,” Reyna said. “We've been together now for two, three years, and played many great games together, linked up with each other, and relied on each other at times. We have great communication, the eye contact to see where we're going to move and try to feed off each other. Now, it's continuing to build together and try to score and keep assisting him. He makes my life easy.”







Reyna put in 75 minutes of work against Paraguay, even though after the match he admitted his fitness level is not quite at 100 percent. His contributions showed up on the scoresheet, and his work rate showed on the pitch. On one play, minutes after scoring in the first half, Reyna passed up a chance for a shot and dished a short pass to try and set up one of his teammates. When a Paraguay tackle sent the ball heading in the opposite direction, Reyna sprinted to chase the dribbler down. His pressure eventually led to a turnover that allowed the U.S. to regain possession.

“He's had really good focus in training this week, really good intensity,” captain Tim Ream said. “He wants to be here. We know the quality that he possesses, and when he matches that quality with playing with intensity, like he did tonight, he gets rewarded... Going forward, he's so confident and he's added more intensity to his game. It's only going to take him to another level.”

Reyna's flick was not only his first headed goal for club or country – it also marked a milestone with a personal family tie. The goal brought his international tally to nine, surpassing the scoring total of his father, USMNT great Claudio Reyna, who finished his 12-year international career with eight.

After the match, Reyna revealed that while he didn't know at first that his goal broke the tie, he and his father had some fun with it.

“I sent him a few texts teasing him after the game, but he was happy for me,” Reyna said.","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

A second-half goal from Folarin Balogun gave the USMNT a 2-1 victory over Paraguay at Subaru Park on Saturday night, the first USMNT match in Chester since May 2018.

Still searching for his best group ahead of next year's World Cup, head coach Mauricio Pochettino named two Philadelphia Union alumni to his starting lineup, with Matt Freese starting in goal and Brenden Aaronson on the wing. The talented but troubled Gio Reyna made his first start under Pochettino, while Folarin Balogun started up top over Ricardo Pepi and Haji Wright.

After his long absence from the team, it took Reyna less than four minutes to get on the scoresheet. Following a corner, the U.S. kept the pressure on, eventually recycling the ball to Max Arfsten on the right wing. The Columbus Crew man put an excellently weighted cross toward the penalty spot, where Reyna had found a pocket of space. He powered a good header past keeper Orlando Gil to give the Americans an early lead.

It would not last. In the tenth minute, Paraguay sent Miguel Almiron down the left wing, where he smacked a spectacular volleyed cross into the American box. With Freese stuck on his line, the ball set up nicely for Alex Arce to head home from close range, giving the substantial segment of Paraguay supporters in attendance something to celebrate.

As the first half wore on, the U.S. had more of the ball, with Reyna and Sergino Dest combining in threatening fashion down the right wing. But neither team really threatened to score again, with the midfield battle turning into a chippy foul-fest.

The Americans claimed the lead again in the 71st minute, this time through Balogun. After Paraguay turned it over outside their own box, Balogun dropped it off for Reyna, who pushed into the box and hit a dangerous cutback. The defender failed to control it, and the ball fell perfectly for Balogun to sweep home into the far corner.

Paraguay, who'd been quiet, tried to find an equalizer, forcing Freese to parry a strong effort from 35 yards out. But it was the U.S. who almost scored on the counterattack. Diego Luna squirted a ball to fellow substitute Ricardo Pepi, who had an open goal to aim at from five yards out. Pepi, though, took one touch too many, and a desperate recovery by the defender blocked his shot away.

The visitors kept the pressure on in the final ten minutes, winning a few corners, but the Americans held firm. The closest Paraguay got came in the final minute, when Arfsten nearly directed a dangerous pass into his own net.

Instead, the final drama of the match came in second-half stoppage time, when a tussle over a ball that went out of play between the two benches erupted into a melee. Despite some punches seemingly being thrown, referee Cristian Corado was happy to let things go without any red cards being showed. (It was a friendly, one supposes.)

The USMNT completes this international window against fellow World Cup qualifier Uruguay in Tampa, Fl., on Tuesday at 7 p.m. — the final match for the team before the World Cup draw on Dec. 5.

The team played okay, but not great.  The USMNT still stands in great danger of being eliminated in the first round of the WC.
. . .
It may be a nice heartstrings and marketing touch to bring Union products, but it's not helping figure out the best USMNT for the WC.  That includes Brenden Aaronson who was predictably ineffective as mentioned. We all know the informal definition of insanity. Like most, I wanted success for him but he's not good enough.
. . .
He ranked as the worst player in the Premier League for the 2022-23 season by Sofascore with only 1 goal and 3 assists in 41 games with Leeds, leading to its relegation.  His follow-up loan to Union Berlin also flopped, failing to complete a full 90-minute game and scoring only 1 goal in 21 appearances.
. . .
Now 25 y/o, it is what it is.  He gives good cardio but is ineffective.  Every time the USMNT spends time giving minutes to players who won't improve the squad wastes critical preparation time.

USA on the way.

The U.S. men's national team defeated Paraguay 2–1 at Subaru Park in a positive start to the November international break.

Headlining the action was Gio Reyna in his first start since the 2024 Copa América. The talented midfielder scored the first goal on the night just four minutes in. His first headed goal for club or country was quickly erased as Paraguay responded through Álex Arce.

A less-eventful second half had some life injected when Reyna combined with Folarin Balogun for the game-winning goal. 

Despite the friendly setting, the match was competitive and things got chippy between the two sides early. Tensions boiled over near the final whistle as a coming together between Alex Freeman and Gustavo Gomez over the ball caused the benches to clear.

Overall, a performance that Mauricio Pochettino will be proud of given the effort shown. This USMNT team has heart and grit.

*Ratings Provided by FotMob

GK: Matt Freese—6.2: The NYCFC man was helpless on the goal conceded. Other than that, it was a quiet night. He was forced into two saves in the second half.

CB: Joe Scally—7.3: A solid showing at right center back in Scally's return. With the talent ahead of him as a wing back, Scally likely needs to fight for minutes in the back three.

CB: Miles Robinson—7.4: Lost track of Arce for the equalizer in the first half. Didn't offer the same presence Chris Richards often does in the role, but kept things ticking in possession.

CB: Tim Ream (c)—7.5: Outside of the first goal, the veteran was assured at the back. 

RM: Sergiño Dest—6.5: Active going forward, but lacked that final bit of quality to create big chances. Overall a decent showing for the PSV right back in a more advanced role.

CM: Tanner Tessmann—7.5: A strong performance from the Lyon midfielder. Tessmann looks like a real contender for starting minutes in the 2026 World Cup.

CM: Cristian Roldan—6.8: Quietly went about his business in a midfield pivot. Roldan will want his first-half shot on goal back given he was given the ball on a platter.

LM: Max Arfsten—8.4: The rise of Max Arfsten has softened the blow of Antonee Robinson's absence. The Columbus Crew wingback has questions to answer defensively, but there's no doubting his attacking presence off the left.

RW: Gio Reyna—8.3: What a reintroduction for Reyna. A goal inside four minutes and a decisive cross that led to the second-half goal. Pochettino has a headache on his hands if Reyna shows up against Uruguay.

ST: Folarin Balogun—7.4: Pressed high, but struggled for service for much of the game. Scored the game-winner before coming off in the second half.

LW: Brenden Aaronson—6.7: A frustrating night for Aaronson. Consistently on the ball, but also lacking that final moment of quality on numerous occasions. Drew three fouls, but also lost the most amount of duels (9).

All eyes were on Reyna to begin the game. How would the playmaker respond to the opportunity given?

The early passages of play saw the USMNT press high as they established their shape. They won a corner less than five minutes in which led to a chaotic moment in the box. As the ball bounced around, it eventually made its way out to Arfsten who played in a tantalizing cross. Reyna rose tall and headed the ball past Gill for the opening goal.

His nonchalant celebration might have given off a calm and collected scene, but there was also a sense of relief on Reyna's face.

The good feeling was quickly wiped away though as Paraguay responded swiftly. Miguel Almirón played a deadly cross which Arce had no issue heading past Freese. Pochettino will be unhappy with the nature of the goal conceded given his defense fell asleep right after scoring.

Roldan had a golden opportunity to put the USMNT back in front around the 20th minute after a dangerous run from Dest, but his effort went right at Gill.

The rest of the first half saw tempers flare a bit as fouls and yellow cards started to pile up, though neither goalkeeper was truly threatened. The USMNT finished the half with 11 fouls, the most in the Pochettino era. 

Much of the second half lacked attacking quality from both sides. The hosts dominated possession, but any time the ball was moved around the box Paraguay were quick and decisive with closing down passing and shooting lanes. Dest had a sight at goal in the 65th minute, but his left-footed effort flew over the bar in his last action of the game.

The USMNT finally found the go-ahead goal in the 71st minute after some brilliant play from Balogun and Reyna. The Monaco striker held the ball up well, laid it off for Reyna as he played it back into the box. A fortunate, slight deflection benefitted the USMNT as Balogun was finally rewarded after a relatively quiet night.

Substitutes Timothy Tillman, Diego Luna and Ricardo Pepi nearly combined for a third after coming on, but the latter could not get his feet right in a major moment.

On the verge of stoppage time, Blas Riveros played a dangerous ball across the face of the USMNT goal which nearly deflected in for an own goal. 

Tension throughout the night finally hit a breaking point near the final whistle as Alex Freeman and Gustavo Gómez fought over the ball. The tussle led to both benches clearing and unused Paraguayan substitute Omar Alderete receiving a red card.

CHESTER, Pa. — Mauricio Pochettino has no intention of being cruel when it comes to picking the 26-man roster for the World Cup-bound United States men's national team.

But make no mistake: Nobody's roster spot is safe.

Outside Subaru Park, a little more than half an hour outside Philadelphia, a countdown clock clicked off the time until the start of the World Cup next June prior to kickoff of the USMNT's match with Paraguay on Saturday.

A stark reminder of the dwindling time left for Pochettino to make his decisions for 2026.

A pair of friendlies during the November camp are being played without a number of recognizable names, including American stars Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams — both dealing with injuries. 

That has led the head coach to detail what's at stake for every player in camp.

“For me, I think it's the players that deserve to be here are the players that we want to see, are the players that are our choice, our selection,” Pochettino said ahead of Saturday's friendly, which the USMNT won, 2-1. “No one can feel safe. No one can feel that it's going to be even the name that you say: Pulisic or Tyler Adams. I think the federation is bigger than the names.

“That is the national team. That is representation of the country, it's everyone.”

Weston McKennie, Chris Richards and Malik Tillman also have not been with the USMNT this week.

And with all of that in mind, Pochettino wants every player to be ready to play if his name is called for the World Cup.

“It's a great opportunity in the moment that, [if] we decide to pick another player, choose another player, that player needs to show up and step up and say, ‘Yes, we have the opportunity to be part of the roster for the next World Cup,' ” Pochettino explained.

Pulisic, of course, has been a big topic of conversation since the Gold Cup earlier this year — a tournament in which the Pennsylvania native opted not to play, instead choosing to rest after a grueling club season.

Pulisic had returned to the national team for the September camp held in New Jersey but was injured in an October match and has been recovering since. 

He gave a wide-ranging interview with CBS Sports Golazo this week and explained his focus at the moment is on recovery.

“I just want to make sure I have the time now to fully care for myself and make sure that my hamstring is doing well and allow other guys to take the place. So, I think it's just the best decision for everyone right now,” he said.

After Saturday's match and a friendly against Uruguay in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday, Pochettino's squad will not reconvene until March.

And when the club meets for its final camp ahead of the start of the World Cup, which begins May 27, Pochettino will have his roster set and won't be making any cuts.

“I think it's difficult when you bring more than 26 [players] and then you need to tell on the last day, you are out,” he explained. “I prefer in a different way to bring the 26 that you believe that are going to be in the squad, and if something happens, you call someone. … But to be involved, then to go home, I think is more cruel that situation than if you call and say we need you because something wrong happened or some player was injured.”

Mauricio Pochettino will make sure to avoid as much heartbreak as possible with the U.S. men's national team when he names his final squad ahead of the official 2026 World Cup roster. 

While many teams will bring in extra players for a last look during pre-camps ahead of major tournaments, Pochettino wants to avoid that type of heartbreak. As such, he has committed to not over-filling the June roster, keeping it as close to his final World Cup squad as possible to avoid any disappointment. 

“I think from the beginning, if you say, okay, that is the 26, that is a shock, but this—okay, you accept. But after to be involved and then to go home, I think it's more cruel,” he told reporters earlier this week. 

“For me, it's easier to call more players than 26, but I think I need to think (terms of) the human being and desire and not to be cruel,” Pochettino added. “You train, you train, and you train. You go home. It's tough.""

The final cuts from the pre-tournament camp to the final roster have been a significant issue for the USMNT in the past. In 2014, Landon Donovan admitted to breaking down in tears after Jürgen Klinsmann cut him from the final squad for Brazil, and Jeff Agoos famously burned his kit when he was dropped by Bora Milutinović in 1994, the last time the U.S. were World Cup hosts.

It might not be so easy for the Argentine manager, though, especially considering that he has called up 71 different players since taking over as head coach in the fall of 2024. But, with a shift to a back three in recent windows, and some consistent performances, his best possible squad could be emerging.

“I think number one is the intensity and the energy and the collectiveness that we showed in this in this game,” said World Cup hopeful Gio Reyna after the Stars and Stripes' recent 2–1 win over Paraguay. 

“We have a lot of quality around the field. So if we start with intensity and fight together, then we believe that we can be a lot of teams.”

The U.S. could have two friendlies in the June pre-World Cup window and will also play twice in the March international window. They close out the 2025 calendar year against Uruguay on Tuesday evening.

The FIFA Club World Cup did not end with any favorable results for Real Madrid. They were fully focused on the competition, for which they even brought Trent Alexander-Arnold a month early and paid Liverpool for that, and they made an immediate managerial change that they could have easily deferred to the start of the new season. 

But the loss at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain was an awful setback that had been ignored for far too long.

But despite the beating, Los Blancos left the USA with some positives. One was that Dean Huijsen was one of the most clinical defenders there. Another was that Gonzalo Garcia earned a first-team promotion, which he eventually received.

Another takeaway was the remarkable redemption of left back Fran Garcia, who became both a defensive and offensive standout for Xabi's new team. 

The reason it was such a surprising development is that Real Madrid did not even plan for him to be the first-choice left back at the Club World Cup. They wanted Alvaro Carreras, but Benfica's tough negotiations delayed the signing.

Garcia, as a result, was given the opportunity and made the most of it. He played every minute of the six games Real Madrid participated in and finished with a goal and an assist. 

More than the numbers, he performed as a complete left back, the total opposite of how he looked last season. Fans were shocked, and some even questioned the need to sign Carreras.

But things have not been the same for the Spaniard since. After the Club World Cup elimination, Real Madrid completed the signing of Alvaro Carreras, who has since become the first and only choice at left back.

Xabi Alonso has not looked back, and he frankly has no reason to. Carreras is outstanding and fits perfectly in the manager's system. He's sidelined both Fran Garcia and Ferland Mendy.

He is a reliable defender who completely neutralized any Lamine Yamal threat in the recent El Clasico, and he also contributes with goals, assists, and chance creation in the final third.

Since his arrival, Fran Garcia has been largely confined to the bench. So far this season, he has played only four games, averaging 53 minutes each. That is poor and a clear sign that he has fallen out of favor with the manager.

Xabi Alonso has made it clear that Garcia is no longer needed. He has Carreras for the balanced fullback role, and although Garcia has a somewhat similar profile, he is visibly riskier and makes more mistakes than his counterpart. That has undoubtedly stood out.

Unless Carreras suffers a major injury, I do not see any path to redemption for the sidelined Garcia. His time with Los Blancos is all but over.

Despite having only recorded one point in their World Cup qualifying group, Sweden secured a place in the World Cup playoffs on Friday night without even playing. 

Sweden, despite currently being last in their World Cup qualifying group, have now secured a playoff spot for the World Cup thanks to their Nations League C group victory. 

The four best Nations League group winners who do not finish in the top two in the World Cup qualifying group will receive a playoff ticket.

The results in the other groups mean that Sweden's place is now guaranteed after Croatia's group victory on Friday night, as well as Germany's win in Luxembourg, which means that Germany and the Czech Republic will at least finish second in their respective groups. 

There is still a small chance that Sweden can finish second in their World Cup qualifying group and thus get a better seeding than through the Nations League place.

Sweden have otherwise had a dismal World Cup qualifying campaign, where they have lost to unsung Kosovo on two occasions and have only one point to show for four matches. This led to the dismissal of Jon Dahl Tomasson, who was replaced by Graham Potter. ","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Former coach of Malmo FF and the Danish national team, the 72-year old Norwegian Age Hareide, is seriously ill according to the Norwegian media vg.no.

Hareide is currently in Milan, where Norway are due to face Italy in a decisive World Cup qualifier tomorrow. He was supposed to be present as an expert for the television station NRK in connection with the match, but he is not well enough.

Norwegian international team coach Stale Solbakken has just sent a touching greeting to Hareide at a Norwegian press conference in Italy.

""I send my regards to Åge Hareide, who is fighting a battle. He is one of the greatest players. Great coaching career. Victories in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. As one of the few Norwegians, he has World Cup experience as a coach. And he knows what it's all about"", said Solbakken at the press conference.

In his playing career, he played for Hodd and Molde in Norway as well as Manchester City and Norwich City in England. Hareide was capped 50 times playing for Norway.

Hareide has also had a distinguished career as a coach. His biggest achievements were qualifying Malmo FF for the Champions League on several occasions and taking Denmark to the round of the last 16 at the 2018 World Cup. Last year, he stepped down as coach of the Icelandic national team. ","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

FIFA has taken an unprecedented step that will directly affect stadium access for its upcoming competitions, including the 2026 World Cup. The governing body, led by Gianni Infantino, confirmed the creation of official blacklists designed to prevent individuals involved in online abuse from purchasing match tickets.
The decision, announced on International Day for Tolerance, sends a powerful message: hate and harassment on social media will now carry real-world consequences.


FIFA has taken an unprecedented step that will directly affect stadium access for its upcoming competitions, including the 2026 World Cup. The governing body, led by Gianni Infantino, confirmed the creation of official blacklists designed to prevent individuals involved in online abuse from purchasing match tickets.
The decision, announced on International Day for Tolerance, sends a powerful message: hate and harassment on social media will now carry real-world consequences.


Online Abuse Now Comes With Real Sanctions


According to FIFA, the blacklist will include users who have engaged in racist, discriminatory or threatening behavior on social media during official tournaments. Anyone listed will be blocked from buying tickets for FIFA competitions, including the World Cup in United States, Mexico and Canada.

The federation also revealed that it has filed criminal complaints against 11 individuals this year, with cases emerging in Argentina, Brazil, Spain, the United States, France, Poland and the United Kingdom. Member associations have already been notified to take action within their jurisdictions.


A Massive Digital Monitoring System


FIFA's digital surveillance program has expanded significantly since 2022. This year alone, the organization detected over 30,000 abusive posts, and since the start of the project, they have flagged more than 65,000 incidents of harmful content.

During the most recent FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, the monitoring system oversaw 2,401 accounts belonging to players, coaches, clubs and referees across five platforms. In total, 5.9 million posts were analyzed. Of those:



179,517 were flagged for review
20,587 were formally reported



The goal is clear: protect anyone involved in FIFA competitions and stop the normalization of digital abuse.






A Firm Message From FIFA's President


Gianni Infantino emphasized the intent behind the policy:

“Football must be a safe and inclusive space—on the pitch, in the stands and on social media. Abuse has no place in our sport. We will continue working with federations, confederations and law enforcement to hold offenders accountable.”


Direct Impact on the 2026 World Cup


The new blacklist system will be applied immediately to the 2026 World Cup ticket-sale process. Online purchasing platforms will be linked to FIFA's registry of sanctioned users, blocking them from acquiring tickets.

The aim is to ensure that stadiums across the United States, Mexico and Canada remain free of violence—not only physical, but digital as well.

With this policy, FIFA draws a clear line: your behavior online can determine your access to the biggest stages in world football.

After watching Scotland's defeat against Greece in the wake of Denmark's disappointing 2-2 draw against Belarus, the Danish national team coach, Brian Riemer, isn't worried ahead of Tuesday's decisive World Cup qualifying clash in Glasgow. 

""The Scots were in big trouble - big, big trouble. Exactly what I hoped for would happen. They had to come forward on the pitch, and they couldn't handle that. They came back into the match at the end through a set piece, which we also have to be aware of.""

""They are a team that you have to take seriously, but we have more quality. However, not much should go wrong before they can compete with us. So we have to deliver a top performance to ensure our qualification for the World Cup"", said Riemer to the Danish media on Sunday.  

Scotland will have great support behind them on Tuesday evening, as Hampden Park is sold out. Brian Riemer also expects intense pressure from the start. 

""I expect that they will come out firing from the start, but then they will turn into the Scottish team that we know. If it's still tied at the end, they'll try to give it a good shot. That's how I imagine the match will be.""

""I think they're fine with the fact that they haven't necessarily decided the game after ten minutes. If it's 0-0 with 15 minutes left, they'll have to throw everything at it"", said Brian Riemer.

Denmark is currently struggling to contain a stomach virus in the camp, which has sidelined Rasmus Hojlund and Joachim Andersen.

On Sunday and Monday, the national team trains in Helsingor, before the team travels to Glasgow on Monday afternoon.","{'href': 'https://www.flashscore.com', 'title': 'Flashscore.com'}","soccer"

Club, career, more to know about Republic of Ireland's World Cup qualifying hero","https://www.sportingnews.com/uk/football/news/troy-parrott-club-career-republic-ireland/9078f934fde0d5c6ac5b277f","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 17:39:14 GMT","

Kyle Bonn

At both club and international level, it has been a journey for Republic of Ireland forward Troy Parrott to find his way in European football.

On November 16, with his nation's 2026 FIFA World Cup hopes in critical condition, he provided a moment that neither Parrott nor Ireland fans will soon forget.

The striker's 96th-minute winner over Hungary dramatically sent the Boys in Green to the UEFA World Cup qualification playoff phase. They had needed a victory to progress and were trailing 2-1 with 10 minutes to go in Budapest.

Parrott's heroics came at the end of an amazing week in which he had previously outshone Cristiano Ronaldo to give Ireland hope in a World Cup qualifying campaign that had looked certain to end in disappointment.

The Sporting News brings you everything you need to know about the former Tottenham youth product who delivered a truly iconic moment of magic for his country.

Now 23 years old, Parrott has been a regular for the Republic of Ireland national team for nearly a half-decade. He made his international debut in 2019, logging 63 minutes and bagging an assist in a 3-1 friendly win over New Zealand.

After an ankle injury kept him from competing for a starting job for the next year, he would find a way into the Ireland squad on a more permanent basis in 2021, scoring his first two international goals in a 4-1 win over Andorra that summer on just his fifth appearance.

While his career began in England, he would not find club success until moving abroad. As a Tottenham Hotspur youth product, he would make just two appearances for the Premier League side while being shipped out to the likes of Millwall, Ipswich Town, MK Dons, Preston North End, and Excelsior on loan.

It was that final stop that saw him find a permanent home, as he made waves in the Netherlands by scoring 10 goals in 25 regular-season matches for Excelsior, plus another seven goals in four playoff games at the end of the season.

As of 2025/26, Parrott plays for Dutch club AZ Alkmaar of the Eredivisie.

He joined AZ in the summer of 2024 on a €4 million deal from Tottenham, immediately slotting into the starting lineup and excelling almost as soon as he landed back in the Netherlands after his previous productive loan spell.

After scoring 14 goals in 28 league matches his first year at the club, he netted six goals in the first seven matches of the 2025/26 season.

The highlight of Parrott's international career to date was the winning goal he scored against Hungary in the final match of their group-stage journey through 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying.

He found the back of the net in the 96th minute to secure a 3-2 win for the Republic of Ireland, scoring with almost the last kick of the game to secure a place in the playoff round at their opponent's expense.

Goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher, nearly at the halfway line, booted a prayer into the penalty area. It found the head of Liam Scales, who flicked the ball on to Parrott on the doorstep for the point-blank poke into the net.

Troy Parrott, take your place on the pantheon of Irish greats 🇮🇪pic.twitter.com/KATKNMZO4g

While he will be remembered for that single moment, it was a memorable 90 minutes for Parrott, whose winning goal was his third of the match. The hat-trick was his first in international competition, bringing him to double digits for career international goals.

Prior to the Hungary game, Parrott had breathed life into Ireland's qualification hopes by leading his side to a surprise 2-0 win over Portugal in Dublin.

In a match in which Cristiano Ronaldo was shown a straight red card for violent conduct, Parrott scored twice to secure three invaluable points and give his team a chance ahead of the visit to Budapest.

Scotland slipped into danger after a 3-2 defeat to Greece, leaving them one point behind Denmark in Group C.
Both sides now face a winner-takes-all clash on Tuesday, where Scotland must win to avoid missing out on automatic qualification. 






Group J is equally tense, with Wales holding a slim chance of finishing top.
To achieve this, they must defeat North Macedonia and hope Belgium suffers a shock home defeat to Liechtenstein.
Belgium and Portugal, meanwhile, can guarantee their spots with victories in their next fixtures.        
The Netherlands and Norway are all but through, with only improbable goal-difference swings capable of denying them a place.
Africa's qualification picture is nearly complete.
Tunisia and Morocco were the early qualifiers and have since been joined by Algeria, Cape Verde, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Senegal, and South Africa, who will return to the World Cup for the first time since hosting in 2010.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Italy fighting to avoid another 'apocalyptic' World Cup failure","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/clyzeydppzdo","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:02:29 GMT","

Gennaro Gattuso has been Italy manager since June and won his first five games

Four-time winners Italy are one of the most successful nations in World Cup history - but are in danger of missing the finals for the third successive time.

After failing to qualify for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022, Italy are second in their group, three points behind leaders Norway, who play the Azzurri in Milan in the  decider on Sunday.

But Italy need to win by a nine-goal margin at the San Siro to automatically qualify because Norway's goal difference is far superior.

Therefore Italy will likely be dropping into the play-offs, which have been a source of recent heartbreak and embarrassment.

They lost 1-0 on aggregate to Sweden to miss out on the 2018 World Cup, then four years later suffered one of their most humiliating defeats, beaten 1-0 at home by North Macedonia to end their hopes of qualifying for the 2022 tournament.

For the first time, the 2026 World Cup, which will be staged in Canada, Mexico and the United States next June and July, will feature 48 nations.

Italian football journalist James Horncastle, speaking on the Euro Leagues podcast, said: ""Even with an expanded World Cup, that is going to be bigger than ever, for Italy to miss out - it was called apocalyptic the first time they missed out in 2017, I don't know what stage of the apocalypse we are in now.""

Manchester City and Norway striker Erling Haaland is the top goalscorer in qualifying for the World Cup with 14 goals, including this one in the 3-0 win over Italy in June

Italy won the European Championship in 2021, but have not played at a World Cup finals since 2014 when they beat England but lost to Costa Rica and Uruguay and failed to make it beyond the group phase.

Their 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign could not have got off to a worse start.

A tame 3-0 loss in their opener against Norway, with Manchester City's Erling Haaland scoring one of the goals, led to manager Luciano Spalletti publicly announcing his own sacking two days later, though he still took charge of the following 2-0 home win over Moldova.

From then on, Italy have been playing catch-up, with flawless Norway winning their opening seven qualifiers, scoring 33 goals in the process, including 14 for Haaland.

Italy turned to Gennaro Gattuso, a former combative midfielder who helped AC Milan twice win the Champions League and Italy secure their last World Cup trophy in 2006.

Despite managing AC Milan and then winning the Coppa Italia with Napoli, a 23-day spell at Fiorentina saw him leave without taking charge of a game, before he only lasted seven months at Valencia and five months at Marseille.

His most recent appointment had been with Croatian club Hajduk Split, and many felt him becoming Italy manager was a mistake.

""When I heard Gattuso was in line it just seemed to demonstrate the giant collapse of Italy,"" Italian football journalist Mina Rzouki told the Euro Leagues podcast.

""There were so many clips going around on social media about that Italy team just before they won the World Cup and you are talking about Paolo Maldini, [Fabio] Cannavaro, [Alessandro] Nesta, [Francesco] Totti, [Alessandro] Del Piero and it was just an embarrassment of riches. 

""Now when you look at Italy over the last few seasons, even though they won the Euros, there was just a fall - but the one thing you could rely on was that Italy created these great coaches. Yet none of these great coaches were called up or have succeeded. Spalletti did not succeed.""

Horncastle added: ""The players have had their backs against the wall after losing to Norway in June and now the approach that is being imposed on Italy by the Italian media is 'you have to win all your remaining games and have to score lots and lots of goals'.

""Italy had a great coach in Luciano Spalletti, although, for whatever reason, it didn't work out. Gattuso is a more famous manager for his press conferences than the football he has put on the pitch.""

Gennaro Gattuso was instrumental in Italy winning the 2006 World Cup and played the whole final when Italy beat France on penalties

However, under-pressure Italy have entertained under Gattuso, with his side scoring 18 goals in his first five matches in charge. A 5-0 win over Estonia was followed by a chaotic 5-4 success against Israel, then 3-1 and 3-0 victories over Estonia and Israel respectively.

Gattuso's side struggled to get the breakthrough against Moldova on Thursday before two late goals gave Italy a 2-0 win to keep alive their slim hopes of qualifying automatically. 

""So far, so good,"" added Rzouki. ""Spalletti was considered this great tactician but you always had question marks over his ability to really spur on his side.

""Gattuso has come in and screamed at them and told them how much they need to fight for this jersey and they all have the passion inside them. The players are playing for him and admire what he has achieved with the Italian national team.""

If Italy finish second in their group they will then have to face two single-leg play-offs to secure their place at the World Cup, which they won in 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006.

Mateo Retegui has scored five times for Italy in Gennaro Gattuso's opening five games in charge

Despite five wins in five matches, Rzouki feels there needs to be further improvement if they are to qualify and then make an impact in North America.

""You can see they are hungry for goals at all times, but the team has no balance,"" added Rzouki.

""If you look at the way they played against Israel, they were playing Estonia and Israel but you thought they were playing France and Spain. You should be beating Estonia very easily so you should not be so scared. With Israel it's a harder team but you still should win this match without it being a kerfuffle. 

""Israel had loads of chances, had counter-attacks and rotated their players so well and that threw Italy. The big difference with two strikers, and having strikers that are scoring goals. Scoring goals for Italy was so hard, but under Gattuso it looks so easy.

""That balance worries me - they are reckless and look tactically naive at times. Maybe they will be a bit like Barcelona when they outscore opponents, but without the beauty.""

Italy host Norway knowing a huge goal difference swing is needed if they are to qualify automatically


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Norway look destined for their first World Cup appearance since 1998, with Løvene needing only to avoid a nine-goal defeat against Italy to secure their place. They have been in imperious form since the start of the 2026 qualifying campaign in March, winning all seven of their matches. Heavy victories over Moldova, Israel and Estonia have underlined their dominance, but it was the 3–0 win over Italy in Oslo that tilted the group in their favour. Erling Haaland has scored 14 goals, while the now-injured Martin Ødegaard had been supplying his compatriot with ease. It may feel like a party atmosphere for the travelling fans on Sunday, but the players know they still have a job to finish.

Italy, meanwhile, come into this match with nothing to lose. Their 1–0 win over Moldova on Thursday was a disappointment, and any realistic hope of overturning the goal difference has surely vanished. One bright spot is that Gennaro Gattuso remains unbeaten as Azzurri manager since taking charge in June, and he will hope to extend that run against Norway. Expect an attacking lineup, with Italy certain to give it everything as they attempt to reach their first World Cup since 2014. If they fall short, they will head into March's single-leg play-offs, needing to win two more matches to qualify.

The Republic of Ireland pulled off one of the great comebacks in World Cup qualifying history, as they beat Hungary 3-2 in Budapest on Sunday to reach the playoffs for the 2026 World Cup. 

Troy Parrott's hat trick left him in tears as Ireland fans everywhere rejoiced as they finished second in Group F and are now heading to the UEFA playoffs for a spot at their first World Cup finals since 2002. 

They will play a one-off playoff semifinal in March 2026, then if they win that they will play a final with the winner qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. 

A few weeks ago Heimir Hallgrimsson's Ireland looked down and out in qualifying but won all of their final three qualifiers, including a memorable 2-0 win against Portugal in Dublin on Thursday thanks to Parrott's double, to keep their World Cup dream alive. 

That set up a must-win clash in Hungary and Ireland trailed twice, and were 2-1 down with just over 10 minutes to go as Hungary only needed a draw to qualify for the playoffs and sat back to hold on. 

But Parrott made it 2-2 in the 80th minute and then won it in the 96th-minute in dramatic fashion, to send their away fans wild.

The Tottenham Hotspur academy product, who is now at AZ Alkmaar in the Netherlands, couldn't hold back the tears as he spoke to RTE Sport after celebrating with his family in the stands in Budapest. 

“I'm really emotional right now. What a night,” Parrott said. “I can't believe it. I really can't believe it... This is why we love football. Because things like this can happen. I love where I am from. So this means the world to me. My family is here. This is the first time I've cried in years. I really can't believe it... Everyone is crying. I said against Portugal this is what dreams are made of but I don't think I will ever have a better night than this in my life. There's always a chance and we've taken the chance.”

The tournament in USA, Canada and Mexico will be the first with 48 teams taking part in a 12-group format

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

The 48 nations competing at the 2026 World Cup will discover their group stage opponents when the draw takes place on 5 December.

The tournament will be the first to feature 48 teams, expanded from 32 in Qatar, and will also be the first World Cup to be hosted by three countries. The majority of 104 games will be staged in the USA (78), with Mexico and Canada hosting 13 each.

The World Cup will begin on 11 June in Mexico's historic Azteca Stadium, the scene of Brazil's 1970 glory inspired by Pele and Argentina's success in 1986 led by Diego Maradona. 

It will conclude with the final on 19 July at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Here is everything you need to know.

The draw for the 2026 World Cup will take place at 5pm GMT/12pm EST on Friday 5 December, at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC. The US president Donald Trump is expected to be in attendance. 

The 48 nations will be divided into 12 groups containing four teams each, one from each of four draw pots.

Pot one will contain the three host nations – USA, Canada and Mexico – plus the nine top countries in the Fifa world rankings who have qualified for the tournament. Already, Mexico have been assigned Group A, Canada to Group B and the USA to Group C.

Pots two, three and four will contain the next 12 best-ranked sides in order so that, theoretically, the groups will be balanced and the best teams will be kept separate until the knockout rounds.

Teams from the same confederation will be kept apart in the group stage, except for Europe where there are more teams (16) than groups. No group will have more than two European nations.

The top two finishers in each group will qualify automatically for the last-32, along with the eight best third-placed teams. 

The ranking of the third-placed teams will be determined by points, then goal difference, then goals scored. If two or more teams are still level, then “team conduct scores” will come into play (a yellow card is minus one point, a red card via two yellow cards is minus three points, and a straight red card is minus four). If still equal, the team with the highest world ranking will progress. 

Each continental confederation has a set number of nations taking part in the World Cup to decide the first 46 spots. Then a play-off competition will decide the reamining two places.

Uefa (Europe): 16 spots

CAF (Africa): 9 spots

AFC (Asia): 8 spots

Conmebol (South America): 6 spots

Concacaf (North America): 6 spots (including three hosts)

OFC (Oceania): 1 spot

An inter-confederation play-off competition will take place to decide which two additional teams will qualify. Six nations will enter the play-offs: one from CAF, one from AFC, one from OFC, one from Conmebol and two from Concacaf, competing for the last two spots at the World Cup. The inter-confederation play-offs take place in March.

England and Albania already know their finishing spots in World Cup qualifying ahead of Sunday's showdown in Tirana.

England's place at the 2026 World Cup has already been confirmed ahead of its clash against Albania as the qualifying campaign rounds to a close on Sunday. The Three Lions have won seven from seven in UEFA qualifying Group K and can put the finishing touches on a perfect campaign with victory in Tirana.

Runner-up Albania can no longer overcome the seven-point gap between it and England, but at the same time, second place is guaranteed regardless of Sunday's outcome. That means a play-off against one of the other second-place finishers or UEFA Nations League qualifiers awaits in the second round before it can potentially lock down a spot in North America next year.

For that reason, both teams may opt to rest their most prized assets and look to experiment with some of their respective second-string stars this weekend. England has won each of the seven meetings between these teams to date, hoping to round off qualifying with possibly the best record of any European team advancing to the World Cup.

Mauricio Pochettino took a gamble on Reyna, and the midfielder delivered a Man of the Match performance as the USMNT opened November camp with a win.

CHESTER, Pa. - To say Gio Reyna is under pressure is putting it lightly. Everyone knows what's at stake for him, especially after so long on the sidelines. He needed a moment this camp - something that showed why he could, and maybe should, be at the World Cup next summer. It took four minutes for him to deliver it. His opening goal was the moment of the match on Saturday, but it wasn't the only one as he helped lead the U.S. to a 2-1 win over Paraguay at Subaru Park.

Reyna's goal came early and, for the oft-discussed midfielder, it surely felt good. Played in by a Max Arfsten cross, Reyna made no mistake with his header, smashing it off the crossbar and in to set a tone for both himself and his team.

""It wasn't perfect. Just honestly happy to be back playing with this group, with this staff,"" Reyna told Turner Sports after the game. ""It was my first header ever, actually. I've been training [on that] at my club, Gladbach, because I'm pretty tall and feel like I can jump pretty well. It's just about timing and technique. So it's starting to pay off."" 

Paraguay, however, fired right back, taking advantage of a USMNT breakdown to equalize at one apiece in the 10th minute. Alex Arce, the 30-year-old veteran, provided the finishing touch of a Miguel Almiron assist, one that came as a result of several defensive mishaps on the U.S. side. From there, though, the U.S. settled down before, ultimately, getting their winning goal late on from a familiar goalscorer: Folarin Balogun.

Reyna was once again involved, although he won't technically be credited with an assist. His ball in, though, deflected off a defender and straight to Balogun, who made no mistake in netting his third goal in as many starts for the U.S. Reyna acknowledged he's developed off-the-field chemistry with the U.S. striker. 

""We both can just do a bit of everything,"" Reyna explained. ""I think we just try to get working in training and just speak honestly. I think communication is the most important thing between us. And we have a really, really good relationship, on and off the pitch. So it's eye contact, little things that we've grown to know, to get, get each other, get to know each other. So, yeah, it's great to play with him. Makes my life easy, and I try to help him out too."" 

Another win for the U.S., then, who are now unbeaten in four. They've won three of those four and, despite having an obviously weakened lineup, Saturday was the latest of those three. The big story isn't the result, though; it's Reyna, who changed the game on Saturday and offered a reminder that he might just be a player who can change games when they matter more next summer.

GOAL rates the USMNT's players from Subaru Park...

Matt Freese (5/10):

Nothing he could do on the goal. Had little to do otherwise.

Sergino Dest (6/10):

Got forward a whole lot and got back a whole little - which is typical for Dest. Effective, but there were hefty gaps defensively on that right-hand side.

Joe Scally (6/10):

Speaking of that right-hand side, he was a bit too high at points, given the player next to him, but he grew into the game. Misread the ball on Paraguay's goal, although he wasn't the only one to break down on that sequence. Still, there were positive signs worth remembering that could lead to Pochettino trying this again.

Miles Robinson (6/10):

Lost Arce on the goal as the final breakdown on that goal. Was okay otherwise, particularly on the ball as he grew into the game.

Tim Ream (7/10):

Lack of pace was exposed a few times against an athletic Paraguay team. Hit a few stunning cross-field passes, though, and was rock solid outside of that goal sequence.

Max Arfsten (8/10):

Fantastic cross in on Reyna's goal. Showed plenty of ability going forward, as he generally does from that wing back role.

Tanner Tessmann (7/10):

In a word? Tidy. Nothing overly crazy, but he was clean on the ball and decent enough defensively. Certainly handled the physicality well.

Cristian Roldan (6/10):

Had one great chance that forced a decent save. Not wildly dynamic, but did provide consistency and stability in that midfield spot.

Gio Reyna (8/10):

Great header on the goal, which surely felt much-needed. Could have pressed a little better on Paraguay's response, but there's no doubting his ability to impact the game on the attacking side. That popped up again late when he helped set up Balogun's big finish.

Brenden Aaronson (6/10):

Got absolutely mauled all through the first half, but kept getting back up. Had a few good moments on the ball, but was generally knocked down before they turned into much.

Folarin Balogun (8/10):

Didn't get much service throughout, but did press hard. Was finally rewarded with a good bounce to him for his goal, which was taken well.

Alex Freeman (6/10):

Certainly known for his attacking skill, but did bring a bit more stability on the right once he was thrown into the match. Got into a bit of a scrap at the end, but was nowhere near his fault.

Diego Luna (7/10):

Typical from Luna, who made his impact by nearly getting an assist.

Aidan Morris (6/10):

Didn't get too many touches after replacing Roldan

Timothy Tillman (6/10):

Created a dangerous moment soon after coming on, so kudos to him, especially considering the fact that he was a late call-up.

Ricardo Pepi (5/10):

Had a golden opportunity, but took one too many touches to allow Paraguay time to block it away.

Sebastian Berhalter (N/A):

Came on late to replace Aaronson. Shoutout to him for jumping right in to defend Freeman, though.

Mauricio Pochettino (7/10):

Threw out a strong lineup and was rewarded with a win. He'll be happy with plenty of what he saw, which is the big goal of this camp, isn't it?","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Liverpool star Ibrahima Konate has revealed that he gets calls from compatriot Kylian Mbappe every two hours to sign for Real Madrid. The French defender is into the final year of his contract and from January he will be able to hold pre-contract talks with clubs abroad. The Reds, on the other hand, are determined to offer him a new deal to avoid another situation like Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Konate has established himself as a key figure in Liverpool's starting lineup ever since his move from Bundesliga side RB Leipzig in 2021. The 26-year-old has formed a strong partnership with Virgil van Dijk at the heart of the Reds' defence and has made 147 appearances for the Premier League giants across all competitions and scored six goals.

However, speculation remains rife regarding Konate's future ahead of the January transfer window. The centre-back is into the final year of his current contract and it is up in the air as to whether he will ink fresh terms at Anfield. 

BILD reported last week that German giants Bayern Munich are tentatively weighing up a move to rival La Liga heavyweights Real Madrid by making a bid for Konate, who is eligible to hold pre-contract talks with clubs outside of England from January 1. Los Blancos, on the other hand, have been long-time admirers of the defender.

Konate recently revealed that he gets constant phone calls from his France team-mate and captain Mbappe, as the Madrid star is determined to convince the defender to join him at the Spanish capital next summer. Speaking to Telefoot, Konate said Mbappe ""calls me every two hours to sign for Real Madrid.""

Los Blancos are in no hurry when it comes to Konate, as Liverpool have only a few weeks to convince the player and make him sign a new deal before he starts to negotiate new offers. Madrid would want Konate to reject a new contract and then join them in the summer for free, quite similar to the way they landed Alexander-Arnold.

Reds legend and pundit Jamie Carragher recently claimed that while he would love to see Konate stay at Anfield, if he leaves for Madrid next summer, the Merseyside club won't miss the centre-back much. He told the Daily Mail: ""I'd like him [Konate] to stay but if he doesn't stay, Liverpool will sign someone else. Liverpool won't fall apart if Konate leaves. He's not Virgil van Dijk. He's a good centre-back who you hope will sign, but if he doesn't want to sign, Liverpool will be absolutely fine. He's a very good centre-back, he's a title winner at Liverpool, he's played in the Champions League final against Real Madrid. He's obviously a quality centre-back. It's not poor management [if he goes for free]. You can't physically make somebody sign a contract. Then it's your decision, do you keep him to the length of his contract or do you sell him?""

Konate has appeared in 16 matches for the Reds across all competitions this term. Despite featuring regularly under Arne Slot, Carragher believes there is still scope for the Frenchman to improve as he added: ""It's still only a couple of games. He hasn't had a great start to the season and he needs to show a bit more consistency. 

""He was fantastic against Real Madrid and he needs to keep that going over the next few months, it can't just be two games on the bounce. There are no secrets [to picking up your form]. It's about working harder and you become more professional. It's on your mind constantly that you want to get back into good form and every you think tiny detail will make a difference, whether that's what you eat, what time you go to sleep, it's just becoming an ultra-professional on and off the pitch.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Wayne Rooney opens up on incredible Donald Trump encounter during game of golf with US president","https://www.goal.com/en-gb/lists/snipers-nuclear-attacks-wayne-rooney-donald-trump-encounter-golf-us-president/blt14a6d7889a5873da","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:42:50 GMT","

Wayne Rooney has revealed he would be 'f*cked' if there was a nuclear attack as he discussed a surreal meeting with Donald Trump. The former Manchester United and England striker told all during a guest appearance on 'A League of Their Own' as the US President gave Rooney a stark warning were all hell to break loose when the pair met on the golf course during Trump's first term.

Rooney was still on the books at MLS side DC United when he came face-to-face with Trump. The former striker his trade for the American side for a year, joining in 2018 before returning to England with Derby at the start of 2020.

The ex-Everton and United hero didn't disappoint during his time in Washington as he scored 23 goals and laid on 13 assists across 50 league appearances for DC United. Rooney then joined the Rams in January 2020 having agreed a deal to move to Derby in August 2019 despite having two years left to run on his deal with the MLS outfit.

During his time with DC United, Rooney made the trip to Trump National golf course after a friend flew from Manchester to Washington. And they were joined by an unexpected guest after Trump got wind that Rooney had visited the course and wanted to get involved.

Rooney revealed all about meeting Trump on 'A League of Their Own', stating: ""When he was President the first time, I went to play golf. My friend was over from Manchester. We went to play golf at his course and when we got there, there were sniffer dogs and there was security everywhere.

""And he said, ‘the President's coming in, he's playing with you'. We're playing with snipers everywhere. There's all kinds. It was surreal. There were three big Escalades there. And one of them had a box on the back.

""So, I said to him, ‘what's that for?'. He said if there's a nuclear attack, he gets put in that and airlifted out. So I was like, ‘what happens to us?'. He was like, ‘you are f*cked'!""

Rooney spoke in depth about the encounter with Trump, telling The Overlap last year: ""The maddest thing about it was we had (Rudy) Giuliani in the buggy behind us, then there were about 50-100 golf buggies that were all security.

""There was a boat in the lake with snipers, there were snipers in the bushes, and I was like 'What's going on here?!'""

Rooney was asked by Trump to coach his son, Barron, when he was living in the United States during the final knockings of his career. ""Donald asked me to give his son football lessons,"" he added.

During his time stateside, Rooney and his family were invited to the White House by Trump as the US President and wife Melania hosted a Christmas event. Wife Coleen and their four children followed the player across the pond as they set up camp in the capital.

And Coleen has revealed her first interaction with Trump, which left the 39-year-old shocked. ""So, when I came in, he [Trump] said to his son [Barron], 'See, I told you all the soccer players get the good-looking girls',"" Coleen Rooney told the Stick to Football podcast.

Rooney's wife stated that her mother wasn't impressed with the lewd comment, adding: ""When I've come out, I've told my mum, she was like 'Ergh'.""

Rooney returned to DC United as manager in July 2022 as he replaced outgoing boss Hernan Losada, penning a deal until the end of the 2023 season. However, having failed to make the playoffs for the second season running, Rooney left the MLS side in October 2023.

Rooney has struggled as a football manager following his retirement from the game having endured doomed spells with Birmingham and, most recently, Plymouth. Having been appointed on a three-year deal to manage Argyle in May 2004, Rooney departed in December that year with the Pilgrims bottom of the Championship and four points from safety. He hasn't managed since.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Cristiano Ronaldo has been sent home by Portugal following his red card against the Republic of Ireland on Thursday. Ronaldo received his marching orders on the hour mark, his first dismissal of his international career, having elbowed Ireland defender Dara O'Shea, as the Selecao crashed to a surprise 2-0 defeat at the Aviva Stadium. Portugal remain top of World Cup qualifying Group F despite the loss.

However, the Selecao's progression to the 2026 World Cup isn't quite so cut and dry following Thursday's reverse. Troy Parrott bagged a first half brace for the Boys In Green as Ireland made it back-to-back wins to give their play-off hopes a much-needed shot in the arm.

Ireland now face Hungary, who sit one point above Heimir Hallgrimsson's side, on Sunday afternoon needing to win in order to leapfrog the Magyars into second place. Hungary may yet finish first if they win and Portugal lose to Armenia, though even without Ronaldo, that seems unlikely.

The 40-year-old won't be hanging around to watch Portugal's game at the Estadio do Dragao in Porto on Sunday afternoon after the experienced striker was 'released from the national team' according to Portuguese publication A Bola. Ronaldo had put in a sluggish performance up until his dismissal in what proved a frustrating evening for the Portugal captain.

Before the game, Ronaldo had promised to be a 'good boy' upon his return to Ireland, stating: ""I really like the fans here. The support they give to their national team is lovely.

""For me, it's a pleasure to play here again, I hope they don't boo me too much tomorrow - I swear that I'm going to try to be a good boy.""

Ronaldo's red card was met with disbelief by the experienced striker, who turned to sarcastically applaud the home crowd before trudging towards the tunnel. And the Al-Nassr hitman had to be held back by former Chelsea defender Ricardo Carvalho after the Portuguese hero appeared to mouth 'well done' in the direction of the Irish dugout.

Portugal head coach Roberto Martinez came to the defence of Ronaldo after Thursday's defeat and argued that the captain's outburst was not 'violent'. ""Of course, we spoke I think it's difficult for a player like Cristiano, who's in the box. And today he had two defenders constantly in physical contact,"" Martinez said.

""There's no violence. He tries to push the defender away and he was unlucky that the VAR... the angle of the images [makes it look] worse than what happened. It's Ronaldo's first red card for the national team, it's incredible.""

A straight red card on the international stage tends to carry a two-match ban, which means Ronaldo may miss Portugal's World Cup opener if they to get the job done against Armenia and avoid needing to jet stateside next summer via the play-offs.

Manchester United captain and Ronaldo's Portugal team-mate Bruno Fernandes has admitted that the frontman made a mistake but that his dismissal made things more difficult in Ireland last week. Fernandes, who sat out the game against Ireland owing to a ban of his own, said: ""That happens in football, a moment where Cris had a reaction that cost him dearly.

""Something he didn't want to do, but it ended up happening. He knows he made a mistake and unfortunately couldn't help us, but it doesn't change the fact that we were already behind in the game.

""It made things a little more difficult, because we were playing with 10 men and didn't have a player who could score a goal at any moment.""

Portugal are still expected to finish top of Group F on Sunday as they gear up to take on Armenia on home turf. Armenia have lost four of their five World Cup qualifiers, including a resounding 5-0 loss to Martinez's men at the Vazgen Sargsyan Republican Stadium back in September.

Ronaldo scored twice in that resounding victory, while Joao Felix - twice - and Joao Cancelo also got on the scoresheet earlier in the year.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Portugal player ratings vs Armenia: Bruno Fernandes and João Neves net hat-tricks as Cristiano Ronaldo sits suspended in nine-goal win to clinch World Cup spot","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/portugal-player-ratings-armenia-cristiano-ronaldo-bruno-fernandes-joao-neves-world-cup/blt84d3c244734d3be9","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:58:53 GMT","

Bruno Fernandes and Joao Neves hat-tricks helped a Cristiano Ronaldo-less Portugal qualify for the 2026 World Cup with an emphatic 9-1 win over Armenia on Sunday. The Seleccao were without their iconic forward following his red card against Ireland, but virtuoso displays from Fernandes and Neves ensured they topped UEFA Group F thanks to a thumping victory.

After their shock loss to Ireland in midweek, Portugal seemed determined to right the wrongs of what happened in Dublin, and it took just seven minutes to ease fans' nerves when Fernandes' free-kick was pushed onto the post by Armenia goalkeeper Henry Avagyan, and Renato Veiga was on hand to head into the empty net. Boos were soon ringing around Sporting CP's stadium, however, when Eduard Sperstian bundled the ball home from close range after the Portuguese defence was cut open in the 18th minute. 

Not long after supporters held a minute's applause for the late Diogo Jota, Goncalo Ramos pounced on a poor back pass by Artur Serobyan to restore the home side's advantage, and less than 90 seconds later, Neves smashed in a first-time beauty from the edge of the box on the half-hour mark. Hopes of a comeback were well and truly over when Neves bent a brilliant curling free-kick in off the bar from 25 yards out to make it 4-1 four minutes before half-time, and moments after Joao Cancelo's effort was deflected onto the post, Portugal were awarded a penalty when Ruben Dias was hauled down in the box, and Fernandes duly dispatched the subsequent spot-kick in first-half stoppage time.

Portugal's relentless march forward continued when Fernandes swept home his side's sixth in the 51st minute after good, determined work from Ramos, and the Manchester United captain had his third goal of the day when he scored his second penalty after substitute Carlos Forbs was felled in the area. The 104th-ranked side in the world, Armenia seemed ready to put this game behind them when Neves grabbed his hat-trick with an acrobatic finish nine minutes from the end, and substitute Francisco Conceicao made it 9-1 at the death.

GOAL rates Portugal's players from Estadio do Dragao...

Diogo Costa (6/10):

Was a virtual spectator for the majority of the contest, other than picking the ball out of his net for Armenia's goal. 

Nelson Semedo (6/10):

Was guilty of losing his man for Armenia's shock equaliser as he switched off at the crucial moment.

Ruben Dias (7/10):

Won his side a penalty just before the interval and led a defence that never really looked troubled, apart from the odd opening. 

Renato Veiga (7/10):

Was in the right place at the right time as he calmly headed Portugal into the lead. Will need to face stronger opposition to be a guaranteed starter, though.

Joao Cancelo (5/10):

The former Manchester City man was shrugged off too easily for Armenia's equaliser and also made some rash challenges. May need to improve to tie down a World Cup starting spot.

Joao Neves (10/10):

Rifled in a terrific strike from 18 yards out to give Portugal a two-goal cushion and then backed that up with an even better goal, this time with a sumptuous free-kick. Scored a classy third for one of the best hat-tricks you are likely to see.

Vitinha (8/10):

The Paris Saint-Germain talisman ran the show in midfield. He danced past would-be tacklers with ease and looked so calm on the ball.

Bruno Fernandes (9/10):

Fired in a dangerous free-kick that directly led to Portugal's early opener and took his penalties well with a stuttering run-up. Executed a first-time finish with aplomb for his second, and could have had five goals rather than just three.

Bernardo Silva (6/10):

Linked up nicely with his team-mates but left others to rip apart their overpowered opponents. 

Goncalo Ramos (8/10):

The striker showed good anticipation and clarity of thought to make it 2-1 with his interception goal and neatly assisted Fernandes as Portugal ran riot.

Rafael Leao (6/10):

His pace and power caused Armenia trouble, but he didn't get that many clear-cut chances during his 55-minute outing.

Carlos Forbs (7/10):

Won his side a penalty not long after being introduced, as his speed and agility came to the fore.

Francisco Conceicao (8/10):

Was full of purpose and was a proper livewire off the bench. Worked hard for his goal, which he took very well, to make it 9-1 at the death.

Joao Felix (5/10):

Came on for his 50th Portugal cap but didn't do a great deal right.

Ruben Neves (N/A):

Didn't have much of the ball.

Matheus Nunes (N/A):

Had too little time to make an impression on the game.

Roberto Martinez (7/10):

Would not have been pleased with how his team conceded but was clearly delighted by the margin and manner of the victory. His substitutes had a positive impact, too.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Tony Meola reacted to Gio Reyna's showing in the USMNT's 2-1 win over Paraguay, praising his goal and chance created and noting his importance to the team despite lingering fitness questions. He said Reyna should be encouraged by the performance, which marked a strong return after a long spell away. The 22-year-old played 75 minutes on Saturday. 

Meola noted that Reyna should feel encouraged by his recent display, which included both a goal and a chance created that led to Folarin Balogun's game-winner, marking a significant return to form after a lengthy absence from the national team. 

“He should feel good about his performance, getting back to the national team,” Meola said on the CBS Sports Golazo America podcast. “It's a pressure moment for him. We talked about how this is the storyline for tonight. We can make up some of the other storylines, but Gio Reyna is the story.

“He's probably not even close to where he needs to be for his career with regards to fitness, minutes, and confidence, and all of that stuff. And we can only hope that his time at Gladbach continues to grow, and continues to get to a place where now he can go 90 minutes.”

According to Meola, head coach Mauricio Pochettino regards Reyna as an exception in the USMNT roster, highlighting the unique skill set and creativity he brings to the team. This distinction underscores the coaching staff's belief in Reyna's potential to influence games decisively when fully integrated and fit.

“Mauricio Pochettino has been steadfast on if you don't play at your club, you're not playing in the national team,” Meola explained. “And then you go make, what he calls an exception, he's the exception. Every manager has one of those but then you gotta go and you gotta play well. Then you gotta go and you gotta perform. You gotta show the manager ‘Ok you got faith in me? I got to give you something in the end.' He gets a goal and probably the assist [for the second], he's involved in the play and has great touches in the first half.""

Meola has regularly argued that Reyna brings a rare creative profile to the U.S. pool - quick feet, tight-space vision, and the ability to unlock defences - and reiterated that view after the Paraguay game. His position is straightforward: the USMNT is a stronger team when Reyna is firing on all cylinders, but that upside is only useful if the player can combine fitness and form consistently.

“I still think and I've said this all along, we're a better team when he's at his best version,” Meola said. “And whether he comes off the bench or whether he starts, he can make an impact for this team.”

The USMNT will face Uruguay next on Nov. 18.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Mikel Oyarzabal steals the show as Martin Zubimendi also stars to put La Roja on brink of World Cup qualification","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/spain-player-ratings-vs-georgia-no-lamine-yamal-no-problem-mikel-oyarzabal-steals-the-show-la-roja-all-but-seal-world-cup-spot/bltbe2090286316f3d2","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 02:32:12 GMT","

European champions Spain have all-but qualified for next summer's World Cup after crushing Georgia 4-0 on Saturday evening. Two goals from Mikel Oyarzabal and strikes from Martin Zubimendi and Ferran Torres saw Luis de la Fuente's side maintain their 100 per cent record in Group E, on an evening when second-placed Turkey also defeated Bulgaria 2-0.

Controlling possession from the get-go, Spain - without star forward Lamine Yamal and defender Dean Huijsen through injury - were awarded an early penalty when Georgia defender Giorgi Gocholeishvili was adjudged to have handled Torres' cross by VAR. On his 50th cap for La Roja, Real Sociedad striker Oyarzabal subsequently stepped up to send Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili the wrong way.

And after midfielder Alex Baena hit the post, Spain soon made it 2-0 when Zubimendi latched onto Fabian Ruiz's lovely through ball to dink the ball home. Completing what was a dominant opening 45 minutes, De la Fuente's men made it 3-0 when Torres tapped home from Oyarzabal's low cross.

Looking for an early reply in the second half, Georgia carved out a decent chance when midfielder Anzor Mekvabishvili stung the palms of Spain shot-stopper Unai Simon with a long-range effort. But the visitors soon extended their lead when Oyarzabal headed home from Torres' lovely cross. 

Pushing and probing for a fifth which did not arrive, Spain saw out a comprehensive victory which all-but seals their spot at the World Cup, with next week's opponents Turkey highly unlikely to overturn their 14-goal deficit when the two sides meet on Tuesday.

GOAL rates Spain's players from Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena...

Unai Simon (6/10):

Wearing the captain's armband on a fruitful night for his country, the Athletic Club goalkeeper had little to do.

Pedro Porro (6/10):

Looked destined to record an assist when Oyarzabal met his delightful cross but the forward was denied by Georgia 'keeper Mamardashvili. Replaced at half-time by Marcos Llorente.

Pau Cubarsi (6/10):

Handed a start following Huijsen's absence, the Barcelona youngster was cool and calm in possession.

Aymeric Laporte (7/10):

Like Cubarsi, the centre-back was comfortable on the ball, helping Spain build from the back.

Marc Cucurella (7/10):

As you would expect, he was tenacious without the ball, pressing high to stop Georgia's would-be attacks at source.

Mikel Merino (6/10):

Neat and tidy on the ball, he was unable to add to his six goals in qualifying, despite Spain's dominance.

Martin Zubimendi (8/10):

Instrumental in both defence and attack, the Arsenal ace doubled Spain's lead with a beautiful dinked finish.

Fabian Ruiz (7/10):

Brilliant as always at reading the game, the midfielder registered the assist for Zubimendi's goal thanks to a crisp through ball.

Ferran Torres (8/10):

After winning the penalty which brought about Spain's opener, the Barcelona forward soon got on the scoresheet himself, latching onto Oyarzabal's cross to tap home. He then returned the favour by playing in the cross for the Sociedad legend's header.

Mikel Oyazarbal (9/10):

Marked his 50th appearance for La Roja with a coolly-converted penalty, before teeing up Torres for Spain's third. He then rounded off an impressive display with a fantastic header in the second half.

Alex Baena (7/10):

Injecting plenty of guile into Spain's play going forward, the midfielder hit the post before getting a pre-assist for Torres' strike.

Marcos Llorente (7/10):

Replacing Pedro Porro at half-time, the Atletico Madrid man was solid defensively, making a crucial clearance late on to ensure Spain are yet to concede in qualifying.

Fermin Lopez (7/10):

Introduced just after the hour mark, he was involved in the build-up to Spain's fourth, playing in Torres with a cute pass.

Pablo Barrios (6/10):

A second-half substitute, the midfielder didn't put a foot wrong in a low-key performance.

Borja Iglesias (5/10):

Replacing man-of-the-match Oyarzabal, he passed up a golden opportunity to score late on, blazing over from close range.

Yeremy Pino (N/A):

Unable to make an impact as a late substitute.

Luis de la Fuente (7/10):

His pre-match team talk certainly worked as Spain were rampant in the opening 45 minutes. His substitutions were good, too, maintaining his side's dominance over proceedings.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:1000goals.com","Germany, Portugal, Belgium Still Need to Battle for World Cup Qualification","https://www.1000goals.com/news/germany-portugal-belgium-still-need-to-battle-for-world-cup-qualification/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 01:27:35 GMT","

Germany, Portugal, and Belgium are among the top European footballing nations that are yet to secure their World Cup 2026 qualification spot. All three countries will need to decide their future on matchday 10, which is the final game in their groups next midweek.

Julian Nagelsmann's men's shock first qualifier game defeat against Slovakia puts them in a tough spot, as they now have to decide their WC 2026 future in the last game. Germany's next match was against the same opponent that beat them in the first qualifier game.

Die Mannschaft are currently level on points with Slovakia, but Nagelsmann's side are currently ahead on goal difference. That's why a win is important to firmly secure their direct World Cup qualification instead of having to go through a tricky playoff situation.

Portugal, on the other hand, had every chance to secure their qualification two games earlier, but somehow blew it off. Their failure to beat Hungary last month and their recent shock loss against Ireland put the Selecao das Quinas in a must-win game situation this upcoming midweek as they face Armenia at home.

Because of their loss against Ireland, which saw Cristiano Ronaldo get sent off, the Portugal national team are only two points ahead of their rival, Hungary. So, a win is certainly a must for Roberto Martinez's men if they want to secure that direct qualification spot.

Similar to Portugal, Belgium also put its direct qualification on hold after only picking up a 1-1 draw against Kazakhstan this weekend. The Red Devils now must grab all three points on their final group match against Liechtenstein, as Rudi Garcia's team are only two points ahead of their rival, North Macedonia, in the standings.

Those three teams still have the possibility of having to endure a grueling and troublesome playoff round if they don't get things right in their final group games.

Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten captured their first Nitto ATP Finals crown as a team on Sunday when they defeated Joe Salisbury and Neal Skupski 7-5, 6-3 to snap the remarkable winning streak of two-time champion Salisbury.

After dispatching Italians Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori to reach the title match for the first time, Heliovaara and Patten were once again assured throughout the final. The Finn-British team lost to Salisbury and Skupski in the round-robin stage but delivered a commanding performance to improve to 3-2 in the teams' Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

The second seeds produced a number of stunning passing shots and were rock-solid on serve, not facing a break point to triumph after 80 minutes. It is the eighth time in the tournament's history that the team that lost to its final opponent in the round-robin stage earned revenge to triumph in the championship match.

""It is hard to describe,"" Heliovaara said. ""The whole week I have looked at the list of winners, with huge winners and I thought, if there was ever going to be my name on that, I am going to be so proud. To be there next to Henry is unreal.""



Heliovaara and Patten end the season holding a 50-20 record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The Finn-British team captured the trophy at the Australian Open and also won crowns in Paris and Beijing.

After triumphing in the Inalpi Arena, Heliovaara dropped his racquet and let out a roar, while Patten raised his fist aloft. Patten is a double winner this week, having got engaged to longtime partner Ellie Stone in Turin.

""The tennis is pretty good but the engagement was something special,"" Patten said. ""It has been a complete dream for me. Ellie has been here supporting me all week. I am a very happy guy right now. I feel unbelievably lucky to have a partner like her and a partner like Harri.""

Salisbury had won his past 14 matches at the Nitto ATP Finals, clinching the title in 2022 and 2023 with Rajeev Ram before he failed to qualify in 2024. Skupski was competing in his first final at the year-end event.

The Brits also lost title matches at Roland Garros and the US Open in 2025. They end their partnership with a 46-22 record on the season.

Jannik Sinner is turning into an indoor titan.

The Italian, who will play Carlos Alcaraz for the Nitto ATP Finals title Sunday, has become dominant with a roof over his head. The second seed's semi-final against Alex de Minaur was his 30th in a row indoors and he shows no sign of slowing down.

Sinner's winning streak is already the sixth longest in the Open Era (carpet not included) and dates back to the championship match in Turin two years ago, when he fell to Novak Djokovic. Only John McEnroe, Djokovic, Roger Federer and Ivan Lendl have won more consecutive indoor hard-court matches, with Federer accomplishing the feat twice.

McEnroe owns the longest streak in the Open Era, having emerged victorious in 47 straight indoor hard-court matches from 1978 through 1987. Nobody else has won more than 35 in a row.

Longest Indoor Hard-Court Winning Streaks in Open Era




What is most impressive about Sinner's streak is not just that he has won, but how convincingly he has done so. The Italian has needed a deciding set in just three of the 30 triumphs he has earned during this streak. In his 27 straight-sets wins, Sinner has needed just six tie-breaks.

At last year's Nitto ATP Finals, Sinner did not drop more than four games in a set, becoming the first player to win the season finale without losing a set since Lendl in 1986. He has not lost a set or serve through four matches this year in Turin, either. 

Since the ATP began tracking service statistics in 1991, Novak Djokovic is the only other player who has made the championship match at the Nitto ATP Finals without losing a service game (2018). Sinner has an idea of why he is successful in such conditions.

“I feel like when someone hits fast, it's very difficult to change the pace of the ball. So this for sure helps me a lot playing indoors,” Sinner said. “[At] the same time I also try to change the pace because it is essential and it is important, especially with the difference of the players you play against.

“But yeah, you don't have the wind, you don't have the sun. You always have the same feeling on the court. It also helps you to feel more and more comfortable, at least from my side.”





Sinner's indoor performance ranks highly not just among his peers, but among the all-time greats. The San Candido native is 90-21 indoors, giving him the fourth-best winning percentage in the Open Era according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Only McEnroe (85.3%), Lendl (83%) and Jimmy Connors (81.6%) have won at a higher rate. He passed Roger Federer (81%) and Bjorn Borg (80.6%) during the Nitto ATP Finals.

No other active player, including Djokovic (80.2%), has won a better percentage of indoor matches. Sinner can continue his imperious indoor play this week but extending his winning streak to 31 and successfully defending his Nitto ATP Finals trophy.

Alcaraz leads Sinner in their overall head-to-head, 10-5, but there's a clear split—Sinner led 4-3 at the end of 2023, and Alcaraz is 7-1 since the start of 2024. The Spaniard also leads 5-2 in finals, 7-2 on hard courts, and more specifically 1-0 on indoor hard courts, a 7-6 (1), 7-5 win in the second round of the Masters 1000 event in Paris in 2021 (at the time, Sinner was No. 9 and Alcaraz was No. 35).And finally, Alcaraz and Sinner have accounted for 9 of the 10 final spots at the five biggest tournaments of 2025, almost completely shutting out the rest of the men's tour from competing for titles at the Grand Slams and ATP Finals. The only other player who even had a chance at playing for one of those titles this year was Alexander Zverev, who made the Australian Open final... where he fell to Sinner.

At just 23 years old Zeynep Sönmez stands at the forefront of a new era in Turkish tennis. The world No. 113, who broke into the Top 70 for the first time in October, has already carved her name into the nation's sporting history, and her trajectory continues to point sharply upward. From winning Türkiye's first WTA singles title in nearly a decade to reaching the third round at Wimbledon, Sönmez has become a symbol of resilience, ambition and quiet confidence.This week in Ismaning, during Türkiye's 2–1 victory over Germany in their first-ever Billie Jean King Cup Play-offs appearance, she showed exactly why.📲🖥️ Stream all the action from the BJK Cup Play-Offs on the Tennis Channel App!A Leader on the Biggest StageTürkiye's historic win hinged on Sönmez, who delivered not once but twice on Friday. She outlasted German No. 1 Eva Lys in a physically and emotionally demanding three-set singles battle, then returned to the court alongside Ayla Aksu to clinch the decisive doubles point.“It was a very tough match against Eva in singles,” Sönmez said after the tie. “I love playing against her. I love her personality. We are good friends and it's good to share the court with her. In doubles, with Ayla, it was good energy on court. We are very happy.”

Her performance continues a strong record in the competition: Sönmez is now 8–4 across singles since her Billie Jean King Cup debut in 2022 and went undefeated (3–0) in April's Europe/Africa Group I event, notching wins over France's Varvara Gracheva, Sweden's Lisa Zaar, and Hungary's Anna Bondar.With Türkiye bidding to reach the Qualifiers for the first time, her steady rise comes at a perfect moment.“We will try to play our best tennis,” she added. “We love to represent our country.

Sönmez's match against Eva Lys carried added meaning. The two travel together frequently, confide in one another, and share a warm off-court friendship that contrasts with the competitive intensity on court.“She is one of the nicest girls on tour,” Sönmez said with a smile. “She is always smiling, always positive. It's fun to spend time with her. She gives me a lot of good energy. When I am down or sad, I know I can go to Eva and talk to her. We are very good friends and it's great to have her in my life.”A Versatile and Evolving GameSönmez describes her playing style as aggressive but adaptable—an approach that has helped her transition from ITF World Tennis Tour titles to deeper runs at WTA level..“I play quite aggressive,” she explained. “I don't play so close to the line, but I always try to go in and end up at the volley. But I also have a defensive side.”

This balance paid off in 2024, when she won her maiden WTA 250 title in Mérida, Mexico—becoming only the second Turkish woman ever to win a WTA event, following Cagla Büyukakcay's historic victory in Istanbul in 2016.“It was really great. I love Mexico. I feel so loved there,” she recalled. “It was very special winning my first WTA title. I will always remember that tournament.”In 2025, she broke another barrier, becoming the first Turkish woman in the Open Era to reach the third round of a Grand Slam at Wimbledon; Bahtiye Musluoglu was the last to do that at the 1950 French Open.Grounded by Home, Driven by PassionDespite her global travel schedule, Istanbul remains her base.

Q. You are the world No. 1, but Jannik has this amazing indoor record. Who is the favorite?CARLOS ALCARAZ: Who is the favorite (smiling)? I mean, the No. 1 means that I've been playing really good during the whole season, in the whole surfaces. He's playing the best on indoor court. We're playing in front of his home crowd.

The 'Marty Supreme' and 'Jay Kelly' stars sat down for an intimate conversation — and a pickup basketball game — in Los Angeles on Saturday.


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


	‘Tis the season for star-studded awards season convos, and Saturday night delivered as Adam Sandler and Timothée Chalamet met up at Fairfax High School in Los Angeles to talk both movies and ball. 


	Seated on the school's basketball courts and brought in through a tunnel of USC cheerleaders, Chalamet and Sandler discussed first meeting on 2014's Men, Women & Children, which the Dune star's scenes were cut out of.




	“I was at the [premiere] party at the Toronto Film Festival and I was sitting there and I was bummed, and you were leaving the party and you gave me a nice little shoulder pat; man, it meant a lot,” Chalamet told Sandler, then recalling how the two reconnected around the time of Uncut Gems.

	“When we were doing the circuit, walking around talking about Uncut Gems, you did a speech one night about Uncut Gems and you had, like, the greatest speech of the night, just pumping it up,” Sandler noted. “I remember seeing [director] Josh [Safdie] watching you say that speech going, ‘Fuck, I'm doing a movie with that guy.'” Chalamet admitted, “That's what I was doing man, I was kissing the ring. I was trailing the Uncut Gems crew so much that Idina Menzel, the great Adele Dazeem, said to Josh, ‘Is he in the movie?'”

	Throughout the conversation — put on by Vanity Fair and centered around Chalamet's work in Safdie's Marty Supreme and Sandler's performance in Jay Kelly — the two reflected on their careers through a series of film clips while also bonding over their love of basketball. 

	











	“The times we've played basketball, we haven't had great luck. We played these random kids and that was rough,” Chalamet remembered, as Sandler added, “You're very good, awesome. I'm fine. We played these two kids, just out of nowhere they just so happened to be so fucking good.” (Soon after, one turned up as Sandler's waiter on a night out).

	The pair discussed moments on Saturday Night Live, as well as Chalamet shooting Call Me By Your Name, Dune (revealing he just wrapped the third film four days ago) and A Complete Unknown; for Sandler, the Punch-Drunk Love segment was a highlight, as Chalamet gushed, “To actors across all ages but really my generation, it's one of the most important performances — impactful, deeply moving. I think because you've ascended to such commercial heights that the people that aren't really in the know don't understand how impactful that performance was and how incredibly nuanced and deeply lived in and heartbreaking it is.”


	The younger star continued, “Hopefully Jay Kelly, it should have been Uncut Gems — I know it's not about awards but you should have a golden man in your hand because you're one of the best fucking actors.”


	Speaking of Jay Kelly, Sandler brought it back to basketball while noting he used to play with co-star George Clooney, as Chalamet responded, “No way, he balls?” 


	“He's great. We played ball when he hosted SNL. He took the whole cast, I think he rented out a YMCA,” Sandler replied. “[Chris] Farley and me and a bunch of goofy comedians, we all went and played ball with Clooney and he was fantastic.” 

	











	Chalamet asked Sandler how he keeps his comedic edge with such a stable personal life, as Sandler turned the “how do you do it?” question back on him after seeing what he deals with in public. “You have it worse than me because you've got so many fucking photographers following you and shit, which makes life nuts,” Sandler said, as Chalamet joked that was only when the pair were playing basketball and he called the paparazzi to come to capture the moment. 


	Getting around to Marty Supreme, Chalamet said of his latest project that Safdie “empowered me to be something I would almost be wary of being in this world and this day and age, which is to be openly aspirational and want to live out your dreams to huge heights… I feel like the gift of my life is to focus on this acting thing the way [his character] Marty Mauser is locked in on ping pong.” And to bring things full circle, the two stars closed out the night with a surprise two-on-two basketball game against a pair of fans (which Chalamet and Sandler unfortunately lost).

Offset posted and deleted a shocking message about his estranged wife Cardi B's newborn baby with Stefon Diggs.

According to screenshots shared online, the Migos rapper — born Kiari Cephus — took to his Instagram Stories, writing, “My kid lol,” after news surfaced that the “Bodak Yellow” emcee had given birth to her and Diggs' baby boy.

In response, Cardi, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, took to X to call out her estranged husband in a series of now-deleted tweets.

“Y'all be thinking it's so funny and it's not.. it's been over a year and I'm still being harassed and threatened to the point that I feel like my life in danger.. it's all fun and games until it's too late,” she claimed.

“Mf'ers do anything for attention and it could get real nasty with just one upload… LEAVE ME TF ALONE,” the mom of four added.

Cardi also took to Spaces to speak out about Offset's shady paternity remark.

“I'm really tired of getting harassed and when I get harassed privately and I ignore [it], that's when I start getting harassed publicly,” she shared. “I have every single receipt. If you wanna keep sending f–king blogs to harass me — like, I can't take it anymore.”

Page Six has reached out to Cardi and Offset for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Last August, Page Six exclusively revealed that Cardi, 33, filed for divorce from the dad of six, also 33, for a second time after nearly seven years of marriage.

The exes share three kids: Kulture, 7, Wave, 4, and Blossom, 1. The “Stir Fry” emcee is also a dad to three other children with three different women.

Since their split, Cardi has blasted Offset as an absentee father online, saying she covers majority of the staggering six-figure expenses for their three children.

Earlier this month, the Grammy winner welcomed a son with Diggs, 31, whom she went public with in May.

After Cardi and the New England Patriots star made their relationship Instagram official, Offset shaded them, saying their romance was a “good roll out n PR” for Cardi's album.

The “Bad and Boujee” rapper also tweeted a GIF of a man throwing a football with the words, “Today I pass,” written atop of it.

In reponse, Diggs shared a black-and-white photo of himself catching a football.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Glen Powell wigs out on a fun Saturday Night Live","https://www.avclub.com/saturday-night-live-recap-season-51-episode-6","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:38:00 GMT","

Glen Powell loves donning his little disguises. It's a counterintuitive choice for such a straight-shot charm-offensive of a presence, a guy who doesn't exactly shapeshift from role to role, but Powell really sells his willingness to go all-in on fake mustaches (even cheap ones, like the subject of an early gag in his version of The Running Man), elaborate makeup (like his professional-amateur “characters” in Hit Man, the movie that so far best puts across his whole deal), or wigs as seen in either of those movies and especially his debut episode of Saturday Night Live.

Obviously, wigs are a feature of every SNL installment. But rarely do they seem so much like an episode's whole theme, the de facto (or actual) subject of multiple sketches. Weirder still, the show beat any accusations of cheaply wig-based comedy by leaning into it so hard, reaching its zenith towards the end of the night with a masterfully performed sketch with the extraordinarily unpromising premise of “lady gets a bad haircut.” No wonder MacGruber had to make a surprise return appearance; he's easily the show's best wig-based recurring character of the 21st century. Did Powell specifically request his return, I wonder?



Powell's comfort with wigs provides whatever weird calculus is needed to explain why the night's lead-off sketch, a clever concept with a topical hook, somehow didn't play as well as any number of much sillier and/or flat-out dumber sketches later in the night. The idea of excitedly showing a grandmother pictures from her youth, animated by A.I. that introduces all manners of glitchy nightmares into her treasured memories, is rock-solid, if technically challenging for a live broadcast. And the sketch worked well enough as Powell, Mikey Day, and others mimed an uncanny-valley version of the past. It also lacked that final push into insanity despite priming the audience for it as soon as the idea is introduced; instead, it ended on the muted note of a runner where one of the grandchildren keeps making unrelated insensitive remarks. The problem, even beyond that ending, apparently: Not wiggy enough.

Because look, consider the movie-set sketch, topical only in the sense that it played like someone in the writers' room read about (or perhaps fell asleep during?) Sentimental Value. Conceptually, it was a flop, with no central tension. As tedious as the take-ruining sketch structure can be, as much as it would be fine if SNL took a decade-long break from every having a sketch that's predicated on someone yelling “cut!” with exasperation, at least there's a built-in game to the scene. Having Chloe Fineman and Glen Powell play grim Norwegian dramatic scenes and then excitedly goof around together in between takes provided a funny contrast, sure, but the sketch didn't really do anything with it, which only underlined that the director played by (who else?) Mikey Day can't do anything but say, gee, that's strange, not even especially bothered, because why would he be? The joke repeated a few times, and then James Austin Johnson rolled in to do one of the night's several niche impressions, with his pretty decent Stellan Skarsgård. End of sketch. Bad, right?

And yet: not really. I mean, kind of bad or at least unfinished on a writing level, but it was, somewhat improbably, a lot of fun to watch Fineman and Powell doing silly voices and gestures in such giddy excitement over crushing their heavy scenes. It wasn't just the wigs, obviously. (Even in terms of pure lizard-brain silliness, Jane Wickline's outlandishly accented “take one” pronunciations made me laugh more than the actual wigs and costumes.) But there seemed to be something freeing about that cheap-disguise wackiness and the whole thing became weirdly electrified. That went double for the sketch about bob-driven division of the U.S. Army, which felt like a caffeinated tweetstorm come to life. (There's no way that this was written without someone saying “fuck ass bob” in the room, even knowing it couldn't make it to air.) It even violated Bowen Yang's very sensible No More Slay edict from last season! (Not me violating my own edict!) And yet everyone was so, so into it, to the point where Sarah Sherman fully pulled off that unlikely look. If there was a greater satirical point beyond the juxtaposition of different types of “fierce” and a vague flip-off to Pete Hegseth, I didn't catch it. But the near-parodic level of basicness here transcended with its sheer volume of cast members gaining power from their fake black bobs.



The episode culminated in another sketch that should have been beyond basic: Ashley Padilla playing a woman who shows up to dinner with a terrible haircut her friends struggle to praise, as she herself attempts to conceal her obvious disappointment. Here, Powell proved himself a team player, passing wig duty to Padilla, who never, ever let that horrific mix of bowl, buzz, and bangs do too much of the work. I have a feeling that praising Padilla might grow repetitive as quickly as the end of 2025, much less the end of Season 51, and I do think there's a kind of comedy nerd that might (might) overemphasize her technical skill in a way that might (might) feel a little myopic in terms of what SNL actually does best. (Call it sketch-comedy fundamentalism, and maybe a necessary countermeasure to all of these hit-and-miss stand-ups.) But boy, can she act the hell out of a sketch like this; the confidence she has in holding back and letting the audience come to her, like in the moment where her character enters and just pauses before joining the group with a happy face, is masterful. (So is every other moment she's on screen in this sketch, but that moment sets the tone.) And in a way, a funny wig can buy you that much extra ridiculous credibility. That's why Powell works so well in disguise: It gets that initial laugh, and then with that time that laugh buys, the audience locks into the fullness of the performance: OK, this is what he's willing to do.

An instant-classic sketch could have taken this episode to the next level from very good to great. (I love MacGruber, but his return basically nudged out the proper five-to-one slot.) Still, almost everything played in the moment, even if most of it won't be replayed heavily in the future. The most complete piece was a too-rare music video, the country song about missing your ex's dad. Usually these pieces aim for relatability; this one had a more niche concept (I don't doubt some folks have had the experience of really vibing with their ex's dad, but it doesn't seem like an instance of the show putting a name to something with stealth universality, nor going full-on Lonely Island absurd). But it was so funny, and weirdly sweet, that it justified itself without needing to add some greater sociological dimension. And Powell's ponytail was a small but significant sign of where the night was heading.



Putting the “almost” in “almost everything”: that Trump cold open. It was probably one of the better ones of the season so far by virtue of being short, straightforward, and at least a little more cutting. It really takes something as unambiguously slimy as the Epstein List to activate any kind of genuine disgust from Jost or whoever draws the short straw on those political cold opens.

It should probably go to Padilla, but I will also use this space to give the sometimes-too-much Marcello Hernández his due and say that his intensely physical impression of Sebastian Maniscalco had its own masterful energy, and was funnier than anything I've seen Maniscalco do in his actual act. It was especially fun that he sprung that bit into a normal sketch and not a dreary impression parade where half the impressions are of the “I guess” variety. Also: More wig power!

Melissa McCarthy joins the, ah, six-timers club, and hosts for the first time in a frankly shocking seven and a half years. Does she count as the unofficial alumni and/or friend-of-the-show Christmas-season host? Usually that person hosts closer to the actual holiday, so maybe not, but I'm excited to see her back on the show regardless. With this episode, she'll tie Drew Barrymore and Tina Fey, and be one down from Scarlett Johansson in terms of the show's most frequent female hosts.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Lawmakers raise antitrust issues with potential Netflix-Warner Bros. merger","https://www.avclub.com/lawmakers-antitrust-issues-netflix-warner-bros","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 00:01:00 GMT","

From an outsider's point of view, Hollywood's ongoing efforts to smoosh its various constituent parts together until the entire film and television industry is just one gigantic fatberg lurking in the Los Angeles sewers, periodically releasing toxic gasses and superhero movies in equal measure, can feel like they're already an antitrust nightmare in all but name. Even so, recent news that Warner Bros. Discovery is putting itself up on the sales block has now provoked genuine murmurings of worries about antitrust issues from at least one United States legislator. Specifically—per Variety—that's California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, and, even more specifically, his concerns are about what could happen if streaming giant Netflix comes out on top in the sale.

Again: From out here, it doesn't feel good to see anybody scoop up Warner Bros., given how few big-name studios have been left standing in the wake of Disney's purchase of Fox, and then Skydance's much more recent consumption of Paramount. (Said merged entity having now become one of the top bidders in the current WBD sale, too.) That being said, Issa did raise some interesting points about Netflix in particular in a recent letter to the Trump White House and the Department Of Justice's antitrust division. Prominently, Issa points out that owning both its own streaming base and HBO Max would likely put Netflix over the 30 percent market share line that usually gets monopoly alarms blaring even amongst the most lax of governmental regulatory regimes. (Since nobody else can match Netflix on those numbers, none of the other corporate entities vying for the sale would walk away with quite such a dominant position in the streaming market.)

Even beyond that, though, the letter raises questions about Netflix's stances toward theaters, specifically. “This consolidation would also diminish incentives to produce new content and major theatrical releases,” Issa writes. “Evidenced by Netflix's own statements dismissing movie theatres as ‘outdated', which could undermine opportunities for the full range of industry professionals both in front of and behind the camera.”

Whilst musing demurely about a potential acquisition in recent months, Netflix execs have made it clear that, unlike Paramount's offer, they wouldn't be looking to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets outright. (Netflix is not inclined to suddenly own a bunch of cable networks, for instance.) But a purchase would give Netflix access to both WB's vaunted library of intellectual properties, and its various film and TV studios. It's certainly easy to imagine that vast machine being turned away from theatrical releases and toward ever more streaming content, all aimed at the shortest attention spans imaginable, which is a scary thought even amidst the context of other scary thoughts about endless media corporation consolidation.

Warner Bros. Discovery recently made it clear, after months of speculation and hints, that it was officially for sale. The company is apparently looking to name a future new owner by the end of the year, listing November 20 as the deadline for a first wave of bids.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Dan Aykroyd says sure, his Casper cameo is Ghostbusters canon","https://www.avclub.com/dan-aykroyd-casper-ghostbusters-canon","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 01:13:00 GMT","

Raising the grim possibility that Casper The Friendly Ghost and Podcast, The Child Who Has A Podcast, could someday meet, Dan Aykroyd has stated that, in his professional opinion, his appearance as Dr. Raymond Stantz in the 1995 childrens movie Casper is part of the wider Ghostbusters canon. Aykroyd did not then go on to confirm whether he's impressed this information upon the Ghost Corps—the actual name Sony uses for the team it has cooking away at ever more Ghostbusters films, somewhere in a Hollywood studio building—but one can only hope he's keeping the Corps in the loop.

Aykroyd, decked out in a Saturday Night Live hat and a Crystal Head Vodka promotional polo, was chatting with the Talking Strange podcast, promoting his History Channel show The UnBelievable, when the canonicity question came up. (And can we just say, in passing, how refreshing Aykroyd's whole vibe is in this era where so many conspiracy-minded brains go down a path of anger, instead of the genuine, unskeptical wonder he brings to the topics he talks about? There's an honest joy in hearing the Nothing But Trouble director/star talk about whether he believes pictures of fairies are real, or list any number of reasons the Loch Ness monster can't actually exist before concluding that he simply doesn't know. It's very charming.)

Anyway, Aykroyd was asked by host Aaron Sagers about his 10-second appearance in Casper, which sees him, in full Ghostbusters regalia (including his “STANTZ” nametag) get driven out of Whipstaff Manor by its infestation of spirits. While he avoided many of our questions—What's Ray doing in Maine? Why is he alone? Shouldn't someone have talked him out of that mustache?—Aykroyd concludes that there's no reason to exile the scene from Ghostbusters lore. “I think so. Given the fact that Spielberg asked for me, and said come and do this. It's a beautiful nod to what we were doing with Ivan [Reitman] and everybody. You've got to include it in the canon, no doubt.”

And while we could quibble with whether Aykroyd is referring to a strict narrative canon, as opposed to the term's use as an acknowledgement of something being an admirable scene, we're too distracted by the fact that this verdict means that Don Novello's Father Guido Sarducci, who appears in the scene right before Aykroyd's, is also now Ghostbusters canon. And, not to get all Tommy Westphall on you, but that's a whole can of worms, given how prolific Novello was with in-character cameos in the 1980s and '90s. Blossom, Married… With Children, It's Garry Shandling's Show… Hell, this means Rodney Dangerfield's “Rappin' Rodney” music video is now Ghostbusters canon, opening up the possibility that, after Dangerfield gets executed (by Pat Benatar!) for his crimes during the course of that video, he might have eventually ended up on the wrong end of a proton beam. A grim thought, indeed.

Anyway, Dan Ayrkroyd's clearly still having a lot of fun. Good for him!

When “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum Teddi Mellencamp stepped out for BravoCon 2025, there's no doubt that she looked lovely. However, one outfit may have outshone any others. That happens to be the sheer dress that she wore to The Bravos award show.

Seen posing in a pic with “The Real Housewives of Orange County” star Tamra Judge that was shared on Instagram on Friday, November 14, Teddi opted to wear a full-length piece that was high on the neck and featured long sleeves. The sheer fabric boasted a gorgeous floral design and underneath Teddi wore a black bra and panties. While you couldn't see her shoes (which were surely fabulous), she did opt to wear striking silver earrings.

On top of that, Teddi wore her hair in a blonde pixie cut with the front brushed up and the sides brushed back. While it wasn't clear if it was a wig or not —  she's experienced some hair loss due to cancer treatments — either way it looked amazing.

In the caption, Tamra wrote, “Two BravHos on their way to The Bravos 🖤”

When Tamra posted the photo of herself and Teddi to Instagram, plenty of people left comments admiring Teddi's look.

One person wrote, “Tedd[i] looks stunning w that hair style! She looks like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct! 👏❤️”

“You look unreal @teddimellencamp so so beautiful ✨️✨️✨️,” another added.

A third person wrote, “Teddi looks stunning I love her with short hair ❤️”

“The short cut on Teddi looks amazing. She's rocking it,” came from another follower.

Someone else wrote, “Teddi is stunning. Her style is amazing!”

Although Teddi is dealing with cancer, she was still able to make it to BravoCon and is thankful for that fact.

“I just feel grateful that I'm able to be here and that I feel good enough to be here,” she told People. “So, I'm feeling excited. This is something I needed to do, and I'm glad that I came.”

Kyle Richards, who spent the day with Teddi, added, “You were a little nervous too.”

“I was nervous,” Teddi agreed. “I was like, ‘Oh no. What if I can't do it? What if I…' But it's one of those things that once you get your feet wet, you feel alright.”

“With the Vegas energy, you can't help but feel energized,” Kyle also noted. 

Teddi felt the same way, saying, “I definitely feel more energized.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","[VIDEO] Bunnie Xo Reacts to Jelly Roll's Shaved Look as His Daughter Cries","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jelly-roll-shaves-bunnie-xo-reaction/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 15:05:46 GMT","

Fans are losing it after Bunnie Xo shared a hilarious and heartfelt video showing her husband, country star Jelly Roll, shaving his beard for the first time in a decade. The clip, posted to Instagram on Nov. 13, quickly went viral as viewers — including their daughter — reacted to the singer's jaw-dropping transformation.

“This is the first time I've ever seen this man without facial hair. Not one freaking time,” Bunnie said in the video, teasing fans as Jelly prepared to ditch his trademark beard. The Need a Favor singer, who's lost nearly 200 pounds over the past two years, joked that he wanted to see his newly defined jawline. “We're trying to see if a facelift might be in order,” he quipped while trimming his beard on camera.

Bunnie documented the entire process as Jelly experimented with different styles, including a goatee and what she called a “cop stash,” before going completely clean-shaven. But the final reveal left their daughter in tears — and the audience begging for a full look. “The total naked face… it's not terrible,” Bunnie said while laughing and covering her mouth in disbelief.

The suspense-filled video ended before showing Jelly Roll's full face, sparking an avalanche of fan reactions in the comments. “Results please!! I bet he looks amazing! I love how you hype him up, Bunnie,” one user wrote. Another joked, “I've actually never experienced FOMO until right now.”

Celebrity friend and singer Jessica Simpson also joined in, commenting, “Oh Bunnie! I loved watching this!!!!! Your smile is so contagious.”

Despite the cliffhanger, Bunnie assured followers that her husband would reveal his full look “when he's ready.” Fans, however, couldn't help but speculate about his transformation, with many noting that his ongoing weight loss has made him nearly unrecognizable.

The new clean-shaven look marks another major moment in Jelly Roll's health journey. Over the past two years, the 40-year-old artist has reportedly dropped more than 200 pounds after previously weighing around 550 pounds. In a recent interview, he admitted that his physical transformation has also changed his outlook on life, saying he's “healthier, happier, and a way better human.”

“I sleep better, I walk better, I talk better,” he told “The Hot Hits With Nic & Loren” in November. “I was a cocky, arrogant, fat [expletive]. Now I don't hate my life as much.”

The country singer's fans have celebrated every step of his transformation — from his inspiring weight loss to his confidence in showing off his face after a decade behind the beard. And while Bunnie says the clean-shaven look isn't her favorite, even she couldn't deny one thing: “That jawline though!”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jane Fonda Makes Rare, Emotional Comments on Ex-Husband Ted Turner","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jane-fonda-praises-ex-husband-ted-turner/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 03:13:01 GMT","

It has been more than twenty years since Jane Fonda and billionaire Ted Turner ended their marriage, yet the admiration between them is still evident. Fonda, 87, praised Turner, 86, at GCAPP's 30th annual EmPower Party and gala, where she credited him with helping her charity overcome its earliest challenges.

“It was a very challenging time in Georgia. Had I not been with Ted, this was something; had he not stood by me with his love and support, we never would have survived,” Fonda said, as reported by People. “Ted's not here, but he is here in my heart, and I know he is here in a lot of our hearts.”

Her voice softened as she reminded the room that even decades after their split, she still calls him her “favorite ex-husband.”

Fonda and Turner first crossed paths in 1990 at a charity event, and the spark was immediate. On paper, they could not have been more different. She was a Hollywood icon with a deep commitment to activism. He was a bold and outspoken billionaire who founded CNN and preferred life on sprawling ranch land.

Even so, the connection clicked. Their relationship moved fast, and friends often described them as an unexpected but undeniably magnetic pair.

The couple tied the knot on December 21, 1991, at Turner's massive ranch near Capps, Florida, as reported by the LA Times. Fonda stepped into life as a wife and stepmother to Turner's five children from earlier marriages.

She was already raising her three children, Troy Garity, Vanessa Vadim, and Mary Luana “Lulu” Williams. Although the couple never had children together, they built a blended family and spent ten years sharing a rhythm that balanced red carpets with ranch life. Fonda has often spoken fondly of that time, noting the joy, adventure, and growth she experienced during their marriage.

Over time, Turner's fast-paced lifestyle and Fonda's growing focus on faith and self-discovery began to pull them in different directions. They quietly finalized their divorce in 2001, CBS reported.

Even so, they stayed close. Fonda has often called Turner her “favorite ex-husband” and has said she will always love him. Their relationship changed, but the connection never disappeared.

At the EmPower gala, she made it clear that her gratitude for him remains strong, especially for the role he played in her life and in the work they built together.

“Southern Charm” star Madison LeCroy was involved in a car accident at BravoCon 2025 in Las Vegas.

The reality television star revealed the news to fans with a note on her Instagram Story on Nov. 15.

“Hey y'all… I want to let you know I won't be making it to WWHL tonight,” she wrote. “My team and I were in a car accident on the way back to the hotel. Thankfully we're all okay, but it was frightening and we're still trying to catch our breath from it. I'm just grateful everyone walked away.”

“I felt so much love today and sad I won't make it tonight,” she concluded. 

LeCroy is scheduled to be on the panel, It's All About To Go South, on Nov. 16 alongside fellow “Southern Charm” castmates Patricia Altschul, Venita Aspen, Salley Carson, Craig Conover, Austen Kroll, Molly O'Connell, Rodrigo Reyes, Shep Rose and Whitney Sudler-Smith.

In June, LeCroy and her husband, Brett Randle welcomed their daughter, Teddi, who is the couple's first child together. The reality star also shares a 12-year-old son, Hudson, with her ex-husband Josh Hughes. 

At the time of her birth, Teddi weighed “only five pounds,” which led to her spending some time in the NICU, LeCroy told Us Weekly. Teddi ultimately came home after a two-week stay at the hospital.

“She's breathing on her own and hasn't needed any oxygen or anything like that. She's kind of a little trooper,” LeCroy told the outlet. “[Doctors] were shocked with how early she was that she was gonna be this independent. So, I was like, ‘Oh, I wasn't shocked at all.'”

The highly anticipated 11th season of “Southern Charm” will be here in no time. The show is set to premiere on Wednesday, Nov. 19, and the trailer teased tons of drama along with some new romances. Things will begin with LeCroy's baby shower, which was highlighted in an exclusive clip shared by Bravo.

The end of Season 10 showed Craig Conover and former “Summer House” star Paige DeSorbo having broken up. And it seems this new season has him embracing the single life, with possible sparks flying between Salley Carson and newcomer Charley Manely. Plus, it seems Conover and Austen Kroll's friendship troubles continue into this new season. 

Along with Conover, LeCroy, Kroll, Carson, Manely, the cast will include Shep Rose, Venita Aspen, Rodrigo Reyes, Molly O'Connell and newcomer Whitner Slagsvol.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Dina Merrill's Beloved Husband Passes Away at 100","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/ted-hartley-dina-merrill-husband-passed/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 03:13:01 GMT","

Ted Hartley, the third and final husband of “Desk Set” star Dina Merrill, has died at the age of 100. He joined fellow Hollywood fixtures June Lockhart and Bob Hope by living to become a centenarian. The Hollywood Reporter says he died on October 10 in New York City, after a lengthy time of living in the Hamptons.

A cause of death has not been confirmed. The news comes just a few days after the loss of his fellow former New York resident Sally Kirkland, who lived there from the early '60s to early '70s while acting Off-Broadway and partaking in NYC's avant-garde movement.

In one of his final interviews, Hartley spoke to Les Carats about “ONWARD,” a fine art exhibition he displayed at Nicolas Auvray Gallery in NYC.

Hartley agreed with the interview that the display was “joyful,” and added, “Joy can be expressed in so many different ways. He revealed he created most of his paintings in a studio located in East Hampton. “It's perfect for me because I can look out and see the ocean right on the edge of property. The other thing you can do is you get to have a fire in the fireplace everyday. Long winters,” he said.

He also revealed in the interview that he formerly worked as a firefighter during his military service. “I was very proud to be a firefighter. Everything needs to have a little danger in it,” he laughed.

Merill and Hartley, who wed in 1989, took over the remnants of RKO in 1991 years after the start of its decline in the 1940s. The Discography of American Historical Recordings says the studio was formed in 1928 via a merger of Joseph P. Kennedy's Film Booking Offices of America and the Keith-Albee-Orpheum theater chain, becoming one of the “Big Five” studios of Hollywood's Golden Age.

The Hollywood Reporter says the couple's company, Pavilion Communications, bought a 51 percent stake, and Hartley went on to produce several films such as “Mighty Joe Young” and “The Magnificent Ambersons.”

Hartley was Merrill's third husband. The pair were married from 1989 until Merrill's death from Lewy Body dementia on May 22, 2017. Her obituary in The Hollywood Reporter says the “Butterfield 8” star's first marriage was to Colgate-Palmolive heir Stanley M. Rumbough Jr. in 1946. The couple had three children before splitting in 1966.

The year of her divorce, she married “Obession” actor Cliff Robertson, with whom she welcomed one daughter. They split in 1989.

Merrill's marriage to Ted Hartley was her longest.

In writer-director James Vanderbilt's “Nuremberg,” Russell Crowe plays Nazi Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring in the days following World War II, when he was arrested by Allied forces and forced to stand trial for his war crimes. The greatness of Crowe's performance — and of Vanderbilt's finely tuned script — lies in its ability to humanize Göring without compromising the film‘s depiction of him as a force of pure evil. 

The film's secret weapon in this regard is the sound design, which strips down the sound design in Göring's cell to give every line, breath, and silence emotional power. When he came on board the movie, supervising sound editor and re-recording mixer Michael Babcock saw creating a complex characterization of Göring as one of the biggest challenges looming before him and his collaborators.

“The first deep conversation I had with James Vanderbilt was actually about the acting,” Babcock told IndieWire. “It was one of those projects where we talked less about sound than what was going to inform the sound, because I was really enthralled with how they were going to balance making Göring human without making him sympathetic. James is really comfortable with having deep conversations like that right away, so that was an inspiration.”

 










Babcock began work on the film with a deep dive into historical research, figuring out what trains and backgrounds would have sounded like in 1940s Germany, but was guided throughout the process through the performances. “ I was thinking about it a lot as I was working on it, and I don't think I stopped when I went home,” Babcock said. “All the characters have strong agendas, but they never think they're manipulating each other. So the sound can't manipulate either — everything is so exposed.”

The key for Babcock became finding ways to support the storytelling through subtle sound work that increased the tension without overshadowing the performances, as in a key scene between Göring's lawyer (Rami Malek) and the Supreme Court Justice (Michael Shannon) tasked with prosecuting the Nuremberg trials. “There's a lot of gray area there,” Babcock said, noting that his job was to build mood through layers of atmosphere that might register with the viewer only on a subliminal level, or after the fact. “James wanted to add to the dialogue all the time. He's not a paint-by-numbers guy.”

For the many scenes between Göring and his lawyer, Babcock found himself relying on modern technology to create a period sound. “I spent a lot of time on those scenes because I was so enthralled by what they were doing as actors,” Babcock said, noting that making the sound unnoticeable required an insane amount of work. “The cell had to sound like it was made of German cement, but the set itself does not sound like that. I think I had to use every trick I've learned in my career to preserve the performances.”

 










Babcock relied on technology that he said has come out in the last two or three years — “not AI,” he is quick to note — to take superfluous noise out, recreate the space as it would have sounded in the 1940s, and then “put it all back in to make it seem like nothing happened to the sound.” Babcock wanted the sound in the cell to convey a sense of claustrophobia and of no escape from the serious topics under discussion. “There's nothing but them, just the two of them — and you can't hide from that.”

Aside from the prison cell, “Nuremberg” features another key environment in which a great deal of the movie takes place: the courtroom where Göring's fate, and the fates of his collaborators. In real life, the courtroom had been built in a bombed-out building, and Babcock wanted to get across what that meant psychologically. “There are creaks where it's almost like it's breathing,” he said, adding that he used reverb to give a sense of gravitas to the setting and went on eBay to buy a period-authentic stenograph machine for the location.

Given the darkness of the subject matter, “Nuremberg” was a heavy project to take on, but it did provide pleasures in the form of finding period sounds for trains, cars, and other vehicles and props. “The fun part is that I feel like I get to be an actor when I work on a period film,” Babcock said. “You want to take any chance find sounds for anything you see in the background, whether it's planes or vehicles or car horns or flashbulbs.” 

 










Throughout the process, authenticity was the guiding principle. “There were a lot of gut checks where we would ask, ‘Does that sound too Hollywood?'” Babcock said, noting that a hanging scene in the movie was particularly challenging. “It has to sound authentic, but it also has to be shocking and visceral. It's all about embracing how immersive you can make something.”

Two quotes from the historian Jane Kamensky — one appearing in the first episode of “The American Revolution” and one in the last — exemplify so much of what's driving Ken Burns' new king-sized and king-skewering documentary. The first frames the final two hours of the 12-hour series, which encompass events from May 1780 through what the title simply refers to as “Onward.”

“I think to believe in America, rooted in the American Revolution, is to believe in possibility,” Kamensky says. “That to me is the extraordinary thing about the patriots' side of the fight. I think everybody on every side — including people who were denied even the ownership of themselves — had the sense of possibility worth fighting for.”

Burns' documentary venerates that possibility, not as an outdated idea but as a dream that took great effort to distinguish and that's prematurely fading from our cultural consciousness. The series recognizes the many disparate parties involved in founding the United States, including the nascent colonies, the British kingdom, and the Native American tribes, as well as subsections of those broad groups, be it the revolutionaries vs. the loyalists or the enslaved vs. their oppressors. As much a civil war as a revolutionary war, the conflict wasn't singular; it was varied and voluminous. 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






It felt, in other words, not unlike today. Despite the present state of the country — fractured, frightful, and frustrating (to say the least) — and the state of his longtime home at PBS, the Brooklyn-born documentarian isn't ready to call it quits. He sees America through the long lens of history, where what feels unprecedented can also be viewed as familiar, given proper context. We began as a fractured people, and we remain fractured still.

Without explicitly mentioning Donald Trump, “The American Revolution” is designed to juxtapose then and now, early and often. Through Mercy Otis Wilson, the series — written by Geoffrey C. Ward and co-directed by Burns, Sarah Botstein, and David Schmidt — acknowledges how satiric portrayals of British royalty helped shift public opinion in favor of democracy. When describing the Boston Tea Party, experts emphasize it wasn't the message of the protest that set off the powers that be, but “destroying private property” (including “thousands of pounds of sterling”). And even when the war was well underway, sharp divides persisted in the colonies. 

Among these compelling comparisons — expressed in a deluge of details sure to excite history buffs (and drain the life from easily distracted viewers, like yours truly) — a major contrast stands out: The hope, the dream, the possibility that united so many to fight for an America yet to be realized has since been muddied as that America has taken shape. The rejection of despots in favor of a radical democracy isn't a fresh idea anymore, even if it's still a guiding principle worth following. And maybe, just maybe, if Burns can use history to remind us where we were then, some viewers will find their way back to a shared reality in the here and now.

 










Which brings us to quote No. 2: 

“Those who have interests in keeping the political story alive and growing have to really work to keep it front and center; to define the problem as something present in the minds of ordinary people. ” Kamensky says in the premiere, while discussing the early days of the revolution and how hard it was to mobilize enough people to turn a good idea into an active uprising,. “Why would I care about this as a woman? Why would I care about this as a small farmer?”

There weren't 24-hour news channels or endless TikTok streams in 1776, but there was an attention economy. Burns' “American Revolution” exists in ours, which means it needs to put in the work to leave a mark on modern minds. There are too many other voices fighting to be heard to ensure the best informed or most pressing will win-out, and the onus is on the speaker to break through the noise. They can do so with their platform (and PBS is giving “The American Revolution” quite the rollout, including education initiatives for classrooms and widespread accessibility for the general public). They can do so with their work ethic (which is staggeringly clear from the thoroughly researched information onscreen, plus, given Burns' omnipresence via tour stops, speaking engagements, and interviews, just as evident off of it). 

 










And they can do so with their style. By now, people know whether to count themselves in for a Ken Burns' documentary. The 72-year-old filmmaker is as close as any documentarian can get to a household name, and whether you sampled his encyclopedic examinations via “The Civil War,” “Baseball,” “Jazz,” “Mark Twain,” “The Vietnam War,” or something else, little should surprise you about how “The American Revolution” rolls out. Peter Coyote narrates. Paintings and historical documents are presented via slow zooms, in and out. Historians and writers provide their authoritative perspectives, while re-enactors march in formation and animated maps illustrate battle plans. For a unique bit of fun, you can play “guess the celebrity voiceover” assigned to each quoted historical figure. (It's quite the cast — Ethan and Maya Hawke! Samuel L. and LaTanya Richardson Jackson! Josh Hutcherson, Lucas, and Charles!) 

But Burns' dry, monotonous style applied to a season of television at least two hours longer than most modern audiences are used to consuming makes for an arduous watch — and I do mean “watch.” As a podcast, “The American Revolution” might be easier to process, but as a visual experience, it's stale. And for a series hellbent on reminding divided countrymen of their common ground, it's frustrating to feel like so little mind was paid to connecting with anyone who didn't worship at the altar of their high school history teacher. 

 










I say all this with the utmost respect for the director and his work, especially because “The American Revolution” makes its consequence so obvious, starting with its opening lines, spoken by Matthew Rhys, quoting Thomas Payne: “From a small spark kindled in America, a flame has arisen, not to be extinguished. … The strength and powers of despotism consist wholly in the fear of resisting it. And in order to be free, it is sufficient that he wills it.”

While the series stops short of saying as much — insisting on its own apolitical perspective, even as its intrinsic morality roots it firmly against today's anti-truth, pro-fascist Republican party — the source of its urgency is unmistakable. The work is never over.  The Revolution is ongoing. “No kings” then means “no kings” now.

Here's hoping it's heard.

“The American Revolution” premieres Sunday, November 16 at 8 p.m. ET on PBS, PBS.org, and the PBS app. New episodes will be released daily through Friday, November 21.

Genre:

November 16, 2025

In a 2003 interview with CMJ New Music Monthly, Aesop Rock does his best to dismantle his mythology. The piece paints a portrait of a hyperactive mind wracked with executive dysfunction, the plight of an artist caught between the gears of his own brain. Standing in his messy apartment, replete with spent matchbooks and ashtrays overflowing onto the floor, Aes looks on as El-P, his labelmate, and Teal, his publicist, pick up empty water bottles and discarded CDRs.

It's easy to imagine him spinning in circles, ambivalent about the profile and unsure of how to help his friends clean; his quotes oscillate between a slight grandiloquence about his records being classics and a rattling anxiety about how he's perceived. This was during the press cycle for Bazooka Tooth, his nervy fourth record and follow-up-slash-fuck-you to 2001's Labor Days, the breakthrough that propelled him into minor rap stardom. People were calling him a “genius,” but, as he tells the reporter, “Look at my fucking crib. There's Pepto Bismol spilled on the freaking coffee table.”

That feeling had been bubbling up in Aes since he'd started getting press. Music journalists treated him as a specimen to dissect, while posters on Al Gore's internet viewed him as the greatest lyricist to touch a mic. He didn't see himself as either. The reality was more straightforward, humanizing even: Born Ian Mathias Bavitz, in 1976, between brothers Graham and Chris, he was raised in a quiet part of Suffolk County, New York. He spent most of his free time drawing, a passion that would lead him to Boston University, where he graduated in 1998 with a Certificate of Fine Arts. Although he loved Run-DMC and the Beastie Boys, there were no grand designs to grow up and become a rapper. In interviews, he shrugged off any connection between his visual art practice and his music career, and when asked about his dense, cluttered lyrics, he'd respond, “I just write about what I see and perform it with conviction. It's mad obvious when cats act deeper than they really are, so it doesn't make sense to do that.”

But in the late '90s and early '00s, as Aes built a buzz in the New York rap underground, fans and critics began regarding him as a mythical figure sent to Earth to redefine hip-hop—to transcend it altogether. He bristled at what he perceived to be a disingenuous read of his work, a push to label him as anything other than a rapper simply making rap music. “All these subgenres are things that didn't exist when I first started rapping,” he says in that same CMJ interview. “Now it's like ‘leader of the nation of avant-hop prog-rap'—I don't even know what the fuck that means!”.

Aes cut an unconventional figure for a rapper, a tall, lanky white guy with dinner plate eyeballs, a perpetually unkempt beard, and an air of hypervigilance. In video footage from that era, he looks constantly on edge, staring into the middle distance and pulling another cigarette from the quickly diminishing pack. The voice that emerged from that wiry frame was immediately striking: a gravelly baritone, frayed by smoke and tar, vowels hammered on the anvil of a thick Long Island accent. He rapped in overstuffed sentences through a maze of 50-cent words and ornate imagery. Each lyric felt like a proclamation from some smirking deity hiding the meaning of life in a cryptogram, something he'd cop to on 2002's “Nickel Plated Pockets”: “If this means anything at all anyway, it's a riddle.” He could encapsulate the vastness of existential churning in only a few bars, like this passage from “The Tugboat Complex,” an early-career loosie that appeared on Inside Out Vol. 1: A Fool Blown Compilation:

I slide like Kodachrome, wrote a poem for every planetType their mileage from the sun on an envelope, licked it, stamped itGot eight thank-yous in the mail, but nine planets means there's one leftOnly the Earth would thank me later with a breathtaking sunset

Aes' style wasn't without precedent. During the Clinton years, as hip-hop entered its second decade, rappers began to push at its boundaries, developing new rhythmic pockets, embracing the slipperiness of language, and delving into topics previously untouched. MCs like Nas and Big L gleefully discovered how many rhyming syllables they could stack together; Aceyalone waxed philosophical about concepts like the passage of time and laws of human attraction; Camp Lo created entire dialects out of slang terms both familiar and fabricated; Company Flow filtered sci-fi, dystopic paranoia through classic rap braggadocio. Blockhead, Aes's best friend and frequent collaborator, once said that when they first met, Aes resembled Saafir, the late Oakland rapper whose hypnotic 1994 debut, Boxcar Sessions, had the density of a neutron star, a tangle of triple entendres and obscure reference points. In 2000, the same year Aes released Float, Ghostface Killah rewrote the English language with his absurdist, mafioso masterpiece, Supreme Clientele.

Small labels like Fondle 'Em, Rawkus, and Rhymesayers dominated the underground, constantly releasing ambitious, forward-thinking records. Their fanbase was often labeled “backpackers,” a somewhat derogatory term for rap nerds who championed graffiti writers and “conscious” MCs (rappers like Common or Talib Kweli who combined secular spirituality with social justice), traded bits of Scribble Jam lore, dissected lyrics on web forums, and shied away from the sleek, jiggy sounds on Top 40 countdowns. The etymology of “backpacker” is a little murky; some believe it references graffiti writers who'd turn up at rap shows with backpacks full of spray cans, while others say it refers to young fans who'd carry around records of their favorite niche artists. Regardless of its origins, backpack rap emerged as a subgenre for those seeking topics beyond street tales or shopping sprees. It could be corny, embracing a cringey “lyrical miracle” vibe, or cerebral and strange. Eventually, it lost the negative connotations and simply became a synonym for “alternative.”

Later in the decade, the underground splintered further, as even smaller labels like anticon. and Peanuts & Corn became bastions of experimentalism, issuing albums of brooding, almost ambient instrumentals and nearly inscrutable lyrics. It was a time of fervent research and development, tearing hip-hop to the studs, studying its blueprints, and attempting to build something new. As Cash Money took over for the '99 and the 2000, and Jay-Z smoked cigars on yachts filled with video vixens, some rap fans dismissed anything on the radio and music channels as formulaic or cheap.

There was an endless, circular debate on message boards about what constituted “real hip-hop,” and many argued that emphasis on writing over everything—multi-syllabic rhymes, complicated concepts, clever punchlines—was the only mark of worthwhile music. So-called “abstract rap” offered solace to those who felt alienated by the mainstream, and, in hindsight, lacked the critical understanding that hip-hop had always been experimental at its core. When Aesop Rock dropped Float, he was greeted like the perfect avatar of that concentrated zeitgeist, the culmination of the decade's fence testing: Here was an MC clearly raised on the “yes yes y'all” era, playing with language like a cat teasing its prey, discovering innovative cadences, and rapping like his cortisol levels spiked with every sunrise.

Remarkably, Float seemed less like a refinement of his previous works and more like a product of a confident artist in perpetual motion. Music for Earthworms, a 1998 compilation of tracks Aes recorded with producer Dub-L, was a modest cult hit, selling 200 hand-assembled copies before the toll of xeroxing and cutting each cover became too much. Compared with Float—or most of Aes' discography for that matter—songs like “Abandon All Hope,” a creeping mid-tempo jam casting his boasts as carvings on Hell's door, or “The Substance,” a syrupy meditation on the cold indifference of the universe, wouldn't seem out of place. 1999's Appleseed, which sold 10 times as many copies, is just that much more polished, shedding the four-track murk to be more present and assured.

Around that time, Doseone, the cLOUDDEAD member who guested on Appleseed's final track, “Odessa,” had become an A&R for Mush, a small Cincinnati studio-turned-label that had put out a number of cLOUDDEAD 10-inches. In 1999, Dose approached Aes and brokered a one-album deal, the details of which were outlined in a simple three-page contract. Aes had always been skeptical of labels; why sign anything that would probably never pay the bills and ultimately complicate the fun of making music? But, given the homespun success of his first two projects, the chance to have someone else cover the cost of full-color artwork was persuasive. “I had about 20 songs,” he said in a 2007 interview with Caught in the Crossfire. “I thought, ‘Yeah, let's just put them all on there,' and that was the first official record.”

There's a ramshackle, lo-fi charm to Float that feels immediate, as if each new thought that crossed through Aes' mind instantly breaks containment. He and Blockhead, who produced about half the record (Aes himself provided the other half), recorded the album on a Roland VS-880 digital workstation, a budget-friendly studio-in-a-box that's nonetheless a slight step up from a cassette four-track. Both Aes and Blockhead (and Omega One, who contributed the beat for “Skip Town”) composed on ASR-10 samplers but didn't separate the stems of their beats, bouncing everything as a stereo mix. Aes tracked his vocals without a stand, gripping a Shure SM-58, the stalwart, affordable mic found at every live venue, in his fist. There's a tinny resonance coating Aes' rich voice, and plosives abound, suggesting loose, shambling sessions shot through with a frantic, wide-eyed energy.

It's an overwhelming album. Aes fills nearly every space with words, emphasizing specific lines with infinite layers of his voice and ad-libs zipping around in the background like agitated bees. There's almost no breathing room, save for Blockhead's three instrumental interludes, but even those—especially “Dinner With Blockhead,” a somersaulting bandoneon loop perforated by tear-the-club-up drums—are packed to the gills.

Float lives all over the map but never feels like it's overreaching or clashing with itself. Consider how well the rain-streaked Gershwin jazz of “No Splash,” or the Hitchcock score strings of “Oxygen,” or the '80s noir electro of “Fascination” hang together, mesmerizing yet transportive. Each cut is filled with ear candy, like the internal rhymes Aes flexes on “Spare a Match” (“Spare a match for the most distorted orchid in the patch/Assorted orphans coursed in morbid orbit forward toward the traps”), or the rhythmic tension between the guitar sample and dragging drums in “The Mayor and the Crook.” “Big Bang” is especially emblematic of Float's restless sense of discovery: Aes hits a double-time flow during the hook, something few East Coast rappers were attempting in the late '90s. When it slows to a half-time lurch for the third verse, it sheds the baroque cello and violin loops and gains synth arpeggiations typical of the Mannie Fresh and Beats by the Pound singles that dominated the airwaves.

Aes raps as though he's running out of time, desperate to convey his message before being carried off by death or angels or some other unknown force. There's an air of paranoia hanging over the record, manifested most clearly in the chorus of “Commencement at the Obedience Academy”: “Must not sleep, must warn others,” a phrase so deeply held that he tattooed it on his arms. His words careen around each other; you get the sense he's constantly trying to hold himself together like a dropped pie. Verses move from acidic to nakedly emotional within the space of a few bars. “My tummy's full of glass because I promised my friend I'd chew up the bottle if he truly drank the poison,” he says on “The Mayor and the Crook,” only to follow it up later with “I cherish the Ferris wheel's revolutions not because the ride enthralls/But more simply to the fact that it still revolves.”

At the beginning of “How to Be a Carpenter,” a song about exploring one's artistic practice, Aes offers a parable:

I used to have a rope ladder, but tattered were the rungsI strung it from the highest willow, trying to hug the sunThe seventh level buckled, and I tumbled from the summitNow I'm back to re-climb, and this time light my cigarette from it

It's a striking image, one of the most memorable quotes from an album flush with quotables. As his work progressed, he'd go on to recreate that approach, crafting stories within stories, little four- to six-bar asides that deepen whatever concept he's working in. If taken out of the context of his lengthy, storied discography, Float stands as a masterful statement, unwavering and aware of its vision. But trace its lines, and you'll recognize it as the road map for everything he'd go on to do. “6B Panorama,” in which Aes looks out at Avenue A and 11th Street, in the East Village, and describes the vibrant world, presages the hyper-detailed observations in songs like “Bird School” or “Fumes.” On “Big Bang,” he “smells the warm blood of the bill collector knocking,” a theme he'd immediately revisit on 2001's Labor Days. Float is the load-bearing piece of Aesop Rock's catalog, a complete work and an endless wellspring for one of rap's strangest and most acclaimed careers.

Glen Powell‘s debut as Saturday Night Live host finally occurred after four years in the making—and for four years, a UPS driver who delivered to his house wondered if he was making it all up.


	But the actor removed all doubts by inviting the driver to Studio 8H and bringing him up on stage. 


	Powell, the co-star of 2022's Top Gun: Maverick, had been offered the hosting role for SNL‘s Christmas show in 2021. When he got the news, he said, a UPS driver had just pulled up, and Powell and his family celebrated by taking a group photo with him. 


	But when the film got pushed back due to Covid, Powell said, executive producer Lorne Michaels told him: “Without Top Gun, no one will know who the f— you are.” And the invitation was pulled.


	“So, I didn't end up hosting. Which means for four years, this UPS driver was going around saying Glen Powell is a liar,” he said. What feels even better than hosting, he added, is “proving that I am not crazy.”


	Powell, 37, then explained how Mitch ended up in the studio audience.

	“This is real: my sisters tracked him down—because the women in my family are terrifying—and they found the cell number of this guy,” he said. “And to prove to Mitch that I'm not a liar, I flew him all the way to New York—coach. I don't know how Running Man is going to do, yet.” 


	“He thought it was a scam, but he still came,” the Texas native said. “And he is sitting in the audience tonight.”

	The two then recreated the picture they took years ago.

Saturday Night Live‘s Donald Trump tried any which way he could to come up with a satisfactory explanation for his reluctance to release more files related to Jeffrey Epstein.


	In a White House press briefing, the president (James Austin Johnson) was asked about this week's trove of emails that lawmakers released, many of which have led to even more questions about Trump's relationship with the dead sex offender. But Epstein's former friend struggled to form a coherent defense of his actions. 


	“I am hiding almost nothing—just enough to make it extremely suspicious,” Trump responded to one reporter asking what he is concealing from the public. “But let me ask you a question: if there was something incriminating about me in the files, then why would I cover them up?” 


	The reporter (Kenan Thompson) replied quizzically: “Wait, isn't that exactly why you would cover them up?”




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Okay, let me go again,” the president said, only to bolster critics' arguments once more. 

	











	“If I were innocent, wouldn't I just release all the files?” he said, looking around the room confidently.


	“Yes!” the reporter noted. “Again, I think you're just agreeing with what everyone is saying.” 


	After two consecutive whiffs, Trump tried again—but was no less convincing.


	“Jeffrey Epstein—I barely knew the guy, as evidenced by the thousands of pictures of us together, dancing and grinding our teeth at various parties, always leering at something just off camera. Probably a book we're excited to read,” he said.

	











	Trump, after praising former Fox News host Megyn Kelly for effectively splitting hairs about what constitutes an “actual pedophile,” was confronted by how Epstein claimed in an email that he was never a member of Mar-a-Lago, even as Trump has said he kicked him out of the club.


	“It's kind of hard to square that circle until you realize that Trump exists across many timelines,” he said. “It's the ‘Trump multiverse theory.' We just happen to be living in the worst one.”

	Trump then figured his way out of the Epstein scandal was to do something true to form: start selling something, fast. And in this case, the product would be individual Epstein files—”on sale for the low, low price of $800.” 


	“A beautiful, one-of-a-kind screenshot,” he boasted of one gold-framed email—”in very low-res.”

Saturday Night Live‘s Weekend Update ran through some of the most damaging emails that came to light this week about Donald Trump and dead sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.


	One such email from Epstein claims that Trump “knew about the girls.”


	“It's bombshell news that legal experts are calling ‘duh!'” Colin Jost joked. 


	“This week's Epstein documents are obviously very dark and disturbing, but I also think it's kind of adorable that Epstein's email address was ‘jeevacation@gmail,'” Jost continued. “It's like if Jeffrey Dahmer's was ‘dinnertimejeff@yahoo!'”


	Co-anchor Michael Che addressed another email in which Epstein's brother asked him “if Putin has the photos of Trump blowing Bubba?” One old nickname for Bill Clinton, Che noted, was “Bubba.”


	“So I guess that's one job Trump has created,” Che joked.

	“I don't know if that oral sex story is true, but I do know that image is burned in my brain like that scene from The Shining,” Che continued, as that bizarre shot from Stanley Kubrick's 1980 horror film was shown on screen with Trump's and Clinton's faces superimposed.

	











	Che turned to yet another email, this one showing Epstein saying was able to “take Trump down.”

	“Pretty big talk for a guy who lost to a bedsheet,” Che joked. Epstein's 2019 death in a New York City jail cell after his arrest for sex trafficking was ruled a suicide, though conspiracies about it persist, in part due to the information that the Trump administration has—and has not—released.“In general, I don't believe in conspiracies, because as a member of the illuminati, I know that we, the lizard people, control everything,” Jost joked. “And it's really hard to believe that Trump was so oblivious that he didn't notice his good friend was running an international pedophile ring. Though I guess Trump is the one guy on earth who thinks “YMCA” is a straight anthem.”

	











	“And on a basic level, it's just shocking how many alleged pedophiles Trump was friends with: Epstein, Prince Andrew, and Diddy. I mean, that's a lot, you know?” he went on. “Think about your own friend group. How many pedophiles do you know? One, maybe two? But Trump's like the Forrest Gump of meeting famous pedophiles.”

	James Pickens Jr. has revealed he's been diagnosed with prostate cancer. The news comes in tandem with his Grey's Anatomy character, Dr. Richard Webber, sharing he has cancer, which was revealed toward the end of the Nov. 13 episode.


	In a new interview with Black Health Matters, the actor opened up about his diagnosis and how it has affected several family members.


	“It's not the kind of news anyone wants to hear, but to be honest, prostate cancer has run through my family. My father had it,” Pickens said. “He had a lot of brothers; several of them had it. I would have been surprised if I hadn't gotten it.”


	The actor continued: “I've got a 90-year-old first cousin, who's still alive, actually; he had it. His son has it. A couple of his brothers had it. No one, as far as I know, has succumbed to it.”


	Pickens —  who has starred on Grey's Anatomy since the show's premiere in 2005, appearing across all 22 seasons — said he has been proactive about getting health screenings. He began PSA (prostate-specific antigen) testing when he was 41. He is now age 73.  He stressed that prostate cancer is “highly treatable,” but that “early detection is the key” in last week's Grey's Anatomy episode via a PSA.

	











	“My urologist said, ‘Because you were so diligent in that piece of your health, it was to your advantage,” he told Black Health Matters. “We were able to catch it so early because you were being tested.'”

	In 2024, during his annual physical exam when he also underwent PSA testing, his numbers appeared in normal range. But earlier this year, his numbers had ticked up so he was sent for an MRI, which a urologist said revealed “something suspicious.” A biopsy later revealed a tumor, which had not spread and he underwent a prostatectomy.


	“We caught it really early, and so they thought that would be the best route to take. I do have a rare variant that you don't see very often. They wanted to err on the side of caution and keep an eye on it,” Pickens said. “It was rare enough that they wanted to make sure that they were crossing all the T's and dotting all their I's. But they hadn't seen one that was detected as early as mine.”

Jeff Schwarz will be auctioning off a large UFO collection from a California film producer. Here's what's included.

Schwarz is auctioning off the extensive collection of Chris Wyatt, a Californian who produced documentaries such as “UFOs: Above and Beyond” in 1997 and “Close Encounters: Proof of Alien Contact” in 2000.

There are filmed interviews for documentaries, a binder full of UFO photos from around the world, and all sorts of photocopies of documents from U.S. government bodies such as the FBI and the National Security Agency about unidentified flying objects.

The highlight of the collection is a 1947 yearbook for Roswell Air Force Base in New Mexico, where the remains of a UFO and its alien crew were allegedly taken after it crashed nearby.

“It's extremely historically important,” said Wyatt over the phone from southern California.

Why? Because the yearbook shows everyone who was at the base at the time of the UFO incident — and Wyatt said the air force rounded up copies and destroyed them.

Wyatt said he went to Roswell in 1997 as a guest of former U.S. government physicist Bob Lazar and film director Roland Emmerich, who had made the blockbuster UFO film “Independence Day.”

Wyatt had a late-night rendezvous with several military officers who were in Roswell at the time of the alleged UFO incident.

“One of the gentlemen was on his deathbed,” he recounts. “He pulled me aside and said, ‘Listen, when the crash happened, one of the first things they did at Roswell Air Force Base was to confiscate all the yearbooks.

“They were afraid that if the press got ahold of them, they would find out (the truth). The military officers would be hounded by the press. They didn't want the media to know who was there, and they wanted to cover it up.”

But the man kept a duplicate copy he had received.

“The gentleman kept it for a number of years and gave it to me. He said, ‘Listen, you're the guy to take this public.'”

It's not like a regular high school yearbook — near the front is a full-page photo of a nuclear detonation and the resulting mushroom crowd. Underneath are the words “A Bombs Away.”

There appears to be another copy of the yearbook at the Walker Aviation Museum in Roswell. But to people who believe in the Roswell UFO story, Wyatt's copy is gold.

So is a binder full of photos collected by Lt.-Col. Wendelle Stevens, an air force officer who dedicated his life to studying UFOs after he retired.

The photos are largely snapshots from the public. There is even a photo of a cylindrical UFO flying in the sky around Vancouver on Oct. 17, 1992. It's identified as being taken by “anon(ymous) teens.”

Looking through the collection is like taking a crash course in UFO-ology. There are dozens of books and magazines about UFOs, from a 1950 paperback called “The Flying Saucers Are Real” by Donald Keyhoe to the 1998 book “The Aliens and the Scalpel: Scientific Proof of Extraterrestrial Implants in Humans” by Dr. Roger K. Leir.

There are interviews with and books by physicist Bob Lazar, who said he worked at a secret U.S. government site that UFO enthusiasts call Area 51.

Lazar claims his job was to “reverse engineer” UFO technology. The collection includes a screenplay for “The Bob Lazar Story”, a proposed movie.

Non-believers dismiss Lazar as a conspiracy theorist, though. By selling the collection, Schwarz may be accused of the same thing, but it doesn't bother him.

“I think people are going to think I'm completely crazy,” said Schwarz, known for the reality TV series The Liquidator. “(But) it needs to be seen. And once people see it, they're going to understand it.”

How did it wind up in Vancouver? Schwarz's associate Mike McCune knew Wyatt and thought Direct Liquidation would be a good place to handle the auction, because the company sells almost anything.

At a recent auction of Olympic memorabilia, for example, Schwarz sold a local collection of over 30 Olympic torches, some from Vancouver, others from places such as Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. Some brought $300, others up to $1,500.

Schwarz and McCune are still dividing all the UFO material into lots, but hope to have the sale in a month or two.

But who will buy it?

“One of the things that they specialize in is Hollywood auctions,” says Wyatt. “So they have a large database (of potential buyers). There's going to be enthusiasts, people wanting to round out their classic UFO magazines or archives.”

If you believe in UFOs, or government conspiracies, it does seem to be the kind of collection the government doesn't want you to have.

Asked if he has ever had a visit from government officials, Wyatt replies, “Multiple times. But that's not something I'm talking about in the press.”

While her favorite destinations include Japan, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Maui, she's always ready for a road trip across the U.S.

With a B.S. in Agriculture from the University of Kentucky, Stacey spent 26 years in scientific labs before returning to school to earn a certificate in technical writing. When she's not writing or traveling, you'll find her tending to her garden or curled up with her two cats at home in southern Indiana, planning her next adventure.

A strange, perfectly circular ring floating above Disneyland Resort stopped early morning drivers in their tracks on Thursday, quickly igniting online chatter about UFOs, illusions, and everything in between. The timing only heightened the buzz—Disney World Florida has had guests on edge over the last month due to a string of deaths, and now UFO sightings at Disneyland California have fans wondering what on earth is happening across the parks.

Cell phone videos of the dark ring rising over Anaheim spread fast, with viewers unable to decide whether the moment was eerie, mesmerizing, or just plain baffling. But the mystery didn't last long. As speculation swirled, Disneyland stepped in with a simple explanation that longtime fans recognized instantly—one that only fueled even more discussion about the park's behind-the-scenes magic.

So what was the mysterious ring drifting above the Happiest Place on Earth, and why does it keep catching people off guard?

Disneyland moved quickly to clear up the confusion once the early morning footage began circulating. The resort confirmed that the strange ring wasn't anything extraterrestrial but rather a byproduct of a pyrotechnic test conducted before the park opened for the day. For longtime visitors, this explanation rang familiar. Shows like World of Color and Fantasmic! are known for their fire effects, which can occasionally send a concentrated plume swirling into a perfect circle when the air is still. 

One of the first people to capture the spectacle shared photos and video after spotting the ring hovering above the resort around 6:30am.

Lori Nayahalski told KTLA, ""It wasn't dissipating, nor was it a flock of birds. Real life Matrix or just an orchestrated spoof... I don't know, but it was something.""

While Disneyland's clarification settled the UFO debate, it also highlighted just how little most casual visitors know about the park's nightly production work. And it turns out this wasn't the first time guests have been startled by the exact same phenomenon.

Although these rings look mysterious, they're not part of the show. They're an unintended side effect of specific fire bursts used in Disneyland's nighttime spectaculars. 

Longtime Disneyland fans quickly began comparing this week's footage with other sightings from recent years. In a Reddit post from several months ago, one visitor described an almost identical moment: ""We saw this in the sky over Disneyland about 9:15pm. There was no noise... It was pretty high in the sky and quite large in diameter."" Their family only noticed it because their child pointed it out.

Other commenters chimed in to explain that the rings appear after certain fire sequences, especially during World of Color. ""Happens after World of Color :) Have seen it several times. It's from the fire portion of the show."" Another guest added that the same thing occurs with pyrotechnic blasts in Fantasmic!: ""Yeah, the giant fire blast in the middle of World of Color does this. ... I believe a few of the fire effects in Fantasmic cause them too.""

For theme park diehards, the phenomenon feels almost routine. But for guests who don't catch Disneyland's major nighttime productions, or who witness the rings unexpectedly, without the surrounding music and lights, the sight can be genuinely startling. Combine that with the right lighting conditions and a quiet morning sky, and the result is a mystery that feels much bigger than it really is.

Although the strange ring that hovered above the resort wasn't a UFO, the moment highlighted how the park's pyrotechnic artistry, usually seen only as a part of a carefully choreographed show, can occasionally create real-world surprises that feel otherworldly. For many fans, the incident is just another reminder that Disneyland's magic extends far beyond the ground.

West Virginia, a state celebrated for its natural beauty and deep-rooted history, has recently emerged as a prime destination for paranormal tourism. With ghost tours, haunted history walks, and supernatural-themed experiences capturing the imagination of travelers, the Mountain State has found an unexpected way to attract visitors. While interest in paranormal activities is growing, it doesn't necessarily reflect a widespread belief in the supernatural. Instead, it's a testament to the allure of West Virginia's rich storytelling tradition, cultural heritage, and the viral power of social media.Paranormal Tours: A Rising Attraction in West VirginiaAs the air cools and fall sets in, West Virginia's ghost tours and supernatural experiences have gained significant popularity. These tours often highlight the state's unique history, from Civil War battlefields to abandoned mining towns. One standout location is the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum in Weston, a stunning example of hand-cut stone architecture. This historic site has embraced paranormal tourism, using ghost tours to both raise awareness and fund critical restoration efforts.Advertisement  These nighttime tours offer an intriguing blend of education and entertainment, allowing visitors to explore West Virginia's past through a lens of mystery and the supernatural. Visitors are drawn in by tales of tragic events and eerie encounters, learning about the state's history while experiencing the thrill of the unknown. Whether it's a Civil War soldier's ghost or a miner's lingering spirit, the stories add a chilling layer to the state's rich historical tapestry.The Role of Heritage in Paranormal AppealThe success of paranormal tourism in West Virginia can largely be attributed to the state's deep cultural and historical significance. The state's rugged mountains, remote valleys, and forgotten towns are naturally suited to the ghost stories that have been passed down through generations. These tales often weave together real historical events with supernatural elements, creating experiences that resonate with visitors seeking both thrills and a deeper connection to the past.Advertisement  Many towns and communities across the state have capitalized on this heritage, offering ghost tours that highlight the state's Civil War history, industrial past, and local folklore. By incorporating real-life tragedies, such as deadly mining accidents or the haunting memories of war, these tours provide visitors with a connection to history that goes beyond mere facts. They allow tourists to experience the state's past in a more personal and memorable way, blending storytelling with the authentic ambiance of old, often derelict, buildings.Social Media's Role in Expanding the Paranormal ExperienceOne of the driving forces behind the rise of paranormal tourism in West Virginia is the impact of social media. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have amplified interest in the state's ghostly offerings, as tourists share their spine-chilling experiences with a wider audience. The ability to capture and share paranormal encounters has become a major attraction for many, turning these ghost tours into viral phenomena.Advertisement  Ghost tours are not only low-cost and low-risk but also offer visitors the chance to create compelling content. Social media users can share eerie photos, videos, and first-hand accounts of their experiences, attracting new audiences eager to visit the same haunted locations. Influencers and content creators have played a key role in spreading the word about West Virginia's paranormal tourism scene, generating buzz and encouraging others to take part in the fun. The social media effect has turned ghost tours into an experience that is both thrilling and shareable, enhancing their appeal to younger travelers and those seeking Instagram-worthy moments.West Virginia: The Ideal Setting for Paranormal ExplorationWest Virginia's landscape provides the perfect atmosphere for paranormal tourism. From the misty hills and secluded towns to the abandoned sites that dot the state, the natural setting amplifies the eerie atmosphere. Whether it's an old mining town with a tragic history or a Civil War battlefield where spirits are said to linger, the state's hauntingly beautiful locations are the ideal backdrop for supernatural exploration.Communities like Harpers Ferry, which played a significant role during the Civil War, offer a glimpse into the past while providing opportunities for ghostly encounters. These areas are steeped in history, making them perfect locations for visitors seeking a mix of history and the supernatural. West Virginia's combination of scenic beauty, historical landmarks, and ghostly tales makes it a prime destination for those looking to embark on a paranormal adventure.What the Future Holds for Paranormal TourismLooking toward the future, paranormal tourism in West Virginia is expected to continue thriving. Industry experts predict that as long as ghost tours remain grounded in authentic local history, they will continue to attract visitors. While the state also promotes its outdoor recreation, heritage, and small-town experiences, paranormal tourism offers a unique way to draw visitors during quieter seasons. It provides an exciting way for travelers to engage with the past, all while adding an element of thrill and mystery.With the continued growth of the official West Virginia Paranormal Trail and more communities embracing the trend, the state is solidifying its reputation as a top destination for paranormal enthusiasts. By blending its rich historical heritage with a modern twist on entertainment, West Virginia has created a tourism experience that appeals to a wide range of interests.

In the vast, rust-colored expanse of Mars' Jezero Crater, NASA's Perseverance rover has stumbled upon an anomaly that has scientists buzzing: a metallic rock that appears utterly out of place on the Red Planet. Dubbed ‘Bunsen Peak' by the mission team, this fist-sized specimen isn't your typical Martian basalt—it's an iron-nickel meteorite, a cosmic interloper from the asteroid belt or beyond. The discovery, captured in high-resolution images last month, underscores the dynamic history of Mars as a target for extraterrestrial impacts.

According to a report from MSN, the rover's instruments detected the rock's unusual composition during routine scans in September 2025. ‘This is not something formed on Mars,' noted mission scientist Dr. Ken Farley in a NASA briefing. The find aligns with Perseverance's ongoing quest to unravel the planet's geological past, but it also highlights the rover's role in spotting serendipitous treasures amid its primary mission of searching for signs of ancient life.

Perseverance, which landed on Mars in February 2021, has been traversing Jezero Crater—a site believed to be an ancient lakebed—for over four years. Equipped with advanced tools like the SHERLOC instrument and a suite of cameras, the rover has collected dozens of samples, some of which may contain biosignatures. This latest discovery adds a layer of intrigue, as meteorites like this could have delivered organic compounds to Mars billions of years ago, potentially kickstarting microbial life.

A Cosmic Visitor's Journey

Recent web searches reveal that NASA announced on September 10, 2025, via its official site, that Perseverance had collected a sample from an ancient dry riverbed potentially preserving evidence of microbial life. As reported by NASA, the rock features unusual mudstones associated with ancient microbes. This biosignature hint comes hot on the heels of the meteorite find, suggesting a tantalizing link between extraterrestrial impacts and life's building blocks.

The meteorite's composition—rich in iron and nickel—mirrors those found on Earth from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. ‘It's incredibly exciting,' said planetary geologist Dr. Abigail Allwood in an interview with Live Science on September 10, 2025. Bringing such samples back to Earth via the planned Mars Sample Return mission will be crucial for confirmation, as current rover instruments can only provide preliminary data.

Linking Impacts to Ancient Life

Posts on X from users like UFO mania and The Debrief in April 2025 speculated about ‘technology' or ‘mysterious objects' near the rover, including what appeared to be a ‘crashed flying saucer' or escape pod. While NASA dismisses these as natural formations or debris, they fuel public fascination. A post by Mario Nawfal on April 15, 2025, described a rock called ‘St. Pauls Bay' studded with black spheres, puzzling geologists.

Industry insiders note that these findings could reshape our understanding of Mars' habitability. As detailed in a BBC article from September 10, 2025, the rover's detection of organic molecules expands on previous discoveries by Curiosity, which found the largest organic molecules on Mars in March 2025, per NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Rover's Technological Edge

Perseverance's suite of instruments has been pivotal. The rover's PIXL tool confirmed the meteorite's non-Martian origins by analyzing its elemental makeup in real-time. This capability, combined with AI-driven navigation, allows the rover to cover more ground efficiently, increasing the odds of such discoveries.

News from Earth.com on September 17, 2025, highlighted organic signals in mudstone resembling microbial activity. ‘The metal detector has gone off,' quipped a scientist in a GB News report from October 5, 2025, referring to chemical markers key for life.

Implications for Future Missions

The discovery ties into broader narratives of Mars exploration. A SciTechDaily piece from last week detailed evidence of multiple water flows in Jezero Crater, creating life-supporting conditions. This builds on Perseverance's time-lapse capture of a comet transit on October 2, 2025, as noted in X posts.

For space industry leaders, these findings underscore the value of sustained investment in robotic missions. The planned sample return, a collaboration between NASA and ESA, faces budget hurdles but promises lab analysis that could confirm extraterrestrial life traces.

Debating Anomalies and Public Perception

X discussions, including a November 15, 2025, post by Jean Ward about strange anomalies in Ulyxis Rupes, often veer into speculation. NASA counters with science updates, like a blog post from October 1, 2025, describing the meteorite encounter as a ‘stranger in our midst,' per NASA Science.

Experts emphasize caution. ‘These are not conclusive proofs but compelling clues,' stated Dr. Katie Stack Morgan in a Space.com article from October 3, 2025. The debate echoes the Viking missions' ambiguous results from 50 years ago.

Industry Ripple Effects

The discoveries are boosting private sector interest. Companies like SpaceX eye Mars colonization, where understanding meteorite impacts could inform habitat designs against cosmic radiation.

Recent news from Daily Galaxy last week touted ‘unprecedented' clues in Jezero, hinting at a watery past. As Perseverance continues its trek, each find peels back layers of Mars' enigmatic history.

Evolving Search for Life

Integrating these elements, the meteorite could represent a delivery mechanism for life's precursors. Combined with biosignature rocks, it paints a picture of a once-habitable world bombarded by space debris.

Looking ahead, NASA's Artemis program and potential human missions will build on these robotic insights, potentially transforming our cosmic perspective.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Is Supernatural Getting A Season 16?","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-season-16-will-it-happen/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 17:30:00 GMT","

Even after 15 seasons and just as many years, fans of Supernatural are practically begging for Supernatural season 16—but will we really be getting another season of this fan-favorite show? Supernatural concluded with a controversial series finale in 2020, and even with that seemingly definitive ending, many want more of Sam and Dean Winchester.

Both Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, along with other key actors from the show, like Misha Collins, have expressed interest in some sort of revival, which raises the questions: Is Supernatural season 16 really going to happen, and, in light of the series finale, how could such a return work?

Currently, nothing has been announced when it comes to Supernatural season 16. Throughout various press events and the many conventions the Supernatural cast members participate in annually, this is a constant question. Yet, at least as far as the public currently knows, Supernatural season 16 (or any other reboot/revival) is not in the works at present.

Of course, that doesn't automatically mean there isn't something happening behind the scenes. It's entirely possible that these conversations are happening with increasing seriousness and legitimacy, particularly because Ackles and Padalecki previously expressed wanting a break of about five years—meaning, 2025 would put them right on schedule.

It's also possible that other factors would limit an announcement right now. For example, Padalecki, Collins, and Ackles are coming back together in The Boys season 5, under the direction of Eric Kripke, the creator of Supernatural. Perhaps they are holding off on a more direct Supernatural announcement so that this project isn't undermined.

That's entirely speculative, but what is certain is that there is currently no confirmation that Supernatural season 16 is coming. Even so, it feels almost inevitable that a Supernatural revival will happen eventually, especially because of what the cast and creators have said at various points since the show's conclusion. 

Supernatural's major cast members have all made it abundantly clear that the show will eventually return. In fact, in the same interview in which Padalecki shared that he and Ackles wanted a five-year break, he stated unequivocally: 

""The simple answer to your question is 100%. I will play Sam Winchester again. Jensen will play Dean Winchester again. It's sort of a timing and availability thing.""

That statement makes it clear that, at least in Padalecki's view, Supernatural's return is only a matter of time. Likewise, Jensen Ackles spoke about a possible Supernatural return, sharing, ""We continue to talk about it... If it happens, then let's go."" Ackles also spoke about the most significant obstacle, in his view, which is his current commitment to Amazon projects:

""Well, it sounds like Amazon's going to have to come up with an idea on that one, because they're controlling my schedule right now.""

Ackles does have multiple shows with Amazon right now, although recent news could very well mean an opening in his schedule. Specifically, with the cancelation of Countdown, Ackles' show that just debuted this year, he may not have as much on his plate. Of course, that's bittersweet, because Ackles and his fans were clearly disappointed to see the show go.

The question of Supernatural's creators, showrunners, and others who worked on the project is a bit more complicated, because the show underwent several changes throughout its 15 years. However, creator of the show Eric Kripke has shared his thoughts on a Supernatural reboot, saying:

""Of course, I'd want to see it. Whether I'm a part of it depends on, could I find something fresh about it that I have never seen before? Obviously, I've told a lot of those stories, but if there was something out there that really surprised me, I love that universe, and I'd be interested in looking at that. It's tricky to find what story in that universe hasn't been told, but if someone can find one, I'm all in, baby.""

Admittedly, that feels like a pretty big ""if,"" but it's likely Kripke who fans would really want to see at the helm of this next era of Supernatural, should it come. All the show's showrunners were great, and Supernatural had countless directors who were fantastic, but for the show to return triumphant, it does seem safest in Kripke's hands.

The ending of Supernatural does pose some problems for a potential reboot. Namely, Sam and Dean's stories seemed definitively over at the end of the show, with Dean dying and going to Heaven and Sam aging on screen, and then dying and joining Dean in Heaven. This seems to show exactly what happened to them.

It would therefore be difficult, or potentially even feel like it was undermining the show, for another season to come along and reverse how their story ended. Yet, there are ways to do that without completely backtracking—and, fans might be much happier with a different outcome than they were with the season 15 conclusion.

Castiel actor Misha Collins even spoke about this directly with Screen Rant, amid other Supernatural cast members' hot takes. Regarding the options for a return, and his Supernatural revival pitch, Collins said:

“There has to be a way. I mean, we time traveled, and we went into parallel dimensions. And I think that it's a problem, but because we have taken off so many of the constraints of normal narrative rules in Supernatural, there has to be a solution to that problem. What it is, I don't know, because now we've seen Sam as an old man, which is a little weird. But I mean…we didn't have to see Sam go through all the stages of aging; that does complicate a reboot. I'm not sure how we solve that problem, but, oh well. Time travel! We just solve it with time travel. We go back in time to right before Cas, that's it, right before Cas sort of gave himself up to the Empty, and that way, Sam, Dean, and Cas, they're all alive.”

While this is just one of several ways another season of Supernatural could work, it does make sense. Two of the most controversial moments of Supernatural as a whole were Dean's death at the hands of a random vampire and Castiel being taken by the Empty. Collins' suggestion addresses both issues. 

Supernatural has proven it's not afraid to play around with the timeline, be it with Sam and Dean going back in time on multiple occasions or the franchise's willingness to create spin-offs like The Winchesters. That show, although it was ultimately canceled, jumped back in time and explored John and Mary's story in greater depth.

Supernatural could take that approach, going to an earlier period of Supernatural, before the finale, although that creates other problems, including that Padalecki and Ackles have (naturally) aged. Theoretically, the show could also take place after the season 15 finale, perhaps with Dean temporarily returning Earth-side to help Sam with something.

The latter is even more problematic than the former, though, because the finale did suggest Sam never saw or heard from Dean again, and he took a complete step back from hunting and raised a family, just as he'd always wanted. Given that, Misha Collins' pitch really does feel like the best way forward.

Yes, it would be a retcon, but it would almost certainly be a welcome one. Five years later, fans remain largely unhappy with how Dean died—or, for some, that Dean died at all. Hitting the reset button to before the Empty took Cas could offer a path forward for the show and a new, better ending, eventually. 

No matter which approach, story arc, or timeline a Supernatural reboot chooses, one thing is for sure: any idea for Supernatural season 16 has to include Ackles as Dean and Padalecki as Sam. The larger Supernatural franchise has unfortunately seen over and over again that other stories just don't work.

After all, several Supernatural spin-off shows were either created or in the works, and none was successful long-term. Padalecki/Sam and Ackles/Dean really are the secret sauce that makes Supernatural such a success, so their return is absolutely essential for any revival. However, there are other characters who deserve returns as well.

Castiel is nearly as popular, if not equally popular, compared to the brothers, so his return would likely also be essential. Beloved characters like Bobby (Jim Beaver), Jody (Kim Rhodes), and even Chuck (Rob Benedict), along with so many others, should be included too. Really, as many returning characters as possible would be best.

For now, news of Supernatural season 16 is a waiting game. However, based on so many updates, comments, and ideas, it really does only seem like a matter of time before this fan-favorite show returns.

'Now You See Me: Now You Don't' cast dishes movie details","https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2025/11/14/now-you-see-me-now-you-dont-cast-interview/87264771007/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 14:07:42 GMT","

NEW YORK — Rosamund Pike raves about the sights and the scenes while filming ""Now You See Me: Now You Don't"" in Budapest and Abu Dhabi. However, the actress points out one major on-set difference from past projects.

""The cast members were practicing their card tricks,"" Pike, 46, recalls to USA TODAY. ""Everyone's saying, 'Do you wanna see a trick?'""

There's plenty of sleight of hand in the third installment of the ""Now You See Me"" magician-driven, thriller franchise (in theaters now). The original Four Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco) team up with a new group of Horsemen (Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa, Ariana Greenblatt) to stop a villain (Pike) from selling the world's largest diamond to an evil entity.

""I like bringing my big villain energy to the screen,"" Pike says with a laugh, calling it her ""BVE.""

""It's more fun to see someone who's vain and full of themselves and who has put themselves on a bit of a pedestal fall down from that pedestal than it is to see someone who's just playing it safer,"" she says.

For Eisenberg, things weren't always safe on set. The actor took part in a fight scene in a room that spins upside down. Everything in the room was padded with styrofoam, save the one bookcase where Eisenberg filmed most of his parts.

""You can see my finger is still a little bent there,"" says Eisenberg, 42, holding up his right hand and pointing to his middle finger. Eisenberg thinks he fractured it, and he wore a cast for the rest of production. ""It was really a lot of fun up until that exact moment.""

Fisher didn't suffer any injuries. But the actress points out another scene where she's stuck in a glass box that's rapidly filling with sand, and then water. Fisher says the scene took a week to film.

""At the beginning, people asked to leave the tank to go to the bathroom,"" Fisher, 49, says. ""But I felt like later on, people stopped asking, which made me concerned that some people may be urinating in the water.""

Without dropping any spoilers, Fisher had good reason to be concerned. Of all the Horsemen trapped in the glass box, she spent the most time underwater.

Harrelson shows up to the interview with a deck of cards. He's got a trick up his sleeve, asking costar Morgan Freeman what hand he'd want to be dealt in a game of poker. Excluding a royal flush, Freeman chooses three aces. Harrelson, who has been shuffling this deck of cards the entire time, then proceeds to deal the actor exactly what he asked for.

The surprises weren't done: As our interview winds down, a familiar voice is heard off camera asking Harrelson to reshuffle the cards while facing the camera so that we could better see the trick. The voice is of famed illusionist David Blaine.

""You didn't show that the cards were shuffled,"" Blaine explains. ""So it could seem like (Freeman) said the aces, and it was set up.""

Blaine went on to break down what he witnessed.

""What I saw happen is legitimately I swear to God, (Freeman) said three aces,"" he continues. ""(Harrelson) was not prepared for it. Woody was shuffling the deck and then he pulled three aces, which is an incredible thing. He actually pulled the aces out of the deck and felt them. It's advanced sleight of hand, what he did.""

Harrelson and Blaine are friends, and the magician joined the cast at a dinner in New York that evening. The next day, those in attendance were buzzing about what happened.

""He ate a wine glass,"" Smith, 30, reveals. ""And then we took a photo, and he somehow changed the photo on the phone without touching it.""

Greenblatt also recalls Blaine changing the writing on a pen from ""Sharpie"" to the five of hearts, which was the card she picked.

All three of the new Horsemen say they appreciate magic in a new way after filming ""Now You See Me 3."" But that doesn't change how blown away they were by what Blaine did at dinner.

""What (Blaine) does is real magic,"" Smith says. ""That's like actual supernatural magic. Like, he's a wizard.""","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","other"

Russia's invasion of Ukraine could soon be brought to an end, according to one pro-Putin psychic. It comes as the Kremlin continues to strike targets deep inside Ukraine as the brutal war continues.

Dictator Vladimir Putin is showing no sign of stopping his brutal invasion of Ukraine, as it hurtles toward the four-year anniversary of the full-scale war getting underway.

Meanwhile, Kyiv and Moscow are drifting further away from reaching a peace deal as Russia remains a pariah on the world stage. But for one mystic, who is loyal to Russia's president, she sees a close end in sight to the war, with victory for Russia an inevitability.

She added that the war will end ""with a surprise"" for Western leaders, as she gives a chilling warning.

Pro-Kremlin outlet MK reported that psychic Adelina Panina is convinced that Ukraine will surrender to Putin incredibly soon. This comes despite the fact that Russia has been crippled by Western sanctions as it continues to offer full support to Ukraine.

Adelina said: ""The situation with the end of the Second Military District is already in the final stretch.""

She referred to the seized Ukrainian land that Russia currently occupies, before adding: ""The whole world understands that our troops have complete control of the front and will not relinquish it.

""No new arms deliveries will change the situation; as I've said repeatedly, our ill-wishers are doing everything they can to prolong the fighting.

""So far, they've succeeded, but there's a high probability that the situation with the Second Military District will be completely concluded by 2026.""

She added that the end of the war will be an ""abrupt and unexpected"" end, as she insists that Europe will not be happy with the results at the end of the war. Supposedly 'predicting the future', she said: ""There will be some final agreement that will surprise the European countries, especially those that have been opposing our country all this time and trying to put a spoke in its wheel.

""Of course, European politicians will be very unhappy,"" Adelina predicted. ""There will be outrage, but they will have no choice.""

Panina went on to say that Russia's win in the war is guaranteed in the stars, with her predicting that all of the wartime goals stated by Mad Vlad will be achieved. However, she did warn that Russia itself will not enjoy the fruits of its labour in invading Ukraine, but Russia's ""opponents"" will instead.

Adelina's comments come after Ukraine was bombarded with its latest set of strikes from Moscow in scenes that were described as ""astonishingly lethal"", according to the BBC. Ukraine, for its part, is striking back where it can, targeting an oil refinery in the region of Ryazan on Saturday (November 15).

The Kremlin, usually unwilling to admit such heavy losses, confirmed the factory had been targeted and revealed it was heavily damaged. It comes as a major blow to Putin's war machine.

However, the governor of the region, Pavel Malkov, did not explicitly say that Ukraine was directly responsible; instead, he claimed 25 Ukrainian drones were shot down - but the debris caused the damage.

Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is to travel to the Balkans, where he is scheduled to meet with the Serbian president, among other leaders. Germany is marking Remembrance day with a Bundestag ceremony. DW has more.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is starting a tour of six Western Balkan countries.

The trip is to center on those countries' aspirations to join the EU.

Meanwhile, Germany's Remembrance Day is to be marked by the traditional ceremony in the parliament, or Bundestag.

Italian President Sergio Mattarella — who will later address the parliament — will join President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Friedrich Merz in laying wreathes to commemorate victims of war and oppression across the world.

Read on here for a rundown of the top stories from and about Germany on Saturday, November 15, 2025, and Sunday, November 16.

Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) criticized the premier of the southern German state of Bavaria, after he urged for the construction of new nuclear power plants in Germany.

Markus Söder, the leader of Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) party, the sister party of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), called for Germany to invest in ""smaller, smart reactors, such as those already in use in Canada.""

He argued that these ""mini reactors"" would require less state funding than previous plants.

But Nina Scheer, energy policy spokesperson for the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag, responded to the idea, saying in an interview with the daily Welt, ""Nuclear energy production is the most expensive form of energy production."" 

She said that, like conventional nuclear power plants, small modular reactors (SMRs) pose an enormous safety risk and produce even more nuclear waste than larger nuclear reactors.

Scheer added that it would be ""irresponsible to ignore these facts and burden the general public with the associated costs."" 

In a speech before the German parliament on Sunday, Italian President Sergio Mattarella urged stronger multilateral structures to prevent new wars.

""Multilateralism is not bureaucracy, as autocratic rulers claim,"" he told the memorial service for the national day of mourning, or Volkstrauertag, in the German parliament.

He described multilateralism as a tool that ""makes peaceful solutions possible.""

""It is the language of shared responsibility,"" Mattarella added.

""How many more deaths will it take before we stop considering war as a means of resolving conflicts between states?"" he asked.

Mattarella also warned that the pledge of ""never again"" in response to the Holocaust is at risk.

""This is what we are experiencing right now: war again, racism again, great inequality again, violence again, aggression again,"" he said.

Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor Lars Klingbeil is scheduled to arrive in China on Monday — the first visit to China by a Cabinet minister of the current German government

The trip to Berlin's most important trading partner comes at a difficult time. Chinese export controls, especially on rare earths, have highlighted the German economy's heavy dependence on Beijing. 

The German automotive industry, for example, has felt the effects as it faces a shortage of important parts.

Eighty years after Adolf Hitler's death, a new documentary by British public broadcaster Channel 4 claims to reveal medical facts about the dictator.

""Hitler's DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator"" also attempts to explain his behavior based on genetic analysis. But from a scientific point of view, this is a highly questionable endeavor.

A flock of around 600 sheep was herded through the German city of Nuremberg on Sunday as shepherds led the animals to their winter quarters. 

Pedestrians lined up the central streets of Nuremberg to see shepherd Thomas Gackstatter's woolly stars. The annual spectacle attracts hundreds every year. 

The bleating sheep were traveling from the summer pastures in the Pegnitz Valley to the Zenn Valley in the city's west.

Bavarian Premier Markus Söder on Sunday has accused politicians from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) of being subservient to Russian PresidentVladimir Putin.

""These people are sycophants; they are Putin's court jesters; they areKremlin servants,"" said Söder, who also leads the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union (CSU), at a conservative youth conference in southwestern Germany. 

In comments made after the AfD said some of its politicians will pay a visit to Moscow, Söder said that AfD lawmakers had also invited groups of visitors to the Russian Embassy in Berlin.

He said the CSU and its sister party, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), were the only parties that could offer a successful counterweight to the AfD, which is the strongest opposition force in the Bundestag.

""The only ones capable of keeping the radicals out of power are the CDU and CSU, no one else in the country,"" he said, while echoing Merz's assertions that the conservative bloc would never cooperate with the AfD.

These remarks seemed to counter criticism from some quarters that the conservative CDU/CSU bloc was using rhetoric redolent of the far-right populist party, particularly on the issue of migration.

At the same time, he predicted ""big and tough battles"" in upcoming state elections, especially in eastern Germany. 

Söder went one to say that the AfD is partly made up of ""strange people,"" many of whom were suspected of right-wing extremism or are even under indictment.


 

A 45-year-old man in Hamburg has been hospitalized with serious injuries, including a broken arm, after being run over by a suburban train and living to tell the tale.

According to federal police, the man fell from the platform onto a track at Hamburg's central train station early on Sunday morning and was hit by an incoming train after waiting passengers were unable to warn its driver in time.

The onlookers called emergency services and comforted the injured man until they arrived.

Police officers and emergency responders freed the man by pushing the train back.

The driver also received care from police and an emergency manager following the incident, with police saying on the basis of witness statements and video recordings that there were no indications of third-party negligence or a suicide attempt.

 

German Economy Minister Katherina Reiche is kicking off a four-day trip to the Gulf on Sunday during which she plans to visit the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

She is scheduled to chair a German-Emirati energy forum and hold talks with officials during the trip, on which she is to be accompanied by an economic delegation that includes ChancellorFriedrich Merz's personal investment representative., Martin Blessing.

Before leaving Berlin, Reiche called both the companies important partners that were ""economically ambitious and strong in technology and capital.""

She said her visit would bring ""a number of contracts signed involving major industrial cooperation.""

According to Reiche, the visit marked Germany's return ""to economic rationality, reforms and partnerships that focus on technology."" 

One topic under discussion is likely to be the planned takeover of German plastics manufacturer Covestro by the UAE's state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), a deal that has been approved by the EU but not yet by Germany itself.

In Qatar, talks are likely to center for one on that country's threat to freeze or halt the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe because of the EU's planned supply chain law.

That law, which would require companies to address human rights and environmental risks in their value chains, is currently in the process of possible reform, with the European Parliament on Thursday agreeing to soften that obligation.
 

Germany's national day of morning, called ""Volkstrauertag"" in German, will be marked by a ceremony in parliament on Sunday, with flags flown at half-mast at the Reichstag building in the capital, Berlin.

Italian President Sergio Mattarella, who is on a two-day visit to Germany, will mark the occasion with a speech in the Bundestag or lower house of parliament.

Since 1952, the day has been used to commemorate victims of war and oppression across the world.

The president of the Bundestag, Julia Klöckner, said ahead of the ceremony that it was important to do more than just remember at a time when peace and democracy are under growing threat in many places.

""Those who honur the victims of war and violence, those who know where hatred and blindness lead, must not remain silent when peace and democracy are threatened anywhere in the world,"" said Klöckner.

She called the day of mourning ""a loud warning to us today, at a time of growing historical distance from the horrors of the two world wars and the simultaneous reality of war — and, unfortunately, a certain normality of war in Europe.""

After Mattarella's speech, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier is to speak at the traditional memorial service.

For the first time this year, his speech will also explicitly mention those persecuted for their gender or sexual identity, as well as police officers killed in service.

 

After several deadly incidents at Germany's famous Christmas markets in past years, many people are concerned about security at the events, a study commissioned by the DPA news agency has shown.

Altogether 22% of respondents in the YouGov survey said they were ""very"" worried about attacks on Christmas markets and 40% said they were ""somewhat"" concerned.

However, more than a third of respondents (35%) said they were not worried at all.

Security measures at Chrismas markets across the country are being tightened after a car-ramming attack killed six people in the eastern city of Magdeburg last December.  

They include vehicle barriers on access roads and a ban on knives that has been in place since 2024.

Not all are convinced that the stepped-up precautions are adequate, with 37% of respondents saying they are not enough.

However, such fears do not seem to excessively deter potential Christmas market visitors, with 59% saying they plan to go to one as opposed to 33% who say they will stay away this year.

The most commonly cited reasons for staying away were high prices for food and drinks (53%), excessive crowds and congestion (50%), a lack of interest (36%) and safety concerns (32%).

Christmas markets in Germany, which are a major tourist attraction as well, often open well before December.

An auction house in western Germany has been criticized for a planned auction of items belonging to Holocaust victims scheduled for Monday. 

The International Auschwitz Committee (IAC) has urged the Felzmann auction house in Neuss to cancel the event, calling the auction ""cynical and shameless.""

A hotel in Istanbul has been evacuated following the deaths of a German-Turkish mother and her two children from suspected poisoning, local media have reported.

Another two tourists staying at the same hotel in the Fatih neighborhood of Turkey's largest city were hospitalized on Saturday after displaying symptoms of nausea and vomiting, BirGun newspaper said.

Although the main focus has so far been on the possibility of food poisoning being behind the deaths, investigators have also found that a room on the ground floor of the hotel had recently been sprayed with pesticides, the Hurriyet news website reported Saturday. 

Police have detained a hotel employee and two pest control workers, meaning that seven people have now been arrested in connection with the deaths, it added.

The father from the family from Hamburg remained in ""critical condition"" in hospital, Istanbul's regional health chief Abdullah Emre Guner said late Friday on X.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is starting a tour of the six Western Balkan countries on Sunday, with his first visit being to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

There, the Christian Democrat (CDU) politician plans to meet with the three members of the country's presidency: one representative each from the Bosniak, Serbian and Croatian ethnic groups.  

A meeting with Christian Schmidt, the international community's High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Dayton Peace Agreement, is also on the agenda.

That pact ended a three-year civil war in 1995.

Wadephul's tour, which is planned to take him on to Montenegro, Albania and Serbia on Monday, then Kosovo and North Macedonia on Tuesday, will be focused on the countries' EU accession processes.

In Serbia, a meeting with President President Aleksandar Vucic — a populist leader whom critics call authoritarian — is planned.

Ahead of Wadephul's trip, a spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry emphasized Germany's support for the Western Balkans in their aspiration to join the bloc. 

""For us, one thing is certain: the Western Balkans are part of the European family,"" he said.

In 2003, the EU agreed that the Western Balkan countries would be eligible to become members once they had carried out requisite reforms.

However, there is growing frustration in several states over the lengthy process involved.

Guten Tag!

The DW online news team in Bonn is resuming its coverage of news from and about Germany on Sunday after an overnight break.

Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul is kicking off a trip to six Western Balkan countries to underline Germany's support on their long path to EU accession.

Sunday is also to see protests in the eastern city of Leipzig by football fans who are angered by ever strict security measures at games.

And Germany will mark its Remembrance Day, on which victims of war and oppression from all nations are commemorated, with a ceremony at the Bundestag attended by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Italian President Sergio Mattarella.

Read on here for our rundown of the top stories from and about Germany on November 16.

Saxony's state premier, Michael Kretschmer of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), has spoken in favor of returning to energy supplies from Russia. 

""We must also consider the sanctions against Russia from our own economic perspective,"" he told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group on Saturday.

""Our interest must be to resume energy supplies from Russia after a ceasefire. Economic relations also increase our security,"" added Kretschmer, who has expressed this position in the past.

Germany stopped receiving pipeline gas from Russia in late August 2022 following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Since then, the EU has imposed a series of unprecedented sanctions against Moscow. 

In mid-October, EU countries agreed to phase out all remaining natural gas imports from Russia by the end of 2027.

In response to the question about renewed gas deliveries, Kretschmer said that ""Russia must be a trading partner again in the long term — without us becoming dependent on it again.""

Before the war in Ukraine, Germany imported more than half of the natural gas it used from Russia. While some politicians, particularly on the right, have called for a return to Russian energy imports, others say Germany should not let itself become dependent on a single energy producer.

            Several thousand people took to the streets of Mexico City on Saturday to protest crime, corruption and impunity in a demonstration organized by members of Generation Z, but which ended with strong backing from older supporters of opposition parties.
    


            The demonstration was mostly peaceful but ended with some young people clashing with the police. Protesters attacked police with stones, fireworks, sticks and chains, grabbing police shields and other equipment.
    


            The capital's security secretary, Pablo Vázquez. said 120 people were injured, 100 of them police officers. Twenty people were arrested.
    


            In several countries this year, members of the demographic group born between the late 1990s and early 2010s have organized protests against inequality, democratic backsliding and corruption.
    


            The largest “Gen Z” protests took place in Nepal in September, following a ban on social media, and led to the resignation of that nation's prime minister. In Mexico, many young people say they are frustrated with systemic problems like corruption and impunity for violent crimes.
    


            “We need more security” said Andres Massa, a 29-year-old business consultant who carried the pirate skull flag that has become a global symbol of Gen Z protests.
    


            Arizbeth Garcia, a 43-year-old physician who joined the protests said she was marching for more funding for the public health system, and for better security because doctors “are also exposed to the insecurity gripping the country, where you can be murdered and nothing happens.”
    


Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum still has high approval ratings despite a recent spate of high profile murders that includes the assassination of a popular mayor in the western state of Michoacan.
    


            In the days leading up to Saturday's protest, Sheinbaum accused right-wing parties of trying to infiltrate the Gen Z movement, and of using bots on social media to try to increase attendance.
    


            This week some “Gen Z” social media influencers said they no longer backed Saturday's protests. While elderly figures like former President Vicente Fox, and Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego published messages in support of the protests.
    


            Saturday's march was attended by people from several age groups, with supporters of the recently killed Michoacan Mayor Carlos Manzo, attending the protest wearing the straw hats that symbolize his political movement.
    


            “The state is dying,” said Rosa Maria Avila, a 65-year-old real estate agent who traveled from the town of Patzcuaro in Michoacan state.
    


            “He was killed because he was a man who was sending officers into the mountains to fight delinquents. He had the guts to confront them,” she said of Manzo.

Survivors group had called on firm Felzmann to ‘show some basic decency' and halt ‘cynical and shameless' event

Poland's foreign minister said on Sunday that an “offensive” auction of Holocaust artefacts in Germany has been cancelled, relaying information from his German counterpart, after complaints from Holocaust survivors.

Radosław Sikorski made the comments on X, saying he and German foreign minister Johann Wadephul “agreed that such a scandal must be prevented”.

The top Polish diplomat thanked Wadephul for the information that the auction was cancelled.

A Holocaust survivors group had earlier called on the German auction house Felzmann to cancel Monday's sale of hundreds of Holocaust artefacts, including letters written by prisoners and other documents that identify many people by name.

A listing of information about the auction on the Auktionshaus Felzmann website on Sunday morning was no longer on the site by mid-afternoon. The house did not immediately respond to calls, an email and text message on Sunday.

The collection of more than 600 lots at auction in western Neuss, near Düsseldorf, included letters written by prisoners from German concentration camps to loved ones at home, Gestapo index cards and other perpetrator documents, the German news agency dpa reported. The auction was titled “the System of Terror”.

“For victims of Nazi persecution and Holocaust survivors, this auction is a cynical and shameless undertaking that leaves them outraged and speechless,” Christoph Heubner, an executive vice-president of the International Auschwitz Committee, a Berlin-based group of survivors, said on Saturday.

“Their history and the suffering of all those persecuted and murdered by the Nazis is being exploited for commercial gain,” he added. The committee said the names of individuals were identifiable in many of the documents.

Heubner said such documents “belong to the families of the victims. They should be displayed in museums or memorial exhibitions and not degraded to mere commodities.”

“We urge those responsible at the Felzmann auction house to show some basic decency and cancel the auction,” he added.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

President to overhaul state energy firms after $100m kickback scheme  alleged by anti-corruption investigators

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced a plan to clean up Ukraine's energy sector after an $100m (£76bn) kickback scheme was alleged by anti-corruption investigators, in the worst scandal of his presidency.

Over the weekend, the Ukrainian president announced an overhaul of key state energy companies including a complete change of management at Energoatom, the nuclear power operator at the centre of the alleged criminal scheme.

Government officials, Zelenskyy said, were instructed “to maintain constant and meaningful communication with law enforcement and anti-corruption bodies. Any scheme uncovered in these companies must receive a swift and just response.”

In further announcements on Sunday, he said he had instructed the government to submit an “urgent law” to Ukraine's parliament to bring changes to the composition of a key energy regulator, the National Energy and Utilities Regulatory Commission. He also promised to appoint new leaders at the top of other energy bodies.

Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau announced last Monday that it was investigating a criminal gang behind a scheme whereby Energoatom's counterparties were forced to pay kickbacks of 10-15% in order to avoid having payments blocked or losing their supplier status. Ukrainian media subsequently reported that one of the senior figures involved was Timur Mindich, a businessman and co-owner of a media production company founded by Zelenskyy before he became president.

The reform promises came shortly before Zelenskyy arrived in Athens on Sunday to mark the signing of a deal that would enable Ukraine to import US-supplied liquefied natural gas through the winter. The Ukrainian government is urgently seeking alternatives to compensate for losses caused by relentless Russian attacks on energy infrastructure.

The agreement between Greece's state-owned gas company, DEPA Commercial, and its Ukrainian counterpart, Naftogaz, will supply Ukraine with US liquefied natural gas via Greece between December 2025 and March 2026.

‘This winter under Russian drones, missiles, and daily strikes is a major challenge for Ukraine and for the Ukrainian people,” Zelenskyy posted on X during his visit, where he met the Greek president, Constantine Tassoulas, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and the new US ambassador to Greece, Kimberly Guilfoyle. The Ukrainian president expressed his gratitude to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, for the US energy supplied via Greece.

Zelenskyy, who is also due to travel to France and Spain this week to sign military aid agreements, is under pressure to prove to European allies that he is serious about tackling corruption, a key condition for Ukraine to become an EU member state.

The Finnish president, Alexander Stubb, told the Associated Press news agency that Zelenskyy had to deal quickly with the corruption allegations, but also praised his wartime leadership and urged European leaders to increase financial and military support for Ukraine.

The scandal comes at a difficult moment, as Kyiv faces a looming budget shortfall, while the EU is deadlocked over a €140bn (£124bn) loan for Ukraine based on Russia's frozen assets. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking progress in Ukraine's EU accession talks, has seized on the anti-corruption investigation, claiming it showed “a wartime mafia network” with “countless ties” to Zelenskyy.

The corruption allegations have caused outrage across Ukraine and have turned into the worst scandal of Zelenskyy's presidency. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) has released damning audio recordings featuring members of his inner circle.

They include the president's friend and former business partner Mindich, who fled his Kyiv apartment last Monday hours before investigators came to arrest him. Mindich – who co-founded Zelenskyy's media production company, Kvartal 95 – escaped to Poland in a taxi. He is believed to be hiding in Israel.

Zelenskyy's reforms announced on Sunday followed his sacking last week of his justice and energy ministers. Both are implicated in the affair, in which a group of government officials are accused of taking kickbacks from contracts with Energoatom. The former ministers deny wrongdoing.

Most commentators believe the illicit scheme was not a one-off, and suggest the scandal may spread to other ministries. Ukrainian media have reported that Mindich was allegedly involved in a bid to supply body armour to the defence ministry, via an Israeli firm and shell companies.

Rustem Umerov, the secretary to the National Security and Defence Council, confirmed he met Mindich while defence minister. But Umerov, who denies any improper influence, said a contract was terminated and stressed no items were ever delivered.

“It's a huge blow, but the worst part of it is that I'm not sure that we are at the end of it. It might still be unfolding,” one pro-government deputy told the Kyiv Independent newspaper over the weekend.

Nabu officials acknowledge Ukraine has a corruption problem, nearly four years after Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion. But they pointed out the scandal had come to light – something that would be unlikely in neighbouring Russia orHungary, they added.

“The story isn't about corruption. It's about Ukraine's struggle and fight against corruption,” Oleksandr Abakumov, the head of Nabu's investigating team, said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Ukrainian forces struck the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and a drone storage site belonging to Russia's elite Rubikon unit, Ukraine's General Staff reported on Nov. 16.

The Novokuibyshevsk refinery, operated by the Rosneft oil company, is one of Russia's 10 largest refineries, with an annual production capacity of 8.8 million metric tons of oil. The plant produces gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil, including jet fuel used by supersonic aircraft.

The refinery was targeted by Ukrainian forces, resulting in explosions and a fire in the area. The extent of the damage is still being assessed, the General Staff said. They also highlighted that footage of the strikes shows the launch of Ukraine's new ""Bars"" jet drones.

Russian air defenses reportedly intercepted 23 Ukrainian drones over Samara Oblast on the night of Nov. 16, according to Russia's Defense Ministry.

Samara Oblast Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev confirmed an attack on the region's infrastructure, stating that the strike was repelled.

According to the Ukrainian military news site Militarnyi, this marks the sixth Ukrainian attack on the same refinery. A previous strike, which occurred overnight on Oct. 18-19, led to the suspension of its operations.

 A drone storage base operated by Russia's Rubikon unit, along with a fuel and lubricants pumping station in the temporarily occupied Donetsk Oblast, was also hit.

The General Staff also provided an update on damage assessments from a recent strike on the Ryazan oil refinery, which occurred on Nov. 15. The attack damaged the ELOU-AVT-4 and ELOU-AVT-6 primary oil processing units, along with a fuel storage tank and pipeline trestles.

Ukraine and Greece have signed a deal to import American liquefied natural gas to Ukraine for the first quarter of 2026, as the country seeks to secure energy supplies amid continued Russian strikes on its infrastructure.

Ukrainian forces struck the Novokuibyshevsk oil refinery in Russia's Samara Oblast and a drone storage site belonging to Russia's elite Rubikon unit, Ukraine's General Staff reported on Nov. 16.

Russian troops reportedly shot dead two captured Ukrainian Armed Forces soldiers on the outskirts of the settlement of Zatyshshia in Zaporizhia Oblast.





 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, The Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur reports on a major corruption scandal shaking up Ukraine's government and involving people from President Volodymyr Zelenky's circle. 

Russian forces launched an armored assault on Novopavlivka, a village in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which borders Donetsk Oblast, taking advantage of difficult weather conditions and limited visibility.

Nataliia Khodemchuk, the widow of Valerii Khodemchuk, the first victim of the 1986 Chornobyl disaster, died in Kyiv overnight on Nov. 14–15 after suffering severe injuries in a mass Russian attack on the city.

Russian attacks against Ukraine killed at least 4 civilians and injured at least 17 others over the past day, regional authorities reported on Nov. 16.



Ukraine and Greece have agreed on a new route for gas supplies, among other deals on financing gas imports, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Nov. 16. 

The sabotage operation blocked Russian military trains, making them a clear target for a Ukrainian attack, the Atesh partisan group said. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Nov. 15 that Ukraine is beginning a full ""reboot"" of its key state-owned energy enterprises, involving management overhauls and comprehensive financial audits. 

At least 11 apartment buildings throughout the city were struck in the overnight attack, Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Illegal logging, gold mining, and drug trafficking: Organized crime in Brazil is sabotaging efforts to combat global warming. This issue has long been overlooked at climate conferences. Is that finally about to change?

As the World Climate Conference,  COP30, is underway in Belem, Brazil, the disastrous consequences of environmental crimes are visible across the Amazon. This highlights an oft-overlooked fact in the fight to combat a warming world: Tackling organized crime is also key to safeguarding the climate. 

In the Amazon, criminal groups like the Comando Vermelho (CV), or Red Command in English, control the illegal trade in gold, rainforest wood and drugs.

""The CV is the most important organization involved in illegal mining and also illegal deforestation and drug trafficking,"" explained Rodrigo Ghiringhelli, professor at the Pontifical Catholic University (PUC) of Rio Grande do Sul and member of the Brazilian Forum for Public Security (FBSP). 

A study published in October by the Brazilian intelligence service Abin and the Forum for Public Security concludes that drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, and human trafficking pose the greatest threats to the population and environment in the region.

The study highlights how the cartels' lucrative business is abetted by several factors. ""These include the rising price of gold, the low level of government presence in the Amazon region, and the permeability of the borders with neighboring countries, which include Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Bolivia, Ecuador, Suriname and Guyana.""

Back in December 2024, the Forum for Public Safety pointed out how cartel power was on the rise in its study,Violence in the Amazon.

""The scenario is worrying,"" it said. ""The struggle for control of territories has caused murders and other crimes, as well as irreparable damage.""

""Control of legal and illegal economic activities in the Amazon region is no longer just a public safety issue, but also an obstacle to sustainable development.""

According to the FBSP, the spread of criminal gangs from southeastern Brazil and their alliances with local groups is progressing at an ""astonishing rate."" In the Amazon, criminal factions are present in at least 260 municipalities, half of which are controlled by the CV.

The Amazon city of Belem is also largely controlled by the criminal group CV. The implications of this are revealed in a recent investigation by the investigative website Intercept_Brasil.  According to the report, shortly before the start of COP30, the CV ordered the suspension of expansion work on a substation that supplies the city with electricity every day from 3 p.m. onwards.

According to Intercept_Brasil, Minister of Mines and Energy, Alexandre Silveira, subsequently called for security measures to be stepped up.

This is not the first time something like this has happened. According to media reports, the local energy company, Belem Transmissora de Energia, has been the target of threats and intimidation since May 2025.

In some neighborhoods in Belem, residents have to abide by the rules of the ""bosses,"" a local told Brazilian daily newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. Many business owners pay protection money while people have to obey orders circulated via WhatsApp and adhere to a strict ""code of silence.""

After the massacre in a favela in Rio de Janeiro on October 29, many people in Belem feared retaliation. During the police raid against the Comando Vermelho, over 120 people were killed, many of them with connections to the criminal gang.

A few days after the massacre, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva deployed the armed forces during the climate conference in Belem. The military ""Operation to Guarantee Law and Order"" (Garantia da Lei e da Ordem, GLO) was also used at other major events such as the G20 summit in November 2024 and the BRICS summit in July this year, both of which took place in Rio.

The rapid spread of the Comando Vermelho from Rio to northern Brazil is indirectly linked to major sporting events. In order to curb crime during the World Cup and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2014 and 2016, a new security concept was introduced in Rio: the so-called Peace Police (UPP, Unidade de policia pacificadora).

The UPPs are widely seen as a success. The permanent presence of the police in the favelas led to criminal factions leaving the neighborhoods, state institutions such as schools and kindergartens functioning again, and the population no longer being terrorized by rival gangs. 

However, according to the Brazilian intelligence service Abin, this successful displacement led to drug gangs moving to other regions of the country.

""When the leaders were forced to leave Rio, they looked for other places where they could operate,"" Abin coordinator Pedro de Souza Mesquita told the Brazilian press on November 7. ""This process began in 2013 and reached its peak in 2024.""

The CV was founded over 40 years ago, during the Brazilian military dictatorship, which lasted from 1964 to 1989.

It began when political prisoners and common criminals joined forces in the notorious Candido Mendes prison on an island near Rio de Janeiro. The aim was to prevent crime among inmates and improve prison conditions.

In the meantime, the group has risen to become one of the most powerful criminal syndicates in Brazil and throughout Latin America.

After the massacre in Rio in October, political pressure has increased: on November 4, Brazil's Congress set up a parliamentary commission of inquiry to uncover the network of organized crime and its infiltration into political and social institutions.

According to lawyer Aiala Coutovon of the State University of Para, the CV already has all the characteristics of an international drug cartel: ""They control the transport routes of the international cocaine trade and have diversified their illegal activities.""

A top Border Patrol commander touted dozens of arrests in North Carolina's largest city on Sunday as Charlotte residents reported encounters with federal immigration agents near churches and apartment complexes.

The Trump administration has made the Democratic city of about 950,000 people its latest target for an immigration enforcement surge it says will combat crime, despite fierce objections from local leaders and down trending crime rates. 

Gregory Bovino, who led hundreds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents on a similar operation in Chicago, took to social media to document some of the arrests he said had reached more than 80. He posted pictures of people the Trump administration commonly dubs “criminal illegal aliens,” for people living in the U.S. without legal permission who have alleged criminal records. That included one of a man with an alleged history of drunk driving convictions. 

“We arrested him, taking him off the streets of Charlotte so he can't continue to ignore our laws and drive intoxicated on the same roads you and your loved ones are on,” Bovino wrote on X.

The effort was dubbed “Operation Charlotte's Web” as a play on the title of a famous children's book that isn't about North Carolina. But the flurry of activity immediately raised questions, including where detainees would be held, how long the operation would run and what agents' tactics that have been heavily criticized elsewhere would look like in North Carolina. 

Stay up to date with the news and the best of AP by following our WhatsApp channel.




Bovino's operations in Chicago and Los Angeles triggered a flurry of lawsuits and investigations over questions about use of force, including wide deployment of chemical agents. Democratic leaders in both cities said that agents' presence inflamed community tensions and led to violence. During the Chicago area operation, federal agents fatally shot one suburban man during an attempted traffic stop.




Bovino and other Trump administration officials have called the use of force appropriate for growing threats on agents' lives. 

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP, did not respond to inquiries about the Charlotte arrests. Bovino's spokesman did not return a request for comment Sunday. 

Elsewhere, DHS has not offered many details about who it is arresting. For instance in Chicago, the agency only provided names and details on a handful of its more than 3,000 arrests in the metro region from September to last week. In several instances U.S. citizens were handcuffed and detained during operations and dozens of demonstrators were also charged, often in community clashes over arrests or protests. 

By Sunday, reports of CBP activity were “overwhelming” and difficult to quantify, Greg Asciutto, executive director of the community development group CharlotteEast, said in an email. 

“The past two hours we've received countless reports of CBP activity at churches, apartment complexes and a hardware store,” he said.

City council member-elect JD Mazuera Arias said federal agents appeared to be focused on churches and apartment complexes.

“Houses of worship. I mean, that's just awful,” he said. “These are sanctuaries for people who are looking for hope and faith in dark times like these and who no longer can feel safe because of the gross violation of people's right to worship.”

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine is working to resume prisoner exchanges with Russia that could bring home 1,200 Ukrainian prisoners, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday, a day after his national security chief announced progress in negotiations.

“We are ... counting on the resumption of POW exchanges,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “Many meetings, negotiations and calls are currently taking place to ensure this.”

Rustem Umerov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, said Saturday he held consultations mediated by Turkey and the United Arab Emirates on resuming exchanges. 

He said the parties agreed to activate prisoner exchange agreements brokered in Istanbul to release 1,200 Ukrainians. Moscow did not immediately comment.

The Istanbul agreements refer to prisoner-exchange protocols established with Turkish mediation in 2022 that set rules for large, coordinated swaps. Since then, Russia and Ukraine have traded thousands of prisoners, though exchanges have been sporadic.

Umerov said technical consultations would be held soon to finalize procedural and organizational details, expressing hope that returning Ukrainians could “celebrate the New Year and Christmas holidays at home — at the family table and next to their relatives.”

In other developments, energy infrastructure was damaged by Russian drone strikes overnight into Sunday in Ukraine's Odesa region, Ukraine's State Emergency Service said. A solar power plant was among the damaged sites.




Ukraine is desperately trying to fend off relentless Russian aerial attacks that have brought rolling blackouts across Ukraine on the brink of winter.

Combined missile and drone strikes on the power grid have coincided with Ukraine's efforts to hold back a Russian battlefield push aimed at capturing the eastern stronghold of Pokrovsk. 

Russia fired a total of 176 drones and one missile overnight, Ukraine's air force said Sunday, adding that Ukrainian forces shot down or neutralized 139 drones.

On the front line, Russia's Defense Ministry said Sunday that its forces had taken two settlements in Ukraine's southern Zaporizhzhia region.

Russia's bigger and better-equipped army has scaled up its attacks, placing the short-handed Ukrainian military under severe strain. Ukrainian officials said in September that the front line has grown in length to nearly 1,250 kilometers (800 miles). 

Russia has paid a high price in casualties and armor for its war of attrition, however, and Ukraine has held it to incremental battlefield gains.

Ukrainian forces struck a major oil refinery in Russia's Samara region, along with a warehouse storing drones for the elite Rubicon drone unit in the partially Russian-occupied Donetsk region, Ukraine's general staff said Sunday. Russian officials did not immediately confirm the attacks.

Months of Ukrainian long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries have aimed to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue the war. 

Russia's defense ministry said Sunday that its forces shot down 57 Ukrainian drones overnight.

The government has no plan for America's 300 billion pennies.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

What, exactly, is the plan for all the pennies?

Many Americans—and many people who, though not American, enjoy watching from a safe distance as predictable fiascoes unfold in this theoretical superpower from week to week—find themselves now pondering one question. What is the United States going to do with all the pennies—all the pennies in take-a-penny-leave-a-penny trays, and cash registers, and couch cushions, and the coin purses of children, and Big Gulp cups full of pennies; all the pennies that are just lying around wherever—following the abrupt announcement that the country is no longer in the penny game and will stop minting them, effective immediately?

The answer appears to be nothing at all. There is no plan.

The U.S. Mint estimates that there are 300 billion pennies in circulation—which, if true, means that the Milky Way galaxy contains about three times more American pennies than stars. How, you ask, could the plan for 300,000,000,000 coins be “nothing”? The Mint, you say, issued a formal press release about striking the final cents. Surely, you insist, that implies some sort of strategy, or at least is evidence of logical human thought and action?

Wow—you are talking like a baby angel raised by puppies in a beachfront palace with no right angles, who has never attempted to wrench useful information out of a government agency's public-affairs officer. I would give anything to spend 30 narcotic minutes in your gumdrop world. Let me take your round little face between my hands and squeeze it tight as I scream this:

That's not how things work with pennies.

It is my miserable fate to possess more miscellaneous information about U.S. one-cent coins than, possibly, any other person on this planet. This is not a boast. The information I command is data no one without a neurodevelopmental disorder would ever yearn to know; it is a body of knowledge with no practical use for anyone. I contracted this condition last year, as I spent several months attempting to ascertain why, in the year 2024, one out of every two coins minted in the United States was a one-cent piece, even though virtually no one-cent pieces were ever spent in the nationwide conduction of commerce, and, on top of that, each cost more than three cents apiece to manufacture.

In search of the answer, I interviewed former directors of the Mint, members of Congress, professors of metallurgical engineering and of law, economists, charity workers, multiple manufacturers of those machines that transform regular pennies into souvenir smushed pennies, scrap-metal recyclers, historians, lobbyists, the CEO of Coinstar, coin collectors, sociologists, government auditors, and the paranoid goblins who perform the opaque work of the Federal Reserve. The initial draft of the story I filed for a popular New York City–based publication was 20,000 words long. (Sadly, all of the best parts everyone would have loved were cut by my psychotic editor, whose No. 1 passion in life was removing 13,000 perfect words from my first drafts; I'm not worried about him reading these words, because a low-class butcher like that doesn't possess enough humanity to subscribe to The Atlantic—though, if you happen to know William, I would thank you not to send him a gift link to this article.) And what I learned was that there was no sane reason why.

Watch: Death to pennies

The simplest way to say this is that everyone directly involved in making billions of pennies every year knew that it was pointless to do so, and also thought that it was legally impossible to stop. Specifically, they thought they were bound to make pennies until Congress issued a law ordering them to cease (which, everyone agreed, was unlikely to ever happen). This, I discovered months into my research, did not appear to be true.

I published my theory—that Title 31, Section 5111 of the Code of Laws of the United States of America empowers the secretary of the Treasury to order that no pennies be minted—last September. On a U.S. Mint webpage that appears to have been created earlier this week (simultaneously with the announcement that the final penny coins intended for circulation had been struck in Philadelphia), this long-overlooked section of the U.S. Code is cited as the legal justification for halting penny production.

Another thing I learned daily over the course of my reporting: No one cares about pennies. Finding people to speak with me about them was nearly impossible, even, as in the case of the U.S. Mint's public-affairs officers, when it was ostensibly their job. (The Mint, which has annually unleashed billions of unwanted and unused pennies upon the nation, gave me the strong impression of being embarrassed to be associated with the coins in any way. Indeed, a retired Mint spokesperson confirmed this.)

There were logical reasons not to care: 300 billion pennies—all of them still and indefinitely legal currency—constitute approximately zero percent of the total money supply of the United States (0.0 percent if rounding to one decimal place). The millions of dollars the government loses by paying more than three cents to manufacture one-cent coins represents an infinitesimal fraction of 1 percent of the government's several-trillion-dollar budget. And these days, most people barely encounter the coins. According to government reports, the large majority of the pennies that have ever been minted in this country either have undergone what is termed “disappearance” (yes, this is the official wording) or are “sitting” in Americans' private homes.

The core problem with the pennies turned out to be a mostly psychological horror. In my article, I described this situation as “the dumbest thing I ever heard” and “the Perpetual Penny Paradox”—both terms I stand by a year later.

Most pennies produced by the U.S. Mint are given out as change but never spent; this creates an incessant demand for new pennies to replace them, so that cash transactions that necessitate pennies (i.e., any concluding with a sum whose final digit is 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 or 9) can be settled. Because these replacement pennies will themselves not be spent, they will need to be replaced with new pennies that will also not be spent, and so will have to be replaced with new pennies that will not be spent, which will have to be replaced by new pennies (that will not be spent, and so will have to be replaced). In other words, we keep minting pennies because no one uses the pennies we mint.

But the problem was not solely the theoretical terror of the infinite. These tokens are also a physical burden, adding 2.5 grams of weight apiece to Americans' cup holders and winter-coat pockets and junk drawers. In a practical sense, penny coins are worthless. (Many people, who do not themselves purchase anything with pennies, assume that very poor people probably use them—disregarding the fact that they have never seen a poor person settling a bill with hundreds of pennies, which would take a very long time to amass, on top of being cumbersome to carry around; the sociologists I interviewed, who study extreme poverty, expressed skepticism that anyone lives off hordes of one-cent coins.) Effectively, they are trash—trash that Americans pay the government (via taxes) to manufacture, at a loss, and then foist back on us; millions of pounds of trash for which we, every time we have ever accepted a penny coin at checkout, have tacitly agreed to provide free private stowage, in perpetuity.

So we've stored the pennies—under the floor mats in our RAV4s, in our empty water-cooler jugs. We've had to. Mint officials told federal auditors in 2019 that, if even a fraction of the nation's never-spent pennies were simultaneously spent or cashed in, the deluge of change would be “logistically unmanageable” for the federal government. For one thing, there would likely not be enough space to store them in our nation's bank vaults.

That's the first thing I thought of when I read the news that the Mint had produced its last pennies for circulation: What are they going to do about the vaults? I went to the Mint website and read its press release. Then I read through every item on the neatly formatted Penny FAQs page. Then I realized they weren't going to do anything about the vaults, because there was no plan at all to do anything except stop making pennies.

This isn't how it usually works when a smoothly running country elects to retire some portion of its currency. Canada, unsurprisingly, provides a seemingly perfect model: When the cost to manufacture Canadian pennies reached 1.6 cents apiece, in 2012, the government announced that it would cease production of the coins and gradually withdraw them from circulation. Simultaneously, the government debuted a robust public-information campaign, explaining to Canadians the logic behind its decision and publishing guidance (including little pictures) for how to round out cash transactions in the absence of pennies. To date, the Canadian Mint has recycled more than 15,000 tons of pennies, redeemed by the public for their face value. Recycling the metal from Canadian pennies (mainly copper and steel) helped offset the cost of trucking billions of unwanted pennies across the nation. And, of course, it kept the coins out of landfills.

Derek Thompson: The amazing history of the most notorious U.S. coin

But it's unclear if anyone would bother recycling U.S. pennies, which, although copper-plated, are made mostly of zinc. Recycled zinc is worth only about a quarter of recycled copper; nearly 1 million tons of copper are recycled in the U.S. each year, versus only about 165,000 tons of zinc. On top of this, a Canadian Mint official told me, copper and zinc are “very hard” to separate.

The good news, which is also very bad news, is that smelting zinc—extracting it from rock—is what a professor from the Colorado School of Mines described to me as “a very unclean, toxic process.” The best-case scenario for recycling U.S. pennies, then, would perhaps be to find industrial manufacturers willing to pay for old penny material in exchange for avoiding the hassle, expense, and danger of harvesting fresh zinc. The worst-case scenario would seem to be that we have only just a few days ago stopped manufacturing billions and billions and billions of hazardously produced zinc disks with no practical use that are also unsellable as scrap.

Incredibly, the penny's end seems poised to be more ignominious than even the phrase worst-case scenario might suggest. A scenario is a sketch of a possible future event; worst-case implies some sense of order and codification—that multiple scenarios have been considered, and ranked by degrees of badness. Worst-case scenario implies that someone is thinking, beyond the present moment, about what can and should be done; it implies an intention, or at least a wish, to avoid the worst-case scenario.

That option, like all others, appears to have been removed from the table. The tabletop, in fact, is entirely bare. The government has issued no guidance about how cash transactions calculated to the cent should work in what will soon be a cent-coin-less country (as soon as the final batch of pennies plunges out of circulation—which will happen with shocking speed). “We are not aware of any plans to issue rounding guidance,” Andrew Von Ah, the director of physical infrastructure for the Government Accountability Office, told me on Friday; in 2019, the GAO released a report in which an association representing the nation's banks especially emphasized the need for public education and rounding guidance “before suspending the penny.” The GAO, Von Ah said, is likewise “not aware of any plan to remove pennies from circulation”—nor indeed “of any plan to mitigate any potential issues with penny suspension.”

So: No one is coming to collect all the useless pennies. And no one is explaining how to get along without them. The government, in other words, is treating the pennies the way it has for decades: by making them Americans' problem.

But perhaps the most alarming thing Von Ah told me was not about the lack of planning for the penny's sudden demise. It was about the possibility that our pointless cent might someday rise from the dead. “The Mint could decide to restart production of the penny in the future,” Von Ah said—or was this a warning?—“if it is determined there is a need to do so.”

[Buenos Aires, November 16, 2025], Guardians of the Ball, the pioneering virtual world transforming how fans experience football, today at Polkadot's flagship conference, sub0 Symbiosis, announced the launch of Guardians ID, a global loyalty program that is going to be built on and powered by Polkadot/JAM and re-architected accordingly to the values of the Web3 Foundation. Ready to gamify and elevate the traditional fútbol fan experience, Guardians ID turns passion into participation by connecting clubs, leagues, federations, and brands with fans through a seamless, blockchain-based rewards and engagement ecosystem.

The Guardians ID Fan Passport acts as an official credential that allows fans to register as supporters of their favorite clubs, national teams, or leagues. Accessible through a mobile app for iOS and Android, the passport enables users to check in at matches and events, interact during real-time matches to prove active support, collect exclusive digital badges and NFTs, and unlock real-world and virtual rewards. From cashback on official merchandise and tickets to digital tokens redeemable for premium experiences, the Guardians ID ecosystem transforms fandom into a dynamic loop of engagement and benefits, all secured through Polkadot and JAM infrastructure, and looking to provide a solid use case to the recently announced proof of individuality.

By integrating with Polkadot, Guardians of the Ball ensures interoperability, scalability, and trust across its expanding world of digital stadiums, live experiences, and official partnerships. The blockchain foundation enables transparent, tamper-proof verification of fan interactions while allowing clubs and brands to design customized campaigns, rewards, and digital assets for their communities.

This initiative was spearheaded in collaboration with the Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA), the leading educational and incubation arm of the Polkadot ecosystem. PBA identifies, trains, and supports high-potential founders and projects that demonstrate how blockchain technology can redefine real-world industries. The Academy's involvement with Guardians of the Ball underscores its mission to foster meaningful adoption by guiding builders from concept to launch and equipping them with the tools to scale within the Polkadot network and JAM Technology.

“Today, the only operations we can reliably execute on-chain are transactions that link wallets with digital assets. Like every major product (application) worldwide, the core systems behind Guardians of the Ball and Guardians ID still depend on centralized infrastructures such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Cloudflare, as well as traditional game-engine architectures. When we discovered JAM and its underlying concepts, we realized it offered a path to finally materialize our long-term vision: building a complete technology stack that aligns with the Web3 Foundation's values, with a user-facing application that is decentralized and resilient at its core ” said Alan Cura CEO at Guardians of the Ball. “The essence of Guardians ID is to reward the passion and the loyalty. With Guardians ID, every fan moment, from buying a jersey to attending a match, becomes a chance to earn, share, and celebrate their passion in new ways.”

Guardians of the Ball was founded with the mission of gamifying the traditional football ecosystem for fans and institutions alike. Within its immersive virtual world, users can explore digital twins of real stadiums, themed art galleries featuring renowned artists and athletes, mini-games, live broadcasts, prediction market integrations, and more. Through direct alliances with clubs, national teams, leagues, and federations, Guardians of the Ball connects institutions with millions of fans worldwide. Businesses and sponsors can also integrate seamlessly into the platform, offering official products, services, and rewards through the Guardians ID loyalty program.

“The whole Sports industry is re-shaping the concept of Digital Fan Engagement. Next year, during the Final of FIFA World Cup 2026, 80,000 people will be at the stadium, while Billions will be engaged digitally. We must develop the products that are used on a day-to-day basis, bringing the ball back to the owners, the fans.” added Alan Cura CEO. “This is Football fandom for the Web3 era.”

[Buenos Aires, November 16, 2025] - At sub0 Symbiosis 2025, Polkadot's flagship developer conference, Talisman announced the launch of “Seekers of the Talisman,” a limited-edition NFT collection that blends mythic art, community ownership, and on-chain utility. The series marks the next step in Talisman's mission to evolve into a community-owned wallet and sets the stage for the upcoming $SEEK Token Generation Event (TGE).

Building on the principles outlined in Talisman's “Road to Community Ownership,” the $SEEK TGE will place nearly half of the total token supply into the hands of users, ensuring that the future of the wallet is governed collectively by its community. The Seeker NFTs extend this premise, offering holders early access, shared value, and participation in what Talisman describes as the emerging collective intelligence of its ecosystem.

“Seekers aren't just collectibles, they're credentials,” said Zerobit, CEO of Talisman. “They unlock access, amplify rewards, and symbolize the shared intelligence that will power the next phase of the Talisman wallet.”

The Seeker collection features 500 unique profile-picture-style NFTs across ten archetypes, ranging from Solarians (guardians between light and chaos), to Lunaris, (creatures of the night), and Mechanites (entities forged from gears and logic). A select set of whitelist slots will be distributed through AMAs, community giveaways, and social campaigns. The mint opens in the final week of November, and artwork will be revealed after the $SEEK token event.

Each NFT will carry progressive utility revealed through story-driven “chapters” of Talisman's lore. The first chapter will grant airdrop multipliers for holders, with future updates offering additional benefits such as early access to new agent features, boosted yields, and other wallet benefits.

Alongside the NFT announcement, Talisman unveiled a sneak peak at its upcoming mobile app for Android and iOS. The app will allow users to view and manage multichain portfolios across EVM, Solana, Bittensor, and Substrate networks; stake and earn yield across protocols with one-tap actions; and receive in-app DeFAI insights powered by Talisman's forthcoming AI agent infrastructure.

Both the NFT collection and the $SEEK TGE serve as preludes to a new phase in Talisman's development, a transition from a multichain wallet into a decentralized finance-AI (DeFAI) gateway where users, agents, and the community collectively guide the evolution of the product. Through these initiatives, Talisman continues its path toward true community ownership and collective intelligence.

It seems like a day doesn't go by without Waymo making some kind of expansion announcement. Detroit, Las Vegas, Nashville, San Diego, and Washington, D.C., are just a few of the cities the company plans to bring its robotaxi to in the coming months. But as I have argued in this newsletter before, there is another “expansion” I think is more important. 

Freeways. 

And now after years of testing and development, the company's commercial robotaxi service is using freeways around the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. 

This is a critical expansion for the company. It's the concrete and asphalt connective tissue in sprawling metro areas like the Bay Area. This new freeway access is fueling Waymo's expansion in that region, which is now 260 square miles and encompasses Silicon Valley and San Francisco. 

Robotaxi rides can have more efficient routes too. Waymo told me it will reduce ride times by up to 50%. 

And using freeways is also essential for Waymo to offer rides to and from the San Francisco Airport, a location the company is currently testing in. 

That freeway-to-airport moment will be the big unlock for Waymo. But will it be enough to help push it in the black? Until someone over there slides me their balance sheet, I can't say. It will certainly be a popular option for travelers. That doesn't mean the economics will pencil out. 

Read on for more news, including Einride's SPAC bid, deals for Harbinger and Teradar, as well as how Via fared in its first earnings and a looming shutdown for Rad Power Bikes. Plus! Scroll down to get the results of the Tesla poll. 

It's been nearly nine months since Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson abruptly resigned, leaving the company without a permanent replacement. That may be about to change, though.

A few little birds told us Lucid Motors has zeroed in on a candidate for the top role. It's expected to be someone outside the organization, which is perhaps no surprise; in August, we shared here that the company and the executive hiring firm it's using had cast a very wide net and was even cold-calling some candidates. This would likely mean that Marc Winterhoff, who's been serving as interim CEO, would slide back to the COO role he occupied before Rawlinson left.

Another SPAC has entered the AV world! Mergers with special acquisition companies may not be officially “back,” but they are certainly popular among autonomous vehicle companies. 

Einride, the Swedish electric and autonomous truck startup, plans to go public via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, just six weeks after it raised $100 million from investors. The SPAC merger with Legato Merger Corp. values Einride at $1.8 billion in pre-money equity.

Einride does generate revenue, which may sound obvious but there have been plenty of pre-revenue transportation companies that have SPAC'd in recent years. 

For now, its primary source of revenue is coming from its software-as-a-service product and a fleet of 200 heavy-duty electric trucks used by companies like Heineken and PepsiCo. Its unusual-looking autonomous podlike trucks are still in pilot mode. 

The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2026, with Einride making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.

Other deals that got my attention this week …

Forterra, a company developing autonomous tech for defense, raised $238 million in equity and debt funding. Moore Strategic Ventures led the equity piece of the funding, while Crescent Cove provided the debt financing. 

Gopuff, the rapid-delivery startup, raised $250 million in a round led by Eldridge Industries and Valor Equity Partners. Baillie Gifford, Robinhood, Equalis Capital, George Ruan, Yakir Gabay, and Gopuff's co-founders. The funding put its valuation at $8.5 billion, according to Bloomberg, a significant markdown from its last raise in 2021. 

Harbinger, the Los Angeles-based electric truck startup, raised $160 million in a Series C funding round co-led by FedEx. As part of the investment, FedEx ordered 53 of Harbinger's electric truck chassis.

Octopus Electric Vehicles, a U.K.-based electric vehicle-leasing business, has struck a deal with lenders, including Lloyds Banking Group, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Agricole, to take its total funding line to £2 billion ($2.6 billion), Sky News reported.

Teradar, a Boston-based startup developing a solid-state sensor, raised $150 million in a Series B funding round from investors Capricorn Investment Group, Lockheed Martin's venture arm, mobility-focused firm Ibex Investors, and VXI Capital, a new defense-focused fund led by the former CTO of the U.S. military's Defense Innovation Unit.

Upway, an e-bike refurbishment startup, raised $60 million in a Series C funding round led by A.P. Moller. Galvanize, Ora Global, and Sequoia Capital also participated. The company has raised more than $125 million since its founding in 2021.

Vay, a German startup that remotely pilots rental cars to customers, announced a $60 million investment from Singaporean tech heavyweight Grab. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close by the end of the year, may be followed by “an additional $350M as joint milestones are achieved within the first year.”

Ford is expanding the availability of its BlueCruise hands-free highway driving technology in Europe. The automaker will make the system available in several vehicles, including the Puma, Puma Gen-E, Kuga, and Ranger PHEV 5 models starting in spring 2026.

Joby Aviation conducted the first flight of its turbine electric, autonomous VTOL aircraft. This demonstrator shouldn't be confused with its all-electric air taxi, although it was built off that platform. This aircraft has a hybrid turbine powertrain and is designed for defense applications.

Lyft has partnered with Curb, a ride-hailing platform for licensed taxis. Under the deal, Lyft riders will be connected with Curb's network of drivers through an integration with the Curb Flow platform, which is already in Los Angeles. Other cities will soon follow. 

Rad Power Bikes, one of the more popular e-bike companies, may not be long for this world. The company has informed its employees that it will shut down in January if it is unable to find new funding or get acquired, according to an internal staff email viewed by TechCrunch.

Tesla might bring Apple CarPlay to its EVs. But at this point, should it? Meanwhile, the company's energy storage division is dealing with an expanded recall of its consumer-based Powerwall 2 product after reports of fires.

The Boring Company, an Elon Musk company, is under scrutiny again. This time because of reports that firefighters performing a safety drill at one of The Boring Company's construction sites in Las Vegas received burns from chemicals used in the tunnel-excavation process. And the controversy doesn't stop there. 

Toyota started production at a new $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina. While Toyota has several facilities in the U.S., this is its first battery plant to be built outside of Japan. And it's not done investing in the U.S. The company said it plans to invest up to $10 billion more than previously expected over the next five years.

Uber has quietly begun piloting in-app video recording for its drivers in India. The ride-hailing company is also seeking more premium customers through new efforts like Uber Ski, which lets riders schedule a vehicle in advance to nearly 40 popular ski destinations in North America and Europe, including Vail in Colorado and Park City in Utah.

Via had its first earnings since it became a publicly traded company, and, welp, it lost money. The tech transit software company reported a loss of $36.9 million in its third quarter, a 73% increase since the same period last year. Its revenue grew to $713 million, an 11% increase YoY.

Remember the poll in last week's newsletter? I asked which product goal is Tesla most likely to achieve by 2035? The options are based on real goals laid out in Musk's $1 trillion compensation package:

And y'all are split between two options: Tesla delivering 20 million vehicles, which received 34.7% of the vote, and “None of these will be reached,” which received 32% of the vote. 

The one item you seem to agree on is that Tesla is unlikely to deliver on the other three goals. About 9.5% of readers picked the 1 million robots option, 12.6% chose 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 10.5% picked 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation within 10 years.

1) Most people with the Toxoplasmosis infection got it from eating undercooked meat, not from cats.

So, it's not clear that cats make you schizophreanic, or schizofrenic people buys more cats.

CHESTER, Pa. — For Gio Reyna, Saturday was the hard launch of his campaign to make the U.S. squad for the 2026 World Cup.

For Folarin Balogun, it was a chance to continue the hot streak he had been on with his club team.

And for the U.S. men's national team, it was a chance to show that the program is headed in the right direction less than eight months out from the World Cup.

A 2-1 win Saturday in a friendly against Paraguay helped show all of that just south of the City of Brotherly Love.

“You can see today all the players that were on the pitch, how they show the quality, the capacity to play football,” USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino said. “I think we create chances. We were a better team that I think is very competitive and difficult to beat. Great, but it's not enough. We're happy, but we have to keep going because we need to improve, improve, improve and arrive at the World Cup at our best.”

Reyna did something that was 600 days in the making: score with the American crest on his chest, heading the game's opening goal in the fourth minute. 

He also sent the ball into the attacking zone, where Balogun scored.

Balogun fired a loose ball in the box past Paraguay keeper Orlando Gill to break a 1-1 tie in the 71st minute.

The USMNT hung with Paraguay, controlling possession 54 percent of the time in the first half while getting two of its four shots on target through the first 45 minutes.

Reyna, along with Sergiño Dest, proved to be a nuisance for the Paraguayan defense for the better part of the night.

And he was the player — once believed to be the future of the United States men's program, but who hadn't had a call-up in eight months — who opened the scoring.

The 23-year-old has been one of the main storylines this camp after drama followed him throughout the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and he entered the November break not having scored a goal yet with his Bundesliga club, Borussia Mönchengladbach.

He shot down the idea that he was struggling with his club team and acknowledged that time to make an impression with the USMNT coaching staff was dwindling. 

However, he said there was a bigger picture at play.

“I think in the end, it's performances like this that can help everybody here,” Reyna said. “But I want to have, more importantly, seven or eight good months in the rest of the season with Gladbach. Then I believe if I keep performing like I did tonight, and then I'll have a good chance to make the [national team] and have an impact there too.”

Reyna's first-half goal helped him surpass his father, Claudio Reyna, on the USMNT goal rankings with the ninth of his career, and recorded his first headed tally in either a club or national team match.

“I told you guys yesterday, Gio wanted to come into camp and do his thing. Wanted to put the noise behind him and I felt like he did that today,” Balogun said. “It was a really, really strong performance in a difficult game.”

Alex Arce scored Paraguay's only goal in the 10th minute after a defensive breakdown.

Saturday's match was a physical one at times and things intensified in the final minutes of the match when Gustavo Gómez and Alex Freeman tussled over the ball near the touchline, leading to a shoving match and both teams running out to confront one another.

Six yellow cards were issued related to the fracas and Paraguay's Omar Alderete was issued a red card for the incident.

Erling Haaland and Norway will qualify for the 2026 World Cup on Sunday, barring a minor miracle from Italy.

Italy requires a minor miracle if it's to bag automatic qualification to the 2026 World Cup on Sunday when it travels to the San Siro to take on Italy. Erling Haaland and company have enjoyed a seamless run through UEFA qualifying thus far and sit atop Group I, three points ahead of Italy and with a far superior goal difference.

In short, Norway will most likely keep top spot even if it loses in Milan, with the Azzurri needing to win by nine goals or more in order to overturn the goal difference deficit currently working against them. And that much looks nigh impossible given Stale Solbakken's men won 3-0 when these teams met in Oslo back in June.

Italy scored twice in the dying minutes to beat Moldova 2-0 on Thursday and keep its dream of automatic qualification alive for the time being. However, the soccer gods will need to be smiling on Gennaro Gattuso's side if they're to finish any higher than second and somehow manage to avoid the play-off route.

The UEFA World Cup Qualifiers are a tough, fierce competition. Hence, teams will come to the wire to see if their 2026 World Cup dreams are alive. For Hungary, they needed to beat Ireland, but also needed other results to happen to qualify directly.

Hungary didn't do their part, as they suffered a late, 2-3 loss to Ireland. Meanwhile, Portugal beat Armenia comfortably. This means Hungary ended in third place of Group F. Portugal ended as leaders with 13 points, followed by Ireland with 10 (securing a spot in the playoffs for a World Cup berth), Hungary with eight points, and Armenia in last place with only three points.

The dream is over. Hungary did not do enough to even qualify to the UEFA World Cup Qualifiers Playoffs. This is a second round contested between 16 teams but only four will end up qualifying.

Even if the final score doesn't show it, Hungary were clearly the superior side in the Puskas Arena. The 2-3 score doesn't do justice, as Hungary dominated Ireland in shots, shots on target, ball possession, corners, and pretty much every offensive statistic there is. However, the Irish had more power of will in the latter minutes to get an incredible comeback with goals at the 80th and 96th minute.

The team knew it needed to win and it went out there to make sure that if Portugal slipped, it would've done what was needed. Still, it wasn't enough as Ireland's Troy Parrott scored a hat trick to get Ireland the win. Now, Hungary said goodbye to the 2026 World Cup.

This is a very good squad. While it's not a juggernaut, nor is it star-studded, Hungary have a good collection of guys that make this a very well-rounded team. Still, the lack of focus in the dying minutes of the game cost them.

Dominik Szoboszlai is one of the best box-to-box midfielders in the world right now. The Liverpool star is capable to not only cut passing lanes, but also create goalscoring oppportunities. He is the one guy capable of doing it all. However, the role players didn't do much to help him in the second half of the game, and that ended Hungary's 2026 World Cup dreams.

Cristiano Ronaldo was among the first to congratulate Portugal on their World Cup qualification after seeing his international colleagues book tickets to that 2026 showpiece in a nine-goal showing against Armenia. CR7 sat that game out through suspension, but will get to grace another major international tournament after barely being missed in a resounding win.

Ronaldo was forced to watch that contest from afar after being released early from the Portuguese camp. There was no need for him to hang around while serving a ban. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner saw red during a 2-0 defeat in Dublin against the Republic of Ireland.

He tangled with Irish defender Dara O'Shea during that fixture, elbowing the Ipswich centre-half in the back, and is now waiting to discover how many matches he will have to miss. The hope is that one game will be enough for him to learn his lesson.

Portugal proved, against limited opposition, that they can cope without their talismanic captain. They wobbled briefly against Armenia, with Renato Veiga's early effort being cancelled out, but ultimately eased over the line at Estadio do Dragao.

Manchester United skipper Bruno Fernandes bagged a hat-trick, including two penalties, while Goncalo Ramos, Joao Neves and Francisco Conceicao were also on target. Portugal knew a positive result would be enough to see them top Group F. They finished three points clear of Ireland after making light work of Armenia.

Ronaldo had posted ahead of Portugal's final qualification fixture: “Go team! All together today and forever! For Portugal and for our flag!” CR7 was left smiling at the final whistle as he added: “WE'RE IN THE WORLD CUP! LET'S GO, PORTUGAL!”

Ronaldo is now preparing to grace his sixth World Cup finals. He will be 41 by the time that tournament rolls around, but has signed a new contract at Saudi Pro League side Al-Nassr and shows no sign of slowing down.

It does, however, remain to be seen whether he will be forced to miss the opening games of that event in Northern and Central America. Martinez said of Ronaldo's dismissal against Ireland: “The red card is just a captain that has never been sent off before in 226 games. I think that just deserves credit and today, I thought it was a bit harsh because he cares about the team. He was 60 minutes or 58 minutes in the box being grabbed, being pulled, being pushed, and obviously, when he tries to get away from the defender...I think the action looks worse than what it actually is. I don't think it's an elbow, I think it's a full body, but from where the camera is, it looks like an elbow. But we accept it.

“The only thing that leaves a bitter taste in my mouth is at the press conference [Wednesday], your coach was talking about the aspect of the referees being influenced, and then a big centre-half falls on the floor so dramatically at the turn of Cristiano's body.”

Martinez went on to say, with it possible that FIFA's disciplinary committee will sting Ronaldo with a three-match ban: “After the game it's a difficult time because emotions can be unclear. I saw his reaction to a provocation. It started at the beginning of the game, in every play in the penalty area. It even started the day before in the press conference.

“And it was a reaction of trying to continue playing. Others might fall to the ground and look for a penalty. It's not a violent action, it's not a red card for violence, but a reaction to a provocation. We need to try to show the case and prepare well. I would say it would be very unfair to impose a long suspension.”

Ronaldo has already stated that the 2026 World Cup will be his last. He has sought to clarify comments in which he said that retirement could happen “soon”, with there still at least a couple of years left in the evergreen all-time great.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

 Just like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, Siya Kolisi enjoyed the taste of victory on Saturday in Turin. 

 A two-time Rugby World Cup-winning captain with South Africa, Kolisi led the Springboks to a 32-14 victory against Italy at the city's Allianz Stadium, just as home favourite Sinner was sinking Alex de Minaur to book his championship-match spot at the Nitto ATP Finals. 

 A few hours later, Kolisi was inside Inalpi Arena to watch Alcaraz down Felix Auger-Aliassime and set a blockbuster title match with his great rival Sinner. It will be the sixth Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting between the two in 2025 and Kolisi, who is a big tennis fan, understands the significance of the pair's rivalry. 

 “I'm very excited. I think it's huge,” Kolisi told ATPTour.com ahead of Sunday's final, scheduled for 6 p.m. CET/noon ET. “Obviously, Sinner has home advantage here. He's from here, but I don't think that's going to play on Alcaraz's mind because he is such a powerful player and he showed tonight what he is capable of. It will be great.”

 Kolisi first met Alcaraz earlier in the week in Turin and did not hide his excitement at crossing paths with the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. He also finally caught up in person with Auger-Aliassime, with whom he has frequently exchanged messages of support over social media. 

 “It was the first time I've seen Carlos play live and also the first time I've seen Felix play live,” said the 32-year-old Kolisi after witnessing Alcaraz's 6-2, 6-4 semi-final triumph. “I came to the tournament because of Felix. [He and I] have been talking on social media and supporting each other. We already planned on meeting, and this was the opportunity to meet. 

 “[The match] was good. It was tough. Alcaraz was very powerful today, but you can't take away from the effort of Felix as well. Alcaraz deserved the match, but Felix will get up again.”

 Auger-Aliassime is not the first tennis star that Kolisi has befriended. He has been close with Roger Federer ever since the former World No. 1 came out in support of the Springboks during the 2019 Rugby World Cup (Federer's mother, Lynette, is from South Africa). The rugby star quoted the Swiss when asked what he most admired about tennis players and the way they compete. 

 “I've learned from listening to Roger Federer speak,” said Kolisi. “When you lose a point, you must forget it and move onto the next one. He says he has lost many points, but he's won [so many] matches. It's the ability to move on. You lose a point and then you change your mindset to win the next one. Also when you win one, you can't dwell on it. Just move onto the next one. This mindset is so strong and powerful.” 

 Kolisi, who led his country to Rugby World Cup triumphs in 2019 and 2023, has since joined Federer on trips supporting the Roger Federer Foundation, which supports early education programmes in six countries including South Africa and Switzerland. However, their friendship has not yet stretched to playing tennis together. Kolisi is willing, but unsure his skills hit the required grade to take to court with a six-time Nitto ATP Finals champion. 

 “I've tried to play tennis, but I suck,” said Kolisi. “I would love to play [with Roger]. He does a charity match, and I would love to play in it one day. I suck, there's no other way to put it, but I'll start somewhere!”

	The Wolves originally introduced the Prince-themed look during the 2018–19 NBA season in collaboration with the Prince Estate and Nike, a partnership that returned for the 2025–26 campaign. The updated uniforms feature a paisley pattern over the right shoulder in reference to Prince's Purple Rain jacket, while the “MPLS” lettering on the shorts nods to the artist's close ties to the Minneapolis sound and the Twin Cities community.


	Inside the arena, fans were greeted with a full Prince-themed presentation. “When Doves Cry” played ahead of tip-off, arena lighting cues shifted to purple, and the Wolves incorporated additional visual tributes throughout the home-game experience. The team also rolled out a Purple Rain-inspired motif on the court, expanding the tribute beyond uniforms and into event production for the first time.

	











	The organization previously announced that the Prince-inspired uniforms would appear seven times during the season, with Saturday's matchup against Denver marking their first outing. Additional theme nights will follow throughout the regular season, including a December home game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.


	Over his career, Prince earned five No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, including “When Doves Cry,” “Kiss,” “Let's Go Crazy,” and “Cream.” His landmark 1984 album Purple Rain spent 24 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, while 19 of his albums have reached the top 10. Following his passing in 2016, Prince became the first artist to simultaneously occupy the entire top 10 of the Billboard Digital Songs chart.

Sharon Osbourne is pushing back against an attempt to release early Black Sabbath recordings, publicly challenging former band manager Jim Simpson after he issued a press release claiming legal ownership of the tapes.

	The dispute, which escalated over the weekend, comes months after the death of her husband, founding Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne.

	Simpson, who managed the group in their earliest days, announced on Nov. 14 that he intends to release a collection of 1969 demos recorded before the band adopted the Black Sabbath name. The material, titled Earth: The Legendary Lost Tapes, was initially expected for release in July. The project has yet to materialize, but Simpson maintains he has the right to distribute the recordings.

	











	Sharon publicly disputed those claims in a detailed Instagram post shared on Saturday (Nov. 15). Her post included screenshots of a July 2 email she says she sent to Simpson, warning him against moving forward without the band's approval. 




	“As you know, the Band do not want these tapes released, not least as they haven't heard them despite you saying you would provide copies long ago,” she wrote. “You know that, as a band, Black Sabbath don't take things lying down and you can be assured that if you go ahead with this against the Band's wishes we will take any action where their rights are infringed, both here and in America.”


	The demos in question feature the band's original lineup—Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward—during the brief period when they performed under the name Earth. While recordings from this era have long been of interest to collectors, the group has historically kept tight control over their early catalog and archival releases.


	The dispute adds to a high-profile week for the Osbourne family. Earlier in the week, Sharon and her children Kelly and Jack Osbourne publicly criticized Roger Waters on The Osbournes Podcast after the Pink Floyd co-founder made disparaging comments about Ozzy in an interview with The Independent Ink. Sharon responded by calling Waters “one of the most twisted, sick individuals I've come across in years.”


	For now, Simpson's proposed release of Earth: The Legendary Lost Tapes appears stalled, but Sharon's post signals the band's intention to challenge any distribution that doesn't involve Black Sabbath's approval. With legal questions unresolved and no release date announced, the future of the recordings remains unclear.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Saturday Night Live opened tonight with Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) trying his best to deflect from Jeffrey Epstein, as the focus has turned on a vote next week to compel the release of Justice Department files on the convicted sexual predator.


	The skit had Johnson's Trump appearing in the White House briefing room, as reporters pressed him on  why he's trying his best to block the release of the Epstein investigative files.


	One reporter asked, “Even Trump's biggest supporters think that he should release the Epstein files. What does Trump have to hide?”


	Trump responded, “I am hiding almost nothing, just enough to make it extremely suspicious. But let me ask you a question. If there was something incriminating about me in the files, then why would I cover them up?”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	A confused reporter (Kenan Thompson) chimed in, “Isn't that exactly why you would cover them up?”


	Trump responded, “OK, let me go again. If I was innocent, wouldn't I just release all the files?”


	Puzzled, the reporter responded, “Yes. again, I think you're agreeing with what everyone is saying.”


	Trump then tried again. “Third time's a charm. Jeffrey Epstein. I barely knew the guy, as evidenced by the thousands of pictures of us together, dancing and grinding our teeth at various parties, always leering and pointing at something just off camera — probably a book we're excited to read.”


	A reporter also asked Trump, “You said you kicked Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago but he said he was ‘never a member.'”

	











	Trump replied, “Yeah, I said I kicked Jeffrey out because he was a pedophile, but then I also said I didn't know he did anything wrong. So it's kind of hard to square that circle until you realize that Trump exists across many timelines. It's the Trump multiverse theory. We just happen to be living in the worst possible one.”


	The sketch was little surprise this week, as the White House has grappled with the release of some 20,000 emails from Epstein mentioning Trump more than 1,000 times, per the Miami Herald. Meanwhile, the House is set to vote next week on a resolution to release the remaining DOJ files on Epstein, even though Trump has opposed such a move.


	Earlier this week, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) met with White House officials in the Situation Room, reportedly as they tried to get her to take her name off a petition to get a vote on the Epstein files release to the House floor. Boebert did not do so.


	The SNL skit opened with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt (Ashley Padilla) leading the briefing, trying to convince the reporters that the Epstein email release proved “that President Trump did nothing wrong.” In fact, Leavitt did try to make that claim at Wednesday's briefing.


	The president, though, did not appear in the briefing room, and over the next couple of days avoided answering press questions. But he's raged about the Epstein files on Truth Social, ordering up an investigation of Bill Clinton and other Democrats named in Epstein's emails.


	In tonight's sketch, Johnson's Trump eventually said that he would release the files, but each one would be “on sale for the low, low price of $800.”

This stuff is really not funny.

Yes it is. Unless you realize this sort of coverup is being  tolerated by anyone …anyone.

Nope. What is funny are the depths corrupt, powerful men like Trump and many others are going to prevent release of sealed DOJ documents as they claim they're innocent of any wrongdoing. 

They will do anything to suppress the forced House vote to release them.doing it right now.  And so many Americans are just fine with that. They want migrants and refugees held accountable for “breaking the law” but are just fine with the rich and powerful abusing children and getting away with it.

I agree. Let's get into why Bill Clinton flew down there over two dozen times. Why Bill Gates was hanging around so much, why Epstein had a painting of George Bush with a paper airplane and knocked over Twin Towers as Jenga blocks. ALL PARTIES are complicate with this evil.

SNL‘s Weekend Update was sizzling tonight — going no frills and eschewing guests, bits and standup sets — with numerous shots taken at President Donald Trump‘s expense following the release of hundreds and thousands of Jeffrey Epstein emails this week further implicating the GOP leader's involvement in the the disgraced mogul's sex trafficking operation.


	“Well, the longest government shutdown in history finally ended after 43 days, and you know, first day back in the office, you gotta check all those piled-up emails,” co-host Colin Jost began, kicking off a relentless torrent of jokes.

	











	He continued: “House Democrats released an email written by Jeffrey Epstein in which he claims that Donald Trump ‘knew about the girls.' It's bombshell news that legal experts are calling ‘duh.'”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Taking things over, Michael Che earned some of the biggest reactions of the night.


	“In one of the emails, Epstein's brother asked if Vladimir Putin has a picture of Donald Trump giving oral sex to someone named Bubba, which was an old nickname for Bill Clinton, so I guess that's one job that Trump has created,” he said, adding that while he doesn't know for sure if the allegation is true, the thought of it is nonetheless “burned in my brain like that scene from The Shining.”


	The co-anchor then referenced an email in which Epstein said he was the only figure “able to take Trump down, which is pretty big talk for a guy who lost to a bedsheet.” The lob at Epstein's demise — ruled as a suicide by hanging via a shirt or sheet — garnered shocked reactions from the audience.

	











	Che then passed the baton back to Jost, who quipped: “Trump's like the Forrest Gump of meeting famous pedophiles.”


	This week, headlines were also dominated by Trump's ongoing spat with BBC, the UK broadcaster he accused of editing his January 6 speech in a misleading manner and for which he has since threatened legal action. Che, apparently conceding the point, then offered to air the real footage, which resulted in a spliced video of Trump saying: “Everybody knows I went down on Bill Clinton.”


	In another hit at Trump, Che said POTUS “denied online rumors that the gold decorations in the Oval Office came from Home Depot, even though he has a whole team of guys taking stuff from Home Depot all the time,” as the screen flashed an image of ICE agents. Following a loud, shocked reaction from the crowd, Che dubbed the segment his “favorite episode.”


	Jost, meanwhile, discussed coffee brand Maxwell House's temporary rebranding as Maxwell Apartment “to better reflect current times, though it's much better than their first choice: Ghislaine Maxwell House.”


	As a bonus, Che addressed the cessation of penny production with a perfect pun: “The U.S. Mint this week stopped producing new pennies. Doesn't make sense [cents].” After audience enthusiasm for the joke, Che offered another option: “One last severe blow to Lincoln's head.” Following a more mixed response, he stood corrected: “I'll do the first one.”

This is 100% libel. It's not debatable
implicating the GOP leader's involvement in the the disgraced mogul's sex trafficking operation.

It is actually protected speech, called “Satire” and the Supreme Court unanimously held that Hustler publisher Larry Flynt was protected in a lawsuit by Jerry Falwell and that Satire Is Protected Free Speech under the Constitution. Once again, just because the GOP doesn't LIKE it doesn't mean it is illegal.

If Che is going to continue to look over to the floor seats after every joke why not just start doing audience reaction shots?

Sure miss the funny times of Chevy, Dennis, Norm and Colin. These two have ruined this part of the show for far too long.

	Special Agent MacGruber has found himself on the wrong side of the law.


	In a Saturday Night Live episode teeming with the satirization of and jokes about the trove of Jeffrey Epstein emails released this week (20,000 pages to be specific), Glen Powell‘s hosting debut featured the return of alum Will Forte reprising his classic recurring character in three separate mini sketches.


	In the first go-around, MacGruber and the team (Powell and Chloe Fineman, mullets donned) race against the clock to defuse a bomb planted at an FBI black site; as Powell deduces, it's likely an attempt to stop his planned leak of the unredacted Epstein files he's in possession of.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“Talk about explosive. For far too long, the rich and powerful have lived by a different set of rules than the rest of us, but it's time for a reckoning, 'cause no one — and I mean no one — is above the law. Let's take a look at these bottom-feeders,” MacGruber proclaims before perusing the list, only to find his name featured. 


	Moving fast, he goes to shred it amid Powell and Fineman's protestations, claiming that doing so will actually make it easier to hide from those looking to destroy its contents. (“I'm breaking it up into tiny little pieces, which we can hide in various garbage cans that only we know about,” he assures.)


	In the second redux shown later in the episode, the trio are once again working to stop an explosion, this time at a deep state facility, whereupon Powell pulls out another copy of the list, citing MacGruber's advice to always duplicate evidence. Once again trying to cover his tracks, MacGruber demands Powell hand over the “radical left-wing hoax list,” embarking on a rant threatening him if he chooses not to.

	











	Hurriedly redacting his name, MacGruber then attempts to write in his fellow agents' names in his place as it becomes even clearer he's on the list. At this point, he straps the list onto the bomb, later banging it against the walls when it fails to explode in order to beget a “new beginning.”


	In the third and final MacGruber sketch, the theme song declares, “It's pretty clear by now MacGruber's on the Epstein list.”


	While at an abandoned monastery (a bomb is set to explode in 30 seconds this time), MacGruber attempts to confess to clear his conscience, but Powell and Fineman are already well aware of his being on the list.


	He clarifies that he's “all over it, like, every third page I'm not on.”


	In classic MacGruber fashion, it all ends with an explosion. The popular character, created in 2007 as a parody of the '80s-era series MacGyver, has launched an SNL dynasty of sorts, leading to a film offshoot and 2021 streaming series.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	During a weekend in which he has raged at critics, Donald Trump lashed out at Seth Meyers, as he has done before, while calling on the NBC late-night host to be fired.


	Trump posted on Truth Social on Saturday, “NBC's Seth Meyers is suffering from an incurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS). He was viewed last night in an uncontrollable rage, likely due to the fact that his ‘show' is a Ratings DISASTER. Aside from everything else, Meyers has no talent, and NBC should fire him, IMMEDIATELY!”


	Soon after Trump's post on Saturday, Trump's FCC chairman, Brendan Carr, reposted the president's angry message to his X account.

	On Sunday, Carr posted that he was at Mar-a-Lago this weekend with Trump.

Great to be with President Trump this weekend.  President Trump's policies are unleashing a new wave of growth and innovation in communities across the country. 🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/nVtd2gUgWq


	Carr did not make his own comment on Trump's post, but his amplification of the president's call for NBC to fire a late-night critic follows the FCC chairman's warning to ABC stations in September over Jimmy Kimmel, whose comments about Charlie Kirk led to the network pulling the late-night house from the schedule for several days. Two major station groups, Nexstar and Sinclair, said they would not air the show. Nexstar is seeking FCC approval of its acquisition of Tegna.


	A spokesperson for NBC did not immediately return a request for comment. Meyers has not yet responded.


	Trump went after Meyers earlier this month, calling him “the least talented person to ‘perform' live in the history of television” and a “truly deranged lunatic.”

	











	“In general, I try to live by the New Yorker's creed: When someone is ranting and raving about you, ignore them. Chances are, they're just going to move on and rave about something else. But there's one thing I simply have to address,” Meyers said on the show. “You can say I'm untalented. You can say I'm deranged. But I'm not the one who talks endlessly about catapults on aircraft carriers!”


	Carr's warning about Kimmel, followed by him being pulled from the air, led to a backlash to the backlash, with Disney+ subscribers canceling their subscriptions. 


	Days later, Carr claimed that he was not threatening stations with losing their license if Kimmel was not fired. But even some Republicans took it that way, with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) comparing the FCC chairman's comments to something a mafia boss would say.


	On his late-night show earlier this month, Kimmel, in his monologue, Kimmel said, “We had some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and with everything they can to score political points from it.”


	Two days later, Carr, appearing on Benny Johnson's podcast, called Kimmel's remark “some of the sickest conduct possible.”


	“Frankly, when you see stuff like this, I mean, we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.”


	In the Benny Johnson interview, Carr did bring up the prospect of Kimmel being fired and the possible revocation of station licenses.


	He said: “Look, there's calls for Kimmel to be fired. You could certainly see a path forward for suspension over this. Again, the FCC is going to have remedies that we can look at. We may ultimately be called to be a judge on that.”


	Cruz has said that he plans to introduce the the Justice Against Weaponized Bureaucratic Outreach to Network Expression (JAWBONE) Act. In response to what he says were Biden administration efforts to pressure tech companies, the legislation would “provide a robust right to redress when Americans are targeted by their own government,” Cruz said at a hearing last month.

At least Trump and his administration are fully out in the open with authoritarianism now. Literally want to stifle free speech and control the media.

Carr will be going to prison for an extremely long time very soon after the chips fall.

It's a shame when the president of the united States is a full pledge bully. He thinks the world, revolve around him , an his pathetic ways. He is a horrible person and president. That needs to be impeached immediately, he is doing more harm than good. Threaten people all the time,it's embarrassing

Give us all a break.Tired of listening to Big Cry Baby.Everybody needs to grow up

haha nice try, losers. EPSTEIN FILES!!!!

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	1997 was a memorable year for Guillermo del Toro for two reasons: His father was kidnapped in Guadalajara, Mexico, and, after a turbulent experience with Bob and Harvey Weinstein on his sophomore feature Mimic, the film was released.


	But which was worse to deal with — the kidnapping or the Weinsteins?


	“The Weinsteins, hands down,” del Toro told Deadline's Mike Fleming Jr. in an appearance at Contenders Film: Los Angeles on Saturday. “Because on the other thing, you knew what they wanted. The Weinsteins, who the f*ck knew what they wanted?”


	Sharing that “there's images” and “moments” in Mimic “that come from that ordeal,” del Toro noted that his Weinstein brothers debacle unfortunately “lasted more than 72 days” and was far more unpredictable of a scenario to grapple with than what he had while teaming with Avatar helmer James Cameron to get his father back, in an experience he said bonded the two filmmakers as “brothers.”

	











	Del Toro was on hand at the DGA Theater to accept Deadline's inaugural Contenders Hall of Fame Award, as well as to discuss his latest film, Frankenstein, which he said marked the culmination of “more than 30 years of career and 50 years of obsession.”


	During the sit-down, the filmmaker also shared his feelings on artificial intelligence — the technology poised to disrupt entertainment in innumerable ways — which he said “can be summarized as ‘F*ck AI.'”


	For all he knows, del Toro said, AI “may be useful for architecture, chemistry, medicine. … But as far as art, I don't think any artist raised their hand and said, ‘Can we have AI?' I don't think so.” Comparing the technology to an uninvited party guest, he said AI “knows what has been done; it doesn't know what to do next. It's not a human.”

	What's most interesting to the creative to consider, when it comes to AI, is whether we'll see the moment he considers the “threshold,” when people are willing to pay $12-$13 to watch a film or listen to a song made by artificial intelligence. “If that happens,” he reflected, “then we'll get the movies we deserve, I'm afraid to say.”


RELATED: The 2026 Oscars: Everything We Know About The Ceremony, Host, Date & More So Far


	On the subject of his Frankenstein, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the Creature, del Toro said, “It really is an obsession that started at 7.”


	Referencing the adage that “we're born with one or two songs in ourselves,” he said that Frankenstein is one of those for him — “I am Johnny Cash singing ‘Hurt.'”


	On the subject of his lifelong passion project, he added: “I aged into it. I failed into it; I succeeded into it. My knees hurt; my soul hurts. I have f*cked up enough that I feel the pain of the questions that [Mary Shelley] has. And I try to sing that song as if it's new.”

Premiering at the Venice Film Festival, del Toro's Frankenstein debuted October 17 in limited release on before hitting Netflix on November 7.

I can't speak to the Weinsteins nor the kidnapping, but about AI, of which we are all lay connoisseurs: This is one of many reasons that, for me, we are not truly dealing with Artificial Intelligence today; not the kind embodied by Data of Next Gen. Data was a thinking, reasoning, forward-looking tool in human form. He could decide based on self-predicted outcomes. He had mental capacity. In contrast, what we so desperately want to futurize into the concept of AI is not actually that futuristic, but rather a computerized Alfred E. Neuman offering snappy answers to dumb questions–for the average nonspecialized user, that is–in other words 98 to 99 percent of us. AI is more accurately Aggregated Information, in a more cleverly convenient format. And I'm not forgetting that it's also a highly coercive sales tool.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Lisa Vanderpump makes savage dig at Prince Harry at BravoCon 2025: ‘I'm a loyal Brit'","https://pagesix.com/2025/11/16/celebrity-news/lisa-vanderpump-shades-prince-harry-at-bravocon-2025/","Sun, 16 Nov 2025 17:43:00 GMT","

Lisa Vanderpump took a pointed swipe at Prince Harry while appearing at BravoCon 2025.

During a panel discussion Saturday, Bravo fan Jerry O'Connell shared that his wife, supermodel Rebecca Romijn, recently flew on the same aircraft with the Duke of Sussex. 

“My wife said, ‘Yeah, it was exciting, [but] not as exciting [as] when Lisa Vanderpump sat two rows back,'” he joked.

Vanderpump remarked, “Well, I'm a loyal Brit. He isn't, right?” she said, per Us Weekly. “Come on, you know, I'm telling the truth.”

Page Six has reached out to Harry's reps for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Harry, 41, famously quit his senior royal family duties and left the UK in 2020 after marrying Meghan Markle, 44, in 2018.

“We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages,” they said in a statement at the time.

“This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.” 

The couple ultimately settled into a sprawling estate in Montecito, Calif., with son Prince Archie, now 6, and have since welcomed Princess Lilibet, now 4.

Though Harry has battled for continuing police protection for himself and his family when they visit the UK, he lost both his original case and his appeal.

The move — dubbed “Megxit” by critics — has been condemned by some, who saw the pair's exit as disloyal.

Vanderpump, 65, was born and raised in London, and moved to the States with husband Ken Todd to run their string of upscale restaurants — including Sur, the famed eatery featured on Bravo's “Vanderpump Rules.”

The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” alum told Express in 2019 that she “had a happy childhood” in London, where she “lived comfortably” with her family and started ballet lessons at the age of three.

She ultimately met Todd, 80, at his London nightclub, and the two married shortly after. According to the outlet, they sold their restaurants in London and relocated to Los Angeles with their two children in 2005.

The former child actress began appearing on “RHOBH” in 2010, and began starring in the spinoff “Vanderpump Rules” beginning in 2013.

Vanderpump left the “RHOBH” in 2019.

Mirrorball champ Bobby Bones made headlines this week after former “Dancing With the Stars” host Tom Bergeron seemingly shaded the radio personality. Now, he says he regrets his reaction.

Bergeron — who returned to the ballroom for the show's 20th anniversary special earlier this week — revealed his most surprising “Dancing With the Stars” moment.

“The thing that shocked me most was a win—Bobby Bones. That was when I went, ‘Uhh,'” he told Parade in an interview published Tuesday, November 11. “Bobby Bones was the first time I was like, ‘Ouch.' No disrespect to Bobby. He would probably say the same thing.”

As it turned out, Bones would not “say the same thing.”

The musician took to social media after hearing Bergeron's comments to share his disappointment. 

“This was hurtful, and not because of what was said, but really who said it,” he said in a video shared via Instagram the following day. “What was I supposed to do on that show? I didn't even want to be on the show…Am I supposed to not show up and work hard? Am I supposed to not give it freaking everything that I have? Am I supposed to throw it and not win?”

The former “American Idol” mentor continued, “It's crazy the amount of hate I get, even from people that I respect, like Tom Bergeron and Julianne Hough.”

He went on to say that he had returned his Mirrorball Trophy following Bergeron's “hurtful” remarks. 

“I had a great attitude, I worked hard and here we are six years later, I'm still catching strays out of nowhere, so I sent the trophy back,” Bones added. “They don't want me to be a part of the show, obviously. I no longer have the Mirrorball trophy. I loved my time there, but I would say things like this… taking random shots this week [has] taken all the joy out of my time on the show.”

Bones took to the stage at the Grand Ole Opry on Friday, November 14, to further discuss his Mirrorball drama. 

“Y'all said to send the Mirrorball back. So, I sent the Mirrorball back,” he addressed the audience, as seen in a video shared via Reddit. “I regret it. I wish I still had it. It was like, as soon as I put the stamp on it and sent it off, I was like, ‘God, that was so stupid.' But, I am still the champion, and if you see a post about it, please comment, ‘He's a good dancer.' That would make me feel better. Thank you.”

Fans showed their support for the “The Bobby Bones Show” podcast host in the comments section of his recent Instagram post. 

“Can you plz tell them to ship the mirror ball back to you ❤️ you deserved it,” one fan wrote. 

“For what it's worth, I remember saying I think you're a really great dancer,” another added. 

“Best dancer ever! I stopped watching after you won. Who could ever beat that!!??” a third chimed in.

“Secret Lives of Mormon Wives” star Jen Affleck is standing by her husband Zac Affleck after their relationship was subject to scrutiny during her run on “Dancing With The Stars.”

Jen was eliminated from the competition during the October 28 episode following her Halloween-themed contemporary routine to Taylor Swift's “Look What You Made Me Do.”

After her elimination, Zac had to shut down the suggestion that he was happy to see her time on the show come to an end.

Someone on TikTok reenacted Zac's reaction to Jen and partner Jan Ravnik's elimination, utilizing a popular trend on the app where a person pretends to look sad before smiling for a split second at the camera before looking sad again.

“Youre honestly disgusting,” Zac wrote in the comments, “Grow up.”

News that she did with her “Mormon Wives” castmate Jessi Ngatikaura, Jen expressed her frustration with all the speculation. “It can be tiring and draining, just because it gets old having to hear the same things,” Jen said. “For me, I'm like, ‘People will always talk and people will always have their opinions,' and I think it is frustrating for him when people don't see what's happening behind closed doors and how much work and effort he's putting in.”

Jen noted how her and Zac were both still learning to deal with all the attention.

“We're working on just tuning out the noise of the world—I think it still is hard for him.” She added, “It's hard to have to constantly open your phone and see negative comments and it's hard not to take that in,” she explained. “Even if you say you don't take it in, subconsciously we all care to a certain point. For me, I always have to remind myself, I post, I share my story, and then I take a step back. As long as I'm focusing on being the best version of myself, that's all that matters.”

“I feel like we've grown so much,” she reasoned. “Clearly, if we hadn't been part of Momtok or been part of this show, we wouldn't have gone through everything that we went through this last year. Even though that was so hard and almost broke us, it actually strengthened us in the long run.”

Despite the challenges they've faced in their marriage, in private or in the public eye, Jen admitted, “I feel like we've grown so much. Clearly, if we hadn't been part of MomTok or been part of this show, we wouldn't have gone through everything that we went through this last year. Even though that was so hard and almost broke us, it actually strengthened us in the long run.”

This isn't the first time that Jen has stood firmly by her marriage to Zac. 

In an Instagram post from October 7, Jen wrote her appreciation for her husband in the caption.

“Appreciation post for this guy,” she began. “He's the one who checks that l've actually eaten breakfast, who reminds me to sleep and makes sure I get real rest. What you don't see are all the quiet ways he keeps us going-cooking, cleaning, kid duty, and those late-night shifts with Penny. This journey truly wouldn't be possible without him, and for that, I am forever grateful.”

Amazon's budding satellite internet program is no longer called Project Kuiper. It is now known simply as “Leo.” The name change comes as the company appears to be shifting its focus from “unserved or underserved” communities to securing larger commercial contracts.

The satellite network has been in the works since 2019 and, as Amazon tells it, the name Project Kuiper was only ever supposed to be temporary. Leo is a nod to the network's location in what's known as low-Earth orbit, commonly referred to in the space industry as “LEO.”

As Amazon worked toward launching the first Kuiper satellites earlier this year, the company boasted that the project was an “initiative to increase global broadband access” with a noble-sounding “mission to bring fast, affordable broadband” to communities that aren't well-served by traditional internet providers.

But, as TechCrunch previously noted, the company has changed the language it uses to describe the service in recent months as it inked deals with Airbus and JetBlue, putting the network more squarely in competition with SpaceX's Starlink service.

Amazon didn't respond to requests for comment.

An archived version of the main FAQ page for Kuiper — published in late 2024 — puts the aforementioned “mission” to serve those communities right at the top of the post. Affordability is mentioned three times throughout, with Amazon calling it a “key principle of Project Kuiper.” 

“Amazon has a longstanding commitment to low prices, and lots of experience building popular, low-cost devices like Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick,” reads the answer to a question on the archived post about how much Kuiper service will cost. “We're applying a similar approach with Project Kuiper.”

That question-and-answer about cost is now gone from the Leo FAQ, and there is no mention of “affordability” anywhere on the page.

The language at the top of the new FAQ is also different. It states that Leo is “Amazon's low Earth orbit satellite network, designed to provide fast, reliable internet to customers and communities beyond the reach of existing networks.” 

While the Leo FAQ mentions that poor connectivity can “create an economic disadvantage for people, businesses, and other organizations operating in unserved and underserved parts of the world,” the company is less specific than it used to be about putting those communities front and center in the customer pipeline.

Amazon Leo's new website is even more blatant about how it is prioritizing home and commercial internet service. It promotes the ability to make “seamless video calls, stream 4K videos,” and “handle your whole family's internet needs,” as well as the fact that Leo is “[f]lexible, scalable, enterprise-ready.”

The idea of using Leo “even in rural and remote locations” is brought up as almost an afterthought on the main website, and there is no mention of cost or affordability.

Despite all this, on Thursday, Amazon posted a flashy video about the name change on X. Among other things, it shows a kid using her computer to do homework, professional drift racing, ambulance workers on a remote road, a farmer using a tablet, and a couple dancing in a laundromat. Along with the video, it wrote: “New name, same mission.”

CHESTER, Pa. -- Facing a Paraguay side who have accomplished feats such as toppling Brazil and Argentina, the United States men's national team were able to take care of business, winning 2-1 at Subaru Park on Saturday in a game that saw a brawl take place before the final whistle started by Gustavo Gomez and Alex Freeman. 

Regulars like Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams may not have been with the squad, but Mauricio Pochettino wasn't short on options as Gio Reyna scored his first USMNT goal since March of 2024 while making his first appearance since March of 2025. Despite struggling to get the ball during much of the game, Folarin Balogun was there when he was needed to put the team ahead for good late in the second half of play. It's the third consecutive game with a goal for the Monaco man as he's finding form for the USMNT at a critical time. 

Even struggling for space in the first half, he was there when the team needed him to push the USMNT ahead for good and ensure that they'd keep that lead. This is why it was important for Balogun to commit to the USMNT instead of England, and now they're seeing the fruits of his commitment.

With time until the World Cup dwindling during what is the beginning of the final international break of 2025, the USMNT are hitting their stride as they're now unbeaten in four straight games. Even without his full squad, Pochettino's men are getting results as the move to a back three has provided critical room for error. If they can continue this growth, it may become time to believe that they can make a statement at the 2026 World Cup on home soil. 

It was a long road to get to this point, featuring Pochettino calling in 71 players as he leaves no stone unturned in the player pool, but with unearthly gems such as Diego Luna, Alex Freeman, Max Arfsten, and Tanner Tessemann, that experimentation has worked. Things will be tougher for the USMNT facing Uruguay in on Tuesday, but there's plenty of reason to believe that they can secure a signature win without stars in the side.

The fight may mar what was a good game from start to finish but the USMNT will keep their unbeaten streak going as it now reaches four matches. It's great to see Gio Reyna find the back of the net and here is the rundown of the goals:

71' 2-1: There's Balogun! In the second half, he has dropped back more, and Brenden Aaronson found him to put the USMNT ahead.

9' 1-1: It's another header for Paraguay this time as they cut through the USMNT defense and Almiron put the ball on a plate for Arce to head it past Matt Freese in net.

4' 1-0: GIO REYNA IS BACK with... a header?! Talk about marking your return to the USMNT with a bang, as the team did a great job keeping the ball alive, and Reyna made it count.

After a hard tackle by Paraguay as tempers flared and the benches cleared between the United States and Paraguay. Gustavo Gomez and Alex Freeman were at the center of things, but with no red cards issued to anyone in play, we'll play out the remainder of stoppage time in Chester. 

We've got some nerve-racking moments to see out as Paraguay will throw everything that they can forward.

Pepi had the ball in the box, but a great recovery block from Paraguay kept him from making this 3-1.

Mauricio Pochettino is going to the bench again, this time bringing on three players - Ricardo Pepi, Timothy Tillman and Aidan Morris. Coming off are Folarin Balogun, Gio Reyna and Cristian Roldan.

This is Pepi's first game for the national team in roughly a year, the forward saddled with injuries for much of that time off. He's someone to keep an eye on, though - the USMNT have a batch of in-form forwards between him, Balogun and Haji Wright, creating a genuine sense of competition for minutes up top.

The best forwards in the world are there when called upon, and while Balogun had a rough first half of play, he was clinical to put the USMNT ahead in the second half. That's just what you want to see from one of the most important attackers in the squad.

To close this out, the USMNT will be in a back four as Dest comes off for Freeman and Scally comes off for Luna. This is when it's time for Pochettino's tactical flexibility to shine.

Diego Liuna and Alex Freeman are getting ready for the USMNT, but there will be a corner kick to take first.

Paraguay's defense has been solid, but this lack of penetration into the attacking third is something else. 

No changes for the second half, but Reyna has moved to the left to try to balance the attack.

We've had an open game but the USMNT are getting put the CONMEBOL ringer with some of the challenges. We may not end with each team having 11 on the pitch.

The American striker has been isolated without Christian Pulisic in the attack today. Only one player, on both teams, has fewer touches than his eight so far in the match, and that's Matt Freese in the USMNT net with four. Freese can essentially get out a camping chair, but the USMNT needs to get their star forward involved sooner than later.

It came from a tactical foul to stop a promising Paraguay counter. While the USMNT have been in control, these counter attacks are nervy moments.

The trio of Reyna, Aaronson, and Dest are making things happen. Dest is playing as an inverted fullback, joining the midfield whenever he can, and Paraguay doesn't have many answers for it. There will be another USMNT goal before long.

He hasn't played for the USMNT since March of 2025 and has yet to score a goal for Borussia Monchengladbach, but within five minutes, he finds the back of the net for his country. Just amazing stuff during what is a critical window for the young attacking midfielder.

We have a fascinating lineup today as the USMNT will be up for a challenge, facing Paraguay. Matt Freese will need to be on alert as players like Julio Ensicso will have a pop from distance to see if they can catch the team off guard, but overall this will be an even affair in Chester.

One of the most capped members of the attack, with 21 appearances for the USMNT, the pressure will be on Balogun to carry the attack without the USMNT regulars beside him. The World Cup is drawing closer, and with goals in his last two starts, Balogun is showing why there was so much promise behind his commitment to the USMNT as a dual national. He's been able to create space for others with his movement and holdup play while putting shots on frame to keep defenses honest. 

In form for club and country, if the USMNT are going to get results from games in this window, they'll need Balogun at his best but his role will change a bit depending on the lineup. If Reyna does start, his ability on the ball will help create space but otherwise, Balogun will need to operate in smaller windows of space than he has become accustomed to. It's a good test for him as it'll be one that prepares him for his first World Cup.

Gio Reyna may be the headliner but he is one of three players who start today who were not even part of the USMNT's October friendlies, natural for a team with 12 new faces from last month's camp. Mauriico Pochettino did hint that building chemistry is a bit of a challenge in these circumstances but the U.S. are trying to make up the difference off the field - here's Diego Luna on the connections they are trying to build off the field in the hopes of making progress on it.

Gio Reyna earns his first start under Mauriico Pochettino, having only played for the head coach once before - seven months ago as a substitute in the 2-1 defeat to Canada in the Concacaf Nations League third place match. Reyna's inclusion was a mix of a few things - his club situation finally being sorted out with his transfer to Borussia Monchengladbach and Pochettino's insistence on giving players an adequate amount of opportunities before the World Cup.

Reyna seems to have seized his opportunities, something defender Tim Ream had noticed over the course of the week.

Despite not having key players, that doesn't mean that the team isn't prepared for this game.

""The way Poch wants us to play, he wants everyone to know their role, he wants everyone to be onboard and he wants nobody to think their postion is gaurenteed so I wouldn't say [regular players missing] affects preperation too much but of course at the same time wer're missing some key players and when we get to the important games and where it matters we're gonna want everyone fit and availible,"" Folorian Balogun said, speaking ahead of the match. ""But the most important thing is to manage what we have, and of course, the players who aren't here get healthy and look after themselves.""

Rain is in the forecast for the day, but we should get some good soccer on the docket with the USMNT hosting Paraguay in Chester. There will be a large Paraguay presence at Subaru Park, but with Union academy products also returning to the stadium, there will be quite a reception for them.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


Refresh for latest…: Lionsgate's third outing with the Four Horsemen conjured a $75.5M global opening this weekend. Of that, $54.2M was in 64 international box office markets. 


	The magic extended to No. 1s in 40 of those offshore hubs, including a surprisingly solid China start of $21.7M, according to Maoyan, where Leomus handles. Next best was CIS (Pasatiempo) at $6.4M (and, yes, Lionsgate still third-party releases movies in Russia via its longstanding output deals).


	I'm told that Latin America grossed $5.5M as a region (awaiting a breakdown). Korea, via Lotte did $3.9M, France (SND) $3.5M and UK (Lionsgate UK) $3.2M.

	Last week's champ, 20th/Disney's Predator: Badlands, added $16.1M overseas to bring the international box office cume to $70M. Globally, the total is now $136.3M to make it the 3rd biggest of the franchise at current rates and excluding Russia.


	Offshore, it's the 2nd best of the series. The international drop was 54% excluding China where it nevertheless held well during the midweek. 


	The Top 5 markets to date are: China ($12.7M), UK ($5.6M), Mexico ($4M), France ($3.7M) and Japan ($3.3M).


	Meanwhile, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle was finally unleashed in China where it grossed 373 RMB ($52.5M), per Maoyan.


	In the market, the Imax cume was $12.3M, good for 24% of the nationwide total. Distributed by Maoyan locally, the Japanese anime juggernaut delivered the highest Imax opening weekend box office gross, attendance and indexing ever for a Japanese title in China. It also notched the second biggest Imax debut for an animated film ever in China, behind only Ne Zha 2.
