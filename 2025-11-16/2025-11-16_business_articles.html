                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paris Hilton is successful many times over. The reality TV star turned entrepreneur is the founder and CEO of 11:11 Media, a global entertainment company she aims to become "the next Disney" that combines her passions in music, beauty, fashion and philanthropy. But people haven't always believed in her business savvy. "For a long time, I felt like people had an idea of who I was that didn't reflect the real me," Hilton told CNBC Make It over email following an appearance at the American Express Leadership Academy. Now, the multi-hyphenate and CNBC Changemaker says she's been able to "take back my narrative" through career achievements like launching her company in 2021 and using her platform to advocate for kids in what's known as the "troubled teen industry." The businesswoman said authenticity is a key trait in the people she decides to work with, in addition to being passionate and creative. "And kindness is non-negotiable for me," Hilton added. "It shows people's true character, and I want my brand and everyone who represents it to lead with kindness." In recent years, Hilton has used her spotlight to advocate for children harmed by America's child welfare, juvenile justice, education and health-care systems. Last year, she appeared before Congress and helped to pass the bipartisan Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act. Hilton encouraged other young entrepreneurs to meaningfully integrate philanthropy into their work. "Impact shouldn't be an afterthought; it should be part of your mission from the very beginning," Hilton said, adding that the second hire she made for her company was 11:11 Media's head of impact Rebecca Grone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the precious metal dropped in price on Friday as part of a broader market decline, year-to-date returns still sat at nearly 50%, with a price around $4,100. By comparison, the S&P 500 U.S. stock index is up about 15% in 2025, as of Friday's close. Heady returns in 2025 follow a year in which gold recorded its best annual performance since 2010, about 26%, according to the World Gold Council. But investment profits from physical gold and funds that track gold are taxed differently from those of traditional assets like stocks and bonds, according to tax experts. The upshot is that investors — especially those in the top tax brackets — may pay a higher federal tax rate on gold profits relative to assets like stocks and bonds. That could leave gold investors with a surprise tax bill. "I've seen missteps quite a few times, especially this year with the run that gold has had," said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, which was No. "Long-term" tax rates on investment profits — known as capital gains — are preferential relative to the marginal income tax rates that investors might pay on wages and other income, for example. For example, the top federal rate on long-term capital gains, 20%, is lower than the top marginal income tax rate, 37%. However, physical gold and funds backed by physical gold are treated as collectibles for tax purposes — and collectibles have a top 28% rate on long-term capital gains. "There's no getting around that [collectibles rate] just because it's held in an ETF wrapper," Lucas said. This also applies to other precious metals like silver. Funds that hold gold futures contracts — instead of physical gold — have yet a different tax structure, with a top federal tax rate of 26.8%, said Jeffrey Levine, a certified public accountant and certified financial planner based in St. Louis. "Just because you have a gold ETF doesn't mean it's going to be taxed exactly the same," said Levine, the chief planning officer at Focus Partners Wealth. It doesn't apply to investors who hold gold ETFs in a tax-preferred retirement account, like an IRA. There are three long-term capital-gains rates: 0%, 15% and 20%, depending on an investor's annual income. Short-term capital gains, which apply to assets held for a year or less, are different. Profit on such sales is taxed at ordinary income tax rates, like those that apply to wages, for example. There are seven marginal tax rates, ranging from 10% up to 37%. That means an investor in the 32%, 35% or 37% income tax brackets wouldn't own more than 28% in long-term capital gains on collectibles profits. Meanwhile, capital gains for futures contracts are assessed based on a 60/40 tax structure, said Levine. Added together, that's a top capital-gains rate of 26.8% for gold futures contracts, Levine said. While some higher-income investors might think it's a better idea from a tax perspective to buy gold futures funds, there are also downsides, he said. For example, such investors would get a K-1 tax form since the funds are often structured as partnerships, Levine said. That could make it more challenging and costly to file an annual tax return, he said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is swapping its 1950s "Glass House" headquarters for a new, modern industrial facility to promote collaboration and better appease thousands of employees who have returned to offices in recent years after remote working. It replaces a 12-story, rectangular-shaped headquarters roughly three miles away in the city that is expected to be demolished. The new building marks Ford's sixth headquarters since its founding in 1903. Currently nicknamed "The Hub," the new headquarters will consolidate thousands of employees and several prior locations under one — albeit very large — roof. From an operational basis, the new headquarters is roughly split evenly between design and industrial operations. Design includes massive studios with hidden courtyards and a large showroom. The other half is set to be used for general business operations such as executive offices and common work and meeting areas. There are very few actual offices outside of those for top executives, according to the company. The idea is for employees to be able to work as they choose in different areas, or "neighborhoods," depending on what they're working on that day, officials said. Domain staking, where employees attempt to make a space their permanent workplace, will be discouraged, said Jennifer Kolstad, global design and brand director for Ford Land, the automaker's property management group. This is a space that is a tool for our employees to be more productive, to be more collaborative, and really help deliver the Ford+ plan," said Jim Dobleske, Ford Land chair and CEO, during a tour of the building. Many salaried employees are expected in offices at least four days a week, as of earlier this year, after many of them had a more loose hybrid office-home schedule following the end of the pandemic. Some of that collaboration is expected to occur over food. The new headquarters includes a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight "kitchen concepts" that will feature rotating menus as well as take-home options such as pizza and $6 whole rotisserie chickens, decadent desserts and a juice bar complete with a herb garden. "We have guests coming in from all over the world, so we wanted to make sure we have designed our menus to kind of play homage to that diversity," said Grant Vella, executive chef for the new ]headquarters. "We wanted to do something different, push the boundary of business dining." "This headquarters is the cornerstone of our campus redevelopment, but there's been a tremendous amount of work that we have done throughout the campus to really connect it and make it much more walkable for our employees," Dobleske said, pointing to several facilities and areas, including a test track and 18-acre "Horsepower Park," surrounding the building. Inside the building are six courtyards, including a dual-level one at the center of the company's new design studios to allow designers to take products outside to view them outdoors in natural light. Those design courtyards are exclusive areas that can only be viewed by the surrounding, private studios. Most of the four-story building features outside natural light from the exterior glass walls as well as skylights and other windowed areas. In addition to making a more walkable exterior campus, Ford wants employees to use purposefully designed stairs rather than elevators and escalators that are the primary modes of transportation in its most-recent 12-story headquarters. Craig Dykers, founding partner of Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta that worked on the building, said each staircase in the building, especially in its 14 different arrival areas, are prominent and meant to be inviting to use. "Obviously people don't naturally want to climb a stair, so you have to design it very carefully so that people feel good about using the stair," he said. "Part of the trick is that as you go up one flight, you don't necessarily see the next flight, so it's kind of a journey." The coffee bar overlooks a white artwork that features vehicle parts — one of many prominent pieces of art Ford purchased or has curated for the new facility. Inside the company's design operations are large studios with advanced clay milling machines, a spacious showroom that will operate as a modern design dome and a 64-foot screen showing virtual reviews and testing. There will be a massive Ford blue oval logo on the outside of the building but not on its interior. On some exterior glass walls, such as the company's design operations, there's a glass pattern that features the ovals accompanied by hidden numbers that represent Ford patents. Ford declined to discuss the capital spent to build its new headquarters and design center, which was part of a previously announced $1 billion campus transformation that began under former CEO Jim Hackett, who previously led furniture company Steelcase.

Back in 2023, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made an observation about his company: "I don't think you want a management structure that's just managers managing managers, managing managers, managing managers, managing the people who are doing the work," he said during a company Q&A session, The Verge reported at the time. "I think you're just going to see a different modality within a company, which is an agent manager," Jeanne DeWitt Grosser, the chief operating officer at Vercel, told Business Insider. They're commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user. Vercel, a $9.3 billion cloud-based developer platform founded in 2015, recently trained an AI agent on its best-performing sales representative. The machine is so effective that the company downsized its 10-person sales team to a single top performer and moved the remaining nine to a different team. Becoming an AI agent manager might have a lower barrier to entry, though it requires different technical skills. Grosser didn't say whether Vercel will be posting a job like this anytime soon, but said it's something the company is "contemplating." Last month, Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr.com, an online community for founders of SaaS and B2B companies, posted on LinkedIn that the first $200,000 sales development representative role is "coming." The job involves managing "10+ AI SDR agents" and requires a candidate to be "pretty technical," he wrote. Saurabh Sarbaliya, the chief technology officer and AI lead at PwC, told Business Insider that companies will likely try to train their existing workforce to take on this kind of role before recruiting external candidates. Good agent managers should be able to train agents, give them context, review their behavior, and design workflows that are very "intentional," he said. That includes requiring an agent to consult a human before it goes on to execute specific actions, he said.</p>

Or, at least, their families want to be able to afford them, and they don't want the White House telling them otherwise. Yes, tariffs will cause short-term pain, and sure, efforts to reshore manufacturing and curb immigration may increase labor-market uncertainty, but, officials insist, it will all be worth it. That's how we got Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saying that access to inexpensive goods is "not the essence of the American dream," and President Donald Trump saying that kids should make do with fewer pencils. Sacrifice is not a fun thing for consumers to do, especially when the payoff is vague at best and, at worst, contrary to the kind of economy they desire. "They had a theory of the case of how the economy would evolve earlier this year," says Mike Konczal, senior director of policy and research at the Economic Policy Institute, an economic think tank. Thus far, most of it hasn't been working out. "Even nonpolitical people are aware that something's floundering here," Konczal says. He's floating haphazard policy ideas (economists are generally dubious), claiming prices are already down (somewhat true for select products, very much not true for others), and expressing exasperation at the whole situation. As much as conservatives may not like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mandami, they are paying attention to him, especially his campaign's relentless focus on affordability. While inflation appeared to be slowing around the middle of 2025, it has picked up again and is on track to end the year at about 3% annual growth. During the same period last year, durable goods prices fell by 1%, and there was an expectation that prices for these bigger-ticket items would continue into 2025. Services prices, such as entertainment and transportation, have continued to rise at an elevated pace, too. The costs of major essentials are especially daunting for many consumers, including healthcare, childcare, and housing. Just five years ago, it was much closer to $300,000. Healthcare costs are expected to rise steeply for many Americans next year. They're "perfectly aware" that inflation rates have fallen, she says, but even if goods aren't rising in price quite as fast, consumers can still remember the old sticker price, which is aggravating. Add on the fact that because of tariffs, many people don't think we're out of the woods when it comes to price hikes, either. Another factor Hsu thinks is worth noting: weakening incomes. Twenty-nine percent of respondents to the University of Michigan's November survey mentioned softer incomes as a negative factor in their personal finances, compared to 20% the month before. Average wages for most workers are still outpacing inflation, but the job market is stagnant, and many workers are stuck in place. "The most visible part of this low-hire, low-fire job market is entry level workers being like, 'Oh my God, I've done 5,000 interviews and all I got is this lousy T-shirt,' but the other, smaller violin is people who were job-hopping to get raises for the last few years who just can't do that," says Michael Madowitz, the principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a progressive think tank. The TL;DR here is people are tired of being surprised at how expensive everything is and increasingly annoyed that their paychecks aren't going as far, too. A Washington Post-ABC News-Pisos poll from October found that 71% of American adults say they're spending more money on groceries compared to a year ago. Many consumers have hoped prices would fall — they don't realize that, in many cases, the best they can hope for is for them to stop rising so much. "As a former Biden administration official, I will tell you we learned the hard way that consumers do not distinguish between price levels and inflation," Tedeschi says. When people get angry, they look for someone to blame. "I think the American people realize that's just not a priority for this administration," Konczal says. Trump, who campaigned on "making America affordable again," has struggled to counter the disillusionment. Speaking with reporters in early November, Trump touted the reduced cost of this year's Walmart Thanksgiving basket while overlooking that the 2025 edition includes fewer items and brushing aside concerns about prices, at one point declaring, "I don't want to hear about the affordability." Days later, Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, in an interview on ABC News' "This Week," said that the administration is making "substantial progress" and that prices will come down "over the coming months and next year." In a subsequent interview with Fox News, Bessent said the administration would seek to lower coffee and banana prices "very quickly," and at the end of the week, the president signed an executive order dropping reciprocal tariffs on food items such as beef, coffee, and avocados. In a post-Mamadani election scramble, Trump has floated a flurry of ideas that could be seen as addressing the cost-of-living problem. There's the idea of sending out $2,000 checks to low- and middle-income Americans as a tariff rebate and making 50-year mortgages a thing. Many economists and real-estate analysts aren't sold on these propositions. Half-century mortgages would mean homebuyers pay significantly more overall interest and take longer to build equity. It could also increase demand for homes, in turn increasing prices and adding stress to an already crunched supply if we don't end up building more homes. Even more Trump-friendly voices are doing some sign-tapping around affordability. Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Brett Baier have pressed the president on the issue, asking him to respond to concerns — which he's largely dismissed — about prices. In an interview with CNN, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was up front about her own experience as a consumer. "I go to the grocery store myself," she said. In a statement to Business Insider, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said that "cleaning up Joe Biden's inflation and economic disaster has been a top focus since Day One." Trump, like Biden, finds himself trying to convince a highly skeptical public that the economy is better than meets the eye. Consumers may not know the exact price of everything they buy at the grocery store, but they are aware that their weekly basket is getting pricier. Some consumers are buying less and smaller in order to cut costs, or taking on credit card debt to make ends meet. Admittedly, the price puzzle is a hard one to solve. "There's no low-hanging fruit here, especially on something like housing," Sahm says. Housing policy is generally dealt with at the state and local levels, and there's not much the federal government can do. "You can look to the White House and Congress to actually go after specific price imbalances," Sahm says, but it takes thought and effort. But the Fed's is a blunt instrument, not a precise one, and some of Trump's policies may have ultimately stood in its way. "They would've lowered interest rates more this year if you hadn't unleashed tariffs," Sahm says. Fairly or not, Americans have been viewing the economy as bad for a while now, and it's up to Trump to fix it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Graduate schemes and internships are at risk of becoming a thing of the past as major firms slash headcount in a push to deploy AI. Recently, Amazon laid off 14,000 corporate employees as it aims to invest in its "biggest bets" which includes generative AI. In fact, 62% of U.K. employers expect that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will most likely be lost to AI, according to a new survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.) In the U.S., postings for entry-level jobs have declined about 35% since January 2023, per data from labor research firm Revelio Labs. As companies cut back on hiring junior workers, Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at Oxford Internet Institute, pointed out that recruiting entry-level workers is actually an "investment" in the future. Although they tend to make mistakes and require hands-on training, experts told CNBC why replacing junior workers with AI will actually backfire on companies in the long-term. Healthy organizations cultivate their own talent and it's not feasible to hire for all positions externally, according to Chris Eldridge, UKI and North America CEO of tech recruitment firm Robert Walters I think if you overcut that junior layer, you will have a talent bottleneck at some point in the business that leads invariably to an increase in hiring costs." If a company doesn't have enough young talent, it will be forced to hire from the outside in the future and will create a "talent doom cycle" which will result in increased costs, salary inflation, and a dependency on the external talent market. "Also talent retention is very important through the training development and opportunities you can give people… but you're missing a significant aspect of growth if you shut down the pipeline on bringing junior or entry-level talent into an organization," he added. Companies that don't nurture young talent will eventually lose touch with consumers and mainstream culture, according to Oxford Internet Institute's Stephany. "A firm is part of society, and if it doesn't reflect society adequately, it's very hard for me to imagine a business model or product that doesn't need this generational bridge…and young people bring in fresh ideas that bring a new perspective," Stephany said to CNBC Make It. Firms that fail to adapt and hire junior employees will become "like an elderly homes company," Stephany said. Eldridge agreed noting that there's a stereotype that all good ideas come from the top but "a very healthy percentage of great ideas in the company come from people within their first two or three years in an organization because they see it with fresh eyes." An additional bonus of having young people in an organization is the opportunity for reverse mentoring, particularly as young people bring a crucial knowledge of technology, and losing that would be a "genuine threat" to organizations. "If anything erodes that opportunity for mentorship both ways and that knowledge transfer both ways, it will drive down institutional knowledge or create institutional gaps," he said. Matthew Prince, co-founder and CEO of Cloudflare, told CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange" last week that the tech firm plans to hire 11,000 interns in the age of AI in order to upskill the next generation but also bring fresh new ideas. We need to learn from the next generation," Prince said. It refers to the implicit and unspoken information about a company's culture that colleagues' share. "They emerge from the network of people, those people that sit sometimes in the cafeteria that say 'I've been with the company for 25 years, I can explain you what what's going on, why X has a problem with Y. Robert Walters' Eldridge added that young people are sponges and "absorb the best of a business" including this type of tacit knowledge that can only be passed on through people. "I think businesses rely on that upwards pressure, where you bring in a cohort of inexperienced people, they are hungry, they want to learn. They ask an awful lot to organizations, which sometimes test them and keeps a company on its toes. if you don't have that it could potentially end up being a detriment to the culture and to the performance of an organization," Eldridge added.</p>
