                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Italian, who will play Carlos Alcaraz for the Nitto ATP Finals title Sunday, has become dominant with a roof over his head. The second seed's semi-final against Alex de Minaur was his 30th in a row indoors and he shows no sign of slowing down. Sinner's winning streak is already the sixth longest in the Open Era (carpet not included) and dates back to the championship match in Turin two years ago, when he fell to Novak Djokovic. Only John McEnroe, Djokovic, Roger Federer and Ivan Lendl have won more consecutive indoor hard-court matches, with Federer accomplishing the feat twice. Nobody else has won more than 35 in a row. Longest Indoor Hard-Court Winning Streaks in Open Era What is most impressive about Sinner's streak is not just that he has won, but how convincingly he has done so. In his 27 straight-sets wins, Sinner has needed just six tie-breaks. At last year's Nitto ATP Finals, Sinner did not drop more than four games in a set, becoming the first player to win the season finale without losing a set since Lendl in 1986. He has not lost a set or serve through four matches this year in Turin, either. Sinner has an idea of why he is successful in such conditions. So this for sure helps me a lot playing indoors,” Sinner said. Only McEnroe (85.3%), Lendl (83%) and Jimmy Connors (81.6%) have won at a higher rate. He passed Roger Federer (81%) and Bjorn Borg (80.6%) during the Nitto ATP Finals. No other active player, including Djokovic (80.2%), has won a better percentage of indoor matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Just like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, Siya Kolisi enjoyed the taste of victory on Saturday in Turin. A two-time Rugby World Cup-winning captain with South Africa, Kolisi led the Springboks to a 32-14 victory against Italy at the city's Allianz Stadium, just as home favourite Sinner was sinking Alex de Minaur to book his championship-match spot at the Nitto ATP Finals. A few hours later, Kolisi was inside Inalpi Arena to watch Alcaraz down Felix Auger-Aliassime and set a blockbuster title match with his great rival Sinner. I think it's huge,” Kolisi told ATPTour.com ahead of Sunday's final, scheduled for 6 p.m. CET/noon ET. WILD @SiyaKolisi reaction to meeting @carlosalcaraz for the first time 😂😂😂#NittoATPFinals | #Kolisi pic.twitter.com/mfRBoSdLtV You May Also Like: Final Preview: Alcaraz, Sinner ready for last dance of 2025 at Nitto ATP Finals Kolisi first met Alcaraz earlier in the week in Turin and did not hide his excitement at crossing paths with the No. He also finally caught up in person with Auger-Aliassime, with whom he has frequently exchanged messages of support over social media. “It was the first time I've seen Carlos play live and also the first time I've seen Felix play live,” said the 32-year-old Kolisi after witnessing Alcaraz's 6-2, 6-4 semi-final triumph. “I came to the tournament because of Felix. We already planned on meeting, and this was the opportunity to meet. Alcaraz was very powerful today, but you can't take away from the effort of Felix as well. Alcaraz deserved the match, but Felix will get up again.” Felix Auger-Aliassime greets Siya Kolisi on Saturday night at the Nitto ATP Finals. Auger-Aliassime is not the first tennis star that Kolisi has befriended. He has been close with Roger Federer ever since the former World No. 1 came out in support of the Springboks during the 2019 Rugby World Cup (Federer's mother, Lynette, is from South Africa). “I've learned from listening to Roger Federer speak,” said Kolisi. Kolisi, who led his country to Rugby World Cup triumphs in 2019 and 2023, has since joined Federer on trips supporting the Roger Federer Foundation, which supports early education programmes in six countries including South Africa and Switzerland. However, their friendship has not yet stretched to playing tennis together. Kolisi is willing, but unsure his skills hit the required grade to take to court with a six-time Nitto ATP Finals champion. He does a charity match, and I would love to play in it one day.
