            Pope Leo XIV has pleaded for an end to the “pandemic of arms” as he made his first public comments on gun control while offering prayers for the victims of the shooting at Annunciation Catholic school in Minneapolis.
    


            The first American pope made his remarks following the August 27 shooting which killed two children and injured 18 others as students and staff gathered for a school Mass.
    


            “Let us plead [to] God to stop the pandemic of arms large and small which infects our world,” the Chicago-born pontiff told the crowd in St. Peter's Square following the weekly Sunday Angelus prayer.
    


            Leo, speaking in his native English, said he was offering “prayers for the victims of the tragic shooting during a school Mass in the American state of Minnesota” and the “countless children” who are killed and injured every day.
    


            Leo's predecessor, Pope Francis, frequently condemned the arms industry and warned that the use of guns by civilians to defend themselves had become a “habit.”  Leo, who was elected in May, has continued to condemn the “logic of weapons” and the arms trade, though in a telegram sent in the immediate aftermath of the Minneapolis shooting he refrained from making any comments about gun control.
    


            In the past, however, a now-deleted X account apparently belonging to Robert Prevost – before he was elected pope – re-posted statements by Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago calling for “increased access to mental health care and stronger, sensible gun control laws” following the 2017 shootings in Las Vegas.
    


            He also shared a statement from Democratic Senator Chris Murphy who wrote on the same incident: “To my colleagues: Your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers. None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.”
    


            Following the Minneapolis shooting, Cupich, who is close to Leo, issued his own a statement saying: “The facts are clear. Guns are plentiful and common sense attempts to limit their availability have been largely rejected in the name of a freedom not found in our constitution.”

            Joe Koenen has not seen a single Toronto Blue Jays baseball hat all summer.
    


            Typically, Canadians will flood the streets of Seattle during the summer, but Koenen, who runs Seattle Free Walking Tours (where people pay what they can), said Canadian tourists are almost gone. Streets look emptier to him.
    


            Canadians calling to cancel their tours “explicitly told me that it was because of the policies and the behavior of our current president,” he said.
    


            As a result of seeing 30% fewer customers this year overall, Koenen has been paying his employees but not himself. This is also the first year since he took over the tour company in 2021 that he has had to put his own savings into the business to keep it afloat.
    


            “I am super-duper angry. I'm also disappointed, but I'm more sad … it's such a self-inflicted injury,” Koenen said.
    


            Another Seattle tour operator, John Brink, said “usually you kill it that weekend,” referring to the annual May series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners. But the foot traffic wasn't there this year. The Blue Jays are Canada's only Major League Baseball team, so while the team is based in Toronto, many fans from Western Canada passionately sport their Blue Jays gear when they come to Seattle each summer.
    


            Brink's company, Tasty Tours, which guides visitors through food stalls in the historic Pike Place Market, has seen a 50% drop in Canadian customers.
    


            Many Canadians have boycotted taking US trips and buying American products since the spring. That's when President Trump made false claims and belittling comments about Canada in the midst of a tariff war.
    


            The absence of Canadians has been felt acutely in the United States, especially in cities like Seattle close to the northern border. And Canadians aren't the only international travelers skipping the US. Some other international travelers have also named recent policies around tariffs and immigration as reasons they're staying away.
    


            After a promising estimate in December by analytics company Tourism Economics that the US would see about 9% growth in overall international visitation in 2025, the company's updated outlook now estimates an 8.2% decline, led by about one quarter fewer Canadians visiting the US from January to July, compared to the same period in 2024.
    


            The World Travel and Tourism Council, a global tourism advocacy organization, projected in May that the United States will lose $12.5 billion in international visitor spending in 2025, the only country out of 184 economies the council analyzed that will see a decline this year.
    


            And that pain could stretch beyond this year. Rob Hawkins, from the United Kingdom, changed plans he and his wife had for a 20-day spring 2026 trip to the US to go to South Korea and Japan instead.
    


            “America to me is rock ‘n roll, NASA, speed, jazz, horses, bourbon, hip hop, dance, MTV (the original), Hollywood, gold medals, innovation, strength, respectful (sic) and apple pie,” Hawkins told CNN in an email. “Not the army on the streets and the extreme division currently on show,” he said, referring to the National Guard presence in Los Angeles during immigration raids and in Washington D.C. to take federal control of the local police force.
    


            The Hawkins' decision to avoid the US for now is one echoed across social media by others around the world.
    


            “It's unheard of,” said Didier Arino, general director of travel consulting firm Protourisme in France, about an unprecedented drop in interest for travel to the US.
    


            “It's happened before in a country at war, in a country where there was a security risk, or risk of health crisis, but in a normal situation, we've never seen this kind of turnaround,” Arino told CNN in the spring.
    


            Beyond citing fears of being questioned at the border, or general opposition to the Trump administration's policies, visitors from some countries are now facing an added upfront cost of $250 for a new “visa integrity fee.”



            “This is a wake-up call for the U.S. government. The world's biggest Travel & Tourism economy is heading in the wrong direction, not because of a lack of demand, but because of a failure to act,” said Julia Simpson, World Travel and Tourism Council president & CEO, in a statement.
    


            “While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the ‘closed' sign … This is about growth in the U.S. economy — it is doable, but it needs leadership from DC,” Simpson said.
    


            For Brink, the Tasty Tours owner in Seattle, American cruise ship passengers coming through the city have somewhat offset the loss in international tourists.
    


            Still, “I personally think without the tariffs and the rhetoric and all that nonsense that we would all have made way much more money this year,” Brink said.
    


            Adam Duford, owner of Surf City Tours in Santa Monica, California, has been feeling the pain of a tourism downturn, too.
    


            “Spring break never happened,” said Duford. “Memorial Day didn't happen either.”
    


            Duford's business of running 13-passenger van tours through Hollywood, Malibu and Venice, took a dive this year because of geopolitical forces, catastrophic wildfires and misinformation.
    


            He told CNN that customers were calling to cancel because they had seen a fake image on social media of the Hollywood sign burning down. (It — and all of Hollywood — is still there.) Duford points to misinformation about the January Los Angeles fires, and later, a misperception that protests over immigration raids had taken over the whole city, as examples of why some people stayed away.
    


            Overall, his revenue is down 49% this year. Duford thought this might have been a problem specific to Los Angeles events. But he has also noticed that his typical Canadian customer base that comes during their spring break did not show up this year and learned of businesses in other cities also hurting from lack of tourists.
    


            “It's hard to be angry, because it's not just me,” he said. “For all the promises of a good economy — and maybe people were thinking, ‘we'll sacrifice some culture war things for this good economy that's going to come from this administration.' It doesn't seem like that's happening.”
    


            Prior to the latest challenges, international tourism to the United States had yet to fully recover after the pandemic. Last year, the 72.4 million visitors from other countries represented 91% of pre-pandemic 2019 figures, according to the US National Travel and Tourism Office.
    


            Tourism Economics, which tracks data on domestic and international tourism, now projects that a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels won't happen until 2029 — three years later than it originally projected.
    


            Domestic tourism has not been strong enough to make up for the loss, according to Tourism Economics.
    


            Canadians turning away from the US is particularly worrisome.
    


            More Canadians visit the US than visitors from any other country, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office. Canadians made up about 28% of total international visitor arrivals in 2024.
    


            Instead of going to the United States, “we're seeing Canadian travel begin to lift toward Mexico, to the Caribbean, even toward Europe in recent data,” said Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics.
    


            “I do think once we turn into the colder months … it would be difficult to sustain this sort of drop. I think that there will be a bit of a bounce. But as long as the rhetoric around this — like Canada becoming a 51st state — as long as that continues, I think you're going to see a pretty ongoing reaction from Canadians.”
    


            Airlines have adjusted by changing routes that were bound for the US. There were about 90,200 fewer airline seats available to book from Canada to the US from April 1 to June 30, compared to the same quarter last year, according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics company.
    


            It's no wonder that Koenen and Brink are seeing so few Canadians in Seattle: Tourism Economics estimates Seattle will lose more than a quarter of its international visitors this year, mostly due to Canadians staying away.
    


            “That's really a hard thing. I think what we see as our opportunity is to just stand and be ready to welcome our friends from Canada back when the time is right. The time is not right yet,” said Michael Woody, chief strategy officer for Visit Seattle.
    


            Mike Mondello, who owns “Made in Washington” stores in the Seattle region featuring products by local artists and producers, said he realized during the spring news cycle that “this is going to be a different year.”
    


            Without a doubt, he said the “softening” of business at his downtown store has been disappointing. But Mondello said “time heals all.”
    


            “You won't wake up on a Monday and say, ‘Wow, things have changed.' It'll keep inching its way back, I'm pretty sure,” Mondello said.
    


            Woody believes there is an opportunity with the FIFA World Cup in 2026, when his marketing team in Seattle will be collaborating with Destination Vancouver. Seattle and Vancouver are the second-closest geographical grouping of any of the FIFA host cities, and match schedules have been aligned so that spectators can easily travel to see games on both sides of the border.
    


            Woody expects about 750,000 people flowing in and out of Seattle over the three-week period of those games.
    


            Still, Sacks from Tourism Economics warns that across the US, the estimated bump in World Cup visitors in 2026 will not be enough to overcome the damage done this year.
    


            Canadians have also pulled back from other favorite destinations across the country, including Orlando, home to the nation's largest cluster of theme parks.
    


            Canadian air arrivals to Orlando were down through May and advance hotel bookings slowed noticeably since April, according to Casandra Matej, Visit Orlando president and CEO. But other visitors from the UK, Brazil and Mexico have still been coming in steady numbers.
    


            Steve Hill, CEO of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, told CNN he recently returned from a sales mission in Vancouver. These are routine trips for his team, but Hill said he personally wanted to attend this time to hear from more than 100 tour operators and travel agents about the sentiment in Canada.
    


            What he heard was not surprising: A certain portion of Canadians will not visit the US right now on principle.
    


            “Trying to get them to overcome that too significantly, I don't think works very well,” Hill said. “What we told them is, you know, we're here when you're ready. We hope you're ready soon.”
    


            Las Vegas has seen a drop in both domestic and international tourists. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority's latest data available from January to July 2025, shows overall visitor volume is down 8% compared to the same period the year before.
    


            Hill said other international tourists have still come in relatively stable numbers. He also believes there will be more Canadians returning in the fall and winter when they tend to escape the cold and enjoy hockey season in Las Vegas.
    


            Both Tourism Economics and several cities' tourism bureaus told CNN that they urgently need Congress to fully fund Brand USA, a public-private partnership that heads a globally coordinated marketing effort to promote the US as a premier travel destination. In July, Congress reduced federal matching funds for Brand USA from $100 million to $20 million.
    


            Hawkins, the London resident who decided against his trip next year, said he hopes the situation will improve, so that he and his wife can still travel to Yellowstone and Las Vegas in 2027.
    


            “I look at the hard-working Americans just as I do local business owners here in the U.K.,” Hawkins wrote to CNN, adding that he would “hate to see them suffer” because of government decisions.
    


            “I wouldn't care what political affiliation the owners would have, as I find if you take politics out of any conversation (which I do often), you are pretty much going to have good stuff in common with people.”

‘Mohammed' and ‘Ahmad' are among the most common names of welfare recipients in Germany, according to newly revised figures released by the federal government. ‘Olena', a Ukrainian variant of Helen, is the only female name in the top ten.

Germany's unemployment rate reached 6.4% in August, with the total number of jobless people exceeding 3 million for the first time in a decade. According to Federal Employment Agency data, 5.42 million people were receiving welfare benefits at the end of 2024 – of which 48% were foreigners, compared to 19.6% in 2010.

The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had requested information on the most common first names of recipients to support its argument about the failure of integration.

In June, the Labor Ministry replied that the leading names were ‘Michael', ‘Andreas', and ‘Thomas', followed by ‘Daniel', ‘Olena', and ‘Alexander' – prompting media ridicule of the AfD. However, the initial list did not combine different spellings of names, such as ‘Thomas' and ‘Tomas', ‘Mohammed' and ‘Mohamed', listing them separately.

The revised data placed ‘Mohammed' – spread across 19 spellings – in first place with nearly 40,000 entries, followed by ‘Michael' with around 24,600 and ‘Ahmad' with more than 20,600. ‘Olena' remained the only female name among the top ten, with around 14,200 entries.

Germany is the EU's top migrant destination and the world's third-largest refugee-hosting country, according to UN data. Under former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-border policies, more than a million people arrived from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq during the 2015 migrant influx. In recent years, the country has granted temporary protection to 1.2 million Ukrainians and received 334,000 asylum applications in 2023, nearly a third of the EU total.

The migrant crisis has strained housing, public services and finances, contributing to the rise of the AfD, which has recently led national polls as Germany's most popular political party.

The AfD came in second in February's federal election with 152 seats in the 630-seat Bundestag, but was excluded from coalition talks. Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has designated the AfD a “confirmed extremist entity.” While that classification was temporarily suspended, senior officials have continued to seek legal grounds to pursue a formal ban of the party.

MINSK, August 31. /TASS/. Belarus is actively involved in shaping the new world order, President Alexander Lukashenko said.

""Sharing the principles and views of the global majority, Belarus considers itself an integral part of the new world order and is actively participating in its formation. We joined the SCO and became a BRICS partner with specific proposals that are already yielding results. We came with a clear agenda and promising projects in energy, transport, logistics, finance, industrial cooperation, food security, trade, and technology,"" he said in an interview with the Xinhua news agency.

According to the president, Minsk hopes to continue its fruitful cooperation with China, an undisputed leader of the Global South and the world at large. ""The countries of the Global South act independently based on their own interests. They refuse to automatically repeat the decisions of others. They insist on peaceful conflict resolution, equality, and openness in the economy. They also advocate for the participation of all countries in solving global problems, including climate change. This force is already influencing the world order, and its role will only grow. This is a new center of power,"" said Lukashenko, who is visiting China and will participate in the SCO summit.

The Belarusian leader also stated the importance of defending common historical memory, as some forces in the international arena are attempting to distort the truth. ""The Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression is an integral part of Chinese history and an important chapter in the global anti-fascist struggle. China became the main battlefield in the East and paid an exorbitant price in this monstrous war. Both China and Belarus suffered enormous losses in the fight against fascism and militarism. Tens of millions of people died, and many cities and villages were wiped off the face of the earth. In our country, one out of every three people became a victim of the war,"" the president noted.

Lukashenko also emphasized that, given the current extremely difficult international situation, it is crucial to ""speak out loud about the heroism of our peoples and the exorbitant price of freedom."" ""Otherwise, everything could happen again,"" the Belarusian president emphasized.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

TIANJIN, August 31. /TASS/. The Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) summit will kick off in China's northern city of Tianjin on Sunday.

The event will bring together the leaders of over 20 countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.

According to Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Bin, the summit will be the largest event in the organization's history. The diplomat noted that the meeting's participants planned to assess the SCO's activities, set the course for the organizations' further development, and enhance solidarity and consensus on key issues on the international agenda.

Apart from the leaders of SCO member states and some other nations, the summit will also involve the heads of ten international organizations, including United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Secretary General Sergey Lebedev, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretary General Kao Kim Hourn.

Russian Ambassador to China Igor Morgulov pointed out that the SCO did not press anyone to choose sides, nor did it seek to impose its opinions on others; and its activities weren't directed against third countries. According to the Russian envoy, the organization's attractiveness is based on its pursuit of the principles of equality, consensus, mutual trust, balanced interests, mutual benefit, and respect for cultural diversity, as well as on member states' determination to avoid hostile actions against each other. Morgulov highlighted Moscow's readiness to work together with Beijing to strengthen the organization's authority across the world.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry noted that the Tianjin summit would be one of the most important diplomatic events in China in 2025. According to the event's program, Chinese President Xi Jinping will chair a meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of State and an SCO Plus meeting, where he will deliver addresses.

The Chinese leader is expected to clarify Beijing's position on the organizations' further development given the changes that are taking place in the world. In addition, he will speak about new measures aimed at supporting high-quality development and deepening comprehensive cooperation within the SCO, and will also propose additional methods to ensure meaningful cooperation in order to maintain the international order established after World War II and improve the system of global governance.

The Tianjin Declaration is expected to be signed at the summit. The leaders of SCO member states will also approve the 2035 SCO development strategy.

A number of bilateral events are going to take place on the sidelines of the summit. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that the summit's participants would adopt a number of documents on strengthening defense, economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation. They will also consider initiatives aimed at supporting a multilateral trading system, countering extremist ideas, and boosting cooperation in transport, the energy sector, digitalization efforts, green development, artificial intelligence and scientific innovations.

Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Bin emphasized that the SCO's mechanism of cooperation had improved in the years since its foundation, and cooperation between its members had proved highly productive in a number of fields. This is why, in his words, the organization's international influence is steadily growing.

Liu noted that the SCO had turned into an important power in terms of building a new type of international relations based on the principles of equality and justice. The organization's popularity is rising among an increasing number of countries who may become its new members or partners to ""make a positive contribution to the multipolar world order.""

Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Ling Ji stated that the SCO was demonstrating ""a high level of sustainability and viability in terms of regional and economic cooperation,"" pursuing the principles of equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, openness and tolerance. He noted that in 2024, trade between China and SCO members had grown by 2.7%, reaching an all-time high of $512.4 billion.

The official stressed that China also sought to deepen cooperation with the SCO nations through bilateral agreements.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) was founded in the Chinese city of Shanghai on June 15, 2001. The six founding members were Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. India and Pakistan joined the organization in 2017, followed by Iran in 2023 and Belarus in 2024.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","Weight loss drugs can halve heart patients' risk of early death, study finds","https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/aug/31/weight-loss-drugs-can-halve-heart-patients-risk-of-early-death-study-finds","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 14:31:00 GMT","

GLP-1 agonists could be given to millions with heart conditions to help them stay out of hospital and live longer

Weight loss drugs can reduce by half the risk of heart patients being hospitalised or dying early, according to the largest study of its kind.

The class of drugs, known as GLP-1 agonists, have been found to offer “dramatic benefits” to heart patients, significantly cutting their risk of falling seriously ill or dying prematurely from any cause.

The discovery, revealed at the world's largest heart conference in Madrid, means they could be given to millions of heart patients to help them stay out of hospital and live longer.

Weight loss drugs mimic the glucagon-like peptide (GLP) 1 hormone, which makes people feel full, and were initially developed to treat diabetes. In recent years evidence has emerged suggesting they could prove to be lifesaving across a range of conditions beyond obesity.

Now the results of new research presented at the European Society of Cardiology annual conference show weight loss drugs could reduce the risk of people with heart conditions being hospitalised or dying early by as much as 58%.

In the study, US researchers from Mass General Brigham, a nonprofit network of doctors and hospitals headquartered in Boston, analysed real-world data from more than 90,000 heart failure patients who were obese and had type 2 diabetes. All had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), the most common form of the condition.

The results showed that those taking semaglutide were 42% less likely to end up in hospital or die prematurely, compared with a proxy for placebo. In the same study, tirzepatide cut the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or death from any cause by 58%.

Globally, more than 60 million people have heart failure. Previous studies have suggested weight-loss drugs may improve heart failure symptoms, but their effect on important outcomes such as hospitalisation and death has never been evaluated in large populations until now.

The results presented in Madrid were simultaneously published in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.

The study's author Dr Nils Krüger, of Brigham and Women's hospital and a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, said: “Despite the widespread morbidity and mortality burden of HFpEF, current treatment options are limited. Both semaglutide and tirzepatide are well known for their effects on weight loss and blood sugar control, but our study suggests they may also offer substantial benefits to patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes by reducing adverse heart failure outcomes.

“Our findings show that in the future, GLP-1 targeting medications could provide a much-needed treatment option for patients with heart failure.”

The findings add to evidence that weight loss drugs may help tackle or prevent heart conditions. In May, a trial found that people taking semaglutide had a 20% lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death due to cardiovascular disease.

The University College London study also found semaglutide brought about cardiovascular benefits, regardless of someone's starting weight or the amount of weight that they had lost.

Dr Carlos Aguiar, the vice-president of the European Society of Cardiology and a renowned expert in heart failure, who was not involved with the study, welcomed the findings.

“What this shows is that there is a benefit in using one of these two agents, semaglutide or tirzepatide, to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause mortality,” he said.

“We thought that we actually might not really find a treatment that would work well for a significant proportion of these patients, and what's been a good surprise is that these drugs that are working through weight loss, but possibly through other effects that go beyond weight loss, are potentially reducing the rates of hospitalisation and mortality in patients with heart failure.”

Aguiar, a cardiology consultant at Hospital Santa Cruz in Carnaxide, Portugal, said more evidence would be required before doctors could recommend rolling out weight loss drugs to heart patients specifically to cut their risk of adverse health outcomes, but the study results were “good news”.

Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a consultant cardiologist and clinical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: “These data add to the growing body of evidence supporting a role for weight loss drugs for patients living with both heart failure and obesity, to reduce hospital admissions and death.

“It's crucial that eligible heart failure patients have the opportunity to be considered for these therapies, alongside other evidence-based heart failure medicines.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Russian president and his Chinese counterpart shake hands as more than 20 world leaders attend Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin

Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Tianjin, China.

As a reminder (see post at 09.05), the Russian leader will take part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin today and tomorrow.

He is then due to travel to Beijing to hold talks with Xi and possibly North Korean leader Kim Jong-un later on in the week.

The SCO is regional security grouping set up to limit the influence of western alliances such as Nato.

Xi and Putin are close strategic allies. The Chinese leader last visited Putin in May for the Victory Day parade in Moscow, which saw Russian troops fighting in Ukraine marching with Chinese forces to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat in the second world war.

Here's a wrap-up of the day's key events:

Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in the Chinese city of Tianjin for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) security summit, which is aimed at countering western influence in global affairs.

China's President Xi Jinping personally welcomed several leaders to the summit, including Putin, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Xi is expected to hold talks with Putin later on in the week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country's forces are planning new strikes deep into Russia after he met with his top general, Oleksandr Syrsky. Zelenskyy said Moscow's forces are suffering heavy losses around Pokrovsk, the strategically important logistics hub in eastern Ukraine that Russia wants to seize control of.

Senior White House officials have accused some European leaders of prolonging Russia's war in Ukraine by convincing Zelenskyy to hold out for a better deal with Moscow, Axios reported.

Ukraine's armed forces said on Sunday that Russian forces failed to gain full control of any major Ukrainian city over the summer as it hit back at Moscow's claims of a successful summer offensive.

A Ukrainian former parliamentary speaker was shot dead in Lviv on Saturday, authorities said, as European foreign ministers met to discuss increasing pressure on Moscow to end its war against Ukraine.

Andriy Parubiy, a member of parliament who served as parliamentary speaker from 2016 to 2019 and a key figure in Ukraine's 2013 pro-European Maidan revolution, was shot dead, prosecutors said.

A murder investigation has been launched and the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, condemned the killing as a “horrific murder”.

Europe's foreign ministers met in Copenhagen to discuss possible measures to force Moscow to the negotiating table. Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said that Russia was “clearly not preparing for peace”.

“The European Union and all the member states support the diplomatic efforts to achieve peace and the end of Russia's war. But it's clear that Russia is not preparing for peace. It is the opposite: they are preparing for more war,” she said. Ministers also discussed the war in Gaza and the deepening humanitarian crisis there.

Xi and Putin are close strategic allies. The Chinese leader last visited Putin in May for the Victory Day parade in Moscow, which saw Russian troops fighting in Ukraine marching with Chinese forces to mark the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat in the second world war.

Following a meeting with Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country's forces are planning new strikes deep into Russia.

In a post on X, the Ukrainian leader wrote:

We analysed in detail the situation in the Zaporizhzhia direction and the enemy's intentions. Also the situation in the border areas of the Sumy and Kharkiv regions.

We will continue our active operations in exactly the way needed for Ukraine's defence. The forces and resources are prepared. New deep strikes have also been planned.

Russia launched a deadly attack across Ukraine overnight on Saturday when a five-storey residential building was hit in Zaporizhzhia.

In his X post, Zelenskyy said that the Russian army is “concentrating its greatest efforts” in Pokrovsk, a strategically important logistics hub and mining town in eastern Ukraine that was once considered the safest place in the Donbas.

Zelenskyy said Russia is suffering heavy losses in the area, and claimed that, overall, more than 290,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or severely injured in fighting across the frontline since the start of the year.

“The majority of these losses were sustained precisely in the Donetsk region, while failing to achieve any of their strategic objectives,” he wrote.

Zelenskyy recently warned that Russia was massing a force of 100,000 troops near the mining town which Moscow has been trying to capture for more than two years.

The Kremlin said that European powers were hindering US President Donald Trump's efforts to achieve peace in Ukraine and that Russia would continue its operation in Ukraine until Moscow saw signs that Kyiv was ready for peace.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media reporters that the “European party of war” was continuing to hinder US and Russian efforts on Ukraine. “We are ready to resolve the problem by political and diplomatic means,” Peskov said. “But so far we do not see reciprocity from Kyiv in this. So we shall continue the special military operation.”

European powers say that they do not believe Putin wants peace in Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly said he is ready to discuss peace but that Russia will not give up any of the land that it has taken in Ukraine.

The Ukrainian military said that it had struck Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran overnight.

The military recorded multiple explosions and a fire at the Krasnodar oil refinery in Russia's south and said there was also a fire in the Syzran oil refinery area in Samara region.

Russian authorities in Krasnodar said falling drone debris damaged one of the refinery's units.

Russia has downed 112 Ukrainian drones in the past 24 hours and hit port infrastructure in Ukraine used for military purposes, Interfax news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying on Sunday. We will give you more on this as we get it.

At an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Friday, the US warned Russia to move toward some sort of peace settlement and meet with Ukraine or face possible sanctions.

The meeting was called after a major Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday that killed more than 20 people.

John Kelley, the US mission's minister-counselor, said the airstrikes “cast doubt on the seriousness of Russia's desire for peace” and demanded they stop. He said Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy must agree to meet, and reiterated Donald Trump's warning that the US could impose sanctions on Russia if the war continues.

Despite months of diplomatic efforts, Putin has repeatedly ignored Trump's calls to end the fighting. The “America First” Trump administration has not taken any tangible steps to pressure Russia into stopping its attacks, but has paused intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv at various points.

Senior White House officials have accused some European leaders of prolonging Russia's war in Ukraine by convincing Volodymyr Zelenskyy to hold out for a better deal with Moscow, Axios is reporting.

The officials, frustrated by the lack of progress since the Putin-Trump talks in Alaska two weeks ago, said some European leaders are pushing Ukraine to hold out for unrealistic territorial concessions by Russia.

“The Europeans don't get to prolong this war and backdoor unreasonable expectations, while also expecting America to bear the cost,” a senior White House official told Axios.

“If Europe wants to escalate this war, that will be up to them. But they will be hopelessly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.”

Axios did not specify what countries the US officials were referring to but the outlet was told that it was not the UK or France, who set up the “coalition of the willing”, a loose partnership of western countries pledging support for Ukraine.

Donald Trump has indicated he wants a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy, but while the Ukrainian leader has shown his readiness, the Kremlin has held back and intensified attacks on Ukraine despite international diplomatic efforts to bring the war to an end.

The deadly assaults have renewed calls to use Russia's frozen assets in Europe as leverage over Putin.

A Russian drone attack overnight damaged four power facilities near the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, leaving more than 29,000 customers without electricity this morning, the region's governor and power firm DTEK said.

Hardest hit was the port city of Chornomorsk, just outside Odesa, where residential houses and administrative buildings were also damaged, according to Oleh Kiper, the governor of the broader Odesa region. One person was reported to have been injured in the attack. In a Facebook post, the DTEK Group wrote:

The enemy continues its energy terror in the Odessa region. Four DTEK energy facilities were attacked during the night attack.

Russian drones also targeted Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region this morning, damaging energy infrastructure and leaving 30,000 households without electricity, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said.

The Guardian's Russian affairs reporter, Pjotr Sauer, has written a piece about Putin's trip and what it may mean for the war in Ukraine. Here is an extract of his story:

Key on the agenda, analysts say, will be for Putin and Xi to align their positions on the war in Ukraine amid US efforts to end the fighting. “It is an important time for them to talk about where the war is headed and how likely it is to be stopped in the near future,” said Alexander Gabuev, the director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Centre.

Gabuev said Moscow wanted to know whether it could expect any further assistance from China and how Beijing would respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the fighting…

China has emerged as an economic lifeline for Russia during the war in Ukraine, and Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China's direct aiding of Moscow's war effort.

Bilateral trade climbed to more than $240bn last year, two-thirds higher than before the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Beijing is now the leading buyer of Russian oil and coal and will shortly surpass Europe as Moscow's main market for natural gas…

The talks are also likely to touch on deepening military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow, a development that has alarmed western governments.

While China has stopped short of providing direct military aid, US officials say Beijing has supplied about 70% of the machine tools and 90% of the semiconductors Russia needs to rebuild its war machine. In return, China is believed to be receiving assistance in sensitive defence technologies.

China claims it is a neutral mediator in the war in Ukraine, but the two countries have pulled closer together since the start of the invasion.

Vladimir Putin and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi are among the more than 20 world leaders attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, which is being held in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin.

The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus – with 16 more countries affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”. The China and Russia-led regional security grouping is trying to rebalance global power in their favour and away from the US.

Putin, who is wanted for war crimes by the international criminal court, arrived in Tianjin on Sunday to a red carpet welcome and warm greetings from top-ranking city officials.

During his trip, which is expected to stretch to close to a week, the Russian president will hold talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping, his close ally, and watch Beijing's Victory Day military parade marking 80 years since Japan's defeat in the second world war, where Putin is due to be the star guest alongside North Korea's Kim Jong-un and leaders of Iran and Cuba.

Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence pact last year, and North Korea confirmed this April that it had deployed soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine to fight alongside Russian troops.

Putin has turned to Beijing for trade and political support since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched in February 2022. China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.

Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia's war on Ukraine. Ukraine's armed forces said on Sunday that Russian forces failed to gain full control of any major Ukrainian city over the summer.

The chief of Russia's general staff, Valery Gerasimov, said on Saturday that since March Russia had captured more than 3,500 square km (1,351 square miles) of territory in Ukraine and taken control of 149 villages.

“Despite Gerasimov's claims, Russian forces have not gained full control over any major city,” the general staff of Ukraine's armed forces said. “The figures presented by the occupiers regarding captured territories and settlements are grossly exaggerated.”

We have not yet been able to independently verify any of these claims. Ukraine acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that Russia's army had entered the Dnipropetrovsk region, a central administrative area previously spared from intense fighting.

Russian forces have slowly gained ground in costly battles for largely devastated areas in eastern and southern Ukraine, normally with few inhabitants or intact buildings left.

Russia launched a sweeping attack across Ukraine overnight on Saturday, with one person killed and 24 injured, including three children, when a five-storey residential building was hit in Zaporizhzhia, according to officials.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling for “tougher” western sanctions on Russia as he says Vladimir Putin's attacks shows he is not at all interested in trying to pursue peace.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson joins gathering in Canberra while far-right figure speaks outside state parliament in Melbourne

A neo-Nazi was among speakers to address the crowd at a tense anti-immigration protest in Melbourne, as similar demonstrations under the banner March for Australia took place in state and territory capitals across the country on Sunday.

While the protests were condemned as hateful by the federal government, some politicians attended, including the One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, and party member Senator Malcolm Roberts in Canberra and the federal MP Bob Katter in Townsville.

The marches were promoted by neo-Nazis, as well as anti-lockdown figures who gained prominence during the pandemic, and other fringe groups but no group publicly claimed responsibility for organising the protests.

In Melbourne protesters gathered outside Flinders Street station with many carrying Australian flags, along with placards bearing anti-immigration slogans.

A counter-protest also assembled in front of the State Library of Victoria, with the weekly pro-Palestine rally merging with an antifascist counter-demonstration to protest against the March for Australia.

Victoria police blocked off Flinders and Swanston streets to the north of the intersection, in an apparent attempt to keep two rallies apart, but they eventually met at the corner of Collins and Elizabeth streets with a barrier of police between them, three rows deep, including officers on horseback.

A volatile verbal confrontation ensued, with a bottle thrown from the anti-immigration protest smashing at the feet of the antifascist demonstrators, and an open can of beer flying over the police line towards the anti-immigration march.

The antifascist demonstrators were then pushed back by police in riot gear, who pepper-sprayed approximately a dozen protesters at the front of the crowd.

The anti-immigration rally eventually reached state parliament, where protesters were addressed by speakers, including the neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell, who gave a speech claiming “his men” had led the march, and saying: “If we do not stop immigration, then our death is certain.”

A man with a microphone whom Guardian Australia could not identify told the crowd: “Australians are sick and tired of the rising tide of mass immigration in this country”. He led a chant of “Albo must go”, followed by “Aussie Aussie Aussie”, which the crowd bellowed in unison.

The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, had earlier condemned those who “walk with Nazis” and expressed concern about the anti-immigration protest while attending a multicultural gala on Saturday night.

“No one who has ever tried to divide this country has ever succeeded,” she said. “Because the promise of multiculturalism is so much stronger.”

In a statement, Victoria police said six people were arrested on charges including assault police, behave in a riotous manner, attempted robbery, assault, and resist police. They said two officers were injured after being struck by bottles thrown at them, but did not require hospitalisation.

Police said they estimated 5,000 people participated in the Melbourne rally and counter-protest.

“Officers were required to form many lines between the different groups to protect the safety of all involved, prevent breaches of the peace and prevent physical violence,” the statement said.

“Police also had to use a range of tactical options including OC spray, baton rounds and public order munitions to prevent violence between protestors, some of whom were intent on creating conflict and violence.

“There is absolutely no place for any of this violent and disruptive behaviour in Victoria and the priority for police was to separate opposing groups and prevent breaches of the peace.”

In Sydney, New South Wales police deployed hundreds of officers at the annual marathon, a weekly pro-Palestine rally and the anti-immigration march, all in different parts of the city.

In Canberra a crowd of what appeared to be a few hundred gathered and chanted on the edge of Lake Burley Griffin with a view of Parliament House across the lake, waving Australian flags and wearing them as capes.

Hanson and Roberts were in attendance;Roberts was seen speaking with a microphone.

A smaller counter-rally of counter-protesters were kept separated across a road by police, with officers forming a perimeter to keep the groups apart.

In Brisbane, police reported little trouble as a group of a few thousand flag-draped protesters played Redgum on the march between the Roma Street parklands and the city botanical gardens.

They were confronted briefly at Roma Street by a group of a counter-protesters. One video shows Uncle Wayne Wharton, a Brisbane First Nations activist, telling protesters: “You invaded this country, you stole the land.”

Some protesters in both Brisbane and Adelaide were seen expressing solidarity with alleged Porepunkah police killer Dezi Freeman.

In Brisbane a woman repeatedly yelled “I stand with Dezi” as police walked by. She was holding a sign that said “I identify as sovereign”.

In Adelaide a man held a placard with an image of the fugitive at the march from Rundle Park.

It came after Freeman's wife, Amalia Freeman, released a statement on Sunday pleading with her husband to surrender to police and expressing “deep sorrow” over the fatal shooting of two officers on Tuesday.

South Australia police said the estimated crowds of 15,000 people were generally well-behaved, however there were three arrests.

Ahead of the March for Australia rallies, federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, released a video on social media on Saturday evening saying: “There is no place for violence, racism or intimidation. Whether incited from afar or stirred up here, we cannot let hatred and fear tear at our social cohesion.”

The federal Labor minister Murray Watt denounced the march on Sunday morning, telling Sky News: “We absolutely condemn the March for Australia rally that's going on today; it's not about increasing social harmony.

“We don't support rallies like this that are about spreading hate and that are about dividing our community.”

The shadow attorney general, Julian Leeser, told the ABC's Insiders program on Sunday morning that he believed there would be people there “of goodwill who want to change policies” but warned them to be careful of the company they keep.

“I've seen some of the material for that particular protest and I'm really concerned about the anti-Indian sentiment that is being expressed and some of the antisemitic undertones of some of those protests,” he said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin on Aug. 31 to attend a major regional security summit, Chinese and Russian state media reported. The four-day visit, a rare trip abroad for Putin, underscores Beijing and Moscow's efforts to counter Western influence in global affairs.

Footage from Russia's TASS news agency showed Putin stepping onto a red carpet and being welcomed on the tarmac by senior city officials. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV described China-Russia relations as at their ""best in history,"" calling them ""the most stable, mature and strategically significant among major countries.""

China has become a crucial economic lifeline for Russia during its war against Ukraine, while Kyiv has grown more vocal in accusing Beijing of directly supporting Moscow's war effort.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will host about 20 world leaders at the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

The SCO, founded in 2001 by six Eurasian nations, has since expanded to 10 permanent members along with 16 observer and dialogue partners. Its scope has broadened from security and counter-terrorism to include economic and military cooperation.

Xi is expected to use the gathering to promote a vision of a post-U.S.-led international order, while providing a diplomatic boost to Russia as it faces isolation and sweeping sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine.

Ahead of the trip, Putin told China's Xinhua news agency that Moscow and Beijing oppose ""discriminatory"" sanctions in global trade. Russia's economy remains under heavy strain from Western restrictions and the costs of its war in Ukraine, with economists warning of a looming recession.

Leaders from across Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast Asia are also set to attend the summit. Beijing has billed the event as a show of solidarity among the ""Global South,"" seeking to highlight cooperation between developing and lower-income nations.

The Trump administration will axe 532 jobs at Voice of America (VOA) and the agency that oversees it, it was announced on Aug. 30.

Kari Lake, acting CEO of the Agency for Global Media (USAGM), said on a post on social media that the move will ""to help reduce the federal bureaucracy, improve agency service, and save the American people more of their hard-earned money.""

But the move is just the latest in a long-running battle between VOA, an outlet that U.S. President Donald Trump has accused of being ""radical.""

VOA was established during World War 2 in an effort to counter Nazi propaganda.

In February, the outlet employed approximately 1,300 staff. Since then, programming has been slashed, with broadcasts now limited to just four languages.

The latest layoffs will leave VOA with just 108 staff members.

The decision to dismantle VOA has met legal challenges.

On April 22, a U.S. federal judge ordered the administration to reinstate all employees and contractors, ruling that the mass dismissal likely violated U.S. law. However, a federal appeals court overturned that order, allowing the layoffs to proceed.

The Trump administration temporarily reinstated several staff members from VOA's Persian-language service amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. But at least two of those individuals also received layoff notices on June 20, according to the NYT.

Trump has long criticized U.S.-funded media organizations, criticizing them over their coverage of the U.S. president, and often referring to them as ""fake news.""

In total, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people across the world and employed thousands of employees across the United States, Cuba, Europe, and Asia.

The Trump administration has previously cut thousands of federally-funded positions, with the cuts directly impacting support for Ukraine. 

In February, the Trump administration terminated the employment of top officials from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) after they attempted to prevent representatives from Elon Musk's DOGE from accessing restricted areas.

Russia's Rosneft net income has fallen more than 68% to 245 billion roubles ($3 billion) in the first half of the year due to weak oil prices, Reuters reported on Aug. 30, citing industry sources.

Oil prices were dragged down by production hikes by Saudi Arabia and other states of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+).

The head of Russia's largest oil producer, Igor Sechin, said that production cuts by the group led to a rise in output by the U.S., which has become the world's leading oil producer.

""The first half of the year was characterized by a decline in oil prices, primarily due to overproduction of oil. The main reason is the active increase in production by OPEC countries, including Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Iraq, Kuwait,"" Sechin said on Aug. 30.

Industry sources told Reuters that Russia expressed concern at the OPEC+ meetings about faster-than-expected output increases, but Russia ultimately supported it.

OPEC has been cutting production for several years to support global oil prices.

After calls from U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this year, the cartel upped production in an effort to regain some of its former market share.

Russia revised its August crude oil export plans from ports in the west of the country, increasing them by 200,000 barrels per day compared to the initial schedule.

This came amid ongoing Ukrainian attacks on Russian oil infrastructure. According to Reuters calculations, Ukraine struck 10 refineries throughout August, shutting down facilities representing 17% of national processing capacity, or 1.1 million barrels per day.

The paralyzed refineries freed up additional crude oil volumes for export.

According to the outlet, total loadings from Primorsk, Novorossiysk, and Ust-Luga are expected to reach 2 million barrels per day, up from the planned 1.8 million.

Russian oil companies have yet to receive final loading plans for September, though typically the schedule is finalized a week before the start of the month.

Plans to redevelop Jeffrey Epstein's private island into a luxury tourist resort appear to have been quietly pushed back.

Stephen Deckoff, a private-equity billionaire, bought two islands from the late paedophile's estate two years ago for the purpose of building a “state-of-the-art” holiday destination by 2025.

However, the US Virgin Islands government said it had not received any planning applications for development and locals have been baffled by the lack of construction work since the announcement.

Satellite images show both islands, Little St James and its neighbour Great St James, have barely changed since Epstein died in prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking.

Little St James, a tropical Caribbean beauty spot which Epstein referred to as “Little St Jeff's”, became notorious as the site where the paedophile would traffic, imprison and abuse his underage victims.

Mr Deckoff, whose net worth is valued at almost $3bn by Forbes, announced he had acquired both islands in May 2023 through one of his firms, SD Investments.

A press release stated: “Mr Deckoff plans to develop a state-of-the-art, five-star, world-class luxury 25-room resort that will help bolster tourism, create jobs, and spur economic development in the region, while respecting and preserving the important environment of the islands.”

It did not clarify which of Epstein's islands would host the new tourist destination.

According to the release, the billionaire has made a career turning “distressed situations into successful enterprises”, and would work with the Virgin Islands government to “make this dream a reality”.

“Mr Deckoff is in the process of retaining architects and engineers to develop the resort on the islands, which is anticipated to open in 2025,” it added.

However, a spokesman for the Virgin Islands government told The Telegraph building new structures or altering existing ones would require Mr Deckoff to submit planning applications.

No such plans have been submitted for either Little St James or Great St James, he said.

Tour companies based around the Virgin Islands said they had not seen any evidence of construction work going ahead on the islands.

“Nothing has really happened on either one of those islands. We haven't seen anything going up at all,” said one individual who operates a boat charter company.

Another tour guide who works around Little and Great St James said: “I have not seen anything and I'm out and about… that's my little area.”

Satellite images of the island taken between 2019 and 2025 show a couple of structures have been erected on the north face of Little St James, but on a far more modest scale than the proposed tourist development.

Monika Kuffer, a specialist in satellite mapping at the University of Twente in the Netherlands, noted that one small structure had been built on the beach, while another stretches out to sea near a dock.

What appears to be a reservoir, likely the only source of freshwater for the island's inhabitants, has also been filled up after almost running dry six years ago.

It is unclear whether those developments are intended for Mr Deckoff's personal use, or if they were made with the intention of going ahead with the tourist site at a later date.

Aerial photographs of Epstein's compound – a turquoise-roofed mansion designed by architect Edward Tuttle – swimming pools, guest villas and helipad, do not show any changes since 2019.

Mr Deckoff reportedly bought the islands for $60m after they failed to attract a buyer when they were put on the market a year before for $12m.

Epstein's island has become synonymous with his abuses and is widely nicknamed “paedophile island”. Prominent public figures have taken pains to distance themselves from it and denied visiting it.

According to a lawsuit brought by the Virgin Islands against Epstein's estate in 2020, Little St James was “the perfect hideaway and haven for trafficking young women and underage girls for sexual servitude, child abuse and sexual assault”.

Among those who allegedly trafficked to the location was a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, who labelled it “orgy island” and said she was sexually assaulted there by the Duke of York, a former associate of Epstein's.

Prince Andrew has consistently denied the allegation and said he never visited Little St James.

Donald Trump, the US president, faced the biggest crisis of his second term last month as his own supporters turned on him for refusing to release the “Epstein files” – documents held by the US government on the financier.

Mr Trump, who was friends with Epstein for around 15 years until the mid-2000s, said in July he “never had the privilege” of visiting his former associate's island because he turned down an invitation.

He has claimed without evidence that Bill Clinton travelled to Little St James “28 times”, which the former president has denied.

In an interview with federal authorities in July, released on Friday, Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, said Mr Clinton never visited the island.

Representatives for Mr Deckoff declined to comment.

Tribal leaders and environmental advocates warn salmon populations will go extinct without remediation efforts.

Time is running out for wild salmon in the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest. Their populations, as well as those of some other native fish, have been declining for decades. Now, President Donald Trump is attacking the progress that had been made to restore those once-abundant salmon runs. 

In June 2025, Trump signed a memorandum signaling his administration's unwillingness to consider dam removal on the lower Snake River, a tributary of the Columbia River, and reneging on a landmark agreement that would have provided more than a billion dollars over the next decade to Pacific Northwest tribes for renewable energy projects and salmon recovery.

The federal government entered into the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement under the Biden administration in December 2023 after two years of negotiations. Other parties to the agreement include environmental advocates; Oregon; Washington; and the Umatilla, Nez Perce, Warm Springs, and Yakama tribes. Those tribes entered into treaties with the U.S. government in the mid-1850s, ceding land but maintaining a perpetual right to their fishing grounds in the Columbia River Basin. The government has failed to ensure the tribal fishing rights it promised to protect in those treaties.

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Yakama Nation Tribal Council Chair Gerald Lewis said in a statement that the Trump administration's withdrawal “echoes the federal government's historic pattern of broken promises to tribes.” Still, others who were involved in negotiations to secure that agreement have vowed to continue efforts to restore salmon populations and fulfill treaty obligations even as the federal government seeks to undermine them.

“The Trump administration's decision to pull out of this agreement is short-sighted and regrettable,” Miles Johnson, legal director at Columbia Riverkeeper, told Truthout. “But folks in the Pacific Northwest who care about salmon, and salmon cultures and our rivers, we don't get to stop working on this just because it becomes more challenging.”

Dozens of hydroelectric dams built beginning almost a century ago on the Columbia River and its largest tributary, the Snake River, eliminated spawning grounds, blocked fish passage between spawning and rearing habitats, and altered river ecology in ways that can impair a salmon's immune system or undermine their natural migration instincts. More recently, climate change has placed additional stress on salmon populations.

Experts now agree that dam removal is essential to stop the decline of native fish populations. 

The dams in the Columbia River Basin have been disastrous for fish populations: The number of wild Chinook salmon on the Snake River fell from about 90,000 in the mid-1950s, when there was just one dam on the waterway, to a mere 10,000 in 1980, seven additional dams later. Four species of salmon in the Columbia River Basin have been listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act since 1991.

Congress acknowledged that wild salmon populations in the Columbia River Basin were dwindling and committed to funding hatcheries meant to stop their decline more than 80 years ago. But the facilities have fallen short of that goal. Today, even the hatcheries are threatened, as salmon survival rates have dropped so low that some struggle to collect enough fish for breeding.

“The truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now,” Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, said in a June 2025 statement in response to the Trump administration's withdrawal from the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement. 

Experts now agree that dam removal is essential to stop the decline of native fish populations. One proposal, in particular, which argues for the removal of four dams on the lower Snake River in southeastern Washington, has garnered widespread support from scientists and advocates, as well as other tribal leaders. “We've learned over the last 30 to 40 years of studying these fish intensely that those four dams on the lower Snake River are four dams too many,” Johnson told Truthout.

The Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement stopped short of calling for the removal of those dams, but it committed to meaningful steps in that direction. The agreement promised funding to study and develop solutions to mitigate the effects of dam breaching on transportation, recreation, irrigation and energy production in the region. It also committed funding to tribal-led alternative energy projects, which could have compensated for the eventual winddown of the hydroelectric dams.

“The concepts behind that agreement remain a really responsible, well-thought-out and careful path that sought to ensure a win-win scenario for all the different constituencies that depend on a healthy Columbia River,” Michael Garrity, special assistant at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), told Truthout.

Even though the agreement takes what Garrity and other experts characterize as a measured approach, Trump called it “radical environmentalism” in an effort to slander it and labeled concerns about climate change “misplaced” in his memorandum.

Critical funding will be lost with the Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the agreement. This includes $500 million to improve underfunded and aging hatcheries across the Pacific Northwest and $100 million for wild fish restoration efforts. Much of the promised federal funding would have been disbursed via the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), a federal agency that operates like a business, marketing power from dams on the Columbia River.

“The NGOs, states, and tribes are not going to quit on this issue.”

Still, many aspects of the agreement will move forward in some form thanks to continued buy-in from state and tribal governments and the committed backing of environmental advocates. “The partnership between our four tribes and the states of Oregon and Washington endures,” said Jeremy Takala, chair of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and a tribal councilman of the Yakama Nation, in a statement. “We are still united in the cause of protecting salmon and rivers.”

Amanda Goodin, an attorney at Earthjustice representing the environmental advocates that signed the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, echoed Takala. “The NGOs, states, and tribes are not going to quit on this issue,” she told Truthout. “We're going to be looking for other avenues for the next few years and waiting for the moment that we have a federal administration that actually cares about our natural heritage, obligations to tribes, and following the law, and we'll be ready when that time comes.”

Those other avenues are almost sure to include legal battles over the impact of hydroelectric dams on salmon in the Columbia River Basin. Litigation had been ongoing for decades before it was halted as part of the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement. Federal agencies have lost in court in previous cases. Even John Hairston, administrator and CEO of BPA, welcomed the agreement when it was signed, saying it would help provide “a reliable, affordable power supply to the Pacific Northwest” and put an end to “costly, unpredictable litigation.” Now, Goodin told Truthout, “It's likely we're going to see continued litigation.”

Earthjustice is also advocating for Columbia River Basin fish in Congress, where a series of bills have been introduced that could further undermine plans laid out in the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement. “Those bills are not just salmon extinction bills, they're also anti-solution bills,” Cameron Walkup, an associate legal representative working for Earthjustice in Washington, D.C., told Truthoutof the Northwest Energy Security Act, the Defending Our Dams Act, and the Protecting Our Water Energy Resources Act. “These bills would essentially double down on what the president did in June in terms of trying to turn back the clock on progress toward comprehensive solutions for salmon recovery, and also dealing with interconnected issues like making sure we have reliable and affordable energy.”

Columbia Riverkeeper, Earthjustice, and NGO partners are engaged in organizing sign-on campaigns to demonstrate support for dam removal and oppose the harmful bills introduced in Congress. Walkup also told Truthout that his organization is prepared to engage with members of Congress if it appears the bills could garner enough support to come to a hearing. “We're certainly doing everything we can to uplift all the issues with these bills to make sure that if Republicans do choose to make this part of their agenda, that they're fully opposed by the Democrats and don't make it through Congress,” he told Truthout.

For their part, Washington's state agencies responsible for studying the effects of dam breaching on the lower Snake River are continuing that work even as federal partners have withdrawn. “WDFW, working with the governor's office, is committed to finding a path forward to restore healthy and abundant salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin in a way that respects and addresses the non-salmon benefits of the river,” Garrity told Truthout.

Johnson of Columbia Riverkeeper said his message to those who are concerned about the Trump administration's decision to renege on the historic Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement is simple: “We absolutely need our representatives to understand how much people care about salmon and steelhead and having enough fish in our rivers that people can go fishing, we can meet our obligations to tribes and protect tribal cultures,” he told Truthout. “That starts with individuals, businesses, leaders and anyone else making their voices heard. It's critical to build a groundswell of support.”

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem waived the Endangered Species Act and several other statutes to permit the plan.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

The Department of Homeland Security announced on Tuesday that Secretary Kristi Noem has waived the protections of the Endangered Species Act and other federal statutes to “ensure the expeditious construction” of the border wall through the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge in Texas.

Funds were appropriated for border wall construction in the Rio Grande Valley during the first Trump administration. Now, the administration is eyeing this biodiverse area in Starr County for its next stage of border fortification.

By the time the refuge was established in 1979, the Rio Grande Valley had already lost most of its native habitat. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service pieced together property to protect biodiversity and create a wildlife corridor along the Rio Grande.

Endangered ocelots are being reintroduced in the scrub thorn landscape of Starr County. Other notable species in the area include green jays and the chachalaca, a tropical bird known for its distinctive call. 

Following Noem's waivers, the federal government will no longer have to follow the National Environmental Protection Act, the Clean Water Act, the Migratory Bird Conservation Act and other seminal federal laws to construct the border wall on 13 tracts in the national wildlife refuge. 

The Secure Fence Act of 2006 granted the Department of Homeland Security the authority to waive federal laws to expedite border wall construction. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have used these waivers. In June, DHS issued waivers for 36 miles of border wall construction in Arizona and New Mexico.

Conservation advocates said that there is no national security justification for building a wall through the national wildlife refuge. They warn that the wall will threaten wildlife and cut off communities from the Rio Grande.

“The government owns this land for the sake of conservation,” said Laiken Jordahl, a Southwest conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity. “But this administration is willing to pick those places to be the first to destroy. It's just incredibly cruel.”

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for further comment. In addition to environmental laws, the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act, the National Trails System Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act will be waived.

Congress appropriated funds for the border wall in the Rio Grande Valley in 2019. Now the second Trump administration is picking up where it left off, targeting federal land in the wildlife refuge for border wall construction to avoid the lengthy process encountered by the first Trump administration for condemning private property in the Rio Grande Valley.

Many landowners have fought back, significantly slowing down construction. Texas is also building its own border wall but has made little progress. The Department of Homeland Security under President Joe Biden invoked waivers to continue construction in Starr County in 2023. 

Noem authorized the waivers in the Federal Register, stating that the Rio Grande Valley is “an area of high illegal entry.” The order states that between fiscal years 2021 and 2025, over 1.5 million undocumented immigrants were apprehended in Custom and Border Protection's Rio Grande Valley sector.

“Since the President took office, DHS has delivered the most secure border in history,” the order states. “More can and must be done.”

The authorization does not reference any specific information about apprehensions in the national wildlife refuge tracts. The number of migrant apprehensions has plummeted since Trump took office. CBP reported fewer than 1,000 monthly migrant encounters in the Rio Grande Valley sector in June and July this year. The sector spans more than 34,000 square miles.

“There is no possible way that someone could argue that there is an emergency at the border that necessitates waiving our nation's most important environmental laws,” CBD's Jordahl said.

Scott Nicol, an artist and activist in the Rio Grande Valley, said that the Trump administration is targeting federal lands for border wall construction because it's “easier” than seizing private property.

“If you're tasked with doing this tremendously environmentally destructive project, the waivers make it easy,” Nicol said. “The big thing slowing them down is they can't waive property rights so they have to go through condemnation.”

Nicol said he has spent significant time in the parts of the wildlife refuge targeted for the wall and has rarely seen border crossers or Border Patrol agents. He said that border wall construction is a “spectacle” and that there is no “particular tactical reason” to target the national wildlife refuge.

The area targeted for construction falls within the Rio Grande floodplain. A 1970 treaty between the U.S. and Mexico commits both countries to ensuring that construction along the Rio Grande does not obstruct the river or the flow of flood waters. Mexican agencies have previously objected to border wall plans under the treaty terms.

Nicol was dubious that U.S. federal agencies would adequately integrate flood risks into their construction plans.

“They're not going to worry about it until they have a big flood,” he said.

The International Boundary and Water Commission reviews construction along the border, including flood risk.

“The IBWC fully supports President Trump's and DHS actions to secure the border for all Americans,” said spokesperson Frank Fisher. “IBWC and DHS have an excellent cooperative relationship that allows the IBWC to carry out all its responsibilities.”

            The Israeli security cabinet convened on Sunday to review plans for seizing control of Gaza City, as the government faces mounting international pressure and unprecedented domestic opposition, even from Israel's own security leaders.
    


            The review is merely a formal update for the full security cabinet, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz already approved the IDF's plans earlier this month. But it comes as Israel faces a crucial few weeks at home and abroad.
    


            Alongside the planned military escalation, Netanyahu and the cabinet – made up of senior officials including Katz and far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir - are expected to discuss a diplomatic offensive in response to the anticipated wave of recognition for Palestinian statehood at next month's UN General Assembly.



            Netanyahu is considering measures ranging from full annexation of the West Bank, to partial annexation of selected settlements, to sanctioning the Palestinian Authority, according to two Israeli officials.
    


            Annexing any part of the occupied West Bank by applying Israeli sovereignty would violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions and spark an enormous diplomatic backlash. But it's exactly what Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners are demanding.
    


            As it considers what steps to take in the West Bank, the Israeli government is pushing forward with the military assault on Gaza City despite growing pressue to pursue a diplomatic route would end the nearly two-year war.
    


            The Israeli military carried out intense strikes in and around Gaza City in recent days as it prepares to take over and occupy the city itself.
    


            At least 47 people were killed in Gaza City alone on Saturday, according to Gaza hospital figures. An additional 24 people were killed in Gaza City since Sunday morning, figures showed.
    


            Hamas continues to have a presence in Gaza despite nearly two years of fighting and  one of the latest Israel attacks killed Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida, Katz said.
    


            “Soon, as the campaign in Gaza intensifies, many more of his partners in crime - the murderers and rapists of Hamas - will join him there,” he added.
    


            The attacks also come amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in the battered enclave, as the Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday that another seven people died of malnutrition, bringing the total deaths from malnutrition to 339.
    


            The most significant opposition to Israel's takeover of Gaza City is the country's security establishment, led by IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir, who has warned Netanyahu and his cabinet that the Gaza City offensive will endanger the remaining hostages, risk soldiers' lives, and deepen the humanitarian crisis in the enclave.
    


            Two Israeli sources told CNN that Zamir's main concern and focus is the fate of the hostages, and he is expected to urge the cabinet to discuss negotiations on the latest ceasefire proposal before escalating the war. The sources said this position is endorsed by most of the heads of other security agencies, as well.
    


            Earlier this month Hamas accepted the Qatari and Egyptian mediators most recent offer for a 60-day temporary ceasefire, during which 10 of the living hostages would be returned in exchange for a mass release of Palestinian prisoners. The offer is based on a similar proposal presented by the US special envoy Steve Witkoff in July, originally crafted in coordination with Israel.

            However, Netanyahu, in coordination with the White House, has recently shifted strategy. After months of insisting on negotiating only phased and partial frameworks, he now says he is willing to discuss only a comprehensive deal that would release all of the hostages and end the war on Israeli terms and conditions.
    


            As a result, Israel still hasn't responded to Hamas's acceptance of the Qatari-Egyptian proposal on August 18.
    


            According to two senior Israeli officials, Netanyahu does not intend to raise the negotiations in Sunday's cabinet meeting as well, though the issue may come up during the presentation on Gaza City. The fact that the deal isn't formally on the agenda indicates how low the proposal is on Netanyahu's priority list.

            As President Donald Trump openly contemplates sending military forces into more American cities, the leading congressional Democrats almost invariably describe his actions as an attempt to create a “distraction” from something else — whether that's the cost of living, the massive Medicaid cuts he signed into law, or the controversy around the Jeffrey Epstein files.
    


            That reflex captures the overwhelming preference of top DC Democrats to frame the 2026 election on familiar partisan grounds, particularly the charge that Trump has failed in his core 2024 promise to bring down the cost of living for average families. It also reflects their hesitation about contesting Trump's actions relating to immigration and crime.
    


            But the tendency of Democratic congressional leaders like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries to dismiss Trump's moves threatening democracy as a “distraction” from other issues has created the most significant fissure between the party's grassroots and its Washington leadership.
    


            That one word now divides the principal competing theories of how Democrats should respond to Trump's militant second term.
    


            While the Democratic congressional leadership believes that focusing on the economy gives the party its best chance of gaining ground in next year's midterm elections, many party activists argue they are failing to convey the urgency of the sweeping actions Trump has taken to erode American democracy.
    


            The party's top political strategists are equally split. Some believe that Trump's 2024 victory demonstrated the necessity of remaining “laser-focused” on average families' economic struggles, while others are just as certain that soft-pedaling Trump's moves to shatter democratic safeguards — especially his domestic deployment of the military — is a moral as well as an electoral failure. Far from a distraction, the latter group argues, Trump's efforts to raze democratic safeguards, crush opposition and entrench his hold on power constitute the central goal of his second term — and the greatest threat facing the country.
    


            Describing Trump's actions as “a distraction” is “absolutely wrong,” said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster. “I think it misses completely where Democrats are at.”
    


If party leaders maintain that course, in 2026 Democratic candidates “would have turnout problems that would make the turnout problems of ‘24 look like child's play,” Lake said. “They don't understand that it is the central ballgame, the central point — that we are under a fascist dictatorship for billionaires. They are completely out of touch with the base.”
    


            Other leading Democrats maintain that the party can only slow down Trump by winning back the House next year — and that focusing mostly on the economy offers the best chance of doing that. “Based on my research with these voters that we lost and we have to make up ground with … it's the economy, it's the economy, it's the economy,” said Democratic pollster Ben Tulchin. Democrats in this camp see the special election victory last week of an Iowa Democratic state Senate candidate who ran on a message of affordability in a deep red-district as evidence they're right.
    


            By describing Trump's actions as a “distraction,” the congressional leaders may be engaging in a form of projection. They clearly see time spent focusing on those moves as a distraction from their own desire to center the 2026 campaigns on the argument that Trump's agenda has favored the rich at the expense of average families, couched in language that Chris Matthews could have written for Tip O'Neill to use against Ronald Reagan.
    


            When Schumer and Jeffries have discussed Trump's deployment of military forces to Los Angeles and Washington, DC, they have denounced it. In June, Schumer called Trump's dispatch of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles “a dangerous authoritarian overreach that threatens the very fabric of our democracy.” When Trump sent the Guard into Washington and seized control of the city's police department, Jeffries described it as “nothing more than an illegitimate power grab.”
    


            But both men have also repeatedly signaled — using that flashpoint word — that they don't want to dwell on these issues. After the deployment to Washington, Schumer told one podcast host that Trump's action were a distraction, “plain and simple.”
    


“What's he trying to distract from?” Schumer continued. “Well, a lot of things. But above all, Epstein.”
    


            Jeffries last week used a similar formulation but pointed to a different target. Trump, with his troop deployments, is trying “to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” He added,  “The one big ugly bill is deeply unpopular.”
    


            This approach has deeply frustrated those Democrats who believe that it shows these leaders consider Trump's assaults on democratic institutions less important than whatever they say he's diverting attention from. “You're dismissing (Trump's troop deployments), and you are dismissing all of the people who are horrified by it, and all of the people who are living under this level of oppression,” said Lake.
    


            The conflict over the word “distraction” is, of course, a proxy for the much larger debate over which messages Democrats should emphasize as they work to rebuild the party's tattered image and shape their campaigns for 2026. Democrats have been compulsively picking at that scab since the 2024 election, when many across the party felt that Vice President Kamala Harris failed to articulate a convincing economic message and relied too much on warnings about democracy.
    


            To a striking extent, this divide does not track the party's familiar tensions between progressive and centrist elements.
    


            Tulchin, for instance, was the pollster for Sen. Bernie Sanders' insurgent presidential campaigns in 2016 and 2020. But while he is outraged by many of Trump's actions, he believes the party's congressional leaders are correct to prioritize economic concerns. “If you have one thing to say, hammer Trump on the economy,” Tulchin said. “Ultimately it's going to be the most effective thing we do through next November.”
    


            Longtime Democratic communications consultant Jesse Ferguson was on the other side of the 2016 presidential race as a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton. But he agrees that Democrats should emphasize the economy rather than Trump's authoritarian actions. “He doesn't want the country debating the economy, inflation,” or the GOP's cuts to Medicaid,   Ferguson said. “He wants us locked in a fight over this instead.”
    


            Anat Shenker-Osorio, a leading progressive message consultant, believes this argument is flawed on many levels. The biggest problem, she said, is that party leaders are unlikely to reach the public in today's media cacophony by repeating the familiar economic arguments that Democrats have long leveled against Republicans. “They may agree with it,” she said, “but they are never going to hear it, and they are not going to repeat to their neighbors.”
    


            Moreover, Shenker-Osorio said, the choice to avoid consistent confrontation over Trump's anti-democratic actions is compounding the party's biggest problem: the perception that it is weak and cannot effectively advance its goals. “When you are not even willing to admit we are in a fight against fascism, not a fight against inflation … how are people going to believe you are going to be their champion on any dimension, including the economic one?” she said.
    


            Sean Clegg, a senior strategist for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, has generally argued for moving the party in a more centrist direction. But on this he agrees with Shenker-Osorio. “In our party we have so many armchair generals who love to spout the conventional wisdom about ‘only fighting on our terrain,'” Clegg said. “That's not really how war works.  You don't always get to pick your ground.  Sometimes you have to stand and fight.”
    


            Democratic congressional leaders may be especially hesitant about opposing Trump's National Guard deployments because of their links to immigration and crime, two of his strongest issues in polls. In a recent memo, the Democratic consulting firm Blue Rose Research argued that the party should quickly “pivot” away from the troop deployments back toward tariffs and the Medicaid cuts. Partly, they maintained, that was because Trump's claim that he was “restoring order” proved “highly persuasive” to voters.
    


            Brad Todd, a Republican strategist and CNN commentator, says Democratic congressional leaders are correct to resist a full-scale confrontation over Trump's domestic troop deployments. “I think they rightly understand that fighting Trump on crime and immigration is picking ground he's going to beat you on,” Todd said. “And part of that is because Democrats got themselves way out of position in 2020 and the four years of the Joe Biden administration, and voters do not trust them on those two issues.”
    


            Still, several recent polls have found that more Americans oppose than support Trump's DC deployment (though another also found most say it's acceptable for the National Guard to “assist” local police). And Clegg noted that support for Trump's handling of internal immigration enforcement — as opposed to securing the border — has dropped since Newsom and others confronted the president over his Los Angeles offensive.
    


            Newsom has emphasized that Trump is not floating troop deployments into red-state cities with higher crime and murder rates than Washington. “If the president is sincere about the issue of crime and violence, there's no question in my mind that he'll likely be sending the troops into Louisiana and Mississippi to address the just unconscionable wave of violence that continues to plague those states,” Newsom said at a news conference on Thursday.
    


            With their reticence, the congressional Democratic leaders have left a huge vacuum in the party. Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Newsom, a pair of potential 2028 presidential candidates, have most effectively filled that space.
    


            Pritzker has been unsparing in denouncing Trump as a “wannabe dictator,” as he put in a fiery news conference last week decrying the president's threats to deploy the National Guard to Chicago. Surrounded by local business, religious and civic leaders, Pritzker struck a conspicuously more urgent tone than the party's Congressional leadership. “If it sounds to you like I am alarmist, that is because I am ringing an alarm,” Pritzker insisted, before describing the prospect of troops on Chicago streets as “unprecedented, unwarranted, illegal, unconstitutional, un-American.”
    


            Newsom has attracted even more attention among Democrats by resisting Trump actions he's portrayed as a threat to democracy through over three dozen lawsuits; speeches; mocking social media posts; and his ballot initiative to offset the Texas Republican gerrymander.
    


Tellingly, on the day Trump sent the National Guard into Washington, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi posted on social media that the president was acting “to distract” from his policy “blunders.” Newsom posted: “This is what dictators do.”
    


In a recent interview with podcaster Molly Jong-Fast, Newsom implicitly criticized the instinct of other Democratic leaders to pivot back to economic issues whenever possible. “I know a lot of good people (say), ‘Just play nice … and people will pay attention to your 10-point plan on affordability,'” he told her. “Well, we've been doing that every damn day for years and years and years.”
    


            Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg says that while there is an electoral logic to the congressional determination to center economic issues, Newsom is much more accurately reflecting the mounting frustration and anxiety of party activists. “They feel the Democratic Party is not taking on Trump effectively and they don't understand what anyone is doing,” she said. “And that makes them feel the party is weak. So, when people like Newsom do what he's done, he represents kind of what Democratic voters are looking for in the party.”
    


            Voters' lukewarm response to Harris' democracy messages last year, Greenberg added, is no guarantee they would not react to a more forceful message now that Trump has fulfilled or exceeded many of her warnings. “Everybody is overlearning the lessons from the last election,” she said.
    


            Neither side in this Democratic debate sees the choice as absolute. Tulchin agrees that showing concern about Trump's moves to consolidate power will be essential to turning out the party's growing base of college-educated voters — who respond much more powerfully than swing working-class voters to messages about democracy, he said. Conversely, Lake, Shenker-Osorio, Greenberg and Clegg all agree the party must present a sharp populist critique of Trump's economic priorities.
    


            Yet the difference in emphasis between these two approaches is real, and not unique to Democrats. These same tensions have divided other parties around the world facing opponents maneuvering to entrench strongman rule, said Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth University political scientist who studies democratic backsliding.
    


            Looking at the experience of other countries, Nyhan said, “the science isn't clear” on whether it is more effective for parties opposing quasi-authoritarian opponents to stress their anti-democratic actions or to focus on conventional political concerns like affordability. Most parties, he said, nonetheless choose the latter approach of emphasizing kitchen-table issues — the course Democratic congressional leaders clearly prefer.
    


            But whatever the long-term electoral merits of such an approach, Nyhan argued, it carries the substantial short-term price of failing to present the public a compelling case that Trump's actions are unraveling the nation's democratic traditions. “Democrats have been so paralyzed and so hypercautious that they may be underproviding those messages,” he said. Polls showing that more voters are worried about material issues than democracy can become a self-perpetuating cycle, he said.
    


            Shenker-Osorio similarly argued that the messaging from party leadership has the wrong goal. Democrats are looking for ways to drive down Trump's approval rating, she said, but this far from the next election they should be trying instead to sharpen public concern about his assault on democratic institutions — just as the GOP in recent years elevated the salience of issues around transgender rights, classroom teaching of race and gender, and undocumented immigrants.
    


            Nyhan agrees. Only partially joking, he said the Democratic congressional leadership may still be shouting “'What about the price of eggs?!'” when “they are dragged off to the camps.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrat Eric McWilliams doesn't approve of Donald Trump sending National Guard troops to cities like Washington, D.C. And he's certainly not supportive of most of the president's policies.

But the 63-year old retired handyman and U.S. Navy veteran does praise Trump for one thing. “When it comes to crime,” he said, “He's alright. He's doing pretty good. How he's doing it is another matter.”

“Crime is a big problem,” he went on. “At least he is doing something.”

McWilliams' views reflect the thinking of a lot of Democrats, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It finds that while most disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue, a large majority, 68%, see crime as a “major problem” in large cities. That's despite the fact that statistics show crime, overall, is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows.




The findings underscore the challenge facing Democratic leaders. They must thread the needle between criticizing Trump's policies, which are deeply unpopular among their base, while at the same time not dismissing widespread concerns about safety, which are amplified in many news sources and in online forums like Facebook and the popular Nextdoor app. 

That could create a vulnerability for the party heading into next year's midterm elections.




While Trump remains unpopular overall, the new poll finds his approach to crime has earned him high marks compared to other issues like the economy and immigration. About half of U.S. adults, 53%, say they approve of his handling of crime.

The vast majority of Americans, 81%, also see crime as a “major problem” in large cities. That includes nearly all Republicans, roughly three-quarters of independents and nearly 7 in 10 Democrats.

The issue is complex, though, even for those who are concerned. In interviews, participants who oppose Trump's unprecedented takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police department and threats to expand his efforts to other cities expressed alarm, calling his actions anti-American and part of what they see as an effort to distract the public from issues the White House would prefer they ignore.

They believe resources would be better spent investing in community policing, mental health services and passing meaningful laws to get guns off city streets.

But many also bemoaned the state of public safety in the country, even if they said they felt safe in their own neighborhoods and acknowledged that violent crime is down after a pandemic-era spike. Several noted that they or their neighbors had been the victims of serious crimes and complained about what they felt was a lackluster police response.

Brian Cornelia, 62, a retired foreman and lifelong Democrat who lives in Michigan, near Marquette, is displeased with the performance of both parties.

“Defund the police was nuts,” he said. “Now with Trump what he's doing, that's nuts too.”

He said that crime is “not at all” an issue where he lives and “down all over,” but nonetheless appreciates that Trump is doing something.

“Something is happening. We'll see if it helps or not, but it's better than not doing anything,” he said. Either way, he said Trump had backed Democrats into a corner.

“It's bad. How are you going to say you don't want crime to be dealt with?” he said. “If you argue with him, what, you're soft on crime? It's a Catch-22.”

Even those who give Trump credit question his tactics. 

About 8 in 10 Democrats say it's “completely” or “somewhat” unacceptable for the president to seize control of local police departments, as he's done in Washington. And about 6 in 10 say it's unacceptable for the federal government to use the U.S. military and National Guard to assist local police.

“I don't approve of national troops having authority over fellow Americans,” said McWilliams, the Navy veteran. “You shouldn't use our armed forces to patrol our own people. That turns it into an authoritarian state.”

McWilliams, who lives in White Hall, Pennsylvania, said crime “is practically non-existent” in his neighborhood, where he doesn't even lock his door. But he worries about the situation in nearby Allentown and across the nation, noting the deadly mass shooting this week at a Minneapolis church.

“I'm glad he does want to fight crime because – well, nobody else is doing it, certainly not our mayors and governors and police department,” he said, accusing them of being “too politically correct” to pursue controversial tactics like “stop and frisk,” which he believes works.

Others are far more skeptical.

“I think he's just terrible,” said Carolyn Perry, 79, a lifelong Democrat and retired nurse who lives in Philadelphia and sees Trump's actions as an excuse to target Democratic cities that voted against him.

“I think this National Guard thing he's doing is ridiculous,” she said. “It's almost like martial law. And now they're walking around with guns.”

Democrat Star Kaye, 59, who lives in Downey, California, near Los Angeles, agreed, slamming Trump for using the military against residents — something she said the Revolutionary War was fought, in part, against.

“Of course living in a big city, I understand concerns about crime,” she said. “But I don't think an authoritarian playbook is the right way to fix them.”′

If the president really wanted to tackle the issue, she argued, he would be investing in local police departments instead of diverting resources to immigration enforcement. She sees the crackdown as part of a broader effort to bolster Republicans' chances in next year's midterm elections.

“I think he's going to want to have troops in the street to intimidate people not to vote,” she said.

Part of the challenge for Democrats is that, historically, crime has not been a top issue for their base.

Gallup polling from April found that only about one-third of Democrats said they worried “a great deal” about crime and violence and were more likely to be concerned about the economy, Social Security, the environment, hunger and homelessness.

Crime has also traditionally been a stronger issue for Republicans, including in the 2024 election.

Democrats acknowledged the gap last week at a national party gathering in Minneapolis. In a presentation to Democratic National Committee members, party strategists noted Republicans spent about three times as much on crime-related ads as Democrats in recent presidential election years.

They urged Democrats not to mimic the “tough-on-crime” rhetoric Republicans have embraced for decades, but instead position themselves as being “serious about safety, not empty scare tactics.”

“DON'T TAKE TRUMP'S CRIME BAIT—INSTEAD, LEAN INTO SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT CRIME, RESPOND TO CRISIS, AND STOP VIOLENCE,” they urged in a slide presentation. 

Some Democratic politicians have been trying to do just that.

They include Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has been pushing back against Trump's threats to expand his efforts to Chicago. He defended Democrats' approach and said local efforts to tackle crime have been working.

“We also are tough on crime,” Pritzker told The Associated Press in an interview on Wednesday. Trump, he said, “talks a good game.”

“What the President has done, however, is to make it harder to crack down on crime,” he said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The 22-year-old philosophy student from China did not expect any problems after his 29-hour flight arrived at a Texas airport this month as he was on his way to study at the University of Houston.

His paperwork was in order. He was going to study humanities — not a tech field that might raise suspicions. He had a full scholarship from the U.S. school and had previously spent a semester at Cornell University for an exchange program with no issues.

But the student, who asked to be identified only by his family name, Gu, because of the political sensitivities of the matter, was stopped, interrogated and 36 hours later, put on a plane back to China.

He also was banned from coming back for five years, abruptly halting his dream for an academic career in the United States.

“There is no opportunity for the life I had expected,” Gu said.

He is one of an unknown number of Chinese students with permission to enter the United States who have been sent back to China or faced intense questioning after their arrival, drawing strong protests from Beijing and showing the uncertainty from President Donald Trump's shifting policies. 

His administration has quickly pivoted from a plan to revoke visas for Chinese students to Trump himself saying he would welcome hundreds of thousands of them, partly to help keep some American schools afloat.

Even so, some officials and lawmakers have expressed suspicions about Chinese students, especially those who study advanced technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence, and their possible links to the Chinese government and military. Some lawmakers want to ban Chinese students altogether.

There's no immediate data available on how many Chinese students with valid visas have been interrogated and repatriated from U.S. airports in recent weeks. U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for that data or for comment on Chinese students being questioned or sent back. 

In recent days, Trump said he told Chinese President Xi Jinping that “we're honored to have their students here.” But he also added, “Now, with that, we check and we're careful, we see who is there.”

The Chinese Embassy said it has received reports involving more than 10 Chinese students and scholars being interrogated, harassed and repatriated when entering the U.S.

“The U.S. side has frequently carried out discriminatory, politically driven and selective law enforcement against Chinese students and scholars, inflicting physical and mental harm, financial losses, and disruptions to their careers,” the Chinese Embassy said in a statement.

They were repatriated under the pretext of “so-called ‘visa issues' or ‘might endanger U.S. national security,'” the embassy said.

The students and scholars were taken into small rooms for extended interrogation, repeatedly questioned on issues unrelated to their academic work, and forced to wait long hours in cold rooms without blankets or quilts, the embassy said. Some relied on aluminum foil to keep warm, and some were detained for more than 80 hours, it said.

Such acts by the U.S. side “run counter to the statements” made by Trump, the embassy said, accusing some U.S. departments and law enforcement personnel of not “faithfully acting on the president's commitment.” The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gu told AP that he liked his Cornell experience so much that he applied for a master's program to study philosophy in the U.S.

Despite reports of stricter policies by the Trump administration, Gu said he wasn't too worried, not even when he was first stopped and taken to a room for questioning by a customs officer after landing at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston. His belongings were searched, and his electronics were taken away, he said.

After the officer went through the devices, he started interrogating Gu, focusing on his ties to the Chinese Communist Party, Gu said.

He said his parents are party members, but he has never joined, though he — like nearly all Chinese teens and young people — is a member of the party's youth arm, the Communist Youth League.

The customs officer also grilled him on his connections to the governmental China Scholarship Council, which popped up in his chat history. Gu said it came up in his chats with his schoolmates, but he did not receive money from the Chinese government.

Three rounds of interrogation lasted 10 hours, before Gu was told he was to be deported. No specific reason was given, he said, and the removal paperwork he provided to AP indicated inadequate documentation.

By then, he had hardly slept for 40 hours. The waiting room where he was kept was lit around the clock, its room temperature set low.

“I was so nervous I was shaking, due to both being freezing cold and also the nerves,” Gu said. “So many things were going through my head now that I was being deported. What should I do in the future?”

It would be another day before he was put on a flight. Now, Gu is considering appealing the decision, but that might take years and cost thousands of dollars.

TIANJIN, China (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged on Sunday to resolve their border differences and bolster cooperation ahead of the opening of a regional summit in Tianjin.

Modi is on his first visit to China since relations between the two countries deteriorated after Chinese and Indian soldiers engaged in deadly border clashes in 2020. Modi is visiting as part of India's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional political, economic and security group founded by China.

Modi said in his opening remarks that relations with China have moved in “a meaningful direction,” adding that “there is a peaceful environment at the borders after disengagement.”

He also noted “the importance of peace and tranquillity on the border areas for continued development of bilateral relations,” according to a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs.

Xi said he hoped the Tianjin meeting will “further elevate” and “promote the sustained, healthy and stable development of bilateral relations,” according to state broadcaster CCTV. 

The two sides should “not let the border issue define the overall China-India relationship,” Xi said, adding that economic development should be their main focus.

“As long as they remain committed to the overarching goal of being partners, not rivals, and providing development opportunities, not threats, China-India relations will flourish and move forward steadily,” Xi said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, who arrived in Tianjin on Sunday, is due to meet with both leaders in the coming days.




Earlier in August, China's top diplomat Wang Yi flew to New Delhi, as the two sides announced their rapprochement. Both governments pledged to restart border talks, and resume issuing visas and direct flights.

Wang's visit coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose 50% tariffs on India over its purchase of Russian oil, but New Delhi's process of rebuilding ties with Beijing had been in the works for months.

Modi made that message clear Sunday, saying that “India and China both pursue strategic autonomy, and their relations should not be seen through a third country lens,” according to India's foreign ministry. 

China and India this year have increased official visits and discussed easing some restrictions on trade and the movement of people across the border. In June, Beijing allowed pilgrims from India to visit holy sites in Tibet.

Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in China on Sunday for a summit and celebrations for the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender.

China will roll out the red carpet for more than two dozen world leaders at two major, defense-related events in the coming week, including the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). The group was established by China and Russia in 2001 with a focus on security in Central Asia and the wider region.

Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at the Meijiang International Center in Tianjin Sunday where he was welcomed by Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of eight other nations are set to meet in northern China for the latest summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in a possible challenge to often incoherent approaches by the United States to trade and regional conflicts.

The 10-member group that will gather Sunday and Monday in the port city of Tianjin has grown in size and influence over the past 24 years, even while its goals and programs remain murky and name recognition low. Some call it the scariest grouping you have never heard of.

The full membership includes Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Originally seen as a foil to U.S. influence in Central Asia, the original organization picked up four new members with the addition of India and Pakistan in 2017, Iran in 2023 and Belarus in 2024.

Some of those are clear foes of the West, especially Iran and close Russian ally Belarus. Others including India, China and Russia have a more nebulous relationship, either because of Washington's wobbly stance on Russia's war with Ukraine or because of chaos surrounding U.S. tariffs that have upended key trading relationships with countries such as China and India. 

The SCO's two-day summit may shed more light on issues surrounding the group's activities and intentions.

Since its 2001 founding, the SCO primarily has been dominated by China, the regional economic superpower, with Russia seeking to use the group to maintain its influence over former Central Asian Soviet republics Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. 

While Russia's economic influence has declined steadily, especially under increasingly severe Western sanctions, both Russia and China have used the alliance as a framework for regional military cooperation, albeitlimited to joint drills and firing competitions. 

Belarus, Iran, Pakistan and India joined later in an apparent attempt to share in the SCO's budding influence, though the value of their membership is debatable. Iran and Belarus have faced international condemnation over sanctions and human rights violations, while Pakistan is highly dependent on China for military hardware. 

India has long stuck to a self-avowed policy of neutrality, though that may be part of a strategy of self-interest.

Since the Russia-Ukraine war began, India has become a major buyer of Russian oil, increasing tensions with Washington. Modi also remarked on “steady progress” in improving relations with China after meeting its top diplomat in August and noted “respect for each other's interests and sensitiveness.'' 

India's SCO entry potentially challenges Russian and Chinese domination over the association. Despite their trade ties, India is unlikely to offer meaningful support for Russia's war in Ukraine or China's claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea.

India has also long sought a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council but has received only tepid back from China and Russia, possibly to prevent their influence with the West from being diluted. Still, New Delhi stands to lose little as long as Washington continues to broadcast uncertainty with its foreign trade. 

India has said it will not sign a joint statement with the SCO because it sees a pro-Pakistan stance in the omission of a mention of a deadly April 22 terror attack on tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Yet expectations have not been high for India to sign.

Beijing has given few hints of what solid progress it expects from the summit, which is in keeping with the secretive nature of its diplomacy and politics.

The official Xinhua News Agency on Monday called the gathering the “largest-ever SCO summit in history” and said it would be used for “charting the blueprint for the bloc's next decade of development.” 

The leaders of about a dozen other countries are joining the summit as SCO dialogue partners or guests, including Egypt, Nepal and several Southeast Asian nations. 

Xinhua spoke of the organization being guided by the “Shanghai Spirit, which features mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development.”

Citing growing trade and rail freight between China and other members, observer states and dialogue partners, Beijing seems eager to emphasize the bloc's economic benefits.

Xinhua noted documents would be signed including a notice of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which the ruling Communist Party will mark with a military parade in central Beijing on Sept. 3. 

University of Chicago political scientist Dali Yang said the SCO is one of the most prominent regional organizations China has cofounded.

“For China's leadership, there is a lot of emphasis on maintaining existing relations in the international arena even though the SCO has not been effective in dealing with the major challenges of today,” Yang said.

The summit comes just days before a massive military parade through Beijing marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender at the end of WWII attended by Xi and other leaders, including a rare showing by North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Yang said.

The SCO seems to show a desire to move from a dialogue platform to a “full-fledged mechanism of practical cooperation that brings tangible results to the citizens of the member states,” said June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami expert on Chinese politics. Yet the questions remain, ”to what end and how?”

For Xi, “presiding over the gathering in Tianjin should net him some favorable publicity and possibly further his image as leader of a new global world order,” Dreyer said.

National Border Council Vice President Art del Cueto joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the manhunt for an illegal immigrant accused of attempting to run over an ICE agent as President Donald Trump continues his historic border crackdown.

A lawsuit brought by Attorney General Pam Bondi against Kentucky's public education apparatus over in-state tuition for illegal immigrants resulted in an agreement to end the practice, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman told Fox News Digital in a Thursday interview.

Coleman said the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (KCPE) agreed to change state policy two months after the Justice Department first took the commonwealth to court over a provision in state law 13 KAR 2:045. 

The suit alleged Kentucky's policy violated 18 USC 1623, which states that ""notwithstanding any other provision of law, an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit … without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident.""

The DOJ originally had named Kentucky Gov. Andrew Beshear as the defendant, but Beshear's office previously told Fox New Digital that the KCPE is independent of the governor's office.

Coleman noted that governors do, however, have a role in appointing members to the council.

""Under current federal law, any illegal immigrant is barred from eligibility for postsecondary education benefits, like in-state tuition, unless the same benefits are offered to every U.S. citizen,"" Coleman said.

Bondi noted in a statement obtained by Coleman's office that ""no state can be allowed to treat Americans like second-class citizens in their own country by offering financial benefits to illegal aliens.""

In his interview, Coleman said that the decision is not quite official until the federal district judge signs the agreement between the parties — which he stressed is just a formality.

""Nonsensical is not a term that I didn't expect to use as often as I have the last year,"" he said of the case.

""It's a term from a Harry Potter book or a Roald Dahl book, but nonsensical is spot on and what we're dealing with here,"" Coleman said of what he called putting illegal immigrants and noncitizens before Americans.

Coleman said the original policy incentivized noncitizens to come to Kentucky over other states that may not offer them the same leg up.

""There is a joint motion for what is known as a consent judgment,"" he said, adding that he has not formally put out any statement on the case as of yet in due respect to the judge who has to sign the consent agreement.

In Fox News Digital's prior reporting, a spokesperson for Beshear noted the governor has no authority over KCPE, but Coleman appeared not entirely convinced of the dynamic.

Beshear ""won't hesitate to take credit for any positive policy that comes out of KCPE,"" he said. ""He appointed most members of the KCPE and in real world you're responsible for those that you appoint to these roles, that you have influence on those you appoint to these role, but yet of course who wants to walk away from that because of the nonsensical nature of this.""

Coleman, who was a former U.S. attorney before becoming the commonwealth's top lawman, said it should not have taken Bondi and the Trump administration to put an end to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in the Bluegrass State.

""I do applaud the fact that (KCPE) did the right thing and followed the law, but it took the Justice Department and all of its legal leverage and the chief law enforcement officer of the state opining on the legality before they did right thing,"" he said. ""That's disappointing.""

""They should be stewards of these institutions,"" he said. ""What they do is important and we have great universities in this commonwealth. They need to be focusing on incentivizing. The best and the brightest to come to this commonwealth, not incentivizing those that are out of status, that are violating our laws.""

He also said he hopes Bondi will continue pursuing others of the more than a dozen states with similar policies.

""I'm fully on board with common sense returning and whether it is protecting girls from men playing in their sports to enforcing federal law in the immigration context,"" he said. ""I'm for our universities supporting our best and brightest and not perpetuating this incentive for those that are out of status to fill seats in the classrooms.""

""That is not only unlawful, it comes back to the notion of just head-scratching and nonsensical.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Beshear's office, the Justice Department and a representative for KCPE for comment.

Unleash Prosperity Executive Dir, Tim Doescher and NTU Executive VP Brandon Arnold discuss the effects of a tariff loophole being closed, Labor Day gas prices, and how universities can prepare students for an AI-driven job market.

Labor Day vacationers across the East Coast are facing ""fecal contamination"" warnings at their beaches this holiday weekend.

Water quality warnings have struck coastal areas from Maine to Florida this week, with advisories saying high levels of bacteria could cause nausea or rashes. 

There have been closures this week at some of the country's most popular beach destinations, including Keyes Memorial Beach in the Cape Cod village of Hyannis in Barnstable, Massachusetts, and Benjamin's Beach on Long Island in Bay Shore, New York.

A report from Environment America assessed beach safety by examining whether fecal bacteria levels exceeded standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that trigger an alert to avoid the water. Fecal bacteria at those levels can cause illness in 32 out of every 1,000 swimmers.

John Rumpler, clean water director and senior attorney with Environment America, said aging sewer systems are to blame for much of the contamination.

""These beaches are a treasure for families across New England and across the country. They are a shared resource,"" said Rumpler. ""We need to make the investment to make sure that literally our own human waste doesn't wind up in the places where we are swimming.""

Nevertheless, many people plan to enjoy the ocean anyway this weekend. Despite a two-day warning of elevated fecal indicator bacteria last month at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, beachgoer Yaromyr Oryshkevych was not concerned.

""I really don't expect to be in any kind of danger of fecal contamination,"" Oryshkevych, a retired dentist, told the Associated Press. 

He said he didn't think Rehoboth was close enough to notable pollution to be concerned, and he expected the ocean's natural currents to take care of any problems with contamination in the area.

In North Carolina, five beaches were under advisories in late August because of elevated levels of fecal bacteria. The beaches are open, but swimmers are advised that going in the water could be risky, said Erin Bryan-Millush, environmental program supervisor with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.

Bryan-Millush said heavy rain from storms like the recent Hurricane Erin exacerbated the issue in parts of the East Coast, noting that ""storm drains carry everything"" out onto coastal beaches.

""It could be really bad for someone who is immune compromised,"" Bryan-Millush said.

Latvian tennis star Jelena Ostapenko apologized on social media for what she told American tennis player Taylor Townsend during an emotional outburst after a U.S. Open loss.

Ostapenko told Townsend she had ""no education"" as she pointed her finger at her opponent following an early-tournament loss to the American. She wrote on social media that English is not her native language, ""so when I said education, I was speaking only about what I believe (is) tennis etiquette, but I understand how the words I used could have offended many people beyond the tennis court.""

Townsend reacted to the apology after she won her doubles match on Saturday. She said she was unaware of it.

""That's nice that she did that, that she apologized,"" Townsend said. ""That's fine. That's cool. At the end of the day, I think that it's a learning lesson for her.... It's great that she went to social media and apologized. But I really hope that, from this, she can take that like, hey, you can't control people and it's better just to focus on yourself.""

Townsend said she hadn't personally heard from Ostapenko. Townsend defeated the No. 25-ranked Ostapenko 7-5, 6-1. The two came face-to-face after the match with Ostapenko delivering the insults.

Townsend, who is Black, was asked by a reporter if Ostapenko's comments at the net had racial undertones. 

""I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth,"" Townsend replied. 

""So, whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on. The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament.""

Ostapenko said immediately after the match she was upset Townsend didn't apologize after being helped by a net cord during a point. She also took issue with Townsend warming up before the match at the net, instead of at the baseline.

Former U.S. Secret Service agent and campus security expert Bobby McDonald shares essential tips to help students protect themselves as they return to campus.

College campuses across the country descended into chaos this week as false reports of active shooters sparked mass panic, lockdowns and major police responses – only to be revealed as coordinated hoaxes.

On Monday alone, at least six universities reported active shooter alerts. All turned out to be false alarms, but not before causing widespread disruption and fear.

""Swatting threats are not hoaxes – they're serious. They disrupt the educational process and communities into upheaval,"" Ken Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, told Fox News Digital.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) confirmed to Fox News Digital that it's seeing a nationwide increase in swatting incidents and is working closely with local agencies to investigate the coordinated threats.

""The FBI is seeing an increase in swatting events across the country, and we take potential hoax threats very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk,"" a spokesperson for the FBI said.

The bureau warned that these hoaxes not only waste law enforcement time and resources but also endanger lives.

Swatting refers to the act of falsely reporting an emergency, often involving an active shooter, to prompt a massive law enforcement response. The results can be dangerous and even deadly if responses escalate before the situation is confirmed.

""Every call has to be treated as real. There is no other option,"" retired FBI Special Agent Jason Pack explained to Fox News Digital. ""Even when the details raise suspicion, the response is still full scale."" 

Pack said the FBI is likely analyzing the incidents to identify patterns or shared tactics.

""Swatting is a crime that endangers entire communities. Treating it with the full weight of law enforcement from local patrol officers to the FBI working across borders is the only way to prevent one of these hoaxes from ending in tragedy."" 

Even after threats are deemed false, emotional aftershocks and misinformation continue to disrupt campuses, drain resources and test school resilience.

""We're in the state of the greatest ambiguity, uncertainty, and anxiety around school safety than I've ever seen in my career,"" Trump said.

Even when threats are quickly proven false, Trump said the effects linger with ""an enduring psychological impact."" 

""Even when incidents are found to not be credible… the anxiety, the upheaval, the concerns go on for days, weeks and months,"" Trump said in reference to students, staff and parents.

The trend isn't confined to one city or state – it's spread across campuses nationwide, from large universities to smaller colleges.

Officials say the randomness and scale of the threats are part of what makes them so disruptive.

Here are 10 campuses that faced terrifying false alarms:

Dorms evacuated after threats deemed unfounded.

The most recent case happened on the second day of classes at the University of Texas at San Antonio.  

""Earlier tonight, the university received two reports of threats against the campus,"" the school wrote in a post on X. ""UTSA Police responded to both reports and, out of an abundance of caution, issued alerts to the campus community. Local law enforcement partners also responded."" 

Students were temporarily evacuated from on-campus housing Tuesday night while the university investigated reports of a ""credible active threat.""

""Upon investigation, both incidents were determined to be unfounded. Police will continue to maintain an enhanced presence on campus. Normal activities can resume,"" the school wrote. 

Out of precaution, the school added that there will be an ""enhanced presence"" of law enforcement on campus for the time being. 

Students barricaded after fake gunfire calls.

An active shooter was reported Thursday at Villanova University. (Google Maps)

At Villanova, near Philadelphia, students were alerted around 4:30 p.m. on Aug. 21 about a possible shooter on campus. The alert system ordered students to shelter in place, barricade doors and await further instructions. Social media quickly filled with images of frightened students scrambling to safety. The shelter-in-place order was lifted around 6 p.m. after law enforcement found no credible threat.

Villanova President Rev. Peter Donohue called the situation a ""cruel hoax,"" adding that while there were no injuries or evidence of firearms, the psychological toll was severe. ""Today's events have shaken our entire community,"" he wrote in a campus-wide statement.

Authorities say the initial call to 911 described a man with an AR-15-style weapon, complete with background noises mimicking gunfire. A separate call claimed someone had been shot. Police responded swiftly, but it became clear the threat wasn't real.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has directed state police to use ""every tool available"" to track down those responsible and bring them to justice.

""I know today was every parent's nightmare, and every student's biggest fear,"" Shapiro wrote. ""I'm profoundly grateful no one was hurt, and thankful to all members of law enforcement who ran toward reports of danger to keep Pennsylvanians safe.""

Welcome Week cut short by hoax lockdown.

At the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, classes were canceled after a false report of a shooter sent the campus into lockdown. 

The incident happened during the conclusion of Welcome Week activities. 

VILLANOVA UNIVERSITY ISSUES ACTIVE SHOOTER ALERT AMID ORIENTATION EVENTS

The school's police department released a statement about the incident, calling it ""a criminal act, intended to be disruptive and cause chaos.""

No injuries were reported despite a 911 call claiming otherwise and police are continuing to investigate. 

""While this incident did not pose a true emergency, it is essential that students, employees, affiliates, and guests treat such situations as genuine threats to life until public safety officials confirm otherwise,"" police said. 

300+ calls flood 911 in library swatting incident.

The University of Arkansas also called off classes on Monday after officials confirmed that reports of an ""active threat"" could not be substantiated.

Students were first alerted to a possible active shooter near Mullins Library shortly before 12:30 p.m. via the university's RazALERT emergency system.

Located at the center of campus near the Student Union, Mullins Library became the focus of the initial alert, which read: ""RazALERT Emergency Notification: Avoid the area of Mullins Library due to an active shooter reported. Avoid. Deny. Defend.""

Police received over 300 calls from landlines and more than 30 emergency 911 calls, all reporting an active shooter in seven separate campus buildings. Some callers claimed to have seen a shooter or heard gunfire.

""It's looking as if this was another swatting or hoax call,"" Matt Mills, University of Arkansas Police Department assistant chief, said.

Another Midwest university fell victim to a swatting incident on Monday, striking on the first day of classes for students.

Kansas State University school officials confirmed they were the target of a ""swatting attack"" that was intended to disrupt classes.

Officials said Riley County Dispatch received a call on their administrative line of a message claiming that there was ""active violence at Hale Library.""

""Officers immediately responded and determined the call was a hoax and there was no threat or danger,"" a statement from the school read. ""The building is safe, and the Manhattan campus is under normal operations."" 

Multiple calls, no credible threat.

One state over, Iowa State University was targeted by a swatting hoax.

The Iowa State University Police Department confirmed that the reports of an active shooter on campus were fake.

""Officers responded promptly this morning after receiving several calls and found no credible threat,"" the department wrote in a news release.

On Sunday evening, the University of South Carolina lifted a campus-wide alert and declared an ""all clear"" following earlier warnings about a possible active shooter.

Officials confirmed that there was no current threat.

Earlier that night, the university had instructed students and faculty on the Columbia campus to shelter in place after receiving a report of an active shooter near the Thomas Cooper Library.

An emergency alert was issued shortly after 6:30 p.m. ET, advising individuals to stay away from the area and either evacuate or barricade themselves if needed.

Later, authorities stated they had found no signs of a shooter.

""Police are searching affected buildings,"" read a message from the school's alert system.

Social media videos showed someone approaching a university building with what appeared to be a long, black object, which some speculated might be a rifle.

However, Scott Prill, deputy chief of police at the university, clarified that the individual was actually carrying an umbrella.

The situation was resolved and the ""all clear"" message was issued just after 8 p.m.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order to affirm that city police will not collaborate with the National Guard or federal troops. (via Reuters)

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, signed an executive order on Saturday prohibiting city police officers from collaborating with National Guard troops or federal agents if President Donald Trump follows through on his threats to deploy them to the Windy City.

""This executive order makes it emphatically clear that this president is not going to come in and deputize our police department,"" Johnson said at a news conference with other city leaders.

The mayor's order affirms that Chicago police officers will continue to enforce state and local laws, but will not work with the National Guard or federal agents on patrols, arrests, immigration enforcement or other law enforcement actions.

""We will protect our Constitution, we will protect our city, and we will protect our people,"" he said. ""We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don't want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents.""

The order also instructs city police to wear their official police uniforms, continue to identify themselves, follow body camera procedures and to not wear masks so they can be clearly distinguished from any federal operations.

""The Chicago Police Department will not collaborate with military personnel on police patrols or civil immigration enforcement,"" Johnson said. ""We will not have our police officers who are working hard every single day to drive down crime deputized to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president.""

The order states that the deployment of federal military forces in Chicago without the consent of local authorities ""undermines democratic norms, violates the City's sovereignty, threatens civil liberties, and risks escalating violence rather than securing the peace.""

This order comes as Johnson and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker have been feuding with Trump over the potential of National Guard troops being deployed to Chicago to address crime in the city.

Johnson has cited data showing that violent crime has declined in the last year, including homicides and robberies dipping by more than 30%, and shootings dropping by nearly 40%.

Pritzker has also warned Trump that ""action will be met with a response"" and that a federal deployment without the state's request would be ""unconstitutional"" and ""un-American.""

Trump responded to the Democratic leaders last week by saying that Pritzker is ""incompetent"" and Johnson ""no better.""

The White House dismissed Johnson's order on Saturday, claiming that Democrats were attempting to make efforts to reduce crime a partisan issue.

""If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Reuters.

Johnson said on Saturday that he was considering any legal and legislative measures to stop the federal government, including possible lawsuits.

""We will use the courts if that's necessary,"" Johnson said.

Previous deployments of the National Guard to Chicago were coordinated with local officials, according to Reuters. The president's authority to deploy troops is limited under U.S. law, although there are no restrictions on sending ICE agents or other federal law enforcement officers.

Trump's threat to deploy troops to the Windy City comes after he boosted the presence of federal law enforcement in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to cut down on crime.

Hundreds of federal agents and National Guard troops have been deployed to the streets of D.C. as part of the federal takeover of the district.

President Donald Trump said he will be issuing an executive order requiring voter ID for “every single vote.”

Trump teased the order in a Truth Social post on Saturday night, in which he repeated his call for eliminating voting machines as well as mail-in voting with few exceptions.

“Voter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!! Also, No Mail-In Voting, Except For Those That Are Very Ill, And The Far Away Military. USE PAPER BALLOTS ONLY!!!” he posted.

It is unclear when the order will be issued, but the president hinted at an order getting rid of mail-in voting and voting machines earlier this month.

Then, Trump did not specifically mention voter ID would be included. But he did say he has the power over the states in voting matters because “the States are merely an ‘agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes.”

According to Ballotpedia, 36 states currently require voters to show identification before casting a ballot, though the type of ID can vary.

For example, 25 of those states require photo ID, while the other 11 do not. The 14 remaining states, as well as Washington, D.C., do not require voters to show any form of identification before voting.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A compact that has defined the National Guard's legitimacy for generations is being shattered.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In October 2006, an early winter storm buried western New York under two feet of snow, knocking out power to more than 300,000 homes as temperatures plunged below freezing. Local agencies were overwhelmed. That was the first time I mobilized with the National Guard for domestic-disaster response. We did what Americans expect the Guard to do: Neighbors in uniform arrived with trucks, generators, and training to help our communities recover.

That deployment demonstrated a compact that has defined the National Guard's legitimacy for generations: In extraordinary times, citizen soldiers mobilize to reinforce civilian authority and protect their neighbors. But over the past six months, that trust has shattered. Guardsmen have been called up to fulfill roles far outside their intended purpose, in ways that don't deliver safety and instead escalate tensions in the very neighborhoods they're meant to protect. They've been sent to L.A. to support immigration enforcement and deployed to Washington, D.C., to address an alleged crime crisis. They may soon be organized into specialized units to travel the country for crime suppression and protest control.

The image of the Guard is no longer one of neighbors helping fill sandbags and issuing warm blankets after a storm. It's soldiers standing post on city streets, functioning as police by another name.

I served as a combat engineer in the Army National Guard, where I trained as part of a team that would respond in the case of an attack that used weapons of mass destruction. Our job was clear: pull people from rubble, decontaminate the area, and stabilize the injured. We operated under a civilian incident commander, never questioning whom we were helping or what politics they held. That clarity shaped my understanding of the National Guard: It exists to support, not supplant, civilian institutions.

What is happening today breaks that model and continues a decades-long trend. For some time, politicians at both the federal and state levels have treated the National Guard as a catchall solution to avoid investments in public infrastructure. In 2022, New Mexico called up its National Guard to serve as substitute teachers; in 2021, Massachusetts activated its Guard as bus drivers; and in 2020, the governor of New York had the National Guard serve as New York City garbage collectors. Now the Trump administration is using state troops to fill gaps in law-enforcement capacity without the accountability, training, and community trust that real policing requires.

This trend is dangerous for American democracy. Using the National Guard as the stopgap for every underfunded or politically difficult issue blurs the line between supporting civil authorities and wielding coercive force. It also hollows out civilian capacity: Political leaders who use the military to patch up social problems are deferring the lasting solutions that these problems require. Instead of building a pipeline of educators, school districts have their governor call up troops as teachers; instead of modernizing sanitation systems, municipal leaders get soldiers to haul trash.

Read: Why is the National Guard in D.C.? Even they don't know

But perhaps the most important loss is trust. The National Guard's moral authority rests on showing up when lives are on the line and then standing down when the crisis ends. The country's Founders understood this deeply. George Washington's Newburgh Address to his officers, in 1783, and his later decision to relinquish his commission enshrined the principle of civilian control. Today, as Americans see Guardsmen deployed in roles that resemble policing, that trust frays. Service members also feel the dissonance. One member of the California National Guard told me that they were proud to be called up in January to support firefighters during the Palisades Fire. When this member was activated again just six months later, as part of a federal mobilization that ordered the National Guard to support immigration enforcement, they saw the earlier warm welcome and relief on the faces of L.A. residents replaced by dread. Trained for combat and disaster response, members of the National Guard now find themselves cast as occupiers in their own communities.

Leaders justify these deployments as responses to exigent circumstances, such as a shortage of police to fight rising crime. But crime is a policy problem with deep social roots. It requires sustained civilian work: officers accountable to neighborhoods, courts that move cases fairly, and social services that address addiction and poverty. Soldiers can make a show of force on city streets, but real public safety requires strengthening ties of trust across communities and providing reliable due process. Do we really want to live in a country where troop presences substitute for actual governance, and civic problems are met with military deployments?

The national-security costs of using the Guard in this way are real too. For three decades, Guardsmen have rotated through seemingly never-ending deployments to Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Ukraine, and the Horn of Africa. Adding domestic-policing duties to the list of responsibilities degrades the Guard's readiness for missions that only the armed forces can perform. Washington is asking too much of its citizen soldiers.

Read: What Trump doesn't understand about the military

Governors and state legislatures control when and how their National Guard is used. They can reclaim their units for their intended functions by drawing bright lines around law-enforcement-style deployments, especially in other jurisdictions. If the White House requests that governors send their National Guard on missions that involve controlling nonviolent protests, providing a show-of-force presence, or augmenting routine policing, the presumed answer should be “no.” When National Guard support is genuinely necessary, state leaders must insist that federal missions be bound by clear conditions and objectives, with public and transparent guidance on matters such as how and when force can be used and how long a deployment will last.

The president could choose to override state leadership and federalize the Guard. But in that case, absent a true emergency, governors of both parties across the country should show solidarity with one another by refusing to voluntarily contribute troops, and Congress must assert its authority and vote to end the deployments quickly.

The National Guard has become the “force of first resort” for leaders at both the state and federal levels, in part because of chronic underinvestment in civilian institutions. Rebuilding those systems—schools, sanitation, public health, local law enforcement—is the hard, unglamorous work of governing. But doing so is the only way to preserve the National Guard's emergency role and strengthen the democracy it exists to protect.

The National Guard is a powerful force when it arrives on a disaster scene to save lives, but an uneasy one when it is turned against civilians. Most of its members are motivated by service, not ideology. Misusing the Guard to manage political or social conflict will weaken its capacity to be what it is meant to be—a lifesaving, community-based force of last resort.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Trump brought us the Covid vaccine. Now he's trying to take it away.

In his first term, President Donald Trump touted the “medical miracle” of the mRNA Covid-19 vaccine that he helped deliver to market through the unprecedented public-private partnership known as Operation Warp Speed.

In its second term, the Trump administration is dismantling the signature health achievement of his first term by sowing doubt about the safety and efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccine. The president is taking steps to make the vaccine more difficult for the public to receive and for pharmaceutical companies to bring new mRNA vaccines to market.

Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been a critic and skeptic of vaccines for years, linking them to autism and other disorders without scientific evidence.

Now, Kennedy is canceling grants to develop more mRNA vaccines, which are also being explored for treating the flu, HIV, and cancer.

He fired all 17 members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Covid-19 immunization workgroup, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), and replaced them with vaccine skeptics. He removed Covid-19 vaccines from the list of shots recommended for healthy pregnant women and children, which means insurance companies will likely no longer pay for them. The Daily Beast reports that the Trump administration is planning to pull the vaccine from shelves “within months,” citing a close associate of Kennedy's.

Today, Explained co-host Sean Ramewaram spoke with Katherine Wu, staff writer for The Atlantic, about what this means for Americans' ability to get vaccinated against Covid-19.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What is the secretary of health and human services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., doing right now with mRNA vaccines?

Probably the latest and biggest news is that he canceled half a billion dollars' worth of grants to develop more mRNA vaccines. The public is probably most familiar with mRNA vaccines in the context of Covid vaccines. That's the first place we had successful mRNA vaccines, and that is still where mRNA vaccines dominate the market, but they've been in development for tons of other diseases, not just infectious ones, for a very long time. So this is a pretty huge deal.

Remind me who was president when the Covid mRNA vaccine was developed?

Also Trump, just during his first term, not this one.

Oh, weird. How has President Trump advanced his campaign to inoculate and protect Americans with mRNA vaccines in his second term so far?

He hasn't. During the first term, Trump was the one who helped push forward Operation Warp Speed, that big partnership between government and pharma that got us all of these amazing Covid vaccines in record time, and helped us beat back this pandemic that killed so many people. And so far, this shining beacon from Trump's first term is being systematically ripped apart. We've already talked about how Trump's administration has pulled funding for development of more mRNA vaccines. You would think that we want to build on that success. Not so much. But they've also started to strip away Americans' access to Covid vaccines. They have removed or altered recommendations to get Covid vaccines in certain groups. They've made it harder for vaccine makers to get new Covid vaccines to market, and a lot of the new hires and advisors to the Department of Health and Human Services are taking aim at other Covid vaccine recommendations that could restrict access even further. I think it's very realistic that within a year or two, very few people will be able to get Covid vaccines, even when they want and need them.

We were all there when the Covid vaccines came out, and the president, I believe, was among the first to get them. They were touted as a miracle of medical science. How is that narrative being rewritten right now?

Yeah, it's fascinating, right? Trump himself used that phrase, medical miracle. And there's no scientific reason that he should have stopped believing that. The data on these vaccines has not changed. They're very safe, very effective. They went through all the normal channels of vetting that get us safe, effective vaccines. But right now in his second term, Trump is leading an administration that is mostly pushing out information that these vaccines are dubious. They don't work. And largely, this whole system is corrupt. All the people that recommended these vaccines have conflicts of interest and they're in the pocket of industry, and basically the government is working to restrict access to these vaccines so they don't hurt as many Americans as they could. He said they don't work against respiratory viruses, which is not true.

Studies have shown that they saved millions of lives during the pandemic, and they continue to protect people for everyone who was receiving them. He said that they were the deadliest vaccine ever made. There's no evidence to support that. They have done quite the opposite. And he's cast doubt on the idea that they were studied thoroughly and carefully vetted by expert scientists who knew exactly what safety signals to look for. None of that is backed up by the evidence, but it's basically what the federal government is saying right now.

These vaccines were famously brought to market very quickly. I mean, that was part of the miracle we're referring to here that seemed to spur a lot of these conspiracy theories about their efficacy. Was there any validity to the argument that they were produced too quickly, that there wasn't enough testing?

I think the way you phrase your question is important, right? Because “too quickly” is about, did they arrive so quickly that there wasn't adequate time to study them, make sure that they worked well to protect against Covid and they did so in a way that wasn't posing undue risk to the people who receive them? And I think the answer is very soundly no. It's important to acknowledge that all this was done on the shoulders of all the vaccine science that came before it. Scientists knew what to look for. They knew how to run these trials. They knew how to scale up their technology. And yeah, they did it in ways that were unprecedented, but not unprecedented in ways that they were shooting in the dark.

So what happens now? You were saying that you can see a future in which even people who want and need these vaccines won't be able to get them. How far away is that?

I think there are still enough people at federal health agencies that would fight back against that, that it could be a very dragged-out fight. Stripping access to those vaccines instantaneously would also probably come under legal challenge quickly, but I think it's something that a lot of sectors of the administration are starting to move toward.

Operation Warp Speed obviously played a huge role in developing these vaccines, but it wasn't just an American effort by any means. If the US is falling off right now and denying the medical miracle that was, what's the rest of the world doing? And does that mean that you could fly to Canada to get your Covid vaccine, or even get it delivered?

Man, black market international vaccines. What a world. Yeah, it's a great question, and I think there's a couple things to touch on here. One is that cutting off funding for mRNA vaccine development here cuts off resources for the rest of the world. The US is extremely powerful in terms of scientific firepower, money, and also, up until very recently, foreign aid. If we stop developing vaccines here, that means there are fewer resources for other countries. There's also a chilling effect that is very likely to happen if the US says: These vaccines are crap, they're not worth investing in, they're not worth recommending, they're not good enough for our people. Other countries have traditionally taken cues from the US, especially around vaccines. Other countries might look at what we're doing and pause and be like, well, we don't want to look weird. We don't want to be the outliers when the US is doing this.

But are we the outliers right now? It feels like we're the outliers.

We totally are, and I would hope that other countries look at us and then look at the UK, and be like, Okay, maybe we start following the UK. But it's tricky, because in a landscape where these vaccines get more scarce and more expensive because the US isn't pouring resources into developing them, those vaccines simply won't exist or might be worse than if the US were pouring those resources in. And the US is simultaneously saying “These aren't good enough.” It becomes an economical and almost political decision for other countries to pause a little bit more.

President Trump has taken to wearing a hat that says “Trump was right about everything.” This is a man who loves a win, and he got a huge one in 2020 with the mRNA vaccine for Covid-19. Why do you think he won't take the win?

I suspect some of this goes back to what happened at the end of his term and what happened in the ensuing presidential term. The end of Trump's first term was marred by the start of the pandemic. He was widely criticized for letting things get as bad as they did in the US in those early days. Even though he helped push vaccines along, that was a triumph that didn't completely overshadow all of the other policy hiccups that made 2020 and much of 2021 horrific in this country. The pandemic could have gone much better here if there had been a much better coordinated public health response and better communication. I think a lot of Trump's base felt angered by that, and they felt angered by a lot of early pandemic policies. They felt betrayed by the government, and I think that has soured Trump's base on all things Covid, including vaccines.

It made me insecure and anxious.","https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-influencer-career-made-me-insecure-anxious-sacrificed-morals-2025-8","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 09:11:00 GMT","

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Evelyn Ramli, a 22-year-old marketing specialist in Indonesia. It's been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified Ramli's past and current job income.

For my first two years as a content creator, I saw it as a fun side hustle to do while in university. I posted TikTok and Instagram videos about video editing and fashion, and later transitioned to beauty when I found it to be the most lucrative.

But when I went full-time with content creation after graduating from my university in 2024, I realized it was only the ""dream"" life on paper. Sure, I was making a solid salary and got to work on my own terms, but I was insecure, anxious, and sacrificing my morals for a paycheck.

I decided to take a pay cut and switch to a corporate marketing job. I'm still not sure if it was the right decision.

I was studying English literature in the pursuit of becoming a writer or editor. Toward the end of my second year in university, I really let go of my academic performance in favor of sponsorship opportunities for my content.

I abandoned my dream because I felt creating content was a more creative and free path. When I first went full-time with content after graduating, I loved it. In a typical week, I'd attend four to eight brand events, do one to two days of content shooting, and do some video editing nearly every day. I received all sorts of free products, worked with brands I loved as a child, and met some of the most amazing people.

However, several months after cutting ties with my biggest brand sponsor due to opposing beliefs, I lost almost half of my income. After that, I was making about RM10,000 to 12,000, or between $2,300 and $2,800, each month.

I started reflecting deeper on my content and realized it had grown into something completely different than the hobby it started as.

Almost all of my videos had become ads. I was chasing views, followers, brands, and money, but I wasn't serving my audience or myself. I also started realizing that by representing beauty companies, I was inadvertently contributing to the message to young girls that they aren't beautiful enough.

When I looked inward, I realized I had become insecure, anxious, and distant from my authentic self. I knew I needed to step away so I could really figure out who I am.

I figured I could always go back to content creation, but it may be difficult to enter corporate later on and try to explain my several-year career gap and lack of professional experience.

So, I decided to look for marketing jobs. It has similar aspects to content, which would allow me to continue some of the parts of creation that I love. I only applied to a few jobs on LinkedIn within a month before getting interviewed and later hired as a marketing specialist for an education company.

I didn't mention social media as job experience because I wasn't sure it counted. I relied more on my degree in English language and literature and work experience while in university to sell myself. In my current role, I'm making less than I would've if I had kept doing content creation.

When I was a full-time creator, I had so much free time that I struggled to actually get work done. There were some weeks when I rotted in bed for two days because I was wiped out from a huge event the night before.

I'm now enjoying the routine of getting dressed in a cute outfit and heading to the office to work with a great team. The structure even revived my passion for creating and my drive to challenge myself.

I think about everything I had — the events, products, and freedom — and feel crazy for giving it up. I miss it at times, but I have to remind myself that we always have a fonder view when looking back on things. I have to remind myself how hollow and unsatisfying being a content creator was.

In this article

Nvidia's latest earnings again highlighted its extraordinary success and undeniable market power: $46.7 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from a year earlier, and net income of $26.4 billion. Its forecast for the next quarter came in at $54 billion, broadly in line with expectations. But one omission stood out — no revenue from its China-specific H20 chip. That absence spoke volumes. America's most valuable semiconductor firm is struggling to maintain footing in China just as one of China's own champions, Cambricon Technologies, is surging.

The problem for Nvidia is not with its business fundamentals, and certainly not with the performance of its chips, notwithstanding the ""backdoor"" allegations. Despite heavy losses tied to U.S. export restrictions, the company has thrived and is now racing to meet extraordinary demand for its new Blackwell Ultra platform for U.S. and allied data centers. There is no doubt that it can lead the global AI era without taking on the baggage that comes from its infatuation with China. Yet instead of drawing confidence from that strength, Nvidia has chosen to continue bending over backwards to appease China's party-state, hoping to hold on to a shrinking slice of the Chinese market.

Reports now suggest the company is developing a new ""B30A"" chip — more powerful than the H20 but engineered precisely to skirt the edge of U.S. export limits. This sends the wrong signal. Rather than staying focused on its future outside of China, these moves reinforce the perception that Nvidia, despite repeated warnings and the clear trajectory of China's industrial policy drive toward techno-indigenization, simply cannot give up its China dream.

What is widely known by now is that Beijing has a tried-and-true playbook. Foreign firms are tolerated until local champions are ready, then gradually displaced. Already, China's regulators are pressing companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and ByteDance to justify why they continue to seek out Nvidia products instead of using domestic chips from rapidly emerging Chinese champions. Buying foreign hardware openly is becoming a political liability.

Enter Cambricon Technologies, what many believe to be one of China's alternatives to Nvidia. In the span of just two years, its shares have multiplied roughly tenfold, turning the company into a market darling and another visible symbol of Beijing's drive for technological self-reliance. Investors are not merely chasing profits — they are also betting on that political playbook winning out yet again. Cambricon's swing into profitability this year has only amplified the frenzy, with its next-generation Siyuan 690 processor — still under development — being touted by analysts as potentially closing in on Nvidia's H100 performance and likely outclassing the restricted H20 chips once meant to anchor Nvidia's position in China.

The excitement around Cambricon has less to do with technical benchmarks than with a narrative about nationalistic pride and domestic momentum. Chinese developers such as DeepSeek are already signaling that their latest models will be optimized for ""home-grown chips soon to be released."" That creates an ecosystem where Cambricon is not just tolerated but embraced, its products now used to amplify the story of national progress. And because Cambricon has been on the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List since 2022, every uptick in its stock price and every hint of technological parity is seen inside China as defiance of Washington — a breakout moment celebrated much the same way DeepSeek was earlier this year.

The forces undermining Nvidia's position in China are the same ones propelling Cambricon's rise, and echo a notable list of recent U.S. business casualties in the Chinese market. Think what BYD did to Tesla, Huawei to Apple, or DeepSeek to ChatGPT.

Every time U.S. officials boast of keeping ""the best stuff"" out of China, the nationalist case for Cambricon and other local champions grows stronger. For Nvidia, the danger is real. Clinging to its China dream, kowtowing to Beijing, does not guarantee an open market. It only strengthens the playbook and highlights the contrast between a foreign supplier treated with suspicion and a local firm celebrated as the embodiment of resistance and resilience.

That point was underscored on Nvidia's latest earnings call. Executives admitted that no H20 sales went to China in Q2, and that they are assuming none in Q3 because of ""geopolitical issues.""

Neither Nvidia's CFO nor CEO spelled out those issues, but the signal is obvious: China's rejection is political, not necessarily technical. Xi Jinping has already set the course. At the April Politburo study session, he made clear that indigenization of AI hardware and software is now a national priority. No matter how much Chinese developers may want the ""best chips,"" the party and security apparatus will decide what they can buy — and the private sector will comply.

If Nvidia needed any reminder of how politics can drive market decisions in Beijing, it should look at Washington's own role in accelerating that outcome. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's July remarks that the U.S. strategy was to sell China ""not the best stuff, not the second-best stuff, not even the third best…just enough to get [China] addicted"" was the worst possible messaging at the worst possible time. His ill-chosen words turned what might have been a quiet and gradual market adaptation into a nationalist cause supreme. Security agencies, bureaucrats, and corporate rivals like Huawei and SMIC seized on the insult to argue that reliance on Nvidia is both unsafe and humiliating. Instead of buying H20s under the radar, Chinese firms now face political pressure to reject them altogether and buy local.

This convergence of market momentum, political endorsement, and national pride is no accident. China's AI Plus initiative aims to integrate AI across nearly every sector by 2030. The plan pairs adoption benchmarks with massive investment in domestic chipmaking, high-bandwidth memory, and national computing clusters. Cambricon has become the visible proof-point that China thinks it needs to show it can build an ecosystem independent of U.S. technology, thereby mooting the impact of being blacklisted in Washington.

For investors, it is fair to say that Nvidia will remain the gold standard in performance for the foreseeable future, but in China, perfection and performance benchmarks are not the only things that matter. What matters most to the political and security establishment, if not the private sector, is having ""good enough"" homegrown technology that frees Beijing from dependence on foreign suppliers and anchors its project of techno-indigenization. Even if Cambricon's Siyuan chips never rival Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra, they may be sufficient to carry China's AI development forward — and sufficient is all the party needs.

That makes Nvidia's effort to appease both Beijing and Washington a situation in which the chip giant is serving two masters and satisfying neither.

Norway said on Sunday it had chosen Britain as its strategic partner for the acquisition of new frigates in its biggest-ever military investment, in a deal worth some 10 billion pounds ($13.51 billion) to boost the Nordic country's maritime defense.

Germany, France, Britain and the United States had offered rival frigate designs in competition.

""The frigates are an essential part of our defense because they are key to defend our sovereignty,"" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a press conference.

Norway is NATO's monitor for the vast 2 million square kilometres (772,000 square miles) area of the North Atlantic used by the Russian northern fleet's nuclear submarines.

A key mission for the frigates will be to monitor Russian submarines, whose base is on the Kola Peninsula, an area in the Arctic bordering Norway.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed the deal, which he said was worth 10 billion pounds.

The deal will eventually see a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine warfare frigates – eight British and at least five Norwegian – operate jointly in northern Europe, he added.

British officials, seeking economies of scale for their own navy and to boost Scotland's shipyard industry, had heavily promoted the BAE Systems' frigates, known as the T-26 City-class.

The deal would support 4,000 jobs across the United Kingdom, including more than 2,000 in Scotland, the British government said.

Norway shares a border with Russia and is ramping up defense spending in light of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and U.S. President Donald Trump's demand that NATO allies must bolster their own military strength.

The draft agreement with Britain also guarantees industrial cooperation with Norwegian industry equivalent to the total value of the acquisition, the Norwegian government said.

Norway, a nation of 5.6 million people, currently operates four frigates. It previously said it could order five frigates, with an option for an additional one.

""This will be the biggest purchase to date. And we are now entering final contract negotiations,"" Gahr Stoere said.

Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka's fourth-round U.S. Open showdown will serve as a welcome trip down memory lane for the two fan favorites, as they face off in a match made for prime time on Monday.

Organizers could not have scripted it better for American fans, with a must-watch meeting between two charismatic former champions on the U.S. Labor Day holiday, six years after their memorable first meeting at Flushing Meadows.

The two faced off in the 2019 third round, where legions of domestic fans showed up to watch the then-15-year-old Gauff under the lights in her Arthur Ashe Stadium debut, fresh off her stunning run to the Wimbledon round of 16.

The then-defending champion and world number one made easy work of Gauff 6-3 6-0, but quickly comforted the young American as she dissolved into tears by her bench and urged her to come address the crowd.

Osaka spent much of her own post-match interview watching the crowd cheer wildly for her opponent, a display of stunning good sportsmanship that endures for tennis fans today.

""I remember it was a tough moment for me because it was a hyped-up match. I remember looking back at it. I guess I put way too much pressure on myself,"" said Gauff, who tamed early tournament nerves to get past Poland's Magdalena Frech 6-3 6-1 and into her fourth consecutive round of 16.

""It would be a cool kind of deja vu type of situation (playing again), but hopefully it will be a different result.""

Recalling the encounter, Osaka said on Saturday that it would be special to play Gauff again at Flushing Meadows.

""I remember just knowing that she was going to be a really great tennis player,"" said the 23rd seed Osaka, who plays for Japan but spent much of her childhood nearby on Long Island and is counted among New York's adopted daughters.

Their careers diverged from there: Osaka would go on to win her third and fourth majors at the 2020 U.S. Open and 2021 Australian Open — but has been unable to win another tournament since, struggling with her form.

She became a champion for mental health with her candid disclosures around anxiety and depression and has been on the upswing this season, reaching the Montreal final after battling her way back after giving birth in 2023.

""Sometimes I think about me before I had my pregnancy break... my age was pretty young when I was doing some of the stuff that I was doing,"" said Osaka. ""I have to give myself a lot of grace on that.""

A women's finals record of 3.4 million viewers tuned into ESPN to watch Gauff lift the 2023 U.S. Open trophy, 1.1 million more than the audience that watched Novak Djokovic claim his 24th major title a day later, a reflection of how beloved she is.

Gauff arrived in New York as the third seed after picking up her second major at Roland Garros earlier this year — while Osaka repeatedly said she was happy just to be seeded at all.

""It's been a real pleasure to see how she's kind of navigated herself and been a role model to a lot of young people, even though she's a young person herself,"" said Osaka, who beat the 15th seed Daria Kasatkina 6-0 4-6 6-3 in the third round.

The seven-time major winner Venus Williams, often cited as an inspiration for both players, said their rematch was good for the sport.

""Everyone will be watching,"" said Williams. ""That's what tennis needs.""

TOKYO — When Chitose Nagao retired after nearly three decades in advertising to start a matcha cafe, she never imagined lines would be snaking around her shop before it opened. By midafternoon, the tins of matcha powder on her shelves are sold out, while a steady stream of mostly overseas customers is waiting to try her latest green concoctions.

Her store, Atelier Matcha, is one of the lucky ones. Although matcha supplies are running low even in Japan due to a global craze, a partnership Nagao cultivated with Marukyu Koyamaen, a 300-year-old tea producer in Kyoto, is paying off.

""When I heard that all their tea was sitting unsold in a warehouse during Covid, I wanted to do something,"" Nagao said. Four years later, she has two stores in Japan, one in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, and a new outlet that will soon open in Cebu City, Philippines.

Japan has been consuming matcha since the 12th century, mostly in highly ritualized tea ceremonies that require only a speck of powder. Demand skyrocketed in recent years as matcha's reputation as an antioxidant-packed superfood spread over TikTok. A post-pandemic tourism boom has also pushed prices higher.

According to Japan's Ministry of Finance, Japan exported 36.4 billion yen ($247 million) of green tea last year, four times more than a decade ago. Some 44% was bound for the U.S., mostly in powdered form, like matcha.

In an effort to address the strain on Japan's aging farming communities, the Japanese government is considering subsidizing farmers to encourage them to dedicate more fields to tencha, the type of tea used to make matcha.

Tencha yields are more lucrative but also more labor-intensive, as the buds need to be shielded from the sun to bring out their distinctive grassy flavor. There are not enough hands to harvest, steam and dry the leaves before milling them into powder, producers say.

Tencha prices at this spring auction in Kyoto jumped 170% from the year before to 8,235 yen per kilogram, the Global Japanese Tea Association said. That shattered the previous record of 4,862 yen per kilogram, set in 2016.

Many retailers have also reported that matcha prices have doubled in the last year, and finding a small tin of the powder has become increasingly difficult, even in Tokyo.

Shops are placing purchase limits to make their stock last longer, discourage hoarding and fend off unauthorized resellers. However, matcha remains a popular souvenir for the record number of tourists visiting Japan.

Many online stores sold out months ago as U.S. buyers rushed to stock up ahead of expected tariffs.

Kaminari Issa, which sells everything from matcha beer to matcha cream puffs at its four stores in Tokyo's Asakusa district, said receiving an email request for a ton of matcha is not unusual.

""We're happy,"" said Miku Sugawara, who manages one of the stores. ""But there's only so much we can sell.""

Her shop sells matcha milled from the very first harvest of the season, when the tea leaves are tender, which is considered the highest quality.

Like many others in the trade, Sugawara worries that this summer's record heatwave could lower next year's tea harvest and push prices even higher.

Competition to source and produce enough matcha is so intense that it forced Ito En, the world's largest seller of bottled green tea, to create a dedicated division in May.

The company forecasts group overseas sales to rise 11% this year and is raising prices by 50% to 100% on several products from September in the face of higher raw material and labor costs.

Ito En has dedicated contracts with farmers that supply it with 7,000 tons of regular green tea each year, but only about 600 tons of tencha.

Convincing farmers to grow more tencha has been a challenge because many worry the current boom may wane, Ito En said.

""Matcha's popularity has been incredible. Our own factories and all our contractors are jam-packed,"" said Yasutaka Yokomichi, the manager of Ito En's new matcha division.

He said one of his priorities is to secure enough mills to grind the tencha leaves into powder and package it, which may include fresh investments to expand Ito En's own facilities. It can take one hour to mill just 40 grams of matcha, as the heat resulting from a faster process could degrade its quality.

Atelier Matcha's Nagao said that educating consumers about the different grades of matcha may be the only viable option.

As a devotee of sado, or ""the way of tea,"" premium-grade powder isn't necessary to make a good matcha açai bowl, she said. As an entrepreneur, she also has her sights set on the next big thing.

""Hojicha,"" Nagao says, referring to another kind of tea with a nuttier profile and less caffeine. ""Look, I only have one left today.""

Concerns about an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble and macroeconomic uncertainties are affecting the stock market. Investors can look beyond short-term fluctuations, however, and focus on buying stocks that can deliver attractive returns over the long term.

With their thorough research and in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help identify stocks with solid fundamentals and lucrative growth potential.

Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is this week's first stock pick. The company recently reported better-than-expected results for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. PANW also issued upbeat guidance for its fiscal first quarter and coming full year.

Following the results, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a buy rating on Palo Alto with a 12-month price forecast of $232. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on PANW stock with a price target of $197.

""The punchline is that we believe the quarter and outlook demonstrate the proposed CyberArk acquisition is coming from a position of strength, debunking the organic weakness concern,"" said Hedberg.

The 5-star analyst highlighted that Palo Alto ended fiscal 2025 on a strong note, with results and outlook surpassing estimates across the board. Hedberg noted management's commentary about momentum being driven by strength in Palo Alto's XSIAM offering, AI demand driving software firewall needs and growth in Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions.

Hedberg also cheered the company's Fiscal 2028 target to generate more than 40% in free cash flow margins for the combined Palo Alto/CyberArk company. Overall, Hedberg finds the stock's risk/reward attractive at current prices, especially as he sees PANW as an AI beneficiary and believes that it is insulated from broader risk around AI disruption in other software categories.

Hedberg ranks No. 94 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 65% of the time, delivering an average return of 19.2%. See Palo Alto Statistics on TipRanks.

This week's next pick, database software maker MongoDB (MDB), rallied after reporting better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 and giving a solid forecast.

Impressed by the results, Stifel analyst Brad Reback reaffirmed a buy rating on MongoDB and raised his  price target to $325 from $275, saying the company posted one of its strongest quarters ever. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has assigned a price target of $241 and an ""outperform"" rating on MDB stock.

Reback highlighted that MongoDB's Q2 FY26 revenue exceeded the consensus by about 7%, with upside coming from outperformance in both its cloud database service Atlas and Enterprise Advanced (EA)/non-Atlas businesses. The analyst added that revenue upside and continued focus on operational efficiencies helped deliver Q2 FY26 operating profit margin of 14.7%, surpassing expectations by more than 4 percentage points.

The top-ranked analyst was mainly impressed by the growth in MongoDB's Atlas offering, driven by a healthy increase in consumption across its installed base, impressive new customer additions of 2,800 and emerging AI workload gains.

Overall, Reback believes that ""Atlas is positioned to sustain 25%+ revenue growth,"" fueled by stabilizing consumption, enhanced sales execution and a growing set of core and emerging product drivers.

Reback ranks No. 760 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.2%. See MongoDB Ownership Structure on TipRanks.

Finally, we look at International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF), a company that provides flavors, scents and ingredients for industries including food, beverage and personal care. As part of its strategy of focusing on high-return businesses, IFF announced the divestiture of its soy crush, concentrate and lecithin business.

In a research note dated August 26, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on IFF with a price target of $105. However, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a ""neutral"" rating on IFF with a price objective of just $65.

Feinseth discussed IFF's progress in its strategic initiatives, bolstered by a focus on innovation in high-margin products and efforts to optimize its product portfolio and balance sheet. The 5-star analyst highlighted the company's expanding profit margins and long-term revenue and cash flow growth potential.

Additionally, Feinseth believes that IFF is well-positioned to capitalize on secular, health-focused growth trends in food and nutrition, thanks to its ""robust pipeline of functional ingredients, expertise in sensory science and biotechnology, and deep relationships with global brands.""

The analyst noted that through its strategic initiatives, IFF is creating significant shareholder value. Feinseth mentioned that IFF paid $102 million in dividends in Q2 2025 and announced a new $500 million share repurchase authorization.

Feinseth ranks No. 205 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.9%. See International Flavors & Fragrances Technical Analysis on TipRanks.

While inflation rates have cooled in recent years, U.S. Open attendees may still be experiencing the aftertaste as they sip on the tennis championship's iconic beverage.

The so-called Honey Deuce carries an eye-popping price tag of $23. While the drink costs the same as last year, it has had six price hikes since 2012 — and has outpaced inflation over the past decade.

The vodka-based beverage has become synonymous with the New York City-based event. It's adorned with honeydew melon chunks that resemble tennis balls and is served in a souvenir glass.

Despite the high cost, the U.S. Open sold more than 550,000 of the cocktail last year, bringing in almost $13 million in revenue, according to NBC New York.

As tennis fans descend on New York for the two-week-long event, CNBC calculated how the Honey Deuce's price change has fared compared with broader inflation.

Honey Deuce enthusiasts are shelling out around 53% more than they did in 2015, when the beverage cost $15, according to Sportico's price tracker.

That's higher than broader inflation as tracked in the consumer price index, or CPI. The CPI, which monitors a broad basket of goods and services, has increased about 36% between August 2015 and July 2025, the last month with data available.

In other words, if the Honey Deuce rose in tandem with overall inflation, it would cost approximately $20.33 today. The U.S. Tennis Association, which operates the facilities where the U.S. Open is held, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.

The Honey Deuce's price has also risen at a faster clip than other alcoholic beverages bought outside of homes in U.S. cities. That average cost is up nearly 34% between August 2015 and July 2025, meaning it has seen slightly lower inflation than the overall CPI basket has.

Americans have been particularly focused on prices coming off the period of runaway inflation seen during the Covid-19cpandemic. Higher price tags have soured economic sentiment in recent years.

Yet, consumers have also displayed an inclination to spend on experiences such as travel, concerts and sporting events. That has created a phenomenon known as ""funflation.""

A version of this article appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.

A new push by states to tax the real estate of the wealthy has sparked a backlash among brokers and potential buyers, who say the taxes punish the most important local spenders.

From tax hikes on pricey second homes in Rhode Island and Montana to Cape Cod's proposed transfer tax on homes over $2 million and the L.A. mansion tax, state and local governments see a revenue gold mine in the pricey properties of the wealthy.

""It's a smack in the face to people who just spend money here,"" said Donna Krueger-Simmons, sales agent with Mott & Chace Sotheby's International in Watch Hill, Rhode Island.

The tax hikes are being driven by tighter state budgets and populist anger over housing costs. States are looking to offset budget cuts expected from the new tax and spending bill in Washington. At the same time, the housing market has become a tale of two buyers, with the middle class and younger families struggling to afford homes while the luxury housing market thrives from wealthy all-cash buyers.

The solution for many states: tax the homes of the rich.

Rhode Island's new levy, nicknamed ""The Taylor Swift Tax,"" is among the most extreme. The popstar bought a beach house in the state's elite Watch Hill community in 2013.

The measure imposes a new surcharge on second homes valued at more than $1 million. For non-primary residences, or those not occupied for more than 182 days a year, the state will charge $2.50 for every $500 in assessed value above the first $1 million. That charge is on top of existing property taxes and will add up to big increases for luxury homes in Newport, Watch Hill and other well-heeled, summer communities in the state.

Swift's house, for instance, is assessed at around $28 million, according to local real estate records. Her current property taxes are estimated at around $201,000 a year. The new charges will add another $136,442 to her annual taxes, bringing her yearly total to $337,442 – even though locals say she rarely visits.

Real estate brokers say the increase targets the very taxpayers who already contribute the most. Wealthy second-homeowners pay hefty property taxes but don't use many local services, since their primary residences are in New York; Boston; Palm Beach, Florida; or other locales. Their kids typically don't attend the local schools, and they're infrequent users of the police, fire, water and other municipal services since most stay for only 10 to 12 weeks out of the year.

""These are people who just come here for the summer, spend their money and pay their fair share of taxes,"" said Krueger-Simmons. ""They're getting penalized just because they also live somewhere else.""

Brokers and longtime residents say the summer residents of Newport, Watch Hill and other seasonal beach towns are the economic engines for local businesses, restaurants and hotels.

""You're just hurting the people who support small business,"" said Lori Joyal, of the Lila Delman Compass office in Watch Hill. ""You're chasing away the people who spend most of the money in these towns."" 

Rhode Island is also hiking its conveyance tax on luxury real estate starting in October. The tax on real estate sales will be an additional $3.75 for each $500 paid above $800,000 for a real estate purchase. At the same time, the state's steep estate tax deters many of the ultra-wealthy from living there full-time.

Brokers say some second-home owners are considering selling and many would-be buyers are pausing their purchases. While the tax hike alone isn't expected to lead to any significant wealth flight, Joyal said potential buyers in Rhode Island are already looking at coastal towns in Connecticut as alternatives.

""It's always about choices,"" she said. ""At the end of the day it's about how they can choose to spend their discretionary dollars. Connecticut has some beautiful coastal towns without some of these other high taxes.""

Montana has passed a similar tax. The influx of Californians and other affluent newcomers who poured into the state during Covid has led to soaring home prices and growing resentment over gentrification. Meanwhile, the state's low income tax rate and lack of a sales tax has left it little room for revenue increases to handle the necessary increase in services.

In May, the state passed a two-tier property tax plan, lowering rates for full-time residents and raising taxes on second homes and short-term rentals. For primary residences and long-term rentals valued at or below the state's median home price, the tax rate will be 0.76%. Homes worth more than that will face a tiered-rate system of up to 1.9% on any value over four times the median price.

The Montana Department of Revenue expects the changes, which will start next year, will hike second-home taxes by an average of 68%. Brokers say some buyers are waiting to see the tax bills next year before making any decisions about whether to buy or sell.

""I've heard about some buyers who have put on the brakes to wait for the dust to settle and see what happens,"" said Valerie Johnson, with PureWest Christie's International Real Estate in Bozeman, Montana.

Johnson said that while the tax was touted by legislators as hitting wealthy second-home owners, it will also hit longtime locals who own investment homes and rent them out for income.

""These are small businesses for many people,"" she said.

Manish Bhatt, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said tax hikes aimed at wealthy second-home owners may be popular politically, but they rarely make for successful or efficient tax policy. Real property tax reform should be broad based, rather than focused on taxpayers who are singled out just because they don't live in a community full-time, he said.

""There is a grab to find revenue right now,"" he said. ""But taxing second-home owners could have the opposite impact – dissuading people from owning a second home or continue to own in those communities.""

While the new taxes alone might not drive out the wealthy, ""we do know that taxes are important to businesses and individuals and could cause people to make a decision to buy in another nearby state,"" Bhatt said.

The projected revenue from the new taxes may also disappoint. When Los Angeles passed its so-called ""mansion tax"" in 2022, proponents touted revenue projections of between $600 million to $1.1 billion a year. The tax, imposed on real estate sales over $5 million, has only raised $785 million after more than two years, according to the Los Angeles Housing Department.

Higher interest rates that hurt the housing market have played a role, experts say. Yet Michael Manville, professor of urban planning at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, said wealthy buyers and sellers also reduced transactions in response to the tax.

""The lower revenue is a reason to be concerned because it suggests that the tax might actually be reducing transactions, which in turn can reduce housing production and property tax revenue,"" he said.

Sam Altman needed someone to manage the finances. It was 2018, and OpenAI was still a nonprofit research outfit with 40 employees, no consumer product and no clear revenue model. But someone had to oversee the money.

Altman asked Brad Lightcap, who he'd worked with at startup accelerator Y Combinator, to help him with the search. Lightcap interviewed more than 20 people. Nobody wanted the job. So Lightcap decided to do it himself, stepping into a temporary role as the first business hire inside what was still unmistakably a lab.

""We had no idea we were going to make a chatbot that a lot of people were going to talk to,"" Altman said at a dinner with reporters earlier this month in San Francisco that Lightcap also attended. ""That was just not in the conception.""

Seven years after joining the nascent startup, Lightcap is operating chief of a $500 billion startup with 3,000 employees. His task is to turn OpenAI from a consumer phenomenon, known for creating ChatGPT and sparking the generative AI boom, into a force in the enterprise.

The company took a major step in that direction this week, announcing new offices in Brazil, Australia, and India in response to business demand.

As it enters new markets, Lightcap doesn't have to worry about building a brand. ChatGPT now boasts more than 700 million weekly active users less than three years into its existence.

But selling into the enterprise requires bodies. In the past 18 months, Lightcap has built OpenAI's go-to-market team from around 50 people to more than 700, which includes sales reps and staffers focused on customer success, developer relations and strategic partnerships.

The push started in 2023, with GPT-4 and the launch of ChatGPT Enterprise. Businesses could suddenly see that OpenAI's large language models were capable of reliably handling workflow tasks. Clients started coming in from every direction.

""It was the first time you cross the chasm of the models being intelligent enough to actually solve problems for businesses,"" Lightcap, 34, said in an interview this week. ""We saw significant demand coming out of that launch.""

Moderna began using ChatGPT Enterprise to accelerate drug discovery and summarize vast amounts of research data. Uber built a custom tool that let engineering teams tap OpenAI's models for customer support, driver experience and internal productivity. Morgan Stanley first embedded GPT-4 into workflows on its wealth management team and later extended the integration into investment banking and trading.

""I see our responsibility as both building the tools and being, in some ways, the most knowledgeable people in the world on how to deploy them,"" Lightcap said. ""We've taken that seriously from day one.""

OpenAI's rollout doesn't rely on traditional sales reps. Instead, its go-to-market strategy leans heavily on engineers who work directly with enterprise partners to ensure the models solve real business problems.

While playing a central role in global development for one of Silicon Valley's fastest-growing businesses, Lightcap also has to manage a sensitive relationship with OpenAI's closest partner and emerging rival, Microsoft.

Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI, having poured roughly $13 billion into the company, and its primary cloud provider. OpenAI's models are tightly integrated into Microsoft products like Copilot, and the software giant has used its close ties with OpenAI to offer early access to tools before they're available on other clouds.

The deeper OpenAI moves into enterprise sales, the more the two companies collide.

For companies already running on Azure, Microsoft's pitch is the seamless integration that comes with adding OpenAI's models to the existing stack. But going directly through OpenAI offers proximity to the teams building the frontier technology.

It's not the only market where they're going head-to-head. In Microsoft's annual filing last year, the company formally listed OpenAI as a competitor in search and news advertising. The disclosure landed days after OpenAI unveiled a prototype called SearchGPT, underscoring how quickly the two companies' interests were overlapping.

And this week, Microsoft said it's started publicly testing a homegrown AI model called MAI-1-preview that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers.

Lightcap downplayed the rivalry.

""The opportunity space is so gigantic that in some sense, it's impossible not to bump into everyone else,"" he said. He emphasized that the key for OpenAI is the quality of its models, their safety and reliability, and how the company works with customers.

Microsoft didn't respond to a request for comment.

The two companies are now renegotiating the terms of their partnership, including the enterprise sales split, which delivers 80% of revenue to OpenAI when it owns the customer relationship.

Other points of tension include OpenAI's work with different cloud providers and the governance system that will shape OpenAI's next stage of growth as it raises $40 billion and restructures into a commercial entity.

As OpenAI expands into new regions, it's tailoring its approach to reflect local demand, preferences and use cases.

Brazil, now OpenAI's fastest-growing market in Latin America, has more than 50 million monthly ChatGPT users sending about 140 million messages every day. India, with its surging developer base, has become the company's second-biggest user community worldwide. And Australia, home to some of the earliest users of OpenAI's application programming interface (API), is emerging as a hub for enterprise adoption across the Asia-Pacific region.

The Sao Paulo office will double as a training center for educators, nonprofits, and small businesses, and as a community hub for Brazil's burgeoning developer base.

""There's real energy around AI across Brazil,"" Lightcap said. ""Startups are moving fast and bigger companies are already putting these tools to work. Opening an office here helps us stay close to customers and partners and support that momentum.""

OpenAI is hiring locally to tap into active developer ecosystems. In Australia, the Sydney office will serve as a beachhead for enterprise clients across the Pacific. And in Japan, where the company has already launched a joint venture with SoftBank to roll out enterprise tools nationwide, the Tokyo team is structured to focus on custom use cases like automation, robotics and AI-driven productivity.

""My colleagues in Japan have taught us a lot also about how to actually improve how we go to market, how to improve the way we deliver services to enterprises,"" Lightcap said. ""And so it really becomes this two-way learning process.""

It's not a world Lightcap could have imagined seven years ago, when the fledgling lab he joined was operating out of a three-story wood-frame building in San Francisco's Mission District.

At the dinner in San Francisco in August, Lightcap was seated across the table from his boss. He nodded as Altman described what life was like back then and the short workdays out of the limelight.

""We really did have a nice life,"" Altman said. ""We were the smartest people in the world doing the most interesting science, on the frontier of discovery, in on this big secret.""

President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said Sunday that ""it will be the end of the United States"" if the president's sweeping tariffs are ultimately blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Navarro's comments echoed Trump's own rhetoric as the president sharply criticized last week's 7-4 appeals court decision, which ruled that most of Trump's tariffs are illegal, placing a central tenet of the administration's economic agenda on shaky ground.

The final ruling on the matter is likely to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. As the battle over Trump's tariffs intensifies, the president's advisers are casting the ultimate outcome as pivotal to the future of the country.

""This was weaponized partisan injustice at its worst,"" Navarro said on Fox's ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

""If we lose the case, President Trump is right. It will be the end of the United States,"" he said.

Navarro also said that he feels ""very optimistic"" about the administration's arguments to the Supreme Court.

""A very good dissent provides a road map for the Supreme Court. We feel very optimistic,"" Navarro said.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request to comment.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held Friday that Trump overstepped his presidential authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the sweeping ""reciprocal"" tariffs against virtually every country in the world.

The appeals court allowed Trump's tariffs to stay in effect until Oct. 14, giving the Trump administration time to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.

""If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social after the ruling.

He added that ""with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use [tariffs] to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!""

Without court action, Trump's tariffs were set to affect roughly 69% of U.S. goods imports, according to the Tax Foundation, but if blocked, the duties would impact just roughly 16%.

Parts of Trump's agenda remain safe from Friday's court decision. Most notably, his sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum remain unaffected by the appeals court's ruling.

 A Bitcoin adviser says Bitcoin could reach as high as $10 million, and people will still be saying, “It can't go any higher, right?” 

Skepticism over Bitcoin's ability to rise further has followed the asset for years, and will likely continue even if the price reaches into the millions, according to a Bitcoin adviser. 

“I think it's going to be that way for a very long time,” The Bitcoin Adviser's Luke Broyles told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast on Friday.

“I think Bitcoin will be at $5 million, $10 million or more, and people will still be saying, Yeah, well it's 8% of world assets now. It can't go any higher, right?” he added.

Skepticism has followed Bitcoin (BTC) at every price milestone. Each time the asset has reached a new all-time high, critics have questioned its ability to climb further. During price corrections, many skeptics assumed it would never recover.

This year, Bitcoin reached several new all-time highs. Most recently, Bitcoin reached $124,128 on Aug. 14, according to CoinMarketCap. Since then, it has pulled back to $109,290 at the time of publication.

However, Broyles argued that Bitcoin's biggest hurdle isn't technical but psychological, as most people still don't believe it can improve their everyday lives. “Unfortunately, I don't think a lot of people will make that switch until they see that,” he said.

“I think it is going to be an exceedingly long period of time,” he added. 

Broyles suggested that Bitcoin merging with real estate loans will do much more for adoption than convincing Bitcoin skeptics to invest regular amounts over time.

“Like, is it going to be harder to convince somebody who's more skeptical of Bitcoin, hey, you should buy $1,000 of Bitcoin for the next 200 months. Or is it going to be ""Hey, you can refinance your home and convert this equity into Bitcoin, right?” Broyles said.

Related: Bitcoin price loses key multiyear support trendline: A classic BTC fakeout? 

“I think that is going to blow people's minds,” he said.

A lack of understanding is still one of the biggest obstacles to crypto adoption. According to an August 2024 survey conducted by Australian crypto exchange Swyftx, 43% of 2,229 respondents said they hadn't used the tech because they were unsure how it works.

Oops, something went wrong

Ethereum is the top-performing major cryptocurrency over the past 100 days.

It hit a new all-time high of nearly $5,000 in late August.

Lack of clarity over future rate cuts, and growing disenchantment with the crypto treasury company business model, are keeping Ethereum's price down.

10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›

It took Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) nearly four years to do it, but the world's second-largest cryptocurrency finally hit a new all-time high of $4,954 on Aug. 24. That eclipses its old all-time high of $4,878 that dates back to November 2021.

However, cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and Ethereum has already given up some of its massive gains. It's currently trading around $4,300, and investors are beginning to question if Ethereum has anything left in the tank for the remainder of the year. Here's why they're concerned.

Ethereum's remarkable summer rally, which saw it explode in price from $1,800 to nearly $5,000, started in early May. Over the past 90 days, Ethereum is up a sizzling 73%. That's tops among all major cryptocurrencies.

The summer rally coincides with the high-profile launches of new publicly traded Ethereum treasury companies that are designed to do just one thing: Buy Ethereum. Borrowing the business model already used for Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), these companies raise capital from outside investors, and then immediately plow that money back into Ethereum.

All this new buying pressure has created a lot of buzz and hype around Ethereum. That's especially the case since luminaries from the worlds of crypto and Wall Street were involved in the launch of these companies. SharpLink Gaming (NASDAQ: SBET), for example, appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as its chairman in May. For its part, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSEMKT: BMNR) appointed Wall Street strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat as its chairman at the end of June.

These two companies are locked in a race to see who can stack the most Ethereum. But if you think about it, their transformations into Ethereum treasury companies don't really make a lot of sense. SharpLink Gaming was a company that provided affiliate marketing services to sports betting and online casino sites, while Bitmine Immersion Technologies was a Bitcoin mining company.

So, in many ways, the shine has already worn off the crypto treasury company business model. It would be one thing if these companies were funding Ethereum purchases with cash flow from operations, but they are instead raising money from investors. That introduces a whole new element of risk into the equation.

The second major factor weighing on Ethereum right now is interest rates. The market was pricing in a major easing by the Federal Reserve. In fact, Ethereum hit its new all-time high just hours after Fed Chair Jerome Powell hinted at future interest rate cuts. These rate cuts are good for crypto because they make risky assets more attractive to investors.

But in the week following the Fed chair's Jackson Hole remarks, sentiment in the market has shifted once again. That's because, instead of an aggressive series of rate cuts, there may only be a single rate cut. Moreover, the ongoing tussle between the White House and the Fed is weighing on crypto markets right now. So the market may have gotten ahead of itself in pricing in rate cut expectations.

Finally, Ethereum lacks a specific catalyst to push it higher in the coming months. There's no good reason -- beyond positive market sentiment -- why it should be increasing in price right now. Much of the buzz around Ethereum this summer has centered around all the new pro-crypto legislation coming out of Congress. New stablecoin legislation, for example, is good for Ethereum because it remains the top blockchain for stablecoins.

But it's not like Ethereum has announced any new product launches recently. The last tech upgrade happened in May, and that's old news now. Ethereum already has spot ETFs, so there's nothing really happening on that front either. At best, one could argue that new regulatory clarity around crypto staking could make these spot ETFs attractive to investors.

In reality, the spike in Ethereum's price this summer seems to be a bit of circular logic: The price of Ethereum is going up because more money is flowing into Ethereum, and more money is flowing into Ethereum because its price is going up. But what happens if the price of Ethereum is no longer going up?

If Ethereum were an actual company, I would feel more comfortable about its future prospects. But it's a decentralized, user-powered blockchain network, making it difficult to manage. There is some leadership at the top, but there is no CEO, no corporate headquarters, and no formal strategy that must be followed.

So there's no guarantee that Ethereum will double down on stablecoins or go all-in on decentralized finance (DeFi). That seems to be what Wall Street analysts want it to do, but they can't force Ethereum's hand. Thus far, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has shown very little interest in transforming Ethereum into a ""casino"" for Wall Street investors.

So, for now, it may be time to take some money off the table and wait for a new catalyst to appear. Ethereum remains a very attractive long-term investment prospect, but if you're looking for short-term gains to end the year with a bang, you might want to look elsewhere.

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts massive institutional adoption as Wall Street and treasury companies ramp up ETH holdings.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin just gave ETH bulls something to chew on. In a post on X, he applauded Fundstrat's Tom Lee on his vision for the future of finance and the expanding role of Ethereum in traditional institutions.

“Yes, ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more.”

As a blockchain pioneer, Joseph Lubin is best known as a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder and CEO of Consensys, the largest web3 software studio. Drawing on deep roots in finance as a former Goldman Sachs VP, Lubin has been instrumental in developing Ethereum as the preeminent platform for decentralized finance and smart contracts since 2014.

Responding to Tom Lee's bullish outlook, Lubin predicts a seismic shift in global finance: Wall Street giants will soon run validators, operate L2s and L3s, and write smart contracts to move their business infrastructure onto Ethereum rails.

JPMorgan, for example, has used Ethereum-based technology for its permissioned blockchain projects for about a decade and is joined by Goldman Sachs, Onyx, and a growing roster of major banks launching stablecoin and DeFi initiatives on Ethereum.

Since June 2025, treasury companies, including Bitmine Immersion and Sharplink Gaming, have added 2.6% of all ETH in circulation to their reserves.

When combined with inflows to new ETH ETFs, institutional buyers account for nearly 5% of Ethereum's supply so far this year. Sharplink and Bitmine now hold over $6 billion in ETH, setting industry benchmarks for corporate adoption.

And with the approval of multiple Ethereum ETFs, asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck have invested billions into ETH for their clients, marking a tipping point in its adoption as a primary digital asset for institutional treasuries.

VanEck's CEO recently dubbed Ethereum “Wall Street's token,” and Lubin argues that the transformative potential of Ethereum derives from “decentralized trust,” a quality Wall Street sorely needs.

As legacy institutions migrate from fragmented, siloed infrastructure to unified decentralized rails, staking ETH becomes both a technical and economic imperative:

“Nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, saturated with hybrid human-machine intelligence, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow.”

In his view, not only will L2s and L3s drive more usage of the Ethereum base layer, but “ETH will likely 100x from here” and eventually “flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.”

Ethereum's surging momentum doesn't come without bumps in the road. September is historically Ethereum's toughest month, averaging a -6.42% return since 2016.

The combination of a meteoric summer rally (up 76% year-to-date, nearly 25% in August) and seasonal trends may see a pullback in the month ahead, especially as macro sentiment, monetary policy, and profit-taking could weigh on prices.

Still, bullish fundamentals remain. Net ETH inflows from institutions, the steady climb in corporate treasury holdings, rising yields from staking (~3% APY), and ongoing upgrades all point to a stronger long-term outlook, as Lubin states:

“The one quibble that I have with what Tom has been saying, and I keep telling him this: he is not nearly bullish enough.”

Ethereum is trading at $4,464, up 0.36% in the last 24 hours, with daily trading volume of $22.9 billion. The world's second-largest cryptocurrency carries a live market cap near $536 billion, but according to ConsenSys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, that figure could be only the beginning.

Speaking on August 30, Lubin said Ethereum could grow by 100 times its current value, fueled by Wall Street's adoption of decentralized technology. He argued that ETH could eventually surpass Bitcoin's monetary base, a prediction often referred to as the long-debated “flippening.”

I am 100% aligned with almost all of what Tom @fundstrat says here.Yes, Wall Street will stake because they currently pay for their infrastructure and Ethereum will replace much of the many siloed stacks they operate on (e.g. JPMorgam probably operates on several siloed stacks… https://t.co/bW93kkX1gW

Lubin believes Ethereum will become the backbone of financial markets as banks integrate staking, validator nodes, and Layer 2 scaling solutions to replace their outdated infrastructure. 

Large institutions such as JPMorgan, which still operate multiple siloed systems from past acquisitions, could save billions by shifting to Ethereum-based rails.

Lubin pushed back on fears that Layer 2 scaling networks would weaken Ethereum's Layer 1 foundation. Instead, he pointed to projects such as Linea and Proof of Burn as evidence that scaling efforts strengthen, not cannibalize, the base chain.

For him, Wall Street's role will be pivotal. By running validators, writing smart contracts, and adopting DeFi processes, banks will gradually move onto Ethereum rails. In his view, this isn't a niche experiment—it's the next evolution of finance.

Key points from Lubin's outlook:

Ethereum price prediction is showing strength after bouncing from trendline support near $4,265. On the four-hour chart, ETH continues to respect an ascending trendline, building a bullish structure of higher lows.

The RSI has climbed back to 51 after last week's dip, showing a return of steady buying pressure. The MACD is narrowing its negative spread, signaling a potential bullish crossover. Recent candlesticks near support resemble spinning tops, patterns that often mark turning points when confirmed by volume.

Immediate resistance lies at $4,665, followed by $4,865. A clean breakout above $4,865 would pave the way to the psychological $5,100 level. Failure to hold trendline support, however, risks pullbacks to $4,265 or $4,070.

For traders, the risk-reward setup remains tilted toward the upside. A breakout above $4,665 could target $5,100 in the short run, with medium-term scenarios pointing to far higher valuations if Lubin's thesis plays out. In his words, “ETH will likely 100x from here. Probably much more.”

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is positioning itself as the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation.

By combining Bitcoin's unmatched security with Solana's high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development.

The team has put strong emphasis on trust and scalability, with the project audited by Consult to give investors confidence in its foundations.

Momentum is building quickly. The presale has already crossed $13 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available. At today's stage, HYPER tokens are priced at just $0.012835—but that figure will increase as the presale progresses.

You can buy HYPER tokens on the official Bitcoin Hyper website using crypto or a bank card.

The crypto market has been showing signs of consolidation as investors are moving increasingly towards newer utility-based projects of prominent altcoins. Cardano Price has been under pressure, reflecting cautious optimism among traders seeking early-stage crypto investments with real-world uses.

While ADA is still being referred to in passing, utility-based ventures like Remittix are gaining prominence due to building presale momentum and upcoming infrastructure releases.



Cardano Price is currently at $0.8332, having risen by 1.49% within the last 24 hours. Its market cap is $29.77 billion, with the trading volume at $1.33 billion per day, having fallen by 7.59%. Nevertheless, investors are more and more considering projects that offer quicker transaction speed, cross-border payments, and global usability.

Projects like Remittix at $0.1000 per token are starting to outrank legacy coins in use case value and early adoption.



Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming amongst the top DeFi projects that bridge crypto and traditional finance. Its presale has already garnered in excess of $22.4 million, selling more than 630 million tokens.

By resolving real-world $19 trillion payment headaches, Remittix allows people to send cryptocurrencies directly into bank accounts in 30+ countries within minutes. Remittix supports 40+ accepted crypto assets and 30+ fiat currencies, and it is ideal for businesses, freelancers, and remitters who need low-fee, fast transactions.

There are also recent developments with the listing announcement of two centralized exchanges. The first is to be on BitMart following the crossing of the $20 million presale threshold, and the second listing will be on LBank after reaching more than $22 million.

Such upcoming listings will enhance liquidity, access across the world, and position RTX in head-to-head competition with native cryptocurrencies as a viable substitute.

Remittix beta wallet will arrive in Q3 2025 with a mobile-first focus and live FX conversion. The wallet is designed to make crypto-to-bank transactions simple and grow both newbie and crypto native adoption. The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway is also aggressively interacting with the community, further solidifying RTX as a utility-driven project and not one of speculative hype.



With a deflationary token model and practical uses in the real world, Remittix is poised to become one of the most attractive early-stage crypto investments. Unlike most other altcoins, its development relies on infrastructure, usability, and global applications, which gives it the charm that investors looking for something more than meme-fueled hype are craving.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Tether halts USDT issuance on five legacy blockchains, shifting focus to Ethereum and Tron for scalability and lower fees.

- Affected chains hold < $100M in USDT, while Ethereum and Tron host $153.3B combined, aligning with market efficiency trends.

- Kusama and Algorand face liquidity risks as USDT withdrawals exceed $82.9M, threatening smaller ecosystems' viability.

- Stablecoin investors face 3.9% annual run risks due to Tether's limited arbitrageurs and regulatory gaps, contrasting with USDC's 521 arbitrageurs.

- Ethereum's Dencun upgrade and Tron's $0.0003 fees position them as dominant stablecoin platforms amid tightening regulatory frameworks.

 

Tether's recent decision to withdraw direct issuance and redemption of USDT on five legacy blockchains—Omni Layer, Bitcoin Cash SLP, Kusama, EOS, and Algorand—marks a pivotal moment in the stablecoin landscape. This move, announced in August 2025, reflects a strategic pivot toward blockchains with stronger developer activity, scalability, and user demand, such as Ethereum and Tron [1]. While existing USDT on these legacy chains remains transferable, the lack of official support raises critical questions for investors and blockchain ecosystems.  

Tether's decision to deprioritize these blockchains stems from a combination of community feedback and market dynamics. The affected chains collectively hold less than $100 million in USDT, a fraction of the $153.3 billion total supply [1]. By focusing on Ethereum and Tron—hosting $72.4 billion and $80.9 billion in USDT respectively—Tether aligns with broader industry trends toward scalability and regulatory preparedness [2]. This shift also aligns with Ethereum's Dencun upgrade, which slashed Layer 2 fees, and Tron's low-cost transactions ($0.0003 per transfer), making them ideal for high-volume stablecoin activity [3].  

However, the move leaves smaller ecosystems like Kusama and Algorand vulnerable. These chains, which once relied on USDT liquidity to drive adoption, now face reduced transaction volumes and developer interest. For instance, Omni Layer, the most impacted with $82.9 million in USDT, risks becoming a relic in a market increasingly dominated by efficiency-driven platforms [1].  

The withdrawal underscores inherent risks in stablecoin investing. A 2025 study from Investopedia highlights that Tether and USD Coin face annual run risks of 3.9% and 3.3%, respectively, due to their mechanisms for maintaining dollar parity [4]. Tether's limited arbitrageur base (six on average) creates bottlenecks during crises, potentially stabilizing prices but also limiting liquidity [4]. In contrast, USDC's 521 arbitrageurs could accelerate sell-offs, exposing investors to volatility.  

Regulatory gaps further compound these risks. Tether's history of scrutiny and lack of consumer protections—such as those under Regulation E in traditional finance—make it a “problem child” in the stablecoin space [5]. The irrevocable nature of stablecoin transactions also heightens fraud risks, particularly for retail investors unfamiliar with blockchain's irreversible nature [5].  

Despite these challenges, Tether's shift opens new opportunities. Ethereum and Tron are poised to benefit from increased liquidity, with Ethereum's DeFi infrastructure and Tron's cost efficiency attracting developers and users [3]. Meanwhile, Bitcoin's integration of the RGB protocol via USDT represents a breakthrough, repositioning it as a scalable payments layer. This innovation combines Bitcoin's security with stablecoin utility, potentially drawing institutional investors seeking diversified exposure [6].  

Regulatory alignment is another catalyst. Tether's $127 billion in U.S. Treasuries and gold reserves provide a buffer against scrutiny, while compliance-focused stablecoins like USDC gain traction under frameworks like the U.S. Stablecoin Act and EU MiCA [7]. This competition emphasizes transparency, a critical factor for institutional adoption.  

For investors, the key lies in diversification. While Ethereum and Tron offer scalability, their dominance raises systemic risks, particularly under evolving regulations. Emerging opportunities—such as tokenized assets and AI-driven crypto treasury management—signal broader adoption in traditional finance [7]. However, niche blockchains must innovate to retain relevance, leveraging unique features like Kusama's governance model or Algorand's carbon-neutral consensus.  

Tether's strategic shift underscores a maturing market where efficiency and compliance prevail. Investors must weigh the risks of concentration against the opportunities of innovation, while blockchain ecosystems must adapt to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Coffee beans are tracked from farm to cup using blockchain and AI technology, increasing quality and transparency in a new Minas Gerais project.

Brazil's future coffee is here, and it's in southern Minas Gerais. Blockchain and artificial intelligence are now being combined in a radical experiment that follows coffee beans from farm to cup.

The project is called Smart Coffee Flow, with the Instituto Federal de Educacao, Ciencia e Tecnologia do Sul de Minas Gerais (IFSULDEMINAS) and company VMD Estrategia e Inovacao as partners. 

It was officially launched on August 28, 2025, and will run for two years. Using this revolutionary technology, this project will shed unprecedented levels of transparency and intelligence on coffee traceability.

Smart Coffee Flow project: DataFlow's Coffee Flow: Making Supply Chain Transparent. The Coffee Flow project uses blockchain technology to document the coffee-related supply chain. This makes sure that the data on each batch of beans is secure, transparent, and immutable. 

Blockchain is effectively helping to get a digital record of information from planting to processing to coffee distribution.

This technology is essential to consumer confidence. From farmers to retailers and consumers, all can trace the origin of the coffee and the methods of its cultivation. 

This is beneficial for quality, good practices, and environmental responsibility in a region that is a major coffee-producing state, like southern Minas Gerais.

AI, in addition to blockchain, is capable of precisely and rapidly grading the caliber of coffee. A similar system called CoffeeClass, developed by Embrapa Instrumentation, scans images of coffee on the ground to determine quality in minutes. 

This reflects the mission behind the Smart Coffee Flow, which is intelligent AI-powered supply chain management.

The role of AI includes predicting coffee quality, optimizing logistics, and making decisions. 

It has the potential to benefit farmers with respect to increasing productivity and market competitiveness. AI and blockchain together spell a wiser, more trusted coffee supply chain.

Blockchain technology and digital solutions are becoming increasingly acquainted with the Brazilian coffee business. Previous projects, such as the IBM and Maersk TradeLens platform, have improved efficiency in the shipping of coffee around the world through blockchain. 

Additionally, Minasul Cooperative is about to introduce a coffee-backed cryptocurrency to help farmers financially.

The Smart Coffee Flow project is local in content but is following these international impulses. Minas Gerais will be at the forefront of sustainable coffee innovation as a result of this victory, which has the potential to pave the way for a revolution in coffee traceability, certification, and quality control.

Prof. Cleber Avila Barbosa from IFSULDEMINAS stressed that the project is an essential step for smart agriculture. 

“Overall, the innovation could bring technology deeply into the entire lifecycle of coffee,” said Andre Moreno Uberti, Partner at VMD Estrategia.

The NFT market is experiencing turbulence, with sales down by 8.53% to $129.6 million. Despite this, standout collections like Pudgy Penguins surge by 63%. Explore the key figures and trends driving this ever-evolving market.

Written by Charles Ledoux

Translated on August 31, 2025 at 14:29 by                                        Simon Dumoulin


The downward trend in the non-fungible token (NFT) market continues, with sales volume dropping by 8.53% to reach $129.6 million. This decline occurs amid widespread weakness in the cryptocurrency market, with global market capitalization decreasing to $3.75 trillion.

Pudgy Penguins floor price has doubled since I posted this ONE WEEK AGO.ETH NFT szn is here, unironically led by flightless birds.PENGU szn. https://t.co/AEePLTAzUd pic.twitter.com/E1JBll8oCB

Despite this gloomy climate, some collections are standing out. This is particularly true for Pudgy Penguins, which recorded an impressive 63.39% increase in sales, reaching $5.2 million. This remarkable performance contrasts sharply with the decline of giants like CryptoPunks (-17.95%) or Moonbirds (-36.57%).

In terms of blockchains, Ethereum maintains its leadership position with $54.5 million in sales, although its volume decreased by 8.24%. Polygon ranks second with $18.9 million, up by 16.12%.

At the same time, the number of NFT buyers has significantly increased on certain chains, such as Solana (+39.47%), Polygon (+42.66%), and Bitcoin (+31.55%). This trend illustrates the persistent interest from investors in the NFT market, despite the generally gloomy context.

Although CryptoPunks saw their sales decline by 17.95%, they maintain their status as a premium collection, with the five best individual sales of the week. Among these is the sale of CryptoPunk #4619 for 96 ETH ($446,764), a new record.

Nevertheless, it's the Pudgy Penguins collection that has captured attention, with an impressive growth of 63.39% in sales. The collection recorded increases across all its key indicators, including transactions (+89.66%), buyers (+60%), and sellers (+46.81%).

Although the NFT market is going through a difficult period, the dynamism observed on certain blockchains and collections demonstrates that opportunities still exist for savvy investors. Pudgy Penguins are a perfect example, illustrating that with the right assets, it's possible to stand out in a depressed environment.

- Pudgy Penguins defies NFT bear market through real-world monetization, retail partnerships, and token-driven community engagement.

- BAYC struggles with stagnant floor prices and declining APE token value despite cultural influence and community initiatives.

- Investors prioritize projects with physical utility, diversified revenue, and cross-industry collaborations for long-term NFT sustainability.

The NFT market's bear cycle has exposed a critical divide between projects that thrive through speculative hype and those that build durable value. As floor prices for blue-chip collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) stagnate, projects like Pudgy Penguins have demonstrated how real-world utility and community-centric strategies can defy market downturns. For investors, the lesson is clear: sustainability in a bear market hinges on tangible use cases, diversified revenue streams, and active community participation.  

Pudgy Penguins has redefined NFT sustainability by anchoring its value in real-world monetization. The project's Overpass IP platform allows NFT holders to license their assets for physical products, generating royalties from toy sales, merchandise, and advertising. By 2025, this model had driven over $10 million in toy revenue, with products distributed in 10,000+ retail stores, including Walmart [1]. This retail expansion not only diversifies income but also introduces non-crypto audiences to Web3, creating a flywheel effect of brand awareness and adoption.  

Strategic partnerships with mainstream brands like Lufthansa, NASCAR, and Suplay Inc. further amplify Pudgy Penguins' utility, embedding its IP into everyday experiences [6]. Meanwhile, the PENGU token, launched on Solana, incentivizes community participation through governance and staking, with technical indicators suggesting a potential price recovery to $0.060–$0.070 by mid-2025 [4]. These initiatives have enabled Pudgy Penguins to outperform BAYC in sales volume, overtaking it as the second-largest NFT collection by 2025 [2].  

Yuga Labs, creator of BAYC, has faced challenges in maintaining its early dominance. While the BAYC community remains culturally influential, its floor prices have returned to 2021 levels, and the APE token has lost significant value since 2023 [2]. CEO Daniel Alegre has prioritized community engagement through initiatives like “Made by Apes,” which supports entrepreneurial ventures within the BAYC ecosystem, and ApeFest events to foster collaboration [3]. However, these efforts have not translated into sustained market growth.  

Yuga's Otherside metaverse project, a key pillar of its strategy, has struggled to gain traction despite high-profile partnerships. The company's restructuring—including layoffs in 2023—reflects a broader industry shift toward leaner operations [3]. While Yuga's focus on brand partnerships and IP development is valid, its reliance on speculative value creation has left it vulnerable to market volatility.  

The contrast between Pudgy Penguins and BAYC underscores a pivotal shift in NFT sustainability. Pudgy's success lies in its ability to create tangible utility—physical products, retail distribution, and cross-industry partnerships—that insulates it from crypto market swings. For investors, this model offers a blueprint for identifying projects with long-term viability:  

As the NFT market matures, projects that prioritize utility over speculation will dominate. Pudgy Penguins' ability to monetize in both digital and physical realms, coupled with its token-driven community engagement, exemplifies this evolution. Yuga Labs' struggles highlight the risks of relying on speculative hype without a clear path to real-world value. For investors, the takeaway is clear: seek projects that build bridges between blockchain and traditional industries, ensuring resilience even in bear markets.

- Over 30 Chinese pharma firms are exploring blockchain for drug traceability, signaling a growing trend toward tech-driven compliance and transparency.

NVC Health has entered into a Digital Asset Business Cooperation Framework Agreement with QuantumCTek and North China PharmaTech, marking a strategic advancement in the integration of blockchain technology within the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors. The agreement, announced in a joint press release, outlines collaborative efforts to explore the application of digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs), in areas such as drug traceability, data security, and patient record management [1]. The partnership reflects a growing trend of cross-industry collaboration to harness emerging technologies for improved efficiency and transparency.

Under the terms of the agreement, the three parties aim to develop a secure digital infrastructure that enhances data integrity across the pharmaceutical supply chain. QuantumCTek, a leader in quantum computing and blockchain solutions, will provide the technical framework, while North China PharmaTech will contribute domain-specific insights. NVC Health will act as the primary interface for clinical and operational integration [1]. The initiative is expected to pilot blockchain-based systems for tracking medicinal products from manufacturing to end-user, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards and reducing the risk of counterfeit drugs entering the market.

The move aligns with broader government initiatives in China to foster innovation in the healthcare technology sector. Regulatory bodies have increasingly encouraged the use of decentralized technologies to strengthen data protection and streamline administrative processes. This partnership is also seen as a step toward aligning the healthcare sector with the national digital transformation strategy, which emphasizes the use of emerging technologies to modernize traditional industries [2].

Industry observers have noted that the integration of digital assets into healthcare systems remains in its early stages, with regulatory frameworks still evolving. However, the collaboration between NVC Health, QuantumCTek, and North China PharmaTech demonstrates a proactive approach to overcoming current challenges, particularly in data interoperability and patient privacy. The agreement is not expected to generate immediate revenue but is viewed as a foundational step toward long-term operational optimization [3].

The announcement follows a recent surge in interest from pharmaceutical companies in leveraging blockchain for data management. According to recent reports, over 30 healthcare and biotech firms in China have explored blockchain-based solutions for drug traceability and clinical trial data storage, indicating a shift in industry priorities toward technology-enabled compliance and transparency [4]. NVC Health's initiative, supported by QuantumCTek's advanced cryptographic protocols, is expected to serve as a model for similar collaborations in the near future.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Institutional investors are shifting from traditional alternatives to crypto and ICOs, ending ""altseasons"" as 85% increased allocations in 2024.

- ICO market reached $38.1B in 2025, with 75% funds directed to development, boosting success rates to 34.5% via KYC and multi-chain strategies.

- North America and Asia-Pacific led ICO inflows, while Middle East/Africa saw fastest 43% YoY growth, driven by decentralized alternatives in unstable regions.

- Crypto and ICOs redefine high-growth investing, prioritizing blockchain-based value creation over traditional balance sheets, reshaping institutional strategies.

The institutional investment landscape is undergoing a seismic shift. For decades, traditional alternative assets—private equity, hedge funds, and real estate—dominated the high-growth portfolio. But as of 2025, these ""altseasons"" are fading into obsolescence, eclipsed by a new paradigm: crypto-driven capital reallocation. Institutional investors, once cautious, are now aggressively reallocating assets to digital assets and tokenized alternatives, with ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) emerging as the primary engine of value creation.  

By 2025, 85% of surveyed institutions increased their crypto allocations in 2024, with 59% committing over 5% of their assets under management (AUM) to cryptocurrencies [2]. This represents a strategic pivot from traditional alternatives, which now face structural challenges: illiquidity, opaque valuations, and regulatory scrutiny. In contrast, crypto offers programmable transparency, 24/7 liquidity, and a global, permissionless infrastructure.  

The rise of registered investment vehicles like Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) has further accelerated this shift. Sixty-eight percent of institutions now hold or plan to invest in ETPs [1], leveraging them to access crypto without the operational complexity of direct holdings. Meanwhile, tokenization is redefining alternative assets. Fifty-seven percent of institutions express interest in tokenizing private equity, real estate, and commodities [2], unlocking liquidity and fractional ownership for previously illiquid assets.  

 

The ICO market, once synonymous with speculative hype, has matured into a structured capital-raising mechanism. In 2025, the market reached $38.1 billion in value, a 21.7% year-over-year increase [5]. Crucially, 75% of ICO funds now flow to development and operations, signaling a shift from ""promises"" to ""products."" Success rates have also improved: 34.5% of ICOs hit 75% of their funding goals, with DeFi and infrastructure projects leading at 41% and 36% success rates, respectively [5].  

Projects employing KYC verification and multi-chain deployment strategies attract 30% more capital on average [5], reflecting institutional demand for compliance and scalability. Stablecoins further underpin this growth, enabling predictable fundraising and reducing volatility risk. The result? ICOs are no longer speculative gambles but engines of value creation, generating ""multiples"" through utility-driven tokenomics and real-world adoption.  

North America and Asia-Pacific dominate ICO capital inflows, with $9.3 billion and $8.7 billion raised in 2025, respectively [5]. However, the Middle East and Africa exhibit the fastest growth (43% YoY), driven by institutional demand for decentralized alternatives in politically unstable regions [3]. Countries with strong educational institutions and environmental policies also see higher ICO activity, while high bank concentration and political instability suppress it [3].  

This regional divergence underscores a broader trend: crypto and ICOs are becoming ""anti-fragile"" assets, thriving where traditional systems falter. For institutions, this means diversifying geographically and technologically, hedging against macroeconomic tail risks.  

The death of traditional altseasons is not a collapse but a transformation. Institutional capital is no longer confined to quarterly reports and private placements; it now flows to decentralized protocols, tokenized infrastructure, and global communities. ICOs, with their blend of innovation and compliance, are redefining what it means to ""go public.""  

For investors, the lesson is clear: adapt or be left behind. The multiples of tomorrow will be built on blockchain, not balance sheets.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- SEC reclassified XRP as a commodity in secondary markets, unlocking $7.1B in institutional capital and enabling the first SEC-approved XRP ETF.

- Ripple's ODL processed $1.3T in cross-border payments via 300+ institutional partners, outperforming SWIFT in speed and cost efficiency.

- CBDC collaborations with Bhutan and Palau highlight XRP's role in bridging traditional and decentralized finance through interoperable digital systems.

- XRP's energy-efficient ledger and RWA tokenization position it as a bridge currency for fiat-CBDC transactions in emerging markets.

- Projected $8B in ETF inflows could accelerate XRP adoption, leveraging regulatory clarity and strategic partnerships for global financial infrastructure.

Ripple's 2025 strategic repositioning has positioned XRP as a cornerstone of the evolving global financial infrastructure, driven by regulatory clarity and a surge in institutional adoption. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) reclassification of XRP as a commodity in secondary markets has eliminated a major legal overhang, unlocking $7.1 billion in institutional capital and paving the way for the first SEC-approved XRP ETF [1]. This regulatory alignment has not only restored investor confidence but also created a framework for XRP to function as a programmable asset in tokenized finance.  

The ripple (pun intended) effects of this clarity are evident in Ripple's expanding network. Over 300 institutional partners, including major banks, now leverage XRP's On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution to process cross-border payments. In 2025 alone, ODL facilitated $1.3 trillion in transactions, demonstrating its efficiency in reducing settlement times and costs compared to traditional SWIFT systems [1]. This growth is further amplified by XRP's energy-efficient XRP Ledger, which consumes less power than legacy systems while maintaining robust security [4].  

Ripple's foray into Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) partnerships underscores its role as a bridge between traditional and decentralized finance. Collaborations with Bhutan's Royal Monetary Authority and the Republic of Palau highlight Ripple's ability to design interoperable digital currency systems that align with national monetary strategies [3]. These projects are not isolated experiments but part of a broader trend: over 100 countries are now exploring CBDCs, with Ripple's technology offering a scalable solution for cross-border interoperability.  

The asset's utility as a “bridge currency” further strengthens its value proposition. XRP's low-cost, near-instant settlements make it ideal for facilitating transactions between fiat and CBDCs, particularly in emerging markets where liquidity constraints are acute [4]. This role is reinforced by Ripple's integration of real-world assets (RWAs) onto the XRP Ledger, enabling tokenized representations of gold, real estate, and government bonds. Such innovations position XRP as a linchpin in the transition to a tokenized global economy.  

Looking ahead, the approval of XRP ETFs could catalyze an additional $8 billion in institutional inflows, accelerating adoption across both traditional and decentralized finance [2]. For investors, this represents a rare confluence of regulatory tailwinds, technological differentiation, and strategic partnerships. Ripple's ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape while expanding its network of partners and use cases makes it a compelling candidate for near-term growth.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- U.S. lawmakers led a bipartisan delegation to Europe to strengthen transatlantic cooperation on digital asset policies and monetary frameworks amid global geopolitical tensions.

- Discussions focused on countering U.S. stablecoin dominance in Europe, with the ECB exploring a public blockchain-powered CBDC to enhance competitiveness and accessibility.

- The trip emphasized aligning U.S.-European financial regulations to address risks from digital currencies while fostering innovation and national security resilience.

- Rep. Gonzalez highlighted cross-Atlantic collaboration's importance, noting the visit reinforced economic ties and advanced bipartisan legislative priorities.

House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill (R-AR) and Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D-TX) led a bipartisan delegation to Europe from August 20 to 28, 2025, engaging in high-level discussions with officials in Italy, Switzerland, and Germany. The primary focus of the trip was to foster collaboration on digital asset policy, regulatory frameworks, and monetary policy, while reinforcing transatlantic economic partnerships amid global geopolitical tensions, including Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The lawmakers emphasized the importance of aligning U.S. and European financial policies to address emerging threats and opportunities in the global financial system [1].

During the visit, Hill and Gonzalez held discussions with key financial leaders and regulators, focusing on the expanding market for digital assets, particularly tokenization and stablecoins. The delegation briefed European counterparts on developments in the U.S., including the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, which has catalyzed a wave of innovation in stablecoin issuance. The House delegation emphasized the necessity of a secure yet innovative financial system that supports both economic stability and national security interests [2].

In response to growing U.S. influence in digital finance, the European Central Bank (ECB) is reportedly considering a central bank digital currency (CBDC) powered by a public blockchain. This move aims to counter the potential dominance of U.S.-issued stablecoins in the European market. The ECB has been testing various payment use cases and integration strategies for a digital euro, with over 70 organizations participating in the development process. While the ECB has not yet made a formal decision, the exploration of public blockchain technology reflects a strategic shift toward enhancing accessibility and competitiveness [3].

The delegation's efforts underscore the increasing intersection between economic policy and national security, particularly in light of Russian aggression. Hill stressed the importance of a robust transatlantic partnership in addressing financial risks and fostering innovation. The discussions also touched on the development of new financial products and the potential for tokenization to reshape traditional financial systems. The bipartisan nature of the delegation highlights the U.S. Congress's commitment to maintaining a unified approach in shaping the future of global financial governance [1].

Rep. Gonzalez highlighted the significance of cross-Atlantic cooperation, noting that the trip was a step toward ensuring that financial systems remain secure and conducive to innovation. He also shared a notable personal encounter with Pope Leo XIV, emphasizing a broader message of collaboration. The visit not only reinforced economic ties but also contributed to the broader dialogue on the future of digital finance. Gonzalez expressed optimism about continuing bipartisan efforts with Chair Hill and Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters to advance legislative priorities, including those relevant to his constituents in South Texas [1].

The delegation's trip has broader implications for the future of financial regulation and international cooperation. As the U.S. and Europe continue to refine their approaches to digital assets and monetary policy, the discussions initiated during the tour may lay the groundwork for more comprehensive transatlantic agreements. The urgency for such coordination has increased with the rapid expansion of stablecoin markets and the growing use of digital currencies in global transactions. By aligning regulatory frameworks and leveraging technological advancements, both regions aim to shape a financial landscape that is both secure and resilient [2].

 Odell Beckham Jr., 2022 Super Bowl champion with the Los Angeles Rams, converted his 2021 salary into Bitcoin (BTCUSD) through a partnership with Cash App and was met with doubt.


 Now, years later, his decision may have worked out for him after all. In July 2025, Beckham Jr. posted on X saying he was still happy with his decision to receive his salary in Bitcoin.


 Bitcoin was trading at around $64,000 in November 2021 when Beckham Jr. converted his pay. While it's unclear whether Beckham Jr. received his salary as a lump sum (or in increments) or if he sold some of his Bitcoin, that money could be worth more than $1.2 million as of Aug. 29, 2025, excluding taxes.


 In recent weeks, Bitcoin has notched record-highs as institutional investors—like Strategy (formerly known as Microstrategy)—have bolstered their Bitcoin holdings and retail investors have flocked to spot ETFs.


 The enthusiasm for cryptocurrency has also likely been driven by the Trump administration's embrace of digital assets.


 In July, the House announced a ""Crypto Week"" as it mulled over legislation that would regulate cryptocurrency. And Trump signed one of those pieces of legislation, the GENIUS Act, which creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins.


 It's important to note that it hasn't been smooth sailing for cryptocurrency over the last couple of years. In 2022, ""crypto winter"" chilled the market for Bitcoin: the price fell more than 70%, dropping from a high of more than $69,000 in November 2021 to a low of less than $19,000 in 2022.


 Beckham Jr. isn't the only athlete to have his salary converted into Bitcoin. Sean Culkin, former tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, reportedly converted his salary in April 2021. And Russell Okung also received half his salary in Bitcoin the year prior.


 In December 2020, Okung, a former Carolina Panthers offensive tackle, received half of his $13 million NFL salary as Bitcoin, which he did via a Bitcoin startup known as Zap. During that time, Bitcoin's price was around $20,000. Assuming he held onto the full amount today, excluding any taxes that were taken out, that salary would be worth more than $36 million (as of Aug. 29, 2025).


 Beckham Jr. is just one of many NFL players who have turned all or a portion of their salary into Bitcoin. Beckham Jr.'s decision to turn his 2021 salary could have him potentially netting more than $450,000, excluding taxes. But that's assuming he's had diamond hands, holding onto Bitcoin even when prices plunged in 2022.

- Bybit EU partners with Nasdaq to deploy surveillance tech for monitoring 60B+ crypto trades annually under MiCAR compliance.

- The system detects spoofing, wash trading, and insider trading via real-time analysis of order patterns and trade behavior.

- EU regulators endorse the move as critical for market integrity, with full deployment planned by mid-2024 to meet 2024 MiCAR requirements.

- Bybit joins Binance and Kraken in adopting advanced surveillance, reflecting growing regulatory demands for crypto market oversight.

Bybit EU, the European arm of the global cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, has partnered with Nasdaq to leverage its surveillance technology for monitoring over 60 billion cryptocurrency trades annually. This move is part of Bybit EU's broader initiative to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCAR) regulatory framework, which will come into effect across the European Union in 2024. The firm aims to enhance transparency and fraud detection in trading activities, particularly in light of increasingly complex digital asset markets [1].

Nasdaq's surveillance solution is expected to provide Bybit EU with real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing the exchange to detect and report suspicious behavior across its trading platforms. The system will analyze patterns of order flow and trade behavior, helping to flag potential market abuse such as spoofing, wash trading, and insider trading. According to Bybit EU, the partnership is aligned with its commitment to building trust with regulators and institutional investors in Europe [2].

Under MiCAR, crypto exchanges operating in the EU will be required to implement robust surveillance and reporting mechanisms. Bybit EU's engagement with Nasdaq is a proactive step toward meeting these regulatory requirements before the full implementation of MiCAR. The technology is also expected to assist in Bybit EU's efforts to onboard institutional clients who demand higher levels of oversight and compliance assurance [3].

The move has been welcomed by several EU financial regulators, who have emphasized the need for digital asset platforms to adopt industry-leading monitoring tools. Bybit EU has already begun integrating the Nasdaq surveillance system into its trading infrastructure and plans to complete the deployment across all relevant platforms by mid-2024. The firm stated that the system will be continuously updated to adapt to new forms of market manipulation as they emerge [4].

Industry analysts view Bybit EU's collaboration with Nasdaq as a significant development in the maturation of the crypto trading landscape in Europe. The firm joins a growing number of exchanges, including Binance and Kraken, that are adopting similar technologies to comply with evolving regulatory expectations. The use of advanced surveillance systems is seen as a critical factor in improving market integrity and investor confidence [5].

Insiders Say Layer Brett Combines Ethereum's Tech With Dogecoin's Virality","https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-insiders-say-layer-brett-combines-ethereums-tech-with-dogecoins-virality/","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 07:53:36 GMT","

As the crypto market continues to fluctuate, Layer Brett stands out as a promising investment. Combining the advanced technology of Ethereum with the viral nature of Dogecoin, Layer Brett is designed for sustainability and community involvement. Its recent presale success and innovative features suggest it may offer long-term value, making it a top contender for those seeking the best crypto to buy now.

The market has proven many times that the success of a crypto project doesn't depend solely on technology. A strong ecosystem, cultural weight and perfect timing is usually what helps these tokens gain adoption. A simple idea, when tied to a story people connect with, can turn casual buyers into early winners. Layer Brett enters the space with that same awareness. However, rather than leaning only on hype, it is grounding its identity in sustainability and long-term value.

As a Layer 2 project on Ethereum, Layer Brett emerges at a moment when investors are seeking both dependability and innovation. The project is not chasing the same empty boom-and-bust cycle that has defined many meme tokens. Instead, it is creating a community where involvement matters. Holders can stake its native tokens and enjoy up to 1,340% APY, turning Layer Brett into more than just a speculative trade.

That structure makes Layer Brett potentially the best crypto to buy now. It rewards patience and belief without requiring constant trading. Beyond staking, gamified features give users reasons to keep engaging, helping sustain activity even after the hype fades. On top of that, NFT integrations adds another layer of use to the LBRETT ecosystem.

As always, the official Ethereum price is attracting institutional money and attention. This has given ETH traders more confidence even as the rest of the crypto market feels quiet in late-summer trading. Over the last 30 days, ETH has gained more than 14%. Bitcoin, on the other hand, according to price charts, has slipped with a negative return of 7.6%.

Strangely enough, this momentum is not random. Just this week, ETH hit a record price of $4,945 on August 24. This move has placed it firmly at the center of market discussions. ETH traders now see it setting the pace while others struggle to keep up. With this price movement, ETH's performance shows how quickly leadership can change in crypto space and highlights the growing confidence investors have in the Ethereum network.

The Dogecoin price has been trading in a zone that many traders see as a key accumulation range. DOGE's support zone stretches as low as $0.15 and a failure to keep the current uptrend alive could send the price back there. For now, DOGE buyers have managed to defend higher levels. DOGE has avoided sliding to the reload zone with bulls holding firm above $0.20 despite heavy selling pressure. 

Moreover, earlier support was seen closer to $0.22, but DOGE sellers have chipped away at that level. A top analyst called ProjectSyndicate, points to the $0.15–$0.16 range as the bottom of this setup. If the  Dogecoin price falls back that far, it would be an opportunity for accumulation before another possible rally. 

Although ETH and DOGE equally deserve the title of the best crypto to buy now, their growth pales in comparison to LBRETT's remarkable price rally. This is highlighted by the impressive over $1.6 million in presale revenue generated in just a few weeks.

Dogecoin fell 5% in the 24-hour period from Aug. 28 at 09:00 to Aug. 29 at 08:00, tracking broader risk-asset weakness, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

Between Aug. 24–25, an unknown whale shifted 900 million DOGE (~$200 million) to Binance wallets, fueling concerns of distribution and triggering market volatility, the model showed.

Open interest in DOGE futures slipped 8% after the inflows, reflecting lighter speculative positioning. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows whales continue to build exposure, with 680 million DOGE accumulated in August, signaling institutional demand despite retail selling.

However, Dogecoin's network fundamentals remain firm, with hashrate climbing above 2.9 petahashes per second, underscoring mining security at record levels.

Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder now serving as co-founder and chief investment officer of crypto-focused venture capital firm Maelstrom, says Hyperliquid's HYPE token could soar more than 100-fold.

Hayes is best known for inventing the perpetual swap at BitMEX, the derivatives contract that changed crypto trading. At Maelstrom, he invests in early-stage infrastructure projects. In his latest blog post, Hayes argued Hyperliquid's token could rise 126 times, a claim backed by a valuation model produced by Maelstrom.

Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange built on its own blockchain. Unlike Coinbase or Binance, which are companies running private servers, Hyperliquid lives fully on-chain. Traders use it mainly for perpetual futures — contracts that let them bet on crypto prices without an expiry date.

Its native token, HYPE, acts as both a governance tool and an economic stake. Holders can vote on upgrades, stake tokens for rewards and benefit from the way trading fees link to the token's value. In short, Hyperliquid is the venue and HYPE is how users share in its growth.

Hayes begins his case with the big picture. 

He says when governments print too much money, currencies lose value and ordinary savers are forced to speculate just to maintain their standard of living. Those who don't already own houses or stocks see their savings eroded.

For many, especially in emerging markets, the easiest way to save today is with stablecoins such as USDT and USDC — digital dollars that sit natively on blockchains. Once you're holding stablecoins, Hayes argues, the most obvious place to put them to work is crypto itself, since that's the system where those tokens function most easily.

That funnel, according to the Maelstrom CIO, leads straight to Hyperliquid. Hayes says it already dominates decentralized perpetual futures trading, controlling around two-thirds of the market and is starting to grow against centralized giants like Binance.

He points to execution as the difference. He believes that Hyperliquid's small team, led by founder Jeff Yan, ships features faster than rivals with hundreds of employees. The platform feels as fast as Binance, Hayes says, but every step — trading, settlement, collateral management — happens transparently on-chain.

He calls Hyperliquid a “decentralized Binance.” Like Binance, it relies on stablecoins instead of banks for deposits. Unlike Binance, everything is recorded on its blockchain. Hyperliquid's HIP-3 upgrade also lets outside developers create entirely new markets that plug directly into its order book, turning it into a permissionless trading hub.

Then comes the math. Maelstrom's model starts with a bold forecast: by 2028, the total value of stablecoins could reach $10 trillion.

Next, Hayes borrows a ratio from Binance's history. On that exchange, daily trading volume has often equaled about 26.4% of the total stablecoin supply. Apply that ratio to $10 trillion, and Hyperliquid could see about $2.6 trillion in trades every day.

Now add fees. Hyperliquid charges around 0.03% per trade. On $2.6 trillion in daily activity, that works out to roughly $258 billion in annual revenues once you roll it up across the year.

Investors then discount those future revenues into today's money to reflect risk and the time value of money. Hayes uses a 5% rate, which produces a present value of about $5.16 trillion.

Finally, stack that against HYPE's current fully diluted valuation of around $41 billion. Divide the two, and you get Hayes's headline number: a potential 126x upside.

He ties the calculation back to his broader thesis—that weak money forces people into stablecoins, and stablecoins push them into crypto speculation, with Hyperliquid as the rails for that activity and HYPE as the token that captures the economics.

Hayes closes out his thesis with a bold prediction. “The King is dead. Long live the King,” he wrote, arguing Hyperliquid could surpass Binance as the world's largest exchange and that Jeff Yan could one day rival CZ's wealth.

The model depends on big assumptions: a $10 trillion stablecoin market, Hyperliquid holding a Binance-level share, fees holding at 0.03% and discount rates staying low. If those conditions break, so does the outcome.

But Hayes's through-line is simple. If the world saves in stablecoins, the speculation that follows will happen on-chain — and in his view, Hyperliquid is already in the lead.

 Metaplanet's stock has plunged 54% since mid-June, forcing the Tokyo-listed firm to seek alternative fundraising as its share-based “flywheel” falters. 

Metaplanet, the Tokyo-listed firm aggressively accumulating Bitcoin, is facing mounting pressure as its share price tumbles, threatening the fundraising model it has used to build one of the largest corporate Bitcoin treasuries globally.

The company's stock has dropped 54% since mid-June, despite Bitcoin (BTC) gaining around 2% during the same period. The decline has put its capital-raising “flywheel” under stress, a mechanism dependent on rising share prices to unlock funding through MS warrants issued to Evo Fund, its key investor. 

With shares down sharply, exercising these warrants is no longer attractive for Evo, squeezing Metaplanet's liquidity and slowing its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, according to a Sunday report by Bloomberg. 

Led by former Goldman Sachs trader Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet currently holds 18,991 BTC, making it the seventh-largest public holder, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. The firm has ambitions to grow its stack to 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026, and 210,000 BTC by 2027.

With its “flywheel” strategy losing momentum, Gerovich is turning to alternative fundraising. On Wednesday, Metaplanet announced plans to raise approximately 130.3 billion yen ($880 million) through a public share offering in overseas markets. 

Additionally, shareholders will vote on Monday on whether to approve the issuance of up to 555 million preferred shares, a rare instrument in Japan, which could raise as much as 555 billion yen ($3.7 billion).

In an interview with Bloomberg, Gerovich called the preferred shares a “defensive mechanism,” allowing capital infusion without diluting common shareholders if the stock falls further. These shares, expected to offer up to 6% annual dividends and initially capped at 25% of the firm's Bitcoin holdings, may appeal to Japanese investors starved of yield.

However, analysts are cautious. “The Bitcoin premium is what will determine the success of the entire strategy,” said Eric Benoit of Natixis. That premium, the difference between Metaplanet's market cap and the value of its Bitcoin holdings, has fallen from over 8x in June to just 2x, increasing the risk of dilution.

The company has suspended Evo's warrant exercises from Sept. 3 to 30, paving the way for the preferred stock issuance. Whether this shift can stabilize Metaplanet's funding strategy remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, Metaplanet has been upgraded from a small-cap to a mid-cap stock in FTSE Russell's September 2025 Semi-Annual Review, earning inclusion in the FTSE Japan Index. The move follows the company's strong Q2 performance.

 A Bitcoin adviser says Bitcoin could reach as high as $10 million, and people will still be saying, “It can't go any higher, right?” 

Skepticism over Bitcoin's ability to rise further has followed the asset for years, and will likely continue even if the price reaches into the millions, according to a Bitcoin adviser. 

“I think it's going to be that way for a very long time,” The Bitcoin Adviser's Luke Broyles told Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast on Friday.

“I think Bitcoin will be at $5 million, $10 million or more, and people will still be saying, Yeah, well it's 8% of world assets now. It can't go any higher, right?” he added.

Skepticism has followed Bitcoin (BTC) at every price milestone. Each time the asset has reached a new all-time high, critics have questioned its ability to climb further. During price corrections, many skeptics assumed it would never recover.

This year, Bitcoin reached several new all-time highs. Most recently, Bitcoin reached $124,128 on Aug. 14, according to CoinMarketCap. Since then, it has pulled back to $109,290 at the time of publication.

However, Broyles argued that Bitcoin's biggest hurdle isn't technical but psychological, as most people still don't believe it can improve their everyday lives. “Unfortunately, I don't think a lot of people will make that switch until they see that,” he said.

“I think it is going to be an exceedingly long period of time,” he added. 

Broyles suggested that Bitcoin merging with real estate loans will do much more for adoption than convincing Bitcoin skeptics to invest regular amounts over time.

“Like, is it going to be harder to convince somebody who's more skeptical of Bitcoin, hey, you should buy $1,000 of Bitcoin for the next 200 months. Or is it going to be ""Hey, you can refinance your home and convert this equity into Bitcoin, right?” Broyles said.

“I think that is going to blow people's minds,” he said.

A lack of understanding is still one of the biggest obstacles to crypto adoption. According to an August 2024 survey conducted by Australian crypto exchange Swyftx, 43% of 2,229 respondents said they hadn't used the tech because they were unsure how it works.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Bitcoin faces a fee crisis that threatens network security: Can BTCfi help?","https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-fee-crisis-miners-btcfi-2025","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 12:42:55 GMT","

 Bitcoin's daily transaction fees have dropped over 80% since April 2024, raising concerns about long-term network security. BTCfi could offer a way out. 

Daily transaction fees on the Bitcoin network have collapsed by more than 80% since April, according to a report from Galaxy Digital. As of August 2025, nearly 15% of blocks are “free,” meaning they're being mined with minimal or no transaction fees, just one satoshi per virtual byte or less. 

Lower Bitcoin (BTC) transaction fees benefit users but reduce miners' revenue, raising concerns about the sustainability of the network's long-term security model.

Bitcoin's incentive structure relies on miners being compensated for their work through block rewards and transaction fees. But with the April 2024 halving cutting rewards to 3.125 BTC per block, miners are leaning heavily on the fee market, and it's drying up.

“As block rewards shrink, more weight falls on transaction fees,” Pierre Samaties, chief business officer at the Dfinity Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “If usage does not grow, that base thins, and the guarantees weaken. Sustained throughput is essential for the system to defend itself.”

Bitcoin's onchain activity has slowed significantly since the decline of non-monetary trends like Ordinals and Runes. Galaxy's report notes that OP_RETURN transactions, used heavily during the 2024 Ordinals boom, now account for just 20% of daily volume, down from over 60% at their peak.

Meanwhile, alternative layer 1s like Solana are gaining traction for high-frequency use cases like memecoins and NFTs. Furthermore, the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over 1.3 million BTC, has pushed more BTC volume offchain, limiting movement that would otherwise generate fees.

Bitcoin's fee market is elastic by design, meaning that fees rise when demand surges and fall when activity slows. However, if demand continues to shrink, miners may be left with too little incentive to secure the network. Galaxy noted that nearly 50% of recent blocks haven't been full, and mempool activity remains sluggish.

Against this backdrop, a new hope is emerging in the form of BTCfi, Bitcoin-native DeFi. Unlike DeFi on Ethereum or Solana, which uses smart contracts on those chains, BTCfi uses Bitcoin as the base asset while building financial applications like lending, trading and yield generation on layers or protocols that interact directly with the Bitcoin network.

“Every BTCfi action requires moving Bitcoin,” Samaties explained. “Movement drives computation, computation consumes block space, and space carries cost.” In other words, if BTCfi grows, so does onchain activity and fee revenue.

Related: The future of DeFi isn't on Ethereum — it's on Bitcoin

Samaties noted that Bitcoin has long been viewed as “digital gold,” a store of value more than a usable asset. However, he sees it evolving into something more foundational: a financial primitive.

“A financial primitive is a building block developers can use to design flows, tools, and logic,” he said. “In that role, Bitcoin becomes more than an asset to hold, it becomes a programmable component within broader financial systems.”

Julian Mezger, chief marketing officer of Liquidium, also said that infrastructure improvements are setting the stage for change. “The last five years have transformed Bitcoin's infrastructure from a simple settlement layer into a multi-layered ecosystem,” he said. “We're now seeing the foundations for true Bitcoin-native DeFi being laid.”

Huge Cracks in the Earth Are Slicing through Cities, Swallowing Houses and Displacing Thousands of People

Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of losing homes, businesses—and lives—as giant “gullies” expand into cities across Africa

Gigantic trenches known as gullies are opening up in cities in Africa, swallowing up homes and businesses, sometimes in an instant, a study has found.

About 118,600 people, on average, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) alone were displaced between 2004 and 2023, according to researchers reporting their findings in Nature.

Without urgent action, researchers estimate that hundreds of thousands of people across Africa are likely to be displaced within the next 10 years, including more than one-quarter of the 770,000 or so people in the DRC living in the expected expansion zone of these gullies.

“It's an underestimated and severely under-researched hazard,” says study co-author Matthias Vanmaercke, a geographer at the Catholic University of Leuven (KU Leuven) in Belgium. It is caused by “a combination of natural and human factors,” he says, but this is “not at all unavoidable.”

Gullies are expanding across cities that are built on sandy soils and lack adequate drainage. When there are heavy rains, water accumulates on roads and rooftops. When the drainage systems are inadequate, the water finds its way into unprotected ground, carving deep holes that can stretch for hundreds of metres. Over time, the gullies swallow houses and other infrastructure, and sometimes even result in deaths.

Vanmaercke and his colleagues used satellite images taken between 2021 and 2023 to identify 2,922 urban gullies in 26 of 47 cities, covering a cumulative distance of nearly 740 kilometres. The team cross-checked these images with historical aerial photographs stored at the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Belgium and found that only 46 of the gullies were present in the 1950s. This “gave the first clear indication that this is indeed attributable to the ongoing urbanization,” Vanmaercke says.

In 99% of cases, the gullies had expanded by at least 10 square metres between 2004 and 2023. The average gully was 253 metres long and 31 metres across at its widest point, and nearly all of them were linked to the road network. “The water cannot infiltrate, and it concentrates along these roads which basically become big canals that turn into rivers,” says Vanmaercke.

The researchers then combined data on population density with the gully maps. This enabled them to estimate that an average of 118,600 people were displaced because of gullies over the period — with displacement rates more than doubling after 2020.

Guy Ilombe Mawe, a geomorphologist at the Official University of Bukavu in the DRC and a co-author of the paper says that the widening of gullies can be catastrophic and even fatal, and that families living near gullies often have no safe alternatives.

In November 2019, the researchers visited Kinshasa, the DRC's capital and one of the most affected cities, with 868 urban gullies stretching over a total of 221 kilometres. There they met a mother whose home stood near a gully edge. Two days later, several of her children were killed while sheltering at a relative's house, when an expanding gully collapsed overnight. At least 40 people in Kinshasa died that night.

As African cities expand, the threat of expanding gullies is likely to increase. The continent's population is expected to nearly triple by 2050, and rainfall intensities in tropical Africa could increase by up to 15% in the coming decades.

The authors note in their study that preventing gullies from forming is more effective and affordable than is stabilizing them after they form, which can cost upwards of US$1 million per gully. “The trick would be to have interventions that are well thought of and installed in time. But there's such a huge lack of money and resources that usually when something is done, it's either inadequate or too late,” says Vanmaercke.

Ana Mijic, a hydrologist at Imperial College London, says that governments and private-sector organizations need to step up their investments in interventions such as sufficient drainage systems. But high costs and maintenance of long-term solutions act as barriers.

Gina Ziervogel, a geographer at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, says that governments should prioritize sustainable infrastructure. “We need to understand the role of the environment and resources in cities — soil and water particularly — and so engaging experts from those fields is really important.” She adds that involving the affected communities in planning interventions “would go a long way to understanding their insights, both on the experience of living with this and on potential solutions.”

“The sooner we can invest, the better, because we know that the later we leave it, the bigger the scale of the challenge,” says Ziervogel.

EPA Fires ‘Dissent' Statement Signers

The EPA fired five agency employees who signed a June declaration decrying moves that contradict science and undermine public health, alongside four more served removal notices

The Environmental Protection Agency fired five agency employees who had openly signed a June declaration critical of the Trump administration's weakening of pollution, climate and health safety rules. Four more were served removal notices by the agency.

""EPA supervisors made decisions on an individualized basis,"" following investigations, according to an agency statement released on Friday, first reported by the Washington Post.

In the June “Declaration of Dissent,” hundreds of Environmental Protection Agency employees had decried the administration's moves to “undermine the EPA mission of protecting human health and the environment.” Their complaints ranged from EPA ignoring science to “benefit polluters” to the agency dismantling initiatives aimed at protecting disadvantaged communities. Most EPA employees signed anonymously for fear of the type of retribution now seen in the Friday firings, which were widely anticipated after the agency moved to cancel employee bargaining and grievance rights agreements earlier in August. The employees had previously been placed on paid leave after the letter's release by the agency. This employment limbo was extended three times while they were under investigation for preparing the declaration during work hours, since extended into September for many of the remaining signatories.

“The Administration is blatantly lying about the sourced facts of our dissent letter, and are now blatantly retaliating and infringing on our constitutional rights,” says Michael Pasqua, an EPA employee who helps manage the safety of drinking water in Wisconsin and a signatory of the declaration.

During the first Trump administration—noted for the scandal-ridden tenure of Scott Pruitt as the EPA's administrator between late February 2017 and early July 2018—the agency rolled back more than 100 environmental rules. Now that Trump has returned to office, the administration has moved to cut back federal solar and wind power initiatives, as well as more environmental rules. Across science agencies, the administration has fired employees and advisory panel members, stopped grants and issued policies at odds with scientific findings. In July Zeldin moved to revoke the “endangerment” finding that serves as the linchpin for U.S. climate regulation under a 2007 Supreme Court decision.

In response to such moves across science agencies, hundreds of EPA, NASA, National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation staffers have signed on to public letters of dissent, rare rebukes from traditionally reticent federal employees. The letters follow the administration moving to remove tens of thousands of federal employees from agencies. In February Trump mistakenly said during a cabinet meeting that the EPA would likely cut 65 percent of its staff because “a lot of people weren't doing their job.” (White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers later corrected Trump to clarify that the agency was planning to cut 65 percent of its spending.)

More recently, in August, Federal Emergency Management Agency staffers released a “Katrina Declaration,” raising the alarm to Congress about spending restrictions, cuts to disaster prevention programs and “censorship” of climate and environmental science at the agency. Those moves all raised the chances of a disaster like 2005's Hurricane Katrina catastrophe, which took an estimated 1,833 lives, they wrote. In response, FEMA placed 36 nonanonymous signatories on administrative leave, similar to what the EPA has done, raising concerns of firings similar to those now hitting environmental agency signatories.

""This is a betrayal of our nation's most dedicated members of society—we all want clear air and water for ourselves and our families,” said Colette Delawalla of the advocacy group, Stand Up for Science, in a statement. “Whistleblowing is protected by law and these individuals have done nothing wrong.""

AI Spots Hidden Signs of Consciousness in Comatose Patients before Doctors Do

A machine-learning algorithm spotted signs of “covert consciousness” in coma patients—in some cases, days before doctors could do so

Imagine lying in a hospital bed, awake but unable to move your body to communicate with the people around you. This experience of “covert consciousness” is a reality for many people who have sustained traumatic brain injuries. In a new study published in Communications Medicine, researchers found that they could detect signs of consciousness in comatose patients by using artificial intelligence to analyze facial movements that were too small to be noticed by clinicians.

Covert consciousness was first detected in 2006, when researchers asked an unresponsive woman and healthy volunteers to imagine doing specific tasks while in a brain scanner. The team found that the woman showed brain activity in the same regions as the volunteers. Just last year researchers using similar brain imaging methods found that one in four behaviorally unresponsive patients was covertly conscious. Such tests aren't routinely performed on people in an unresponsive state because this type of neuroimaging is time-consuming and its operation requires specialized skills. Instead, doctors typically rely on more subjective visual examinations to gauge a person's level of consciousness, testing whether they open their eyes, respond to commands or startle at a loud noise.

“We were trying to find a way to quantify how conscious these patients are” using simple and readily available technology, says Sima Mofakham, a computational neuroscientist at Stony Brook University and senior author of the new study.

Mofakham and her team recorded videos of 37 patients with recent brain injuries who outwardly appeared to be in a coma. They tracked the participants' facial movements in extraordinary detail—on the level of individual pores—after they were given commands such as “open your eyes” or “stick out your tongue.” The researchers' AI tracking tool, which they call SeeMe, detected any facial movements and then analyzed whether the movements were specific to the command given. SeeMe documented eye-opening responses in 30 of 36 patients and mouth movements in 16 of 17 patients with analyzable videos. Five of these patients did not go on to produce larger signs of movement that were visible to doctors, though most of the others did. On average, SeeMee detected participants trying to open their eyes and moving their mouths respectively 4.1 and 8.3 days before clinicians spotted these signs.

“What we found was: patients develop [small] movements before going to more obvious movements,” Mofakham says. The results suggest that, in some cases, people are conscious days before doctors notice. Patients with larger and more frequent facial movements also had better clinical outcomes, indicating that the technology may help predict prognoses.

This ability to detect consciousness earlier is clinically meaningful, says Jan Claassen, a neurologist at Columbia University, who wasn't involved in the new research. Signs of consciousness can provide another layer of information for doctors and family members choosing between a range of treatments, from palliative care to more aggressive therapies. “Every day is potentially important” for those difficult decisions, Claassen says. Earlier detection could also allow care teams to start rehabilitation programs used to improve patients' motor skills sooner. Separate research shows that starting rehab earlier is associated with greater improvements in physical function.

Consciousness recovery after a brain injury is often gradual and unpredictable. “When somebody recovers consciousness, it's almost like a flickering light bulb,” Claassen says. “It doesn't just come on or off.” The new study only followed participants until six months after they were discharged from the hospital. But it's possible that some patients whose conditions have remained more static and who are currently presumed unconscious in long-term care facilities might also show signs of awareness that could be detected, whether with more advanced neuroimaging techniques or the simpler SeeMe technology. “We have to do the experiments and see,” Mofakham says. “There is a chance.”

Next, Mofakham plans to examine whether patients can answer yes-or-no questions using specific facial movements. “This has a big ethical implication” because people who cannot communicate “cannot participate in their care,” she says. “This study opens a way to communicate with these patients.”

Something had to diverge from the trunk eventually.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

All animals on Earth share a common ancestor. Trace back the history of any creature from humans to slugs, and you'll eventually be able to follow all of the branches on the animal tree of life back to its trunk. 

But that trunk had to branch off at some point, or we wouldn't have all of today's animals. And that first split has been a bit elusive to scientists, due to it taking place around 600 million years ago. 

We know a few things, though. Namely, we know that the first split resulted in the birth of two creatures—the ancestor of almost all animals, and the “sister” to that ancestor. That sister is the ancestor of just one group of modern-day animals. 

For decades, scientists have debated which group of animals traces its lineage back to the “sister” of literally all other animals. They had two contenders for a long time—sea sponges and comb jellies. And now, thanks to new methods enabling researchers to analyze these creature's chromosomes, scientists believe they finally have the answer.

The key to this technique was looking not just at what genes each animal had, but where those genes were located on the creatures' chromosomes. As a creature evolves, chromosomes will rearrange and genes will move around over time. But once they move, it's almost impossible for them to return to their original positions.

So, in essence, whichever animal showed the least re-shuffling of genes on chromosomes must have evolved into existence first. As we know we only have two options for that first split—sponges or comb jellies—whichever option has the least shuffling is the sister. First evolved equals first split.

In order to figure this out, the team compared the placements of certain groups of genes in sponges and comb jellies to the placements of those same groups in their closest single-cell non-animal relatives. Those single-cell relatives would have been closely related to the “trunk” organism, and would preserve evidence of what that original genome would have looked like. The closer an organism is to that genome, the less it's changed, and the more likely it is to be the sister.  

In both the non-animals and the comb jellies, researchers found 14 groups of genes located on separate chromosomes. But in the sponges, researchers found that those 14 groups had been rearranged into 7 groups, indicating that they split off from the original genome later than the comb jellies.

Which means that we have a winner! The sister to all other animals, the first to branch off, and the most genetically isolated animal is … drumroll please … the comb jelly!

Beyond serving as the answer to a long-agonized-over biological question, scientists are excited to investigate what this new knowledge can tell us about the history of animal evolution, and the mechanisms powering that evolution. The search for answers continues, but at least we now have one more in our pockets.

Our understanding of the universe may be completely wrong.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 1687, English physicist Isaac Newton published his famous Law of Universal Gravitation. The idea that all objects attract in proportion to their mass was a revolutionary idea that became a huge boon for understanding the ways of the universe. But even Newton's influential work had its limitations—specifically, it couldn't explain gravitational phenomena such as black holes and gravitational waves. 

Thankfully, Albert Einstein came around in the early 20th century to help patch things up a bit with his Theory of General Relativity. 

But space is a big place, and even Einsteins sometimes meet their limit. One of the most well-known of these limits is a black hole's center, or singularity, where Einstein's famous theory appears to break down completely. Now, a study from scientists at South Korea's Sejong University suggests that another limit to Newton and Einstein's conception of gravity can be found in the orbital motions of long-period, widely separated, binary stars—also known simply as “wide binaries.” The results of this study were published this month in The Astrophysical Journal. 

After analyzing 26,500 wide binaries within 650 lightyears captured by the European Space Agency's Gaia space observatory, co-author Kyu-Hyun Chae discovered something strange—when these celestial objects achieved extremely low orbital accelerations around 0.1 nanometers per second squared, the observed accelerations were nearly 30 to 40 percent higher than Newton-Einstein models would predict. However, if these accelerations were above 10 nanometers per second squared, they followed the Newton-Einstein theory as predicted. Something weird is happening specifically at these ultra-low accelerations. 

In the standard model of gravity, this is where concepts of dark matter become vitally important. Because scientists don't know anything about this hypothetical form of matter and energy that supposedly makes up a majority of the universe, it's possible that dark matter is influencing this strange gravitational interaction. However, Chae argues that Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND—first proposed by Israeli scientist Mordehai Milgrom in 1983—could explain (among other galactic anomalies) these low acceleration deviations.

The most surprising element is that a MOND-influenced theory of gravity—also co-authored by Milgrom—explains this unexpected 1.4 times acceleration boost. This theory is called a A Quadratic Lagrangian, or AQUAL, and Chae says his work “represents a direct evidence for the breakdown of standard gravity at weak acceleration.”

“This systematic deviation agrees with the boost factor that the AQUAL theory predicts for kinematic accelerations in circular orbits under the Galactic external field,” Chae says in the paper.

Similar to how the Newton-Einstein theory relies on the ever-elusive particle known as dark matter, MOND contains its own limitations and challenges. Chae's study appears to be a big +1 in the pro column for Modified Newtonian Dynamics, but the theory is still just that—a theory. It will need much more observational support before it upends our modern understanding of gravity and the universe we inhabit.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

We know what fossils look like. For example, typical dinosaur fossils are bones turned to stone and preserved from the passage of time located, if we're particularly lucky, in large collections that can be reassembled to represent the beast they used to prop up in their entirety. 

Now, not all fossils are like that. Some are just impressions of small creatures or animals left in rocks, but most have something in common—it's just the hard stuff left behind. With the exception of those found in environments particularly adept at preservation, the soft tissues degrade over time and all we're left with is stony bone. 

But not always. Sometimes we get lucky—like a team did when it located a fossil of a 520-million-year-old worm larva that still had its brain and guts intact.

 “It's always interesting to see what's inside a sample using 3D imaging,” Katherine Dobson, one of the co-authors of a study centered on this remarkable find, said in a press release, “but in this incredible tiny larva, natural fossilization has achieved almost perfect preservation.”

That “almost perfect preservation” made the specimen an absolute gold mine for evolutionary biologists. 

According to the press release, the structures observed within the creature—which were studied via 3D images generated from scans made using a technique known as synchrotron X-ray tomography—include a brain, “digestive glands, a primitive circulatory system and even traces of the nerves supplying the larva's simple legs and eyes.” The incredible amount of detail preserved in this ancient fossil showed scientists that we had previously dramatically underestimated the complexity of early arthropods—a group that came into being during the Cambrian Explosion and includes creatures like crabs, lobsters, insects, and millipedes.

That detail also allowed scientists to draw evolutionary connections between the critters of the ancient past and those scuttling around today. For example, preserved in the larva was a region of the brain known as the protocerebrum. Now that scientists have seen it, they can see that it evolved into the “nub” of arthropod heads that has allowed them to thrive in such a wide variety of environments—from the depths of the ocean to every single continent on Earth (yes, including Antarctica).

“When I used to daydream about the one fossil I'd most like to discover,” Martin Smith, the lead researcher on the study, said in a press release, “I'd always be thinking of an arthropod larva, because developmental data are just so central to understanding their evolution. But larvae are so tiny and fragile, the chances of finding one fossilized are practically zero—or so I thought! I already knew that this simple worm-like fossil was something special, but when I saw the amazing structures preserved under its skin, my jaw just dropped—how could these intricate features have avoided decay and still be here to see half a billion years later?”

Right now, the scientists are happily counting themselves lucky that the creature was preserved at all, giving us a unique window into what life looked like in our distant past.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","NASA's Webb Telescope just found 300 galaxies that defy explanation","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250830001153.htm","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 05:12:29 GMT","

In a new study, scientists at the University of Missouri looked deep into the universe and found something unexpected. Using infrared images taken from NASA's powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), they identified 300 objects that were brighter than they should be.

""These mysterious objects are candidate galaxies in the early universe, meaning they could be very early galaxies,"" said Haojing Yan, an astronomy professor in Mizzou's College of Arts and Science and co-author on the study. ""If even a few of these objects turn out to be what we think they are, our discovery could challenge current ideas about how galaxies formed in the early universe -- the period when the first stars and galaxies began to take shape.""

But identifying objects in space doesn't happen in an instant. It takes a careful step-by-step process to confirm their nature, combining advanced technology, detailed analysis and a bit of cosmic detective work.

Step 1: Spotting the first clues

Mizzou's researchers started by using two of JWST's powerful infrared cameras: the Near-Infrared Camera and the Mid-Infrared Instrument. Both are specifically designed to detect light from the most distant places in space, which is key when studying the early universe.

Why infrared? Because the farther away an object is, the longer its light has been traveling to reach us.

""As the light from these early galaxies travels through space, it stretches into longer wavelengths -- shifting from visible light into infrared,"" Yan said. ""This stretching is called redshift, and it helps us figure out how far away these galaxies are. The higher the redshift, the farther away the galaxy is from us on Earth, and the closer it is to the beginning of the universe.""

Step 2: The 'dropout'

To identify each of the 300 early galaxy candidates, Mizzou's researchers used an established method called the dropout technique.

""It detects high-redshift galaxies by looking for objects that appear in redder wavelengths but vanish in bluer ones -- a sign that their light has traveled across vast distances and time,"" said Bangzheng ""Tom"" Sun, a Ph.D. student working with Yan and the lead author of the study. ""This phenomenon is indicative of the 'Lyman Break,' a spectral feature caused by the absorption of ultraviolet light by neutral hydrogen. As redshift increases, this signature shifts to redder wavelengths.""

Step 3: Estimating the details

While the dropout technique identifies each of the galaxy candidates, the next step is to check whether they could be at ""very"" high redshifts, Yan said.

""Ideally this would be done using spectroscopy, a technique that spreads light across different wavelengths to identify signatures that would allow an accurate redshift determination,"" he said.

But when full spectroscopic data is unavailable, researchers can use a technique called spectral energy distribution fitting. This method gave Sun and Yan a baseline to estimate the redshifts of their galaxy candidates -- along with other properties such as age and mass.

In the past, scientists often thought these extremely bright objects weren't early galaxies, but something else that mimicked them. However, based on their findings, Sun and Yan believe these objects deserve a closer look -- and shouldn't be so quickly ruled out.

""Even if only a few of these objects are confirmed to be in the early universe, they will force us to modify the existing theories of galaxy formation,"" Yan said.

Step 4: The final answer

The final test will use spectroscopy -- the gold standard -- to confirm the team's findings.

Spectroscopy breaks light into different wavelengths, like how a prism splits light into a rainbow of colors. Scientists use this technique to reveal a galaxy's unique fingerprint, which can tell them how old the galaxy is, how it formed and what it's made of.

""One of our objects is already confirmed by spectroscopy to be an early galaxy,"" Sun said. ""But this object alone is not enough. We will need to make additional confirmations to say for certain whether current theories are being challenged.''

The study, ""On the very bright dropouts selected using the James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam instrument,"" was published in The Astrophysical Journal.

Beta blockers—drugs commonly prescribed for a range of cardiac conditions, including heart attacks—provide no clinical benefit for patients who have had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction with preserved heart function. Beta blockers have been the standard treatment for these patients for 40 years.

This is a breakthrough discovery from the “REBOOT Trial” with senior investigator Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain's Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). The study results, which could overturn a standard treatment paradigm, were presented on Saturday, August 30, during a “Hot Line” session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid, and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Additionally, a REBOOT substudy, published on August 30 in the European Heart Journal, shows that women treated with beta blockers had a higher risk of death, heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure compared to women not receiving the drug. Men did not have this increased risk.

“This trial will reshape all international clinical guidelines. It joins other previous landmark trials led by CNIC and Mount Sinai—such as SECURE with the polypill and DapaTAVI, with SLT2 inhibition associated to TAVI—that have already transformed some global approaches to cardiovascular disease,” says Dr. Fuster.

The SECURE trial showed a polypill, a single pill that that combines three medications - which contains aspirin, ramipril, and atorvastatin – reduces cardiovascular events by 33 percent in patients treated with this after a heart attack. The DapaTAVI trial showed both dapagliflozin and the related medication empagliflozin - drugs used to treat diabetes- improves the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis treated by transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

“REBOOT will change clinical practice worldwide,” says Principal Investigator Borja Ibáñez, MD, CNIC's Scientific Director, who presented the results. “Currently, more than 80 percent of patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction are discharged on beta blockers. The REBOOT findings represent one of the most significant advances in heart attack treatment in decades.”

Although generally considered safe, beta blockers can cause side effects such as fatigue, bradycardia (low heart rate), and sexual dysfunction. For more than 40 years, beta blockers have been prescribed as a standard treatment after a heart attack, but their benefit in the context of modern treatments was unproven. The REBOOT trial, is the largest clinical trial on this subject. The international study was coordinated by CNIC in collaboration with the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan.

Researchers enrolled 8,505 patients across 109 hospitals in Spain and Italy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive or not receive beta blockers after hospital discharge. All patients otherwise received the current standard of care and were followed for a median of nearly four years. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in rates of death, recurrent heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure.

A REBOOT subgroup analysis found that women treated with beta blockers experienced more adverse events. Results show women treated with beta-blockers had a 2.7 percent higher absolute risk of mortality compared to those not treated with beta-blockers during the 3.7 years of follow-up of the study. The elevated risk when treated with beta-blockers was restricted to women with a complete normal cardiac function after a heart attack (left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 percent or higher). Those with a mild deterioration in cardiac function did not have an excess risk of adverse outcomes when treated with beta-blockers.

“After a heart attack, patients are typically prescribed multiple medications, which can make adherence difficult,” explains Dr. Ibáñez. “Beta blockers were added to standard treatment early on because they significantly reduced mortality at the time. Their benefits were linked to reduced cardiac oxygen demand and arrhythmia prevention. But therapies have evolved. Today, occluded coronary arteries are reopened rapidly and systematically, drastically lowering the risk of serious complications such as arrhythmias. In this new context—where the extent of heart damage is smaller—the need for beta blockers is unclear. While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments.”

That was the motivation behind REBOOT.

“The trial was designed to optimize heart attack care based on solid scientific evidence and without commercial interests. These results will help streamline treatment, reduce side effects, and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year,” Dr. Ibanez adds.

REBOOT was conducted without pharmaceutical industry funding.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","AI exposes 1,000+ fake science journals","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250830001203.htm","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 02:00:43 GMT","

A team of computer scientists led by the University of Colorado Boulder has developed a new artificial intelligence platform that automatically seeks out ""questionable"" scientific journals.

The study, published Aug. 27 in the journal ""Science Advances,"" tackles an alarming trend in the world of research.

Daniel Acuña, lead author of the study and associate professor in the Department of Computer Science, gets a reminder of that several times a week in his email inbox: These spam messages come from people who purport to be editors at scientific journals, usually ones Acuña has never heard of, and offer to publish his papers -- for a hefty fee.

Such publications are sometimes referred to as ""predatory"" journals. They target scientists, convincing them to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to publish their research without proper vetting.

""There has been a growing effort among scientists and organizations to vet these journals,"" Acuña said. ""But it's like whack-a-mole. You catch one, and then another appears, usually from the same company. They just create a new website and come up with a new name.""

His group's new AI tool automatically screens scientific journals, evaluating their websites and other online data for certain criteria: Do the journals have an editorial board featuring established researchers? Do their websites contain a lot of grammatical errors?

Acuña emphasizes that the tool isn't perfect. Ultimately, he thinks human experts, not machines, should make the final call on whether a journal is reputable.

But in an era when prominent figures are questioning the legitimacy of science, stopping the spread of questionable publications has become more important than ever before, he said.

""In science, you don't start from scratch. You build on top of the research of others,"" Acuña said. ""So if the foundation of that tower crumbles, then the entire thing collapses.""

The shake down

When scientists submit a new study to a reputable publication, that study usually undergoes a practice called peer review. Outside experts read the study and evaluate it for quality -- or, at least, that's the goal.

A growing number of companies have sought to circumvent that process to turn a profit. In 2009, Jeffrey Beall, a librarian at CU Denver, coined the phrase ""predatory"" journals to describe these publications.

Often, they target researchers outside of the United States and Europe, such as in China, India and Iran -- countries where scientific institutions may be young, and the pressure and incentives for researchers to publish are high.

""They will say, 'If you pay $500 or $1,000, we will review your paper,'"" Acuña said. ""In reality, they don't provide any service. They just take the PDF and post it on their website.""

A few different groups have sought to curb the practice. Among them is a nonprofit organization called the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Since 2003, volunteers at the DOAJ have flagged thousands of journals as suspicious based on six criteria. (Reputable publications, for example, tend to include a detailed description of their peer review policies on their websites.)

But keeping pace with the spread of those publications has been daunting for humans.

To speed up the process, Acuña and his colleagues turned to AI. The team trained its system using the DOAJ's data, then asked the AI to sift through a list of nearly 15,200 open-access journals on the internet.

Among those journals, the AI initially flagged more than 1,400 as potentially problematic.

Acuña and his colleagues asked human experts to review a subset of the suspicious journals. The AI made mistakes, according to the humans, flagging an estimated 350 publications as questionable when they were likely legitimate. That still left more than 1,000 journals that the researchers identified as questionable.

""I think this should be used as a helper to prescreen large numbers of journals,"" he said. ""But human professionals should do the final analysis.""

A firewall for science

Acuña added that the researchers didn't want their system to be a ""black box"" like some other AI platforms.

""With ChatGPT, for example, you often don't understand why it's suggesting something,"" Acuña said. ""We tried to make ours as interpretable as possible.""

The team discovered, for example, that questionable journals published an unusually high number of articles. They also included authors with a larger number of affiliations than more legitimate journals, and authors who cited their own research, rather than the research of other scientists, to an unusually high level.

The new AI system isn't publicly accessible, but the researchers hope to make it available to universities and publishing companies soon. Acuña sees the tool as one way that researchers can protect their fields from bad data -- what he calls a ""firewall for science.""

""As a computer scientist, I often give the example of when a new smartphone comes out,"" he said. ""We know the phone's software will have flaws, and we expect bug fixes to come in the future. We should probably do the same with science.""

Co-authors on the study included Han Zhuang at the Eastern Institute of Technology in China and Lizheng Liang at Syracuse University in the United States.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Astronomers stunned as James Webb finds a planet nursery flooded with carbon dioxide","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250830001150.htm","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 11:03:45 GMT","

A study led by Jenny Frediani at Stockholm University has revealed a planet-forming disk with a strikingly unusual chemical composition: an unexpectedly high abundance of carbon dioxide (CO2) in regions where Earth-like planets may one day form. The discovery, made using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), challenges long-standing assumptions about the chemistry of planetary birthplaces. The study is published in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

""Unlike most nearby planet-forming disks, where water vapor dominates the inner regions, this disk is surprisingly rich in carbon dioxide,"" says Jenny Frediani, PhD student at the Department of Astronomy, Stockholm University.

""In fact, water is so scarce in this system that it's barely detectable -- a dramatic contrast to what we typically observe.""

A newly formed star is initially deeply embedded in the gas cloud from which it was formed and creates a disk around itself where planets in turn can be formed. In conventional models of planet formation, pebbles rich in water ice drift from the cold outer disk toward the warmer inner regions, where the rising temperatures cause the ices to sublimate. This process usually results in strong water vapor signatures in the disk's inner zones. However, in this case, the JWST/MIRI spectrum shows a puzzlingly strong carbon dioxide signature instead.

""This challenges current models of disk chemistry and evolution since the high carbon dioxide levels relative to water cannot be easily explained by standard disk evolution processes,"" Jenny Frediani explains.

Arjan Bik, researcher at the Department of Astronomy, Stockholm University, adds, ""Such a high abundance of carbon dioxide in the planet-forming zone is unexpected. It points to the possibility that intense ultraviolet radiation -- either from the host star or neighbouring massive stars -- is reshaping the chemistry of the disk.""

The researchers also detected rare isotopic variants of carbon dioxide, enriched in either carbon-13 or the oxygen isotopes ¹⁷O and ¹⁸O, clearly visible in the JWST data. These isotopologues could offer vital clues to long-standing questions about the unusual isotopic fingerprints found in meteorites and comets -- relics of our own Solar System's formation.

This CO2-rich disk was found in the massive star-forming region NGC 6357, located approximately 1.7 kiloparsecs (about 53 quadrillion kilometers) away. The discovery was made by the eXtreme Ultraviolet Environments (XUE) collaboration, which focuses on how intense radiation fields impact disk chemistry.

Maria-Claudia Ramirez-Tannus from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg and lead of the XUE collaboration says that it is an exciting discovery: ""It reveals how extreme radiation environments -- common in massive star-forming regions -- can alter the building blocks of planets. Since most stars and likely most planets form in such regions, understanding these effects is essential for grasping the diversity of planetary atmospheres and their habitability potential.""

Thanks to JWST's MIRI instrument, astronomers can now observe distant, dust-enshrouded disks with unprecedented detail at infrared wavelengths -- providing critical insights into the physical and chemical conditions that govern planet formation. By comparing these intense environments with quieter, more isolated regions, researchers are uncovering the environmental diversity that shapes emerging planetary systems. Astronomers at Stockholm University and Chalmers have helped develop the MIRI instrument which is a camera and a spectrograph that observes mid- to long-wavelength infrared radiation from 5 microns to 28 microns. It also has coronagraphs, specifically designed to observe exoplanets.

The study ""XUE: The CO2-rich terrestrial planet-forming region of an externally irradiated Herbig disk"" is published in Astronomy & Astrophysics.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Our solar system has a new interstellar visitor: Meet 3I/ATLAS","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250829235726.htm","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 02:01:43 GMT","

A team of international astronomers, including a University of Michigan doctoral student, were the first to publish the discovery of just the third known interstellar object to visit our solar system on July 3.

Now, two of the researchers involved -- Aster Taylor of the U-M Department of Astronomy and Darryl Seligman of Michigan State University -- have authored a new study starting to characterize this far-flung object, dubbed 3I/ATLAS.

Interstellar objects are born outside our solar system and cruise through it without falling into a stable orbit around the sun. 3I/ATLAS and its two predecessors have opened rare, invaluable opportunities for researchers to learn new things about distant parts of our galaxy.

""This is what we're here for -- finding objects like this, making the public aware of them and generating excitement,"" said Aster Taylor, a Fannie and John Hertz Fellow in the U-M Department of Astronomy.

That public excitement, in turn, keeps momentum going for funding and the new tools to enable future discoveries. For example, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, which is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy, came online this summer. Although it did not discover 3I/ATLAS, it's projected to find one or two new interstellar objects per year, Taylor said.

""It's an auspicious time to find cool objects,"" Taylor said. ""We're excited about three, but if we can get to 10 or more of these things, then we'll have a reasonable sample and we'll be really excited about that.""

Both reports are available as preprints on arXiv. Taylor and Seligman also authored an op-ed about the discovery for Space.com.

Tale of the tape

The discovery of 3I/ATLAS was made possible by NASA's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. ATLAS consists of four telescopes -- two in Hawaii, one in Chile and one in South Africa -- that automatically scan the whole sky several times every night looking for moving objects.

ATLAS's name hints at one of the most pressing factoids about this object: It's not going to make terrestrial impact. That is, it won't crash into Earth. In fact, it won't get any closer to us than we are to the sun.

Also, it's likely a comet, Taylor said. It's enveloped by what's known as a coma, a fuzzy cloud of gas and dust around its rocky nucleus. As 3I/ATLAS nears the sun, that coma will likely evolve and reveal interesting clues about its composition.

""3I/ATLAS likely contains ices, especially below the surface, and those ices may start to activate as it nears the sun,"" said Seligman, a postdoctoral fellow at MSU. ""But until we detect specific gas emissions, like H2O, CO or CO2, we can't say for sure what kinds of ice or how much there is.""

Over the coming months, space telescopes like Hubble and JWST will be able to zoom in on 3I/ATLAS to probe these and other questions about its size, spin and how it reacts to being heated.

""We have these images of 3I/ATLAS where it's not entirely clear and it looks fuzzier than the other stars in the same image,"" said James Wray, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology who was involved in the discovery. ""The object is pretty far away and, so, we just don't know.""

Still, the researchers were able to work out some important characteristics from their initial observations. Specifically, 3I/ATLAS is faster, larger and older than its predecessors, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.

3I/ATLAS has a hyperbolic velocity of just under 60 kilometers per second -- roughly 130,000 miles per hour -- compared to 26 for 'Oumuamua and 32 for Borisov. The diameter of 3I/ATLAS is currently estimated to be as much as 10 kilometers, or 6 miles, which would be 100 times that of 'Oumuamua and 10 times that of Borisov.

But Taylor is confident those numbers will shrink as astronomers get better observations of 3I/ATLAS. Such a large size would imply galaxies are way more efficient at making these kinds of objects than is physically possible.

Finally, 'Oumuamua and Borisov have ages measured in millions of years, while 3I/ATLAS appears to be between 3 billion and 11 billion years old.

""It's a wide range,"" Taylor said. ""But 11 billion years is pretty old. It's about as old as the galaxy.""

This is another number that Taylor suspects will ultimately turn out to be toward the smaller end of the range. But it will be interesting regardless because it can provide more clues about how our galaxy was forming stars, planets and other objects earlier in its history.

The discovery

Taylor was recruited for the project while traveling to help confirm 3I/ATLAS was an interstellar object and make early characterizations. And there was a time crunch. If the ATLAS team had noticed 3I, odds were other astronomers had, too, and the team wanted to confirm its suspicions and get the news out first.

""I was fully on vacation in Fiji with my family when this was announced. When I heard, I just thought, 'All right. Well, that's my next two days,'"" Taylor said. ""It's very exciting, but it's also more stressful than you might think.""

Seligman had a little bit more notice, but not much. News started to spread within the group on July 1.

""I heard something about the object before I went to bed, but we didn't have a lot of information yet,"" Seligman said. ""By the time I woke up around 1 a.m., my colleagues, Marco Micheli from the European Southern Observatory and Davide Farnocchia from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, were emailing me that this was likely for real. I started sending messages telling everyone to turn their telescopes to look at this object.""

Larry Denneau, a member of the ATLAS team, reviewed and submitted the discovery observations from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile shortly after it was observed.

""We have had false alarms in the past about interesting objects, so we know not to get too excited on the first day,"" Denneau said. ""But the incoming observations were all consistent, and late that night it looked like we had the real thing.""

John Tonry, another member of ATLAS and professor at the University of Hawaii, was instrumental in the design and construction of ATLAS, the survey that discovered 3I.

""It's really gratifying every time our hard work surveying the sky discovers something new, and this comet that has been traveling for millions of years from another star system is particularly interesting,"" he said.

Once 3I/ATLAS was confirmed, Seligman and Karen Meech, faculty chair for the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii, both managed the communications flow and worked on getting the data pulled together for submitting the paper.

""Once 3I/ATLAS was identified as likely interstellar, we mobilized rapidly,"" Meech said. ""We activated observing time on major facilities like the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope and the Gemini Observatory to capture early, high-quality data and build a foundation for detailed follow-up studies.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Cells “vomit” waste in a hidden healing shortcut that could also fuel cancer","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250830001207.htm","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 02:01:54 GMT","

When injured, cells have well-regulated responses to promote healing. These include a long-studied self-destruction process that cleans up dead and damaged cells as well as a more recently identified phenomenon that helps older cells revert to what appears to be a younger state to help grow back healthy tissue.

Now, a new study in mice led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Baylor College of Medicine reveals a previously unknown cellular purging process that may help injured cells revert to a stem cell-like state more rapidly. The investigators dubbed this newly discovered response cathartocytosis, taking from Greek root words that mean cellular cleansing.

Published online in the journal Cell Reports, the study used a mouse model of stomach injury to provide new insights into how cells heal, or fail to heal, in response to damage, such as from an infection or inflammatory disease.

""After an injury, the cell's job is to repair that injury. But the cell's mature cellular machinery for doing its normal job gets in the way,"" said first author Jeffrey W. Brown, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of medicine in the Division of Gastroenterology at WashU Medicine. ""So, this cellular cleanse is a quick way of getting rid of that machinery so it can rapidly become a small, primitive cell capable of proliferating and repairing the injury. We identified this process in the GI tract, but we suspect it is relevant in other tissues as well.""

Brown likened the process to a ""vomiting"" or jettisoning of waste that essentially adds a shortcut, helping the cell declutter and focus on regrowing healthy tissues faster than it would be able to if it could only perform a gradual, controlled degradation of waste.

As with many shortcuts, this one has potential downsides: According to the investigators, cathartocytosis is fast but messy, which may help shed light on how injury responses can go wrong, especially in the setting of chronic injury. For example, ongoing cathartocytosis in response to an infection is a sign of chronic inflammation and recurring cell damage that is a breeding ground for cancer. In fact, the festering mess of ejected cellular waste that results from all that cathartocytosis may also be a way to identify or track cancer, according to the researchers.

A novel cellular process

The researchers identified cathartocytosis within an important regenerative injury response called paligenosis, which was first described in 2018 by the current study's senior author, Jason C. Mills, MD, PhD. Now at the Baylor College of Medicine, Mills began this work while he was a faculty member in the Division of Gastroenterology at WashU Medicine and Brown was a postdoctoral researcher in his lab.

In paligenosis, injured cells shift away from their normal roles and undergo a reprogramming process to an immature state, behaving like rapidly dividing stem cells, as happens during development. Originally, the researchers assumed the decluttering of cellular machinery in preparation for this reprogramming happens entirely inside cellular compartments called lysosomes, where waste is digested in a slow and contained process.

From the start, though, the researchers noticed debris outside the cells. They initially dismissed this as unimportant, but the more external waste they saw in their early studies, the more Brown began to suspect that something deliberate was going on. He utilized a model of mouse stomach injury that triggered the reprogramming of mature cells to a stem cell state all at once, making it obvious that the ""vomiting"" response -- now happening in all the stomach cells simultaneously -- was a feature of paligenosis, not a bug. In other words, the vomiting process was not just an accidental spill here and there but a newly identified, standard way cells behaved in response to injury.

Although they discovered cathartocytosis happening during paligenosis, the researchers said cells could potentially use cathartocytosis to jettison waste in other, more worrisome situations, like giving mature cells that ability to start to act like cancer cells.

The downside to downsizing

While the newly discovered cathartocytosis process may help injured cells proceed through paligenosis and regenerate healthy tissue more rapidly, the tradeoff comes in the form of additional waste products that could fuel inflammatory states, making chronic injuries harder to resolve and correlating with increased risk of cancer development.

""In these gastric cells, paligenosis -- reversion to a stem cell state for healing -- is a risky process, especially now that we've identified the potentially inflammatory downsizing of cathartocytosis within it,"" Mills said. ""These cells in the stomach are long-lived, and aging cells acquire mutations. If many older mutated cells revert to stem cell states in an effort to repair an injury -- and injuries also often fuel inflammation, such as during an infection -- there's an increased risk of acquiring, perpetuating and expanding harmful mutations that lead to cancer as those stem cells multiply.""

More research is needed, but the authors suspect that cathartocytosis could play a role in perpetuating injury and inflammation in Helicobacter pylori infections in the gut. H. pylori is a type of bacteria known to infect and damage the stomach, causing ulcers and increasing the risk of stomach cancer.

The findings also could point to new treatment strategies for stomach cancer and perhaps other GI cancers. Brown and WashU Medicine collaborator Koushik K. Das, MD, an associate professor of medicine, have developed an antibody that binds to parts of the cellular waste ejected during cathartocytosis, providing a way to detect when this process may be happening, especially in large quantities. In this way, cathartocytosis might be used as a marker of precancerous states that could allow for early detection and treatment.

""If we have a better understanding of this process, we could develop ways to help encourage the healing response and perhaps, in the context of chronic injury, block the damaged cells undergoing chronic cathartocytosis from contributing to cancer formation,"" Brown said.

The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine.

Take a deep breath. A flow of air has rushed into your lungs, where the oxygen moves into your bloodstream, fueling metabolic fires in cells throughout your body. You, being an aerobic organism, use oxygen as the cellular spark that frees molecular energy from the food you eat. But not all organisms on the planet live or breathe this way. Instead of using oxygen to harvest energy, many single-celled life-forms that live in environments far from oxygen's reach, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents or stygian crevices in the soil, wield other elements to respire and unlock energy.

This physical separation of the oxygen-rich and oxygen-free worlds is not merely a matter of life utilizing available resources; it's a biochemical necessity. Oxygen doesn't play nice with the metabolic pathways that make it possible to respire with the use of other elements, such as sulfur or manganese. It gives aerobes like us life, but for many anaerobes, or creatures that respire without oxygen, oxygen is a toxin that reacts with and damages their specialized molecular machinery.

“Oxygen—we love it, of course,” said Courtney Stairs, an evolutionary biologist at Lund University in Sweden. “But it's actually a pretty harmful molecule for most of life on our planet, and even ourselves. We have ways to mitigate the negative effects of oxygen. So we can't imagine life without it, but life is actually quite hard with it.”

For the first couple billion years of life on Earth, organisms avoided this predicament altogether. Back then, the air and oceans were mostly devoid of oxygen, so life was almost entirely anaerobic, or non-oxygen-breathing. Then, around 2.7 billion years ago, the seas filled with industrious, photosynthetic cyanobacteria. They had invented a way to turn sunlight into sugar and oxygen, and they flourished. Over hundreds of millions of years, their accumulated breathing filled the atmosphere and oceans with oxygen. This so-called Great Oxidation Event was a pivotal transformation in the biosphere and the physical chemistry of Earth's atmosphere and oceans. In this new environment, aerobic respiration evolved to dominate the world.

An ongoing mystery for researchers is how life navigated the shift from anaerobic to aerobic respiration; so much microbial biodiversity had to adapt to a world filled with what was once a biochemical bane. Now researchers have fresh insight into what that transition could have looked like billions of years ago, gleaned from an organism living today. A bacterium that researchers collected from the cauldron of a Yellowstone National Park hot spring does something that life really shouldn't be able to do: It runs aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms simultaneously. It breathes oxygen and sulfur at the same time.

The findings “remind us yet again of just how much we still have to learn about microbial diversity and metabolism,” said Natalia Mrnjavac, a graduate student in evolutionary microbiology at Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf in Germany who was not involved in the study. “And for someone who loves microbes, that is thrilling.”

The findings, which were published earlier this year in Nature Communications, challenge assumptions about the limits of cellular respiration and may give researchers a model for understanding how life walks the edge of paradise and poison.

It has long been known that life-forms have evolved ways of alternating between aerobic and anaerobic respiration, for instance as a last resort when oxygen levels are low. But because oxygen disrupts anaerobic respiration, many researchers assumed that cells couldn't grow while using both processes at the same time.

So when Eric Boyd, a microbiologist at Montana State University in Bozeman, and his colleagues uncovered reports from the late 1990s and early 2000s suggesting that some bacteria might be doing just that, their curiosity was piqued. Specifically, bacteria had been observed making sulfide, a product of anaerobic respiration, even when oxygen was present in the environment. “It's weird to read something like that because it challenges the textbooks—of what you know to be true of microbial metabolism,” he recalled.

Eric Boyd collects microorganisms from hostile environments, such as hot springs, to examine how they manage to survive there.

Boyd is interested in how life evolves and persists in some of the most chemically and thermally hostile places on Earth. He and his team study the mix of hardy microbes living in the seams between the surface and subterranean worlds, including the volcanic vents and thermal pools of Yellowstone National Park, not far from his university in Montana. The strange microbe, which appeared to use anaerobic respiration even when oxygen was available, was right up his alley. To learn more about it, Boyd and his team would have to explore the kinds of turbulent springs such a microbe would prefer, where volcanic bubbles mix with the oxygen-rich atmosphere and oxygen-free underground water.

From a roadside thermal spring near Nymph Lake in the northwest portion of the park, they collected and isolated a strain dubbed Hydrogenobacter RSW1. RSW1 seemed like a natural candidate for a study in unusual respiration. The bacterium is common in volcanically influenced hot springs around the world, from Iceland to New Zealand, and can grow on very limited amounts of oxygen. Plus, it is in the same order, Aquificales, as the curious microbes from the earlier reports. The researchers brought it back to the lab so they could grow it and study its metabolism.

The team members went through a process of incrementally determining what elements and molecules the bacterial strain could grow on. They already knew it could use oxygen, so they tested other combinations in the lab. When oxygen was absent, RSW1 could process hydrogen gas and elemental sulfur—chemicals it would find spewing from a volcanic vent—and create hydrogen sulfide as a product. Yet while the cells were technically alive in this state, they didn't grow or replicate. They were making a small amount of energy—just enough to stay alive, nothing more. “The cell was just sitting there spinning its wheels without getting any real metabolic or biomass gain out of it,” Boyd said.

Then the team added oxygen back into the mix. As expected, the bacteria grew faster. But, to the researchers' surprise, RSW1 also still produced hydrogen sulfide gas, as if it were anaerobically respiring. In fact, the bacteria seemed to be breathing both aerobically and anaerobically at once, and benefiting from the energy of both processes. This double respiration went further than the earlier reports: The cell wasn't just producing sulfide in the presence of oxygen but was also performing both conflicting processes at the same time. Bacteria simply shouldn't be able to do that.

“That set us down this path of ‘OK, what the heck's really going on here?'” Boyd said.

RSW1 appears to have a hybrid metabolism, running an anaerobic sulfur-based mode at the same time it runs an aerobic one using oxygen.

“For an organism to be able to bridge both those metabolisms is very unique,” said Ranjani Murali, an environmental microbiologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who was not involved in the research. Normally when anaerobic organisms are exposed to oxygen, damaging molecules known as reactive oxygen compounds create stress, she said. “For that not to happen is really interesting.”

In the thermal spring Roadside West (left) in Yellowstone National Park, researchers isolated an unusual microbe from the gray-colored biofilm (right).

Boyd's team observed that the bacteria grew best when running both metabolisms simultaneously. It may be an advantage in its unique environment: Oxygen isn't evenly distributed in hot springs like those where RSW1 lives. In constantly changing conditions, where you could be bathed in oxygen one moment only for it to disappear, hedging one's metabolic bets might be a highly adaptive trait.

Other microbes have been observed breathing two ways at once: anaerobically with nitrate and aerobically with oxygen. But those processes use entirely different chemical pathways, and when paired together, they tend to present an energetic cost to the microbes. In contrast, RSW1's hybrid sulfur/oxygen metabolism bolsters the cells instead of dragging them down.

This kind of dual respiration may have evaded detection until now because it was considered impossible. “You have really no reason to look” for something like this, Boyd said. Additionally, oxygen and sulfide react with each other quickly; unless you were watching for sulfide as a byproduct, you might miss it entirely, he added.

It's possible, in fact, that microbes with dual metabolisms are widespread, Murali said. She pointed to the many habitats and organisms that exist at tenuous gradients between oxygen-rich and oxygen-free areas. One example is in submerged sediments, which can harbor cable bacteria. These elongated microbes orient themselves in such a way that one end of their bodies can use aerobic respiration in oxygenated water while the other end is buried deep in anoxic sediment and uses anaerobic respiration. Cable bacteria thrive in their precarious partition by physically separating their aerobic and anaerobic processes. But RSW1 appears to multitask while tumbling around in the roiling spring.

It's still unknown how RSW1 bacteria manage to protect their anaerobic machinery from oxygen. Murali speculated that the cells might create chemical supercomplexes within themselves that can surround, isolate and “scavenge” oxygen, she said—using it up quickly once they encounter it so there is no chance for the gas to interfere with the sulfur-based breathing.

RSW1 and any other microbes that have dual metabolism make intriguing models for how microbial life may have evolved during the Great Oxygenation Event, Boyd said. “That must have been a quite chaotic time for microbes on the planet,” he said. As a slow drip of oxygen filtered into the atmosphere and sea, any life-form that could handle an occasional brush with the new, poisonous gas—or even use it to its energetic benefit—may have been at an advantage. In that time of transition, two metabolisms may have been better than one.

Trouble is brewing for the Digital Services Act (DSA), the landmark European law governing big tech platforms. On August 21, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), sent a scathing letter to a number of tech giants, including Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. The letter's subject: the European Digital Services Act cannot be applied if it jeopardizes freedom of expression and, above all, the safety of US citizens.

The opening of the letter—signed by FTC chairman Andrew Ferguson—features a prominent reference to the First Amendment of the US Constitution, namely freedom of speech: “Online platforms have become central to public debate, and the pervasive online censorship in recent years has outraged the American people. Not only have Americans been censored and banned from platforms for expressing opinions and beliefs not shared by a small Silicon Valley elite, but the previous administration actively worked to encourage such censorship.”

The Trump administration intends to reverse course, and it is in this direction that the attack on ""foreign powers,"" the European Union and in the United Kingdom, and in particular on the Digital Services Act and the Online Safety Act, begins. The letter also indirectly references GDPR, the European regulation on the protection of personal data, whose measures are ""aimed at imposing censorship and weakening end-to-end encryption"" with the result of a weakening of Americans' freedoms, according to the letter.

In the letter, the US Antitrust Authority specifically asked the 13 companies to report ""how they intend to comply with incorrect international regulatory requirements"" (the deadline for scheduling a meeting was set for August 28) and recalled their ""obligations towards American consumers under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices"" that could distort the market or compromise safety.

And it is precisely on the security front, and especially on the adoption of end-to-end encryption, that the FTC calls big tech companies to order: ""Companies that promise that their service is secure or encrypted, but fail to use end-to-end encryption where appropriate, may deceive consumers who reasonably expect this level of privacy."" Furthermore, ""certain circumstances may require the use of end-to-end encryption, and failure to implement such measures may constitute an unfair practice."" The weakening of encryption or other security measures to comply with laws or requests from a foreign government may therefore violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the document states.

In a tweet on X, Ferguson wrote flatly that ""if companies censor Americans or weaken privacy and communications security at the request of a foreign power, I will not hesitate to enforce the law.""

""In a global society like the one we live in, overlaps and interferences between different legal systems are natural. Just think of those, in the opposite direction, between European privacy legislation and the famous American Cloud Act,"" Guido Scorza, a member of the Italian Data Protection Authority, told WIRED. Scorza believes that in the event of significant discrepancies, “it will be up to the US government and the European Commission to identify corrective measures capable of guaranteeing the sovereignty, including digital, of each country.”

We've all been there: You moved your TV or computer monitor with bare hands and got it all greasy, or you splashed a bit of liquid on it in sports- or video-game-fueled excitement. How do you clean your screen? Read our guide below for pro tips.

Interested in other screen-related information? Be sure to check out our list of the Best TVs, Best OLEDS, Best Cheap TVs, and How To Buy a TV. Interested in computer monitors? We have a guide to the Best Computer Monitors too. As usual, all our latest coverage is on our Televisions page.

While older, glass-fronted TVs were easy to clean with any anti-static rag and cleaner, you need to be more careful with modern screens, which aren't protected.

The best method for cleaning off the small amount of dirt, grease, dust, or other muck that has accumulated on your TV? Ditch the solvent and just use a soft, dry microfiber cloth ($26 for 80) to clean the display. Wipe in a circular motion, much like you would when brushing your teeth or cleaning your counters.

If things are too gunky for a clean rag to pick up, reach for some distilled and deionized water ($17 per gallon), which won't leave spots or have impurities that can damage your screen. Put a little on the cloth and wipe, following up with a fresh dry rag.

In a worst-case scenario, you can add a tiny amount of Dawn dish soap ($15 for 112 ounces) to the water (read: add a drop to an entire spray bottle [$8 for 2]) and use that. If you do this, you'll want to wipe a second time with distilled water, then again with a dry rag to ensure no residue is left behind. Remember: screens aren't waterproof at the edges, so be sure to go lightly with water if you're using it.

It is typically easier to see how dirty your screen is when it is off, so I recommend turning it off or unplugging it when doing a cleaning. Be careful not to press too hard when rubbing, as you can damage your screen.

Some of these are totally fine to use! Just make sure to check the package and make sure they are rated for displays, and that whatever you choose doesn't have alcohol (common) or other harmful chemicals like ammonia or acetone (rare) that could damage your screen.

I recommend just buying a pack of microfiber cloths, a spray bottle, and a gallon of distilled water, because you can use them to clean many things other than screens, but screen wipes can be a good option for folks on the go. My favorite are these Lens and Screen Wipes ($8 for 100), which I also sometimes keep at my desk to clean my glasses.

Momentum for space development is growing on a global scale.

The rocket company SpaceX, led by CEO Elon Musk, has been carrying out numerous missions since putting its partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket into service. The company now boasts the highest launch frequency in the world, and this has helped boost the number of rocket launches worldwide to 254 last year. This is a dramatic increase of more than 20 percent compared to the previous year.

In Japan, Honda has begun developing a reusable rocket, and it was reported just this June that it had successfully taken off and landed in its first launch test. However, despite Japan being described as a suitable location for rocket launch tests due to its geography, there were only five launches in Japan last year, far behind the number of launches by nations with advanced space programs like the United States, China, and Russia.

The Japanese company &Space Project aims to reverse this trend and expand the base of Japan's space industry. The company has launched a new initiative in cooperation with Noon by Material Record, a research and development project led by the Nomura Corporation Group, which produces acoustic devices using sustainable materials.

This partnership has given birth to Debris, a speaker fashioned out of the tank of a space rocket. The design incorporates scrap parts from the test fuel tanks of the commercial rockets produced in the town of Taiki in Hokkaido.

A release party for Debris was held this past June at CITAN in Nihonbashi.

Taiki is is a hub for Japan's space industry and home to the Hokkaido Space Port, which is used by private companies and university research institutes around the world involved in space development. It's also used by Honda for its reusable rocket takeoff and landing tests.

Debris reuses the waste material from Taiki's rocket tanks as the cabinets for the cylindrical speakers. In typical speaker design, the driver unit that emits sound faces the side of the cabinet, making it easier to direct sound to the listener. Debris is unique in that the driver units are positioned at the top of the enclosure and are designed to emit sound upward. The sound is then deflected by a sphere mounted on top of the cabinet, which causes the audio waves to resonate in all directions. Listeners can experience Debris' pleasant sound no matter where they are standing around the speaker.

The cylindrical cabinet shows welding marks from the fabrication of the test fuel tank.

The components of the sound-deflecting arrangement are made of space-related materials. One piece is an antenna-shaped object made of FRP resin, which is used in rockets and satellite parts. The other piece is a spherical object made of elements that make up the Earth—copper, iron, and aluminum—which have been melted down and reconstructed into a planet-like orb.

The spherical part was created by goldsmith Kazuhiro Toyama, a 2024 finalist for the Loewe Foundation Craft Prize. The beauty of the form, which depicts the oxidation and decay of copper, is intended to remind us of the life of the Earth floating in space.

At the release event, after an explanation by the project team, the audience was able to experience the performance of original music created by DJ Gonno.

Nomura Co. designer Hajime Oyamada says that he designed the speakers based on the question, “What is a musical experience that evokes the universe?” The sound produced by the Debris speakers is reminiscent of a soundscape suspended in zero-gravity space. He says the result is exactly what was intended by the concept.

The design is not the only thing that distinguishes this project. One of the major elements of this project is that Gonno, a well-known DJ and producer in the electronic music scene, has agreed to produce music to play through the speakers. Gonno captured field recordings of the environmental sounds of the town of Taiki, including the beacon of a rocket launch site at the spaceport. He recorded other environmental sounds in the area—cows on a ranch, swaying trees—and incorporated them into a 27-minute song. The soundscape of Taiki-machi, where technology and nature intersect, comes to life in this spectacular piece, which gains depth with repeated listens.

Gonno is a DJ and producer who represents Japanese house and techno music in Japan and abroad. In 2024, he launched his own label, Sanka.

Gonno's music reflects the air and scenery of the place where the fuel tank was born.

Debris is more than just a piece of audio equipment. It functions as a new form of expression at the intersection of space development technology and culture. Its sound, which evokes the dynamism of the space industry and the lives of the people who work in it, seems to symbolize the space culture of the future. The creators will continue to weave the future of the space industry into people's lives and serve as a bridge between technology and culture.

Before I started using a handheld fan, I was a total skeptic. I'd seen the ones that attach to your phone or fit in a bag, and I couldn't imagine they'd provide any real relief from the heat—and they seemed completely unnecessary. But now that I've used the fans on this list, I don't know how I was functioning without them.

There are certain scenarios where having a portable fan makes your life so much better: Outdoor concerts, weddings, festivals, amusement parks, sporting events, backyard parties. I don't live in New York City anymore, but I could imagine having one of these on the subway would be a game changer. Despite their size, they do actually create a significant breeze—in some cases, it's enough to stop you from getting sticky, shiny, and sweaty. If you want to make it through a ridiculously hot day without your makeup melting or pitting out, you need one of these handheld fans.

For more ways to stay cool, check out our guides to the Best Fans and the Best Window ACs.

PlayHot

Amazon

Walmart

This fan was a godsend during a sweltering outdoor concert. It bends at the neck, so I was able to set it up on the picnic table and blast it toward my face without even holding it, then straighten it back into the standard position to carry it with me as I walked around. It also comes with a lanyard that allows you to hang it from your neck. It felt stronger than the other handheld fans I tested, and I liked that the blades were contained, which made the airflow feel more concentrated and meant I couldn't catch them on anything. It kept my face from melting off on the 100-degree day I used it, and while it isn't slim enough to slide into a clutch or pocket (like some other fans on the list), it fit into my small crossbody bag.

There are five speed levels, and the 5,000-mAh battery lasts from three to 12 hours depending on which level you're using. A digital display lets you know what level you're using and how much battery life you have left (you can get a full charge in three hours). The only cons to this fan are that it doesn't have any other uses (no charging bank or flashlight capabilities, like some options on this list), and it's a bit loud, with a drone-y sound. It didn't bother me at a loud concert, and I was even able to talk to a friend without any problem, but if you're in a quieter setting, it might be an issue. At only $20, it's a solid investment for any outdoor festivals or weddings where you need a heavy-duty airflow to really stave off sweat.

This 4,000 mAh-battery-powered fan is a great little cooling device for anyone who needs to be truly hands-free, like construction workers, mail delivery people, park rangers, or even just folks who need to walk their dog or weed their garden in the heat. It clips onto your belt or pants (you'll need a sturdy pair for it to stay in the ideal position), and blows air upward, keeping your back or pits cool, depending on where you place it. You can position it outside or inside your shirt (additional clips hold your top in place so it doesn't billow upwards). There are three levels of airflow, and I found the third setting to be fairly strong (on par with the PlayHot Turbo Fan). The company says the fan's power will last for 20 hours on the low setting. It also has a flashlight, an LED display that shows the battery life and fan speed, and a lanyard, so you can wear it around your neck.

Torras

Amazon

If you deal with dreaded back or boob sweat, this belt fan offers a solution (though it's not the most discreet). Pick one of the two soft, stretchy adjustable straps it comes with, and you can wear it around your waist either over or under your shirt to blow air up toward your sweatiest parts. It stayed in place well while I did chores around the yard. The back of the fan is covered with PCM cooling material, which feels like a gel beneath a plastic sheath, that the company claims absorbs heat and transfers it away from your body, The gel does feel cool to the touch, but I can't say I noticed it when I was wearing the fan, and in some cases, it felt a little leaky and greasy. Still, this was one of few belt fans I could find in this shape. With a 4,000-mAh battery, 15 hours of battery life, and two fan speeds, this is a solid option for anyone who needs a hands-free, wearable fan.

Ororo

Like heated vests and socks, clothing with built-in cooling is becoming more streamlined, functional, and fashionable. This jacket from Ororo looks like your standard windbreaker, save for the two circular fans on the lower back. You turn them on (there are three levels of airflow) with a button on a cord that attaches to a chargeable battery in the pocket, and you can remove the fans, cord, and battery when it's time to wash the jacket. The cooling sensation is surprisingly strong and the fans aren't too heavy or annoyingly loud—the only downside is the back and sides puff up like you'd expect when the fans are on.

The jacket itself is comfortable, made from a stretchy, lightweight, abrasion-resistant fabric, with five pockets, an adjustable hem, and the option to zip off the sleeves and convert it to a short-sleeved jacket. The battery works for 5.5 hours on the high setting and 9.5 hours on the low setting. I'd choose this jacket over waist and belt fans for superior upper body cooling and comfort, if you can deal with looking a little like the Michelin Man.

Gaiatop

Amazon

This fan was a great companion during a late summer parade, providing some airflow without much noise. I appreciate that the fan blades are soft, and they stop automatically if they hit something—it's the type of fan you could hand off to a kid without much worry. It can also stand up on a table, and when folded, easily fits in a small purse or clutch. It comes in pretty pastel colors and has tiny, pointed ears, with a button that looks like some kind of cute creature, though I'm not sure if it's supposed to be an owl or a cat.

At only four ounces and with a small lanyard, you could definitely attach this fan to your phone or keychain to always have it at the ready. It has 10 to 17 hours of battery life, depending on which of the two speeds you use. I wish the higher speed was stronger—it helped provide some relief during a parade, but it didn't totally prevent sweating, like the PlayHot Portable Handheld Turbo Fan. Still, for the price, size, and low noise level, it's a decent cooling option. The Aecooly fan ($10) is also a small, slim, pocket- or purse-sized option.

Jisulife

Amazon

This fan with little ears and a printed-on bear mouth was WIRED senior commerce editor Kat Merck's top hand fan pick in her guide to the Best Fans. “Its two blades produce a pretty strong breeze at 472 feet per minute (measured on my anemometer), it's quiet (44 dB on low), and it's also lightweight at four ounces,” says Merck. “I also found the battery life to be pretty solid. It's not as inexpensive or easy to slip into a pocket as the Aecooly portable fan, below, but I think the fact it doubles as a flashlight and portable power bank make it worthwhile. However, note that the 2,000-mAh battery does run out quickly if you're using it as a power bank.”

Jisulife

Amazon

This no-nonsense neck fan looks a little bit like headphones, with a 5000 mAh battery and five speeds. I like that it's super-lightweight and comfortable if you need to wear it for long periods. However, the ends don't adjust or angle, so if you don't like where the air is directed, there's nothing you can do about it. It's also not too loud; around 40 decibels on low. Color options on Amazon are limited, but if you buy direct from JisuLife you have access to more options like navy, forest green, and pink. —Kat Merck

Jisulife

Amazon

This fan is so strong it's almost comical—1,614 feet per minute on my anemometer. For reference, that's the same as a full-sized tower fan. It also emits a high-pitched whine not unlike a jet engine (60 decibels on its lowest setting), and its mallet-like shape makes it too bulky to slip into a pocket. However, it does double as a power bank and a flashlight, and it's got a short carrying lanyard you can attach to make it slightly less unwieldy. The 9,000-mAh battery is also a plus. Jisulife says this can last up to 25 hours, which I have no reason to doubt, as I've been using it off and on for three weeks and the battery has yet to run out. —Kat Merck

Aecooly

Amazon

This periscope-shaped “powerful turbo air tube” won both a Red Dot and iF Design award this year, and the curved shape is both easy to transport and hold. I also like that there are no rotors or blades to knock into, and the airflow was impressive for a hand fan—807 feet per minute on high (there are six speeds total). It doesn't double as a flashlight or phone charger, but it does come with a digital display, which shows you the battery and speed levels, and a short lanyard for carrying. Don't plan on using this one if you're going to have a conversation, though, as it was over 50 decibels on low. —Kat Merck

Google's Pixel phones are chock-full of helpful, smart features, and they capture some of the best-looking photographs on a mobile device. It's why they're among our favorite Android smartphones. But like several of its peers, Google doesn't have many of its best features turned on by default. For example, Call Screening blocks unwanted phone calls on your behalf, and you need to turn it on yourself.

That's what I'm here for. I test smartphones for a living, and I'm constantly switching to a new device every week or two. I'm an expert at running through the settings of every phone I test and toggling on the features I want. To get the most out of your new Pixel, follow these steps, some of which may even help you turn off things you don't care for, like a few of the generative AI features on the Pixel 10.

Keep Your Pixel Updated

Unlike many other Android phones, Google's Pixel devices get software updates immediately when Google sends them out. That's one of the big perks of owning the phone made by the company that manages Android. Many of the settings I'm running through here are based on the Android 16 build in the Pixel 10 series—you may find some pathways or settings are slightly different on your device if you're not on the latest version. Note: Some features are also exclusive to select Pixel phones.

To update your Pixel, head to Settings > System > Software updates > System update. To check which model Pixel you own, go to Settings, scroll to the bottom, and click About Phone.

Table of Contents

The best features on Google's Pixel phones revolve around the Phone app. No one wants endless robocalls and scams from telemarketers. That's why the first thing I do when setting up a new Pixel is open the Phone app and tap the three-lined icon on the top left (also called a hamburger menu). Tap Settings > Call Screen and toggle on Automatically screen calls. You can choose Basic, Medium, or Maximum protection, and each mode ramps up the screening, with the latter screening unknown numbers.

Within the Phone app's Settings menu, there are several other call features I recommend you turn on. Scam Detection is in beta, but it'll run in the background and will alert you on a call if it thinks you're being scammed. It doesn't run for calls from your contacts; calls aren't recorded, and all of this works locally on the device. Hold for Me is another excellent feature that lets you skip the annoying hold music—turn it on while on a call, and your phone will listen on your behalf and ring when the person you're speaking with returns and ends the hold.

Direct My Call is useful if you're calling a business and they have a complicated phone menu. Once toggled on, it'll show a live transcription on your phone screen during the call, with buttons you can tap (i.e., Press 0 to talk to an agent). Call Notes, once toggled on, will ask if you want to activate it at the beginning of each call. It'll transcribe and summarize calls, so if you're particularly forgetful, you'll be able to see a summary of your calls (you can choose to make it automatically start for calls from non-contacts). The data is stored on the device, and you can have it delete the notes after a set period.

Available on the latest Pixel 10 series at the moment, Voice Translate will translate phone calls in real time, and it'll even use generative artificial intelligence to approximate the voices of the people on the call, so that it feels like you're actually talking to each other and not a robot. You'll need to toggle this on in the middle of a call. And finally, Take a Message is sort of a revamped version of voicemail. When you don't answer, it'll ask callers to leave a message, which you'll be able to see transcribed in real time. It'll even generate insights or tasks based on the transcript, so if your wife called and reminded you to grab milk on the way home, it should show up as a recommendation to add to Google Keep.

One of the best features that originally debuted in the Pixel 2, Now Playing listens for ambient music in your environment and will display the song information straight on your lock screen—no need to guess who the artist is or run a manual sound search. (You can still do that if the music is loud enough by tapping the mic icon on the Google Search widget on the home screen.)

To enable it, head to Settings > Sound & vibration > Now Playing and toggle it on. By default, the feature works exclusively on-device, but you can turn on Enhance Now Playing to have it automatically use Google Search to expand the detection capabilities and provide album artwork. You can also enable Now Playing history, which can be handy if you forgot to save the song you heard to your music app.

It's really annoying when auto-rotate kicks on and changes your screen orientation when you didn't want it to. Sure, you can just turn off auto-rotate in the quick settings tile, or you can enable Face Detection. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Auto-rotate screen and toggle on Face Detection for the phone to use the selfie camera to understand when you've actually put your phone in landscape mode, or when you're just lying down and staring at the screen sideways.

Similarly, if you're annoyed at how quickly the phone's display times out, you can extend the time manually, or use Adaptive timeout and Screen attention. In the Display & touch menu, tap Screen timeout to find these options. Adaptive timeout turns off your screen if you're not using the phone, and Screen attention won't turn off the screen as long as it detects you're looking at it.

One of the more underrated features on Pixel phones is the accuracy of Assistant Voice Typing. It's the little mic icon on the Gboard keyboard that lets you use voice-to-text when messaging a friend or searching on the web. By default, it works OK, but when you tap it for the first time, you'll be asked to download a faster voice model, and you can head to Settings > System > Keyboard > On-screen keyboard > Gboard > Voice typing to make sure that Advanced features is toggled on.

With this, the voice-typing assistant will automatically add punctuation, and will understand certain commands like “Next paragraph,” “delete,” “lol emoji,” and “send,” making the experience as hands-free as possible. Google has also incorporated some generative AI here, so you can say things like, “Rephrase it,” and the assistant will rewrite the message in different phrasing. That's totally optional. I mostly just love the accuracy of the voice-to-text and the ability to move the cursor to the next line, delete words, and send messages without having to tap the keyboard.

There's a whole Personal Safety app that has features like checking in with friends and family once you've safely arrived home, but you should also make sure to do a test run of Google's Pixel Satellite SOS function before you end up in a remote area with zero cell service (this one is only available on the Pixel 9 and newer).

It'll allow you to message emergency services using satellites when there's no Wi-Fi or cellular connection. Head to Settings > Safety & emergency > Pixel Satellite SOS and Try a demo to get the full experience. I have a more detailed breakdown of how it works here.

There are other safety features you should enable in the Safety & emergency menu. Car Crash Detection will sound an alarm and ask if you need help if the Pixel detects a crash. If you confirm or don't respond, it'll call emergency services, and you can enable emergency sharing with your emergency contacts. You should also turn on Crisis Alerts, which will notify you of natural disasters and public emergencies in your area.

There are ways to keep your Pixel secure even if you left your phone behind in an Uber or even if someone snatched it out of your hands. But you'll have to enable these protective features first. Head to Settings > Security & privacy > Device unlock. Assuming you have a pin or pattern unlock on your phone (please use one), you can enable Theft protection. This is comprised of Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock. The former will lock the screen if it detects someone has grabbed your phone and run away. The latter locks the screen after your phone goes offline, in case the thief turns off mobile data and Wi-Fi.

Within Theft protection is Identity Check—toggle it on. It uses the fingerprint or face scanner to verify that you're using the phone when trying to access certain sensitive data, like passkeys or opening the Find Hub app. You can also set Trusted Places here, so your phone will know it needs to be extra cautious when you're away from these trusted locations, like your home.

And you should also toggle on Remote Lock, which allows you to remotely lock your phone if it's stolen or lost. You'll need to go to android.com/lock to do this and add your phone number. It doesn't require a Google Account. (This only works if the device is online.)

Google also renamed its device-tracking app to Find Hub earlier this year. You should hop into it, find your devices, and toggle on Find your offline devices. This allows the network to find and locate your devices, even if they're offline. Location info from the Find Hub app is encrypted, and only you can see it.

If you want the maximum protection Google offers, you can enable a relatively new mode called Advanced Protection. (You'll have to restart your device for the full features to take effect.) Head to Settings > Security & privacy > Advanced Protection.

When you toggle on Device protection, it will automatically enable Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and trigger Inactivity reboot, which will restart your phone if it stays locked for three days. Advanced Protection will also block 2G networks, which are less secure, block harmful web pages, warn you of non-HTTPS sites, and warn you of scams and suspicious links in Google Messages. We've got a full breakdown of how this function works here, if you're interested.

You can create a Private Space on your Pixel with a fresh Google Account for sensitive apps and information (you can also use an existing account). You can hide it behind a custom lock that's separate from the one for your device, and install apps specifically for this space (even if you already have the same app installed).

When the Private Space is locked, these apps will stop working, and you won't get notifications from them. Head to Settings > Security & privacy > Private Space to set it up. You can set how often the Private Space locks, hide it completely, and delete it if you don't need it. It doesn't transfer to new Pixels, so you'll have to set it up again.

Magic Cue is a new feature on the latest Pixel 10 phones. If you opt in, it'll process data from select apps, like Gmail, Calendar, Keep, and Contacts, and serve up that information in relevant situations, primarily in the Phone and Messages apps. For example, if a friend texts asking what time the dinner reservation is, Magic Cue will find it instantly and serve up the answer so you don't have to hunt for it. If you're calling your airline about your booking, Magic Cue will show the confirmation number and other flight details on the screen so you don't have to switch apps during the call. All of this is processed on-device.

Head to Settings > Magic Cue to check out the new capabilities, but this is also the place to go if you want to disable it partially or completely.

Instead of tapping the screen to see the time, you can enable Always-On Display to see a clock at any moment. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Always-On display to enable it. Now, when the screen turns off, it'll still show the time, date, and weather, plus icons for apps with any notifications. You also have the option to show the lock screen wallpaper with the always-on display, but that'll suck up more battery. (I prefer to just have a black screen.)

While we're talking about the display, make sure your Pixel is using the highest screen resolution. In Display & touch, scroll down to Screen resolution and choose Max resolution. It may eat up more battery life, but you paid for a high-quality display! Use it. Smooth display sits right below, but it's finally enabled by default, allowing your phone to hit a 120-Hz screen refresh rate.

The lock screen is fairly customizable. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Lock screen to customize how notifications appear (compact or full list), hide silent notifications, hide sensitive content, and add shortcuts to the left or right corner (like Flashlight or Wallet). You should also enable Dynamic clock, which changes the size of the clock based on what's on the lock screen. To change the appearance of the lock screen clock, head to Settings > Wallpaper & style and Clock (on the lock screen tab). There are several styles to choose from, and you can adjust the colors and size.

As for your lock screen wallpaper, tap on a photo and then tap Effects. You can customize how photos of your loved ones appear—within shapes, a fresh background color, with real-time weather animations, or a Cinematic look that adds depth.

If you want to restart your Pixel or turn it off, you have to pull down the notification drawer and tap on the digital power button. What about the physical power button? Google defaults it to triggering its Gemini voice assistant. You can actually get the power menu back by pressing the power button and the top volume button simultaneously, but if you want the old-school behavior back, head to Settings > System > Gestures > Press & hold power button.

If you go this route but still want to access Gemini, you can just say, “Hey Google,” to set up voice commands, or use the Gemini widget on the home screen to activate it. To add a widget, press and hold anywhere on the home screen, tap Widgets, and scroll to Gemini.

This is for the Pixel 10 series, but these phones can now record in the AV1 video format. This greatly saves storage space, so if you're someone who takes a lot of video, it's the smart approach. However, AV1 isn't supported universally. You shouldn't have issues uploading AV1 videos to Instagram, for example, but you'll want to check if the source you want to upload to supports it. To switch to AV1, open the camera app, click the gear icon on the left, then tap the three dots at the top right. Scroll to the bottom, tap on Video format, and choose AV1.

Speaking of video, Google's Pro Pixel phones, since the Pixel 8 Pro, have been able to use a feature called Video Boost. This sends your footage to the cloud for processing, improving color, brightness, and stabilization, while reducing noise. Depending on the length of the video, the processing can take 20 minutes, several hours, or even a day. You'll be notified when it's ready, and until then, you can use the native footage you originally shot. It's a smart way to level up the video quality (the Pixel 10 Pro can even upscale it to 8K), even if it'd be nice if Google just improved native video capture. To enable Video Boost, switch to the Video tab in the camera app, tap the gear icon in the camera app, and toggle it on.

Another one for Pixel 10 users, Pro Res Zoom is available on the Pixel 10 Pro models, and Camera Coach is on all Pixel 10 phones (though there's a chance one of these could come to older Pixels). You can learn more about how these camera features work here, but Pro Res Zoom essentially stitches hundreds of frames together once you go past 30X to 100X digital zoom, and employs generative AI to fill in the details of the image. That results in spectacularly sharp zoomed-in photos, but it may leave a weird taste in your mouth because parts of it were AI-generated. You can turn it off! Open the camera, press the gear icon on the bottom left, and tap the three-dot menu icon. Tap Model download and then the trash icon next to Pro Res Zoom.

Camera Coach teaches you how to take better photos. It scans the scene, then runs you through several steps that can range from zooming in, switching to Portrait mode, or even shifting a few paces to the left. It's a helpful feature, but there's an odd “Get Inspired” button that will generate some photo ideas you can try. If you don't like that, or don't care for Camera Coach at all, just head to the camera settings and hit the toggle off for Camera Coach.

While you're there, I like to turn on features like Framing Hints, which adds cues like a level so your photos are straight. Rich color in photos uses the Display P3 color format for more vibrant colors in your images, though it's not as widely supported as sRGB.

The Modes section of the Pixel Settings menu is pretty powerful, but I specifically like the Bedtime mode. Head to Settings > Modes > Bedtime to turn it on and customize it. You can tell it when exactly to turn on and off, at a specific time, or when your phone is charging. You can then customize which of your contacts are allowed to cut through the mode (or specific apps), while enabling features like Grayscale mode to remove all color from the screen.

As you set it up, you can toggle on Bedtime activity, which shows you how much time you spend on your phone before bed, and Cough & snore info. The latter will use your phone's microphone to detect coughing and snoring.

Clear Calling: Trouble hearing people on the other end? Google has an easy solution called Clear Calling, which reduces background noise in your caller's environment, allowing you to hear them better. You can turn this on by heading to Settings > Sound & vibration > Clear Calling.

Notification History: Ever accidentally swipe a notification away before you could read it? Toggle on Notification history by heading to Settings > Notifications > Notification history, and you'll be able to view all the notifications that showed up on your device in the last 24 hours.

Adaptive Vibration: Your Pixel knows if it's sitting in your back pocket, on a table, or in a bag. Adaptive vibration will adjust the strength of the vibration so that you can hear or feel it even if you're in a loud area. Head to Settings > Sound & vibration > Vibration & haptics > Adaptive vibration to turn it on.

Edit the Quick Settings Tiles: The Material 3 Expressive redesign is playful, but it also makes a little more efficient use of space in the Quick Settings tiles when you pull down the notification drawer. If you don't care for the default layout, swipe down twice on the notification drawer, tap the pen icon, and you can now move tiles around, hide them, or add new ones.

Battery Percentage: It bugs me when there is no percentage on the battery bar at the top right of the phone. Tell me exactly how much juice I have left! To enable the percentage, head to Settings > Battery > Battery percentage. Take a look around here and turn on Adaptive charging if you want to prolong the health of your phone's battery (it's under Battery health). You can also choose to limit charging to 80 percent, which will improve the overall lifespan of the battery.

Show Keyboard in App Drawer: Swipe up on the home screen, and it'll open the app drawer, but if you want to immediately search for an app or, well, anything, you'll have to tap on the top search bar to bring up the keyboard. If that's cumbersome, you can have the keyboard automatically open when you swipe up. Long-press anywhere on the home screen, tap Home settings > Search settings > Swipe up to start search. Now, when you open the app drawer, the keyboard will open, ready to go.

Flip to Shhh: Flip your Pixel screen down on a table, and it'll automatically turn on Do Not Disturb. You can turn this on in Settings > System > Gestures > Flip to Shhh, and you can then configure the mode in Settings > Modes > Flip to Shhh.

Live Translate: If you frequently receive messages from family members in a different language (and don't speak the language very well), you can toggle on Live Translate at Settings > System > Live Translate. This will detect other languages, like in the Messages app, and show you translations automatically.

Wow, y'all aren't exactly bullish on EV sales in the U.S. once the federal tax credit expires. For those wondering what I am referring to: I included a poll in the last edition of TechCrunch Mobility. Yup, only email subscribers get to participate in polls.

The question was: “What's your prediction for EV sales over the next two quarters after the EV tax credit expires?” And about 60% of you predicted a steep decline. 

I don't totally disagree, although I do think some automakers will try to pass along the $7,500 federal tax credit through other price reductions for at least one quarter. Automakers with fresh EV models slated for late 2025 and 2026 may be better positioned than competitors. However, tariffs are also bound to shrink margins. 

Meanwhile, there is another speed bump emerging in the EV industry in the United States as automakers transition over to Tesla's North American Charging Standard.

Yeah, I'm talking about dongles, aka EV charging adapters.

Senior climate reporter Tim De Chant, who is a longtime EV owner himself, explains how some folks may soon have a trunk or frunk load of charging adapters.

Take GM. The automaker began selling an adapter nearly a year ago to allow existing electric vehicles to use the North American Charging Standard plugs at Tesla Supercharger stalls. EV owners rejoiced in their newfound freedom.

Now GM has announced three more adapters. The additional adapters, which help GM customers access EV chargers with different charging rates and standards, is a win for flexibility, but at the cost of simplicity. It's entirely possible that two-EV households could own four different adapters. Check out the full article here. 

One important housekeeping note: TechCrunch Mobility will NOT land in your inboxes next week. I know, I know. You'll miss me. Same here. But I will be back the following week.

It's your lucky day — we have two little birds to share. 

It's been six months since Peter Rawlinson abruptly stepped down from his CEO, CTO, and board positions at Lucid Motors. His departure came at a critical time, too, as the company was on the precipice of finally launching its long-awaited Gravity SUV. Since then, Rawlinson's CEO role has been filled on an interim basis by Marc Winterhoff, a longtime consultant at Roland Berger who came on as CFO of Lucid in 2023, as the company looks for a permanent replacement. While it's unclear whether Lucid is close to making a decision, a little bird recently told us the search net has been cast very wide, with the company even cold-calling some candidates. In the meantime, it's said that Winterhoff has an eye on taking the position himself.

Meanwhile, over at Tesla. 

When Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla would disband the team working on Dojo, reporters here were predictably curious about what would happen to the factory in Buffalo, New York, where the automaker was supposed to build the AI training supercomputer.

We heard from a few little birds, and the big takeaway is that Tesla is still committed to spending $500 million on a supercomputer there.

The company already invested about $314 million of those funds last year, according to sources who said Tesla reported this figure to the state's economic development department. Could Buffalo be getting a rebrand to Cortex, Tesla's other supercomputing cluster? We're also hearing that Buffalo is keen to keep its relationship with Tesla alive and well, given that the automaker's facility there is one of the top private employers in the city.

Not a lot of deals this week; blame the last weeks of summer. Here are a couple of items for you, though …

Blue Water Autonomy, a startup developing unmanned ships for the U.S. Navy, raised $50 million in a Series A round led by GV. Eclipse Ventures, Riot, and Impatient Ventures also participated.Joby Aviation completed its acquisition of Blade.Vox AI, an Amsterdam-based startup developing a conversational voice AI platform that's purpose-built for drive-throughs in quick-service restaurants, raised €7.5 million in seed funding.

Aurora Innovation said it will integrate its self-driving trucking platform into McLeod Software‘s transportation management system. The upshot: Mutual customers would be able to manage autonomous shipments with McLeod's TMS software and that could help boost adoption.

The Boring Company is finally testing Full Self-Driving (Supervised), the advanced driver-assistance system created by Tesla, in the tunnels that connect Las Vegas' Convention Center to a few nearby hotels.

The last vestige of bankrupt Fisker Inc. is gone. Henrik Fisker, the founder of failed EV startup Fisker Inc., and his wife, Geeta, quietly wound down a private charitable foundation. 

Kodiak Robotics hired Surajit Datta as chief financial officer. Datta previously was VP of finance at SentinelOne. Remember that Kodiak will soon be a publicly traded company, which it will accomplish by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. 

Tesla could have avoided that $242.5 million Autopilot verdict, filings show. Speaking of that trial, The Washington Post reports that a hacker helped retrieve critical crash data that was missing.

And speaking of data, a security researcher found over a thousand publicly exposed hobby servers run by Tesla vehicle owners that are spilling sensitive data about their vehicles, including their granular location histories. Stay safe, people!

Just days before Labor Day, California lawmakers have reached an agreement with app-based companies Lyft and Uber that will give drivers a path to unionization. 

Uncaged Innovations, a biomaterials startup, is working with Hyundai's Cradle division to refine its plant-based artificial leather material for automotive use. It even smells like leather — or can be made with other signature scents. 

Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov posted on X a video of one of his company's robotaxis navigating through the giant dust storm — known as a haboob — in Phoenix. Also, Waymo now has more than 2,000 robotaxis in its commercial fleet, the company told me. More than 800 are in the San Francisco Bay Area, 500 in Los Angeles, 400 in Phoenix, 100 in Austin, and “dozens” in Atlanta — its newest market.

The Autonocast, a podcast I co-host with Alex Roy and Ed Niedermeyer, has a new episode out. And it's worth a listen, especially if you're interested in the intersection of boats, autonomy, and planes. In the episode, Roy and I interview Billy Thalheimer, co-founder and CEO of Regent.

Most western countries are democracies because people got fed up of being exploited by dictators (sometimes called ""kings""), removed them and setup a system in which they elect who makes the decisions. This system has issues but is less bad than dictatorship.Yet, companies kept their hierarchical power structures.Workers should decide who makes the decisions. If they don't wanna invest time into selling their product, they hire a salesman. If they want somebody to make long term projections, plan what gets worked on and communicates with other teams, they hire an assistant. And they decide how much he gets paid according to how much value he actually brings them.Managers should be assistants.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Verizon Finally Restores Service in Most Areas After Day-Long Outage","https://gizmodo.com/verizon-outage-over-2000651331","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 11:12:18 GMT","

Verizon said thousands of people who were affected nationwide by a massive outage now have service back.

If your Verizon-backed phone was out most of yesterday or even still down today, you weren't alone. The company said the blackout was caused by a “software issue” but did not respond to a request to elaborate on what exactly that meant.

Verizon officials assured customers that their engineers were actively engaged in diagnosing and resolving the service disruption. By early evening, the company announced that service was beginning to stabilize in affected regions.

According to Downdetector data, most networks in the New York City, Houston, Chicago, Seattle, the Bay Area, and other major urban centers had been restored by 7:30 p.m. PDT, though a residual few hundred reports of outages persisted nationwide into midnight.

The company advised customers to monitor their network status online for updates.

Verizon officials emphasized that their engineering teams were actively engaged in diagnosing and resolving the widespread service outage that impacted thousands of customers across the United States.

In a statement released Saturday afternoon, the company assured affected users that corrective measures were underway and that efforts to restore normal service were a top priority.

“Our engineers are engaged and we are working quickly to identify and solve the issue,” Verizon said, as it scramble to assuage customers amid mounting frustration on social media.

By early evening, Verizon reported signs of progress, with service beginning to stabilize in key affected regions.

According to the company, network restoration efforts had started to yield positive results, particularly in metropolitan areas where the outage had been most severe.

Despite the progress, the company acknowledged that some users continued to experience issues, and reports of outages persisted into the late evening hours.

The outage was first reported around midday, with thousands of customers taking to social media to complain about their phones being stuck in “SOS” mode since Saturday morning.

Many users expressed frustration over the slow pace of Verizon's response, with some criticizing the company for not providing more timely and transparent updates.

The outage appeared to be concentrated in densely populated urban centers, where mobile connectivity is critical for both personal and professional communication.

Verizon's spokesperson advised customers to check their network status online and provided reassurance that service restoration was ongoing. The company noted that efforts to identify and rectify the underlying software issue were still in progress, and that they expected further improvements in the coming hours.

By midnight, reports indicated that only a few hundred users nationwide were still experiencing service disruptions, suggesting that Verizon's technicians were making significant headway in their recovery efforts.

Overall, the outage underscored the vulnerabilities inherent in even the most sophisticated telecommunications networks, and highlighted the importance of rapid, transparent communication during service disruptions.

Customers and industry observers alike will be watching closely to see how Verizon manages similar incidents in the future, particularly in terms of response times and customer service.

Summer is the time when you want to capture your memories, and this Insta360 X4 is the kind of device that helps you do it in the best possible way. Insta360's name stands for three reasons: amazing 8K output on its 360° cameras, amazing battery life (135 minutes for this model) and amazing ease-of-use design.

The Insta360 X4 camera has been a top seller this summer, but picking it up now during the Back to School discounts at its all-time-low of $349 on Amazon, down from $499, is a smart decision. Especially with the new Insta360 X5 just entering the market at $550, this older product offers nearly as much greatness for a bit over half the price.

See at Amazon

The Insta360 X4 gives you a stunning 8K 360-degree video experience so you can catch all that's around you with ease in clear, high-definition quality. It's waterproof, too, so no sacrifices are made even when you're diving into pool play or filming in bad weather. This level of video quality and build makes it possible for you to trust it to get every second and with confidence.

Where this camera stands out is in battery life: The X4 lasts for as long as 135 minutes, or a great deal more shooting time without the constant anxiety about running out of juice. In comparison to most action cameras that lag shortly beyond the hour mark, the X4's battery life makes a tangible difference for capturing sporting events or travel blogging.

The base package includes removable lens guards to protect the cameras from scratches or bumps, a handy feature if you will be using your camera in the great outdoors or on go-around-town adventures. Another great feature is the invisible selfie stick effect: It enables you to film with the stick disappearing from the clip, and provides a seamless, professional look to your shots without adjusting in post.

Simplicity in operation is another reason the Insta360 X4 is a favorite: The AI editing tools make creating polished videos easier whether you're new to video or an experienced creator. Stabilization technology keeps your footage smooth even when you're moving fast or navigating rough terrain so your videos look as professional as if they were shot by a pro. A solid selling point for those who love to share their experiences quickly is the camera's ability to pair with your phone or other devices for fast transfers and easy sharing on social media or with friends.

If you've been thinking about stepping up your filming game, this deal from Amazon is definitely worth grabbing while supplies last.

Samsung is a name that is well-known as Apple's biggest rival in the tablet market. While the Galaxy Tab S tablets are what equal the iPad Pro in high-end specs and performance, the Galaxy Tab A series offers a cheaper alternative that directly rivals the standard iPad. They may not have all of the bells and whistles of the premium line, but for basic usage, they're more than adequate.

Right now, Amazon has dropped the price of the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (64GB Wi-Fi) to a record low of $134, knocking off 39% from the usual $219 list price. This almost feels like Amazon is clearing out these excellent 2024 models—and if you're looking for a good tablet for your daily usage, this deal is a real no-brainer.

See at Amazon

 

The 11-inch screen has a sharp 1920 x 1200 resolution and a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, which makes videos and everything else look vivid and clear. It gets up to 480 nits bright so even in well-lit rooms, the display is lively. This makes it perfect for gaming but also for reading or video calling without causing eye strain. The TFT LCD technology of the screen maintains colors vibrant and is complemented by the lightweight body of the tablet which makes it comfortable to grip whether at home lounging or on the move.

Samsung packed four speakers powered by Dolby Atmos technology, creating rich and immersive audio that fills the room. This is more than what you'd expect from a budget-friendly tablet and really adds to the overall experience.

Behind the scenes, the Galaxy Tab A9+ is driven by an enhanced Qualcomm Snapdragon 69 chipset for quicker and more seamless performance in all activities. It comes in a number of configurations, including 4GB RAM with 64GB storage or 8GB RAM with 128GB (which is also on sale) and it even includes expandable storage up to 1TB via a microSD card. The processing power and memory are properly balanced to handle multitasking easily so switching between apps or having multiple windows open at once is intuitive and lag-free.

Among the neat features is the multi-window display that enables you to open and use more than one app at a time side by side. From browsing the internet while taking notes to checking your emails while you are on a video call, this tablet makes it simple to multitask. Quick Share feature also allows users to easily share files with other devices, Android or iOS, so they can share photos, videos and documents instantly.

This Amazon sale is worth grabbing before they run out of models.

Chosen Fal.ai model was chosen for its clear performance and latency lead. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Software engineer Jeff Schomay has been experimenting with techniques to transform game visuals using artificial intelligence-powered rendering. In a recent blog post, he shared screens from his Thunder Lizard “old-school ASCII RPG style game” and you can see various AI models reconstructing the title's basic character-based visuals into far plusher full-motion graphics. However, there are quite a few compromises needed to achieve a ‘playable' 10fps and 1ms latency AI visual enhanced game.

You can play Thunder Lizard, using the current ASCII rogue-like engine visuals, right now, via that link. In brief, you use the cursor keys to navigate around the prehistoric landscape while attempting to catch and east smaller dinosaurs, while avoiding larger ones. You grow as you eat smaller prey, but you have to flourish enough to become the most powerful dinosaur before the volcano destroys the entire landscape.

Wouldn't this game be more fun with snazzy pixel art visuals? Schomay must have thought so, too. And you can see various samples of AI-rendered alternatives to the ASCII throughout his blog post.

As Schomay put it in his blog post, there is a “need for speed” in gaming, that isn't yet met by many AI renderers. At least concerning what is available to indie devs.

We get to see some fantastic looking prehistoric landscape renderers, which would really add something to Thunder Lizard. However, the software engineer couldn't coax better than “a four-second latency, it was unplayable” from the most handsome AI game graphics renderer.

You can read much more about Schomay's efforts with various AI models in the linked blog, but for actual playability the choice was ultimately Fal.ai. This model beat the other contenders for its “very fast generation times, source image adherence, and decent look and feel,” according to the software engineer.

Though what you see is an (AI) engine capable of just 10fps and 1ms latency, it's the best option, according to Schomay's efforts, in this case.

Pixel peepers might feel a little let down by the chosen AI visuals, which eventually won out. However, Schomay ends his blog on an upbeat note, stating that “it is amazing to see AI image generation happen in real-time.” He is also excited about the future, but hopes some strides can be made in frame to frame consistency.

We've previously reported on the use of AI in developing and enhancing games and graphics. Nvidia shared a lot of RTX technology reliant AI-enhanced development tool information earlier this year.

The iconic blobject can come home again, if Lego decides to bite the Apple


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The 1990s' most iconic blob, besides the Volkswagen Beetle, may soon be resurrected in brick-built form. A LEGO model of the Apple iMac G3 is up for consideration and fan voting on the LEGO Ideas website, where it is competing for a chance to become an officially licensed and commercially released LEGO model.

The Lego iMac is a 700-piece scale model of the original iMac G3, released in 1998. Complete with custom-designed stickers to replicate the Mac OS splash screen and iMac logo, the model is finished in the original computer's iconic Bondi Blue color. The inside of the transparent shell houses a cathode ray tube and a circuit board, complete with heatsinks and wires, designed digitally using only real Lego elements.

The model is complete with a brick-built keyboard and mouse. Even within the blocky constraints of the Lego medium, the model manages to comfortably approximate the shape and vibe of the original blobby desktop. A space fleet's worth of transparent blue windshield elements is used to create the iMac's bright plastic backside, gorgeously recreating Steve Jobs' first major product launch after his return to Apple.

Lego's ""LEGO Ideas"" website offers a chance for fan designers to submit their Lego models for consideration to be turned into real, on-the-shelf Lego products. Designs that receive 10,000 votes from site users are entered into official consideration rounds, where Lego's designers and lawyers determine which models best fit Lego's capabilities and brand. Over 150 designs meet this benchmark each year, with Lego holding three voting periods annually, and only six models are selected for production each year.

The designer of the Lego iMac G3, Fuma Terai, is no stranger to the Lego Ideas voting process. Six previous models of his have reached the 10,000-vote mark, with Terai's model of the '80s film Gremlins' mascot, Gizmo, being recently turned into an official Lego set of its own.

Close to half of the Lego Ideas sets published so far are based on licensed IP, and with Terai's iMac G3 design only using already-existing Lego elements, it has a fair chance of getting far in voting. Unfortunately, even if it can reach 10,000 total votes and obtain the approval of Lego's legal team, Apple would still need to be willing to play ball with the idea, which historically would be a long shot.

Those interested in seeing a Lego iMac G3 on their desk one day should turn to the Lego Ideas website and vote for the model here. Currently sitting at over 6,000 votes at the time of writing, the project has 319 days remaining to reach its 10,000-vote target, a milestone it will almost certainly reach thanks to its widespread promotion across the techy corners of the web.

For fast action titles, a more optimized game beats pixel peeping eye candy.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Battlefield 6 is one of the most anticipated games of the year, more so because of its friendly system requirements that let it be played even on modest hardware. One of the ways the game's developers were able to achieve this was by side-stepping any ray tracing technologies.

“No, we are not going to have ray tracing when the game launches, and we don't have any plans in the near future for it either,” Studio Technical Director Christian Buhl of Ripple Effect, one of the studios behind BF6, told ComicBook.com. “That was because we wanted to focus on performance. We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as [optimized] as possible for the default settings and the default users. So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we weren't going to do ray tracing and, again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else.”

This decision means that gamers can easily play the game and get good performance, even when running older hardware. The only unfortunate thing is that the title uses EA's Javelin anti-cheat feature, which requires Secure Boot. This precludes the Steam Deck and other Linux-based devices from running the game, so players avoiding Windows won't be able to play BF6.

The Battlefield franchise is Call of Duty's biggest competitor, and it stands out by having a destructible environment. This makes it more realistic and gives players more tactical choices, especially when facing an entrenched enemy. Since FPS shooters focus more on tactics and gameplay like this, we can consider ray tracing as a rather unnecessary eye-candy feature that will only make the title less accessible to gamers.

This is similar to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which launched last year, and also did not have ray tracing enabled in the game. There is a workaround to force the feature if you have a good enough graphics card, but it might cause some issues.

Fast-paced games that cater to a massive player base will likely not want to have ray tracing turned on. Aside from the additional strain this feature puts on GPUs, it also means additional backend work for developers. So, by dropping it altogether, the team behind the title can focus more on optimizing the game and making it run great on as many gaming PCs as possible, instead of making the title look better to the privileged few who have powerful GPUs.

How would you feel if just three customers made up nearly half of your sales?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia just released its second-quarter earnings for 2025, which showed the company breaking its sales records. This is great news for the AI GPU giant and its investors, but the quarterly report also showed a risk that the company is taking. Business publication Sherwood noted that nearly 53% of the reported revenue for the Green Team's Data Center division comes from just three unnamed customers, totaling about $21.9 billion in sales. This is broken down to $9.5 billion from Customer A, $6.6 billion from Customer B, and $5.7 billion from Customer C.

This might not sound like a problem — after all, why complain if three different entities are handing you piles and piles of money — but concentrating the majority of your sales to just a handful of clients could cause a sudden, unexpected issue. For example, the company's entire second-quarter revenue is around $46 billion, which means that Customer A makes up more than 20% of its sales. If this company were to suddenly vanish (say it decided to build its own chips, go with AMD, or a scandal forces it to cease operations), then it would have a massive impact on Nvidia's cash flow and operations.

These scenarios are unlikely to happen soon, though, as investors are still bullish about AI tech, and Nvidia's competitors are still envious of the tech stack that the Green Team can offer. Still, resting the future of your company (especially one so big) on a narrow base will likely keep some executives awake at night.

The company did not name which institutions were its biggest clients, but we can take a guess based on the plans and announcements that several big tech companies have made. One of the first that comes to mind is Elon Musk and xAI. The billionaire has previously broken data center records, setting up 100,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs in a record 19 days last year — something that usually takes four years to finish, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. But more than that, Musk has dreams of running 50 million H100-equivalent GPUs in the next five years.

OpenAI and Oracle also recently signed a deal to build a Stargate data center with over 2 million AI chips — estimated to be equivalent to 5GW spread across 20 different data centers. Meta is also another big Nvidia customer that has recently been in the news, with Zuckerberg putting up data centers housed in tents and announcing plans for ‘several multi-GW clusters', some of which are reportedly as large as Manhattan.

Even though Nvidia is facing issues with its China sales, first when President Donald Trump banned its H20 chip — resulting in a $5.5 billion write-off — and second, when Beijing instructed Chinese companies to stop buying the chips a few weeks after Trump reopened the H20 taps to China once again, these numbers could mean that the company is still relatively safe from ruin, even if it loses complete access to the East Asian country. So, Nvidia's sales to these three companies are probably the reason why Huang can spend his time shuttling between Beijing and Washington, with his company seemingly being used as a political tool by both sides of the ongoing trade war.

Step aside, distilled water.

Immersion cooling is typically associated with large-scale server environments where conventional air-cooled setups are insufficient. Efforts have been made to commercialize the technology, but, of course, enthusiasts wanting to push their hardware will not wait for any revolution—they'll push through to power their own breakthrough.

Such is the story of u/Tra5shL0rd on Reddit, who took to r/nvidia to showcase his crazy DIY immersion cooling apparatus, only with a further twist. In lieu of mineral oil—which is typically used for these endeavours—he dipped his graphics cards in ATF, or Automatic Transmission Fluid, that is used in cars.

The cooling works remarkably simply. The host took a large plastic container in which he put a ROG Strix GTX 1060 stripped down to its PCB and heatsink, connected via a PCIe riser cable to a clean motherboard outside. He poured 2.1 gallons of ATF on top of it, filling the tub about halfway through. Then he installed a submersible pump inside the tub to circulate the fluid, which was connected to an external pump that facilitated the exchange of hot ATF for cold. That was the first loop.

 




The second loop involved taking the aforementioned warm ATF and running it through a Dodge Journey transmission cooler, which acted essentially as a radiator to cool it down. The chilled fluid then flows back into the tub, completing the loop and actually creating something akin to a real car's internal mechanism. It's wild, and entirely non-practical, but it's exactly the kind of thing hobbists enjoy.

TrashBench, as the tinkerer is called over on YouTube, ran some benchmarks, and the results were great. Across various gaming and synthetic tests, he saw a consistent improvement of about 10%, and up to 16% in 3DMark. This was attributed in large part thanks to the 2160MHz boost clock that the GTX 1060 was able to achieve, surrounded by ATF, up from 1886MHz stock speeds. Overall, a resounding success that netted 1st place in Firestrike global scores.

Curiously, a 1080 Ti was also thrown into the mix with a similar teardown of the Strix variant, but these results were milder. The 1080 Ti was running at around 1960 MHz with air cooling, but it pushed to 2114 MHz when cooled with the ATF. TrashBench saw a roughly 7% increase in FPS, but because the 1080 Ti is already a power-hungry GPU with minimal headroom, this was not as impressive. The GTX 1060 more than doubled the 1080 Ti's gain and ultimately emerged as the real winner.

All in all, it was a fun experiment, but it left a whole lot of mess. TrashBench even specifically advises against using ATF, as it stains everything and is a nightmare to clean, which is something you'll be busy with since transmission fluid will get into every nook and cranny of your hardware. The Reddit post ends with a tip of the hat to Dodge, who helped power this cooling system with their transmission cooler. The ATF was from Valvoline, who unfortunately missed the shout-out.

NWSL

There are goals, and then there are the goals in a soccer player's life that they will never forget.

KK Ream's 85th-minute strike to seal Utah Royals' 2-1 victory over Portland Thorns at a packed Providence Park on Friday night was one of the latter.

This, after all, was a moment of history. The Utah native became the youngest NWSL player to score a regular-season goal, just 52 days after her 16th birthday.

The previous record belonged to Kansas City's Alex Pfeiffer, who was just 16 years, three months and 20 days old when she scored on March 16, 2024. Pfeffier herself had only recently dethroned Olivia Moultrie, Ream's opponent on Friday: Moultrie (whose goal in June 2022 came at the age of 16 years, nine months and 26 days) was only able to do so after mounting a legal challenge to the league's under-18 entry mechanism, which allowed teens to play in the NWSL.



Ream's goal was historic and a beauty, too.

She entered the match in the 80th minute. Utah was holding a narrow 1-0 lead when Bianca St-Georges charged into the box and forced a save from Portland's 'keeper Mackenzie Arnold. The rebound fell to Mina Tanaka, but Arnold somehow blocked her shot with her foot. The ball bounced free again, and Ream pounced, smashing it off the post before it spun into the net.

“I saw Bianca with the ball, and she took a great hit, and I was running as fast as I could into the box, and it got deflected to me, and then I just put it in,” Ream said post-match.

And she did not shy away from letting reporters know she has been working hard for the opportunity. “It honestly just feels really good to see all my hard work and me trying to earn minutes.”

Utah forward Cloe Lacasse, who came off in the 24th minute, witnessed the moment at close quarters. “I don't think she could see that it went in, so I kind of just ran up to her, and said, ‘KK, you scored!'” she told The Athletic. “I'm just so proud of her. I think just being the young player that she is, it's just about growth, right? It's about these experiences. And I'm sure it was so special for her, for her family.”

Friday's goal was monumental for Ream, but it was not the first time she has carved out her place in NWSL history. In May, she became the league's youngest starter at 15 years old.

“She does it in training, every week,” said forward Paige Monaghan, who scored Utah's first goal earlier in the evening. “To see her doing it in the game and to secure a win for us, and then her making history, it was huge. It was everything.”

Born in Herriman, Utah, Ream joined the Utah Royals FC AZ academy in 2019, playing up multiple age groups. While in Arizona, she also suited up for the boys' side, RSL Arizona of MLS Next, often sharing the field with her twin brother, Linkon. In 2022, she returned home and joined Utah Avalanche, where she tested herself against boys her age and girls several years older.

By 2024, Ream's rise was impossible to ignore. She began training with the Royals' first team during preseason, and on December 11, the club signed her to a three-year under-18 contract — making her the youngest player in franchise history at just 15 years and 157 days old.

“She's been working so hard. I don't remember working that hard at her age; it's just so deserved,” said St-Georges. “It was really fun to celebrate, especially being on the field with her.”

“It's so deserved,” added defender Kaleigh Riehl, who was next to Ream when she scored. “We see her work day in and day out, and it was honestly a crucial moment for the team. We really needed a goal there, and it was just so awesome that she was the one to get it. And at the time, I didn't know it was a record.”

Ream is part of a new wave of teenage talent reshaping the league. While a college degree remains valuable, players like Ream and Moultrie, Mak Whitham, Angel City FC's Kennedy Fuller and Casey Yu-jin Phair are opting to go pro early and proving themselves to be valuable assets to their clubs.

“It just like, dinked around, dinked around,” said Utah's goalkeeper, Mandy McGlynn. “And I was like, was that KK? Did KK slide that thing in there? I was really proud of her to score not only her first goal, but a game-winner, a beautiful one.”

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has managed in some of the loudest atmospheres in the world. Still, he had never experienced the chaos that is an American college football gameday. 

That is, until Saturday, when the 53-year-old attended the highly anticipated matchup between the No. 1 University of Texas Longhorns and No. 3 Ohio State Buckeyes appearing on Fox Sports' Big Noon Kickoff show. 

Before kickoff, Pochettino met with Austin FC co-owner Matthew McConaughey and was shown on the big screen at Ohio Stadium, before appearing on the network that will also show the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Alongside Pochettino were Rob Stone, who has hosted soccer coverage on Fox for several years, and former USMNT defender Alexi Lalas. 

Pochettino confirmed on air that it was his first football game, and went on to lead the Buckeye faithful in an “OH-IO” chant outside the stadium, before Lalas followed up by starting a U-S-A chant. 

“The most important is to arrive in a very good condition and be competitive and to let these (fans) be very proud of the team and be excited,” Pochettino said on-air. “I think it's going to be an unbelievable event and I think it's going to be (vital) for USA and soccer and the future of soccer. And only what we want is our fans to enjoy, like they will today.”

OH-IO@USMNT Head Coach Mauricio Pochettino get the @OhioStateFB crowd going 🇺🇸🙌 pic.twitter.com/jK57d6ntEI

While the appearance may not be expected for many soccer head coaches, Pochettino finds himself in a unique time with the USMNT, as the team and sport attempt to develop further focus ahead of next summer's tournament. 

Meanwhile, getting in front of cameras on some of the most-watched sporting events of the weekend brings the USMNT to the forefront of people's minds, despite the lackluster play on the pitch through the Copa América, Concacaf Nations League and Concacaf Gold Cup. 

It won't take his focus off the USMNT, though, as he gets set to welcome a controversial roster for friendly matches against South Korea in Harrison, N.J., and Japan in Columbus, Ohio, even without highly-regarded players Weston McKennie, Malik Tillman and others. 

After the September friendlies, the USMNT will have only four international windows before opening the 2026 World Cup in Los Angeles on June 12, 2026.

A claim has been made as to the reason why US President Donald Trump joined Chelsea's Club World Cup celebrations.

It was a controversial and awkward affair really, and you could see in the players faces that they were left confused and likely annoyed by the occurrence.

Chelsea beat PSG in the final of the Club World Cup to become Champions of the World in what was an incredible achievement for the club.

The lads celebrated after the game and did the usual trophy lift on the podium. Trump walked out onto the pitch at the end of the game alongside Chelsea co-owner Todd Boehly to hand out the medals.

But there was a surprise to then see him stay within the Chelsea players when Reece James lifted the trophy. Chelsea's players were rather miffed by this. But apparently it was Chelsea that asked him to stay up there.

Eric Trump has told The BBC that Chelsea invited Donald Trump on to the stage for their Club World Cup celebrations.

Eric says that Chelsea said ‘it would be the greatest honour of their life' to have Trump there.

Hmmmm…. I'm not sure this will get a great response from some fans.

However, there is no doubt that having Trump up there bought a lot of news coverage and attention to Chelsea. So you could say that it was some solid PR work by the club, although I'm not sure at this point whether it was good or bad PR!

A packed house with more than 60,000 fans will be supporting Brian Schmetzer's team at Lumen Field on Sunday evening.

The 2025 Leagues Cup wraps up this evening with a highly attractive clash that pits Seattle Sounders against with the side from Washington State looking to bag their first Leagues Cup trophy with the Herons aiming to scoop the cup for a second time.

Lionel Messi appears fit and ready to play after making a return to action in the semi-final win against Orlando City in a Florida derby that saw Javier Mascherano's men prevail with a 3-1 win.

However, ahead of the game, it's the Sounders who are being highly tipped as the form team ahead of the game and this is boosted by the fact that more than 60,000 fans will pack into Lumen Field to support the ‘Rave Green'.

#LeaguesCup2025 Final is set 🔝😮‍💨An epic clash between @SoundersFC and @InterMiamiCF awaits 🏆Nos vemos el próximo domingo en Lumen Field 🏟️ pic.twitter.com/oNrfsiyZ44

By advancing to the final of the Leagues Cup, the Sounders booked their spot in the 2026 edition of the Concacaf Champions Cup, giving themselves another opportunity to show out even further on the regional stage and potentially qualify again for the FIFA Club World Cup. 

Seattle have been in fine form since the Club World Cup visited the Emerald City and despite losing all three games in the FIFA tournament, their form has improved as they posted a 10-1-3 record in 14 matches during the summer months.

“The Club World Cup was certainly part of it, playing top-level teams,” said Sounders player Cristian Roldan. “You focus in, you zone in a little more. We came together collectively. It's our team, the way we're built, the way we're set up. It's a great group of guys, we're all in this together. We all bought into our goals and objectives of the year. We all gave a little bit more after that Club World Cup. We're riding on it now and on the wave, and hopefully we can continue to build and improve on that.”

A 25-year-old Mumbai investment banker was ecstatic about the prospect of traveling to the United States to witness the FIFA World Cup with his father. He'd been dreaming about that moment since he and his father made their way to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. However, those intentions were abruptly put on hold when he was refused a US visa, leaving him absolutely stunned.

The banker, who makes about Rs. 2 lakh a month after taxes, had carefully planned his trip, Financial Express reported. Though his company could only authorize three weeks, he planned to remain in the US for four weeks.

The applicant mentioned that he has a childhood friend with US citizenship in Seattle that he wanted to visit during his trip. However, his schedule was flexible depending on which FIFA match tickets he could get. While he would pay for his living expenses in the US, his father was willing to support his travel costs.

The actual visa interview lasted less than a minute, claimed the applicant, as per Financial Express. During the interview, the Indian applicant talked about his passion for football and his 2022 World Cup memories with his father when the consulate officer questioned him about the reason for his travel.

He further opened up about the cities he would visit and how long he planned to remain in the US. He was then questioned about his living situation and his parents' home.

At the end of the interview, the consulate officer surprisingly stated, “I'm sorry, you are rejected,” despite the fact that he had given clear answers. The interviewer did not ask him about his job, income, and travel history, the details which are deemed essential for visa evaluation.

Netizens react to Indian applicant's B1/B2 visa denialMeanwhile, several social media users attempted to find the reason behind the visa refusal to the Indian applicant. “You could have said i am planning to watch xxx vs xxx at xxx city, Childhood friend who is US citizen. High chances he might sponsor you for visa, Earning 2 lakh yet dad sponsoring is huge red flag. Consular officer assess everything and decide whether to approve or deny,” one user stated. Another person even stated that he would also turn down his visa if he were conducting his interview. Stressing that he was offering unnecessary information that was not essential, the user further said, “Purpose of the visit is: tourism/ watching football — not the long story about your dad sponsoring your trip. Be simple, clear and direct. And figure out at least some location you'll go to watch the match. It's too up in the air right now.”

Business

By Cheryl HallBusiness columnist

Business columnist

Monica Paul is on the last leg of a 16-year marathon as the final countdown to the 2026 FIFA World Cup has begun.

The 50-year-old executive director of the Dallas Sports Commission crafted the region's winning FIFA bid in what seems like eons ago. Now, she's busy working on zillions of details before the first early-round game takes place at AT&T Stadium on June 14.

She's spinning plates while having great fun.

All told, Dallas will host nine matches, including four knock-out games and one semifinal — more than any of the other 15 North American host cities.

“The World Cup is the largest sporting event in the world, so it was a must-have in my book for Dallas,” Paul said in a recent interview at her Sports Commission office in Fair Park. 

Dallas hosted the men's World Cup in 1994, when six games were played at Cotton Bowl stadium. “So it was never if we were going to bid on it, but how are we going to make it happen?” she said.

Arlington's iconic AT&T Stadium will become Dallas Stadium during the games. FIFA always keeps the venue names simple without sponsorships.

These days, Paul jockeys between her cramped sports commission basement office at Fair Park and her sparse World Cup office in Founders Square near the convention center — not that she spends much time in either of them. “Hey, we're a nonprofit, and it works for us.”

North Texas was the largest metropolitan area in the country without a sports commission until Paul created one in 2014 to go after the NCAA Women's Final Four in 2017 at AT&T Stadium. She pulled that off to rave reviews.

Paul and her staff of about a dozen scope out promising events. She goes after those prospects with the fierce competitiveness needed to succeed in this industry. 

And she's very, very successful. 

Paul is described by her multitude of fans as a humble leader who knows what needs to be done, works incredibly hard, earns trust and doesn't put herself at the center of the spotlight.

“Monica's the glue that brings everybody together,” said Dan Hunt, president and co-owner of FC Dallas. “There's a reason why we've had more big events with her serving in control than any other city in the United States.”

Or as Greg Bibb, CEO and managing partner of the WNBA's Dallas Wings, puts it: “Monica's superpower is her ability to connect people of all different backgrounds and interests so that they understand the common good of that initiative.

“Whether she's talking to the CEO of a Fortune 500 company or a volunteer at an event, she gets immediate buy-in from them.”

Bibb was introduced to Paul's aplomb in 2017, when he was founder and owner of Capital Sports Ventures and needed her help in getting 20 miles of city road closed off for his Dallas Bike Ride, a large-scale, public, traffic-free bike ride that ran through the center of downtown. 

“There are a lot of ingredients that make Dallas and North Texas the leading sports market for business in the country,” Bibb said. “But the most important ingredient is Monica.”

The World Cup has consumed most of Paul's professional life of late, but she's also juggled, pursued and kept Dallas at the forefront for many other sporting holy grails. She's already reeled in the 2030 NCAA Men's Final Four and the 2031 NCAA Women's Final Four.

Paul is in hot pursuit of the 2031 Men's Rugby World Cup and the Women's 2033 Rugby World Cup, and she's building a war chest to grab a dominant share of the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup, with the tournament final as the ultimate goal.

That's why it's imperative that things go off without a serious glitch next year. 

Paul is cool under pressure. She'll never let you see her sweat. 

That said, Paul admits to a “high-anxiety attack” three years ago as she stood in the predawn hours at AT&T Discovery District downtown waiting for FIFA to announce its 2026 World Cup host cities.

She fully expected Dallas to be among them.

And why not? 

Paul had marshaled support from the entire family of Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, AT&T Stadium, Dan Hunt and his older brother, Clark Hunt, the other local sports owners, as well as leading sports heroes, and business and civic luminaries throughout North Texas.

But when Paul looked on her iPhone at FIFA's North American online map, Dallas was nowhere to be found.

“My heart just dropped, and I thought, ‘This just can't be possible. How could I have possibly screwed this up so badly that Dallas is not going to be chosen as a host city?'” Paul recalled. “At this point, we'd been working on World Cup for about five years, and those five years flashed through my mind. ‘Is somebody playing a joke?'”

Her palpitations were quelled when FIFA reloaded its map showing North Texas among its 16 North American host cities.

Fast-forward to Feb, 4, 2024, when Paul, Hunt, Jones and a who's who entourage were at a large reveal party at AT&T's Stadium Club waiting to hear just what kind of bounty Dallas had hauled in for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Athletes Dirk Nowitzki, Marty Turco, Emmitt Smith and Paxton Pomykal, along with the mayors of Dallas, Arlington and Frisco were there waiting for FIFA's Sunday evening broadcast.

Encouraging rumors had North Texas getting five, six and maybe even seven games if it was lucky.

Paul, Jones and Hunt were seated front-and-center when the screens showed that Dallas had far exceeded anyone's expectations with nine games. They gave Paul a standing ovation. 

That news was just the beginning.

It's not just the nine games that stretch from June 15 to July 14. FIFA is designating the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center as its international broadcast center, where media outlets and the world's broadcast studios will set up shop for the whole tournament.

An undetermined number of teams will set up North Texas base camps. 

All will spend money on lodging, transportation and entertainment.

“I keep hearing that the economic impact could be worth north of $2 billion — maybe much more when the experts make their final calculations,” Hunt said. “The metroplex is truly the epicenter of World Cup 2026. That's not debatable.”

None of this happens without Paul, he said.

Hunt recently looked at his personal calendar for June and July 2026. “It was the coolest thing. Every few days, I saw a Dallas World Cup game come up.”

Paul's life has been a magical mystery tour of — among many other things — playing college volleyball, being a delegate of USA Women's National Olympic Volleyball, overseeing international events for both the men's and women's national volleyball teams, putting on the National Senior Games and helping save USA Taekwondo from Olympic decertification and financial ruin.

In the meantime, she finished her physical education degree and earned a master's degree in sports administration.

The middle-school girl who thought her school trip to Washington, D.C., was a big deal has been to 27 countries. She hasn't been to Antarctica or Africa. She'd love to get to Africa but will take a pass on Antarctica. “That might be too cold for me,” she said.

Paul delights in retelling how she was kicked off the National Honor Society at Caldwell High School because she wrote an English paper for another student for $30. 

Her punchline is that her classmate got a higher grade than she did.

Paul grew up as a tomboy on her family's farm. She was hell on four-wheelers and dirt bikes and rode tractors with her grandfather. She played basketball, golfed and threw shot put and discus before zeroing in on volleyball. 

She hated dresses and cried when her grandmother gave her one for Christmas. 

The high school valedictorian went to the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor in Belton, a private Christian college in the central corridor of Texas, on a full-ride academic scholarship — choosing it over one offered for volleyball.

Her playing days ended when she tore her ACL her freshman year, and she decided to transfer. “The 11-o'clock curfew just didn't fit what I was expecting my college experience to be.” 

Transferring to the University of Texas at Austin was a gamechanger.

Just before Paul's senior year as a physical education major, she spotted an ad in The Daily Texan for a volleyball team manager under UT's legendary head coach Mick Haley.

Haley was offered the top coaching position of the USA Women's National Volleyball Team in 1997 ahead of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. He asked Paul and an assistant coach to join him at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs the next May. 

“I hadn't finished my degree but knew that this was a once-in-a lifetime opportunity and that there were people who were way more qualified than me,” she said. “Hopefully, I'd shown my work ethic and initiative. And I'm like, ‘Yep, I'll take it.'”

Team USA wasn't expected to make it out of the first round of the competition, but it finished a surprisingly close fourth — just shy of a bronze medal. “It taught me, ‘Don't ever count yourself out.' It was amazing to see the team gel at the right time.”

Directing competitions for the 2007 National Senior Games in Louisville, Ky., was among her most personally gratifying experiences. “We had 14,000 athletes — including a 102-year-old bowler and table tennis player — in 18 sports at 36 different venues over 16 days.”

Over the years, Paul's been asked many unusual questions, but none like the one posed by a tennis player in the oldest age group. She needed to know the exact distance from the tennis courts to the nearest restroom.

Kellie Fischer, CFO of the Texas Rangers for 20 years, said Paul navigates among the most powerful businesspeople in the area as well as decision-makers both internationally and locally.

“The key players have always enjoyed camaraderie,” she said. “But Monica has been a significant part of bringing sports owners to the table when joint efforts were needed for special events like the World Cup.”

That's no small feat. At last count, North Texas has 14 professional sports teams, including the new-to-the-scene Dallas Trinity FC, a women's soccer team. 

Paul found a steadfast ally in Charlotte Jones, chief brand officer and co-owner of the Dallas Cowboys, 11 years ago when they crafted the successful bid for the NCAA Women's Final Four in 2017 at AT&T Stadium.

“Leader. Teammate. Friend. All of these apply to Monica, and we're so fortunate to have her on our side,” Jones said recently. “We wouldn't have the World Cup and many other events without her tireless effort. She approaches everything with an energy and competitive fire that's contagious, and you can always tell that her heart and love for Dallas are in it, too.”

Gina Miller, vice president of broadcasting, media and communications for FC Dallas, has seen Paul's overarching impact up close and personal.

“She brings cohesive vision to the D-FW sports market that motivates all of us to pursue world-class events and produce at the highest level,” Miller said. “Her leadership isn't just strategic. It's also deeply supportive, and that makes a real difference in how we collaborate and succeed as a region.”

Paul says that's because she and her team understand the role at hand. 

“We're not trying to run a professional team. We're not trying to run a venue. We're trying to bring in sporting events that generate economic impact and position Dallas and the D-FW region on a national and international stage,” she said. “I'm not going to step on toes.”

Dan Hunt is a very, very busy guy. The family-first co-owner of both FC Dallas and the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs also has numerous business and philanthropic interests. But he says his jam-packed calendar doesn't hold a candle to Paul's.

“Monica is one of the busiest human beings that I've ever known,” Hunt said. “Her attention to detail is amazing. She takes the most copious notes that become like this gigantic checklist that she and her staff systematically execute.”

People in her close orbit quickly respond to her texts and phone calls, but she can't always reciprocate.

Hunt has a three-text rule for reaching her. “Monica gets grace through three text messages, and then I call her because she's just so busy.”

Paul is slightly sleep deprived, getting about five hours a night with her beloved dachshunds, Stella and Rosa. “They allow me to share their bed with them.”

She tries hard to carve out time for friends. She celebrated her recent Big 5-0 with pals on an island off the coast of Cancun, and has weekly adult beverages on her patio in Addison. But she doesn't get to her Cedar Creek lake house to kick back and party as often as she'd like.

“Maybe it's both a strength and a detriment,” she said, “but I have a great work ethic to the point where work sometimes gets prioritized over personal health, family and friends. I have a hard time saying no to people. I don't want to disappoint them.”

True, Hunt says.

“There are a lot of conversations when we're about to add to her to-do list and she says to me, ‘Please don't do this to me' with a grin on her face, and then she makes it happen. She's a remarkable asset for this community.”

Kwesi Appiah with Ghana at 2014 World Cup  (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)

Kwesi Appiah's work in war-torn Sudan continues to earn global recognition, following an impressive run at the African Nations Championship with a fourth-place finish.

The Falcons of Jediane are among just eight teams yet to lose a game in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Africa.

Ahead of upcoming crucial games against Senegal and Togo in September, Appiah, who became the first Black African coach to lead a country (Ghana) to the FIFA World Cup in 2014, now has his focus on making history with Sudan.

He also shared insights into his journey with Sudan, the challenges he faces, and his prediction for the 2025 African Footballer of the Year. Appiah previously spoke to RG about his misconstrued comments about Nigeria. 

Despite being drawn in a tough Group B, Sudan has emerged as a genuine contender for a place at the 2026 tournament in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

Due to the ongoing conflict in Sudan, the national league has been suspended. As a result, Appiah's player pool is largely restricted to domestic stars from giants Al Hilal and Al Merrikh.

Both clubs have been competing in Mauritania's top flight to stay active and prepare for continental competitions.

“The whole experience has been tough,” Appiah told RG. “With the insecurity and absence of a national league, it's difficult to select players.

The good thing is that Al Hilal and Al Merrikh are still active, so I select many players from them. Sometimes, I also rely on Sudanese players based in Libya.”

Despite these limitations, Appiah credits much of his progress with Sudan to the autonomy granted him by the Sudanese FA.

“The most important thing is being able to select players yourself because you, as coach, know the tactics you want to play,” he explained.

“Football is not just about what happens on the pitch. You have to change the team's mindset. Many players are affected by the war and financial struggles. 

“My job is to help them shift focus from those issues and concentrate on competition. That mentality is key to success.”

However, the 65-year-old admitted the Sudan role has been one of his toughest yet.

“In Sudan, unlike other countries, the government doesn't finance the national teams. The FA manages everything alone, which makes things very difficult financially,” he said.

“But once you understand the reality on the ground, you adapt. You look at what you can do to help the situation beyond money.”

More than a decade ago, Appiah made history by guiding Ghana to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil - a rare feat in African football often dominated by foreign coaches.

“From AFCON to the CAF Champions League to the World Cup, I always aim to leave a footprint and what matters most is not what I did years ago but what I can do now with the players I have.”

Appiah also weighed in on the African Footballer of the Year debate, tipping either Liverpool's Mohamed Salah or PSG's Achraf Hakimi to succeed Nigeria's Ademola Lookman.

“Salah has been consistent with top performances in England,” Appiah noted. 

“But Hakimi has been exceptional too. Even as a defender, he's scored important goals and been vital for both PSG and Morocco.

“For me, if either Salah or Hakimi wins, they both deserve it.”

Hakimi and Salah helped their clubs to win their respective leagues in Europe, and they are on course to steer their countries, Morocco and Egypt, to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

RG spoke to Yevhen Cheberko about the Columbus Crew's season, making his long-awaited international return for Ukraine, and more in an exclusive interview.

Rangers beat out rivals to sign striker Bojan Miovski from Girona in a €3.5M deal plus add-ons, reuniting him with the Scottish Premiership

 FIFA President Infantino has assured fans of getting access to the US

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has assured football fans across the globe that the United States is ready to welcome travelling fans to the country for the 2026 World Cup.

This comes after it was reported that football fans from Africa “are a little bit jittery” about current events in the United States. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was told at a news conference in Kenya, which urged him to ensure African visitors to the tournament do not feel “outcast ... second-class citizens.”

The FIFA leader was reminded he met yet again last week with US President Donald Trump, who now has a gold World Cup trophy sitting in a glass case on his desk in the White House.

“We are going to play it in a country where some of us do not feel welcome,” said a reporter from South Africa, the home country of FIFA vice president Patrice Motsepe, who sat beside Infantino at a luxury hotel in Nairobi.

Motsepe is the brother-in-law of South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had a tense visit to the White House in May 2025 when Trump repeated his administration's baseless claims of white farmers being systematically killed in the country.

At least nine African nations will be in the 48-team lineup of the World Cup being played from June 11 to July 19 in 11 US cities, plus three in Mexico and two in Canada. Egypt, Morocco and South Africa are likely to qualify in October as current leaders of qualifying groups.

A 10th African team could advance in inter-continental playoffs scheduled after the tournament draw, which Trump and Infantino announced in the Oval Office last week will be held in Washington DC at the Kennedy Center on December 5.

“Everyone will be welcome in North America next year for the World Cup,” said Infantino, whose long-standing ties to Trump got him a seat in the Capitol Rotunda for the president's inauguration in January.

“I think it's important to clarify this. There is a lot of misconception out there,” the FIFA leader told a roomful of African media.

Tickets for the 104 World Cup games go on sale September 10, 2025, amid long-standing concerns about fans getting visas to enter the US, which has travel bans and watch lists for dozens of countries. Iran already qualified and will play at least three games at the World Cup.

“I think the onus is on you to make sure that Africa and all the other people of the world do not feel outcast, do not feel like they are being made second-class citizens in a world where equality should prevail,"" the South African reporter told Infantino and Motsepe.

The reporter's identity was not immediately clear — the news conference was carried on the Confederation of African Football's YouTube channel — but he said he's from South Africa.

Infantino was told earlier by a reporter: “African football fans are a little bit jittery about what is happening in the US in regards to the expansion of people who are in the US.”

Motsepe, a billionaire businessman who has led Africa's football body since 2021, insisted discreet work with US authorities had secured commitments to make the World Cup run smoothly.

“We are confident that we will fulfil whatever requirements they may have and there will be sufficient access to African fans in the World Cup next year,” Motsepe said.

Announcing travel bans in June, the Trump administration promised exemptions for teams and officials coming to the tournament — and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics — though the prospects for fans are less clear.

Infantino claimed fans came from 164 countries to the month-long Club World Cup hosted in 11 US cities in June and July “without, of course, any problems” with visas.

“The world needs occasions of unity,” said Infantino, who was told by Trump in the White House last week that FIFA would not be able to organise World Cup games in LA next year had the president not sent troops into the city this month. Eight games are scheduled at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, including the US team's opener on June 12.

“Be positive, you will see there will be a great, great celebration of the greatest FIFA World Cup ever,” Infantino said in Kenya.

Before the US Open, it had been a difficult season for Felix Auger-Aliassime at the majors. The Canadian had lost in the second round or earlier at the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon.

But the 25th seed showed he is alive and well at Flushing Meadows Saturday evening when he upset third seed Alexander Zverev 4-6, 7-6(7), 6-4, 6-4 for a place in the fourth round. It is his first time into the second week at the season's final Slam since he reached the semi-finals in 2021.

“This feels good. This feels good,” Auger-Aliassime said. “I've been coming here since 2018. I'm still young, but it's been a few years and I'm working my way. Some of you it might be the first time you're watching me tonight. But this feels really good.

“Obviously job's not done. The tournament's still going, but this means a lot to me. A lot of hard work, many years.”



Auger-Aliassime attacked at will inside Louis Armstrong Stadium, winning 24 of his 27 net points to eliminate the German in three hours and 48 minutes. Zverev walked on court with a 6-2 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry and held set point at 6/5 in the second-set tie-break for a two-sets-to-none advantage, but was unable to convert.

“It was a nervous start the first few games and after it was pretty crazy, pretty flawless. But still Sascha was serving unbelievable, so it was tough to get a break,” Auger-Aliassime said. “I got a bit lucky in the tie-break that it went my way, but with the way I played in the third and fourth, I still think whatever happened in the second, I would give myself a chance. I was seeing it big today and it's good when you feel like that on the court, for sure.”

Auger-Aliassime won the pair's only previous clash at a major at Wimbledon 2021 and by defeating Zverev in New York earned his first victory at the level against a Top-5 opponent (previously 0-6.)

The 25-year-old will next take on 15th seed Andrey Rublev, who survived a difficult five-setter against Coleman Wong 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Rublev will take a 7-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his showdown with Auger-Aliassime for a place in the quarter-finals.

""I think I would be a fool not to [use his win for confidence,"" Auger-Aliassime said. ""Of course this feels good. I'm going to try to recover as best as I can. Even though I looked not tired, it was tough on the legs, a lot of sprints, a lot of forehands. I'll try to recover my best. But these guys — Sascha, Andrey — these are all top players and they've been at the top of the game for many years, but I'm trying to be battling with them in those matches for sure.""

In other action, Alex de Minaur advanced to the fourth round in New York for the fifth time after Daniel Altmaier was forced to retire. De Minaur led the German 6-7(7), 6-3, 6-4, 2-0 when play was stopped. The Australian will next play Swiss qualifier Leandro Riedi, who also advanced via retirement. The 23-year-old led Kamil Majchrzak 5-3 when the Pole could not continue. Riedi is up 271 spots to No. 164 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Courtside Changeover: Taylor's resurgence, Coco's resilience and more from New York","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4352699/courtside-changeover-us-open-taylor-townsend-coco-gauff","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 02:57:02 GMT","

An in-depth look at everything that's gone down so far at the US Open, from Taylor Townsend's inspired run to Coco Gauff's Simone Biles shoutout to Venus Williams' unlikely pairing with Leylah Fernandez ... and so much more.

“New York City tends to bring out just a lot of drama.” -- Jessica Pegula

NEW YORK -- The first week of the US Open has delivered a mix of tense matches, comeback stories and off-court intrigue. Yet as the tournament heads into the second week, the top four seeds -- Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Pegula herself -- are still very much in play.

Pegula's offhand remark, made after her win over Victoria Azarenka on Friday, neatly captured the week's mood -- unpredictable, charged, and at times, bigger than tennis itself.

For those who have been following along -- and, particularly, those who haven't (you know who you are) -- we present Courtside Changeover, a look at the week that was and a sneak peek of what's coming up. 

It didn't take long for the New York crowd to fall in love with Alexandra Eala, who came back from 5-1 down in the third set to force a tiebreak against 14th seed Clara Tauson in the first round of the US Open.

The 20-year-old ended up winning the wild back-and-forth tiebreak, prevailing 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (11) to become the first player from the Philippines in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam main-draw match.

As that was happening, there was some more high drama over on Court 10, as Moyuka Uchijima edged Olga Danilovic 7-6 (2), 4-6, 7-6 (9). The first Monday of the tournament appropriately set the tone for the rest of the week. 

American Madison Keys battled relentlessly but couldn't overcome her many errors (more on that below) in a devastating first-round loss to Renata Zarazua (much more on her, too). After the match, the Australian Open champion was candid about how her nerves got the best of her in Arthur Ashe Stadium, calling it ""a little bit paralyzing.""

Those hoping for a deep run from Victoria Mboko were also disappointed, as the Montreal champion bowed out to two-time Slam champ Barbora Krejcikova 6-3, 6-2 in the first round. Not the result many expected, but there's no doubt the 19-year-old Canadian has many memorable Queens runs in her future.

The celebs always come out to the Open and bask in the one-of-a-kind scene that envelops the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, and this year has been no different. We won't bore you with all the names, but we'll list just a few: Lin-Manuel Miranda, John Mulaney and Olivia Munn, James Corden, Sabrina Ionescu, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Imperioli, Queen Latifah, Connie Britton ... you get the picture.

But perhaps our favorite ""star"" moment was Gauff shouting out Simone Biles for providing some much-needed inspiration from the seats during her second-round win over Donna Vekic. That was a cool moment.

We're gonna give doubles some much-deserved love here. 

This point is just nuts, for so many reasons.

Maybe photo of the year? Photo of the century? OK, we don't want to get too hyperbolic here, but this photo of Jasmine Paolini is objectively a once-in-a-lifetime snap.

And now you know who to dress up as for Halloween.

Ah, so many quotes, so little space to share them. 

Tough to choose, but we'll go with this one from Venus Williams: ""I always tell people, I'm not good at doubles. No one believes me.""

Um, you've won fourteen -- 14! -- doubles Slams (16, if you count mixed). So yes, we do not believe you.

Here's another great one from her new partner, Leylah Fernandez, upon finding out that Venus wanted to play with her: ""I was like a kid on Christmas day, just jumping around. I was so happy. I don't think I stopped smiling for the whole night, and even in the morning.""

And there was plenty to smile about. Much more on them below.

Yeah, it was a rough match for Keys, who smashed 46 winners but committed 89 unforced errors in her 3-hour and 10-minute loss to Zarazua. The 6-7 (10), 7-6 (3), 7-5 defeat was especially surprising because of how strong she's been in tight matches this year. Coming into this one, Keys led the Hologic WTA Tour with 15 three-set victories and 10 comeback wins.

On the other side of the net, Zarazua became the first Mexican woman to defeat a Top 10 seed at a Grand Slam since Angelica Gavaldon took down Jana Novotna at the 1995 Australian Open.

Some more insane numbers from that match: Zarazua won 131 points to Keys' 125.

Zarazua lost her next match to Diane Parry, dropping the third-set tiebreak 10-7.

Sometimes we forget how young Gauff is -- here's your reminder that she's still very young, and has accomplished an incredible amount before her 22nd birthday. We all know about the two Grand Slams, but in addition to the titles, she's been a prolific winner on the sport's biggest stage. With her three victories in New York this week, the World No. 3 now has 74 career wins at majors. Since 2000, only newly inducted Hall of Famer Maria Sharapova won more Grand Slam singles matches (85) before turning 22.

Coco turns 22 in March, so she has a bit more time to run up that tally with continued success in this tournament and a strong run in Australia next year. Amazingly, if she were to close out this tournament and win the Australian Open in January, she'd tie Sharapova with 85 on the nose.

Two of the most beloved players on the Hologic WTA Tour played their final match this week. Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova played her last match against Parry, and was quite emotional on court after the defeat as the gravity of the moment sunk in.

Later that day, former World No. 4 Caroline Garcia played her final match, a three-set loss to Kamilla Rakhimova.

Both had outstanding careers and were wonderful ambassadors for the sport (and continue to be). We'll miss them both, but we know we'll see them around sooner than later ...

What a monumental week it was for Townsend.

The 29-year-old American became the talk of the Open after her upset of 25th-seeded Jelena Ostapenko. Frustrated that Townsend didn't apologize after winning a point with the help of a net cord, the former French Open champion confronted her after the match in a rather uncomfortable scene. Townsend admirably took the high road, but strongly defended herself and her actions.

Players rallied around the World No. 139 -- who's also the top-ranked doubles player -- in the aftermath of the incident, as did the fans, and she seized the moment by ousting fifth-seeded Mirra Andreeva in an electric Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday night to advance to the fourth round.

OK, back to Venus and Leylah. Earlier this summer, in Cincinnati, the former US Open finalist talked about what a dream it would be to play the seven-time Grand Slam singles champion. They didn't end up squaring off in Ohio, but less than a month later they were on the same side of the net, as a team, in front of more than 14,000 rabid fans in Louis Armstrong Stadium.

A post shared by US Open (@usopen)

It was a party in Armstrong, as the unlikely American-Canadian pairing came back from 5-2 down in the first to upset sixth-seeded Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3.

And they weren't done. They followed it up with a straight-sets win over Eri Hozumi and Ulrikke Eikeri, and are into the third round.

We're thankful that Venus stuck around to play doubles, and watching these two together is a treat.

We've got some unbelievable matchups over the next two days. On Sunday, fourth-seeded Pegula squares off against countrywoman Ann Li, defending champion Sabalenka meets 95th-ranked Cristina Bucsa, two-time Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova plays the red-hot Townsend and ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina takes on former Wimbledon champ Marketa Vondrousova.

Labor Day's slate features the ultimate popcorn match -- Naomi Osaka vs. Gauff -- as well as Ekaterina Alexandrova vs. six-time Slam champion Swiatek, 11th-seeded Karolina Muchova vs. 27th-seeded Marta Kostyuk and Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova vs.  Beatriz Haddad Maia.

I tried, but the pain was too big,” he said in a statement. “Thanks for all your support through all the days and all the kind messages.”

After a relatively uncomplicated first set on Friday night, breaking in the seventh game of the match en route to clinching the opening frame, Djokovic looked like he was about to start cruising to a straight-set victory in the second set, not only bringing up triple break point with Norrie serving at 3-all, 0-40, but—after missing out on those opportunities—also moving ahead 3-1 in the tie-break.Norrie came alive at that moment, though, winning six of the next seven points to sneak out the breaker and even the match up at a set apiece—he then broke Djokovic in the first game of the third set, as an upset started looking more and more like a possibility.But it wasn't to be, as Djokovic not only broke right back in the next game, but ended up winning the next four games in a row to re-take control of the match, eventually closing out the third set, jumping out to a 3-0 lead in the fourth set and cruising to victory from there.""Particularly third and fourth kind of started swinging through the ball a bit more,"" Djokovic said after the match. ""And honestly, I was pleasantly surprised with Norrie's level. I think he was playing really aggressive. I was not used to him playing so close to the line and just really taking the ball early, particularly on the forehand side.""Credit to him for fighting and playing some really good level, particularly in the second set and beginning of the third. But I guess when it mattered, I came up with some really good points, good shots, good serves. Serving performance definitely the best so far.""Yeah, these kind of matches and performances always give me hope that I can go far, challenge the best players in the world.""

NEW YORK—Novak Djokovic never did this. Nor did Serena Williams. Not Roger Federer, nor Iga Swiatek nor Rafael Nadal. None of those Grand Slam champions—in fact, not many pros, period—have done what Coco Gauff is trying to do here at the US Open.And you wonder why she's been so emotional, so overwrought that in her second-round match with Donna Vekic she was unable to suppress tears on one changeover, and visibly trembled during another?Gauff is going where no great player has gone before. She is attempting to fix a major deficiency: a wayward serve. And doing it in real time, in a Grand Slam tournament, in full view of anyone watching.On Saturday at the US Open, Gauff showed signs that her bold gamble may be paying off. She rolled through No. 28 seed Magdalena Frech in a scant hour and 13 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium, 6-3, 6-1.

Frech, a 27-year-old from Poland, is short on power but has an elegant game full of classic, grooved shots, along with really quick feet. She engaged Gauff in numerous rallies of 20 shots or more, with both women firing away at each other's forehands—a challenge Gauff might have shied away from in the past, but met head on.Gaff got the best of most of those rallies. For the match: French made 17 forced errors to Gauff's nine, and nearly twice as many unforced ones (29-18).But the salient detail in the stats was that Gauff lobbed in only four double faults. She leads the WTA in that infamous department, with over 300 eight months into the year, 23 in one recent match in Montreal alone. After that match, Gauff knew that something had to give.In a lucky stroke, serve and biomechanical specialist Gavin Macmillen, who had worked wonders previously for Aryna Sabalenka, suddenly became available shortly before this tournament. Gauff was sick of having her guts twisted up over her serve, even when she still managed to win matches with her superb defense, rock-solid backhand, and steely determination. Defying convention—most players make changes in even far less consequential areas under cover of night—Gauff hired McMillen.

Gauff was sick of having her guts twisted up over her serve, even when she still managed to win matches with her superb defense, rock-solid backhand, and steely determination. Defying convention—most players make changes in even far less consequential areas under cover of night—Gauff hired McMillen.

I just felt like I didn't want to waste any more time. Coco Gauff on hiring a serve coach right before the US Open

It was, in some ways, high time. Gauff is such a superb athlete that she can compensate for or overcome any number of flaws, but perhaps not against elite opponents.The assignment for McMillen, a “sport performance specialist” in biomechanics, involved a variety of areas (including the forehand, which already looked much better). But the main focal point is the serve. To that end, he has changed Gauff's service motion, a delicate mission at the best of times, never mind in the pressure cooker of a major.“I just felt like I didn't want to waste any more time,” Gauff explained after her first win, over Ajla Tomljanovic, a harrowing, three-set slog in which she hit 10 double faults (which already was something of an improvement).“It's definitely tough going through the match and battling that internal battle, especially since this is the first tournament (with McMillan). The universe happens how it is, but I wish I could have done this maybe in Montreal.”

McMillan immediately set about making changes to Gauff's ball toss, her shoulder alignment, body rotation and launch point. He wanted her to focus less on serve speed than developing new muscle memory, a task Gauff has compared to “learning a new language.”The stress that had been building up in Gauff due to her serving woes, and the apprehension she felt taking a step so drastic, perhaps appearing desperate to many, caught up with her in the second round. Her match with Vekic was tight from the get-go, those tears she shed during the first set a nod to the pressure she was under as a former champion in New York, where she is beloved.Gauff managed to squeak out the first set with a 7-5 tiebreaker, but settled in to claim the second, 6-2. She hit only eight double faults, though—two fewer than her opponent. Something was working.

Surviving that challenge, Gauff struggled to control her relief. She also felt immense gratitude for a crowd that had done it's best to get her across the finish line. When Gauff addressed them, she said, “It's been a rough couple of weeks, but I'm just happy to be back on this court. You guys give me so much joy and the reason. . .”Tears began to trickle and glisten on Gauff's cheeks, and she stepped away from the microphone to regain her composure. When she resumed, wiping her face, she said, “You guys really help me a lot. So I'm doing this for myself, but I'm also doing it for you and no matter how tough it gets inside, you [we] can do it.”In her ensuing press conference, Gauff addressed the turbulence she felt in the first set:“I think it was just nerves and just pressure, honestly, and I'm someone that usually can thrive on that. There's been a lot on me this tournament, more than usual, which I expected coming in. . . [But] I was able to reset. It was a challenging moment for me on the court.”

A different sort of challenge awaits in the fourth round, where Gauff will face a resurgent Naomi Osaka, another former US Open champion—and one with whom Gauff has had an interesting history.In 2019, Osaka crushed 15-year-old Gauff in the third round on the same court that will host their next match. Gauff cried after that rout, but Osaka went over and comforted her with a hug. She also invited Gauff to join her in the winner's on-court interview, telling the youngster that speaking to the crowd was a better option than “crying in the shower.”Gauff doesn't believe she will feel any special pressure when she plays Osaka, whom she leads 3-2 in their series. Any emotions associated with that famous meeting in 2019 have long passed their use-by date. If anything, facing another major champion comes as a relief, no matter the state of Gauff's in-transition game.

This whole tournament I think will stick with me the rest of my career, knowing that if I can get through, like, two tough matches feeling how I'm feeling, I know I can get through pretty much anything.

She believes that a player of Osaka's caliber, against whom Gauff will not be a prohibitive favorite, will put her under far less pressure than having to duel with another underdog. The difference is especially germane because of Gauff's situation, although Osaka is also justified in rolling the dice, feel free to hit without inhibition. She's taken great strides of her own here in Gotham and has her own fish to fry.“I'm honestly excited to play her now, because I feel healthy, and I just want to see what happens.”Whatever the outcome, however far Gauff penetrates the draw, this tournament is already indelibly written into her mind.“This whole tournament I think will stick for me the rest of my career, knowing that if I can get through, like, two tough matches feeling how I'm feeling, I know I can get through pretty much anything,”Gauff said. “Regardless, I hope I get more Grand Slam finals and when those nerves come, I'll recall this feeling and know that it probably can't get much worse than this.”She spoke those last words with a smile, a stark contrast to the tears she shed not so long ago.

For tennis purists, it doesn't get much better than Karolina Muchova. The Czech is an athletic and artistic player who treats the court like a canvas to be painted with various colors and styles. She has the versatility to trade power shots, change tempo with slices and touch, or charge the net to finish with a volley. When almost all her peers lean on power baseline attacks, Muchova's fully formed game is almost an unorthodox throwback.Countrywoman Linda Noskova is decidedly more new school. The 20 year-old has some versatility in her game, but she's more of a carpenter—see ball, hammer ball. She announced herself to the tour in 2024 with a quarterfinal run in Melbourne that included a win over top-seeded Iga Swiatek.The Olympic doubles partners had never previously faced off before their third-round match Saturday on the Grandstand. Even though Muchova was the lower seed, the US Open website actually had Noskova the slight favorite. Some of that could have been due to Muchova's lack of matches this year, as well as playing two tough three-setters to reach this point of the draw. Whereas her younger opponent came in with two straight-set wins including a retirement in the previous round.In the end it was the veteran who used her craftiness and experience to fashion a 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-2 victory over her hard-hitting opponent. Here are some instructive takeaways from the all-Czech affair:

Czech players are renowned for being technically sound off the ground, and both women follow in that tradition. A great example is how they prepare the racquet in their forehand backswing. They use their off-hand to guide the racquet to the side of their body—not back—and turn their upper body. The hoop is even with their chest, with the strings facing the court and the butt cap pointed behind them. When they drop the racquet into the slot, it always remains on that side of their body. If you were their opponent looking straight at them from the other side of the court, the racquet head would never cross their backs throughout the entire motion. This leads to more efficient and consistent ball striking.

Both women have solid first serves, but Noskova really struggled on her second. She had nine double faults in the first set alone and 15 overall. Where Muchova has solid mechanics, Noskova's motion has a slight hitch in the backswing, and she can lose control over the racquet face. Plus, the sun over the Grandstand seemed to be giving her fits.Tennis is a difficult game, but it's not complicated. If your serve isn't clicking to start a match—as was the case with Noskova—take something off it to develop consistency. Especially if you're donating lots of double faults and struggling to hold serve. Once you start finding the range, building confidence and getting ahead in games, then you can go back to letting it rip.

“Muchova's variety and movement allow her to play a more all-court game than many,” says Mark Kovacs, a high-performance coach who has worked with numerous Tour players. “This variety provides her with the ability to change her game style as needed depending on her opponents.”Muchova recognized she wouldn't win by arm-wrestling with Noskova from the backcourt and was better off mixing spins, speeds and depth to create quicker, cat-and-mouse exchanges. She used her serve to open space in the court for her next shot, pressured Noskova's shaky second serve and dished out equal portions of junk balls and heavy strikes to keep Niskova guessing.Some players can be quite effective being somewhat one-dimensional, be it bashing serves and groundies or chasing down every ball. It brings clarity to an otherwise unruly game. However, when Plan A isn't working, Plan B is to see Plan A. It takes time to develop, but being able to attack opponents in a multitude of ways is a huge asset.

The match was a mostly nervy, uneven affair that neither woman will likely put in a time capsule. There were only a few extended rallies or dramatic shots that brought the sparse crowd to its feet. Both served for the first set—Muchova at 5-3 and Niskova at 6-5—and both imploded. As poorly as she served, Niskova still somehow managed to steal the first set in a tiebreaker. To her credit, Muchova didn't let the missed opportunity discourage her and continued to press her younger opponent into mistakes until she cracked.But that's tennis—most matches aren't works of art. Even if you're game is off, your level of compete doesn't have to follow suit. Stick with it and your opponent may hit a rough patch or panic at closing time. Someone has to win, might as well be you.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Leclerc crashes out after Antonelli spins the Ferrari into the wall

‘I had a really good weekend in the sessions where it mattered' – Piastri on Dutch GP win

Lando Norris finished fastest again at Zandvoort as McLaren dominated proceedings in Free Practice 3.

Lando Norris completed a clean sweep of fastest Free Practice times ahead of the Dutch Grand Prix, finishing more than two-tenths clear of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in the third session.

The duo stamped their authority on proceedings ahead of Qualifying on Saturday afternoon, finishing well clear of the rest of the field, which was headed by George Russell and Carlos Sainz.

Heavy overnight rain left the track damp at the start of the one-hour session, with drivers in no rush to head out on to the Zandvoort Circuit for several minutes.

Isack Hadjar was eventually the first to venture out, the Racing Bulls driver keen to make up for a lack of running in FP2 after coming to a stop on track with no laps under his belt.

But the Frenchman completed just one lap on the intermediate tyre before pitting, stating over the radio that ""the track is very green"" as Kimi Antonelli was the next to explore the circuit but on medium Pirelli rubber.

Practice 3 results

FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN DUTCH GRAND PRIX 2025

Antonelli moved back to the top with a 1m 13.740s and times began to tumble with the majority of the field performing installation laps approaching the 10-minute mark, with Franco Colapinto and Gabriel Bortoleto both jumping to the head of the standings on the hard tyre.

Lance Stroll in his repaired Aston Martin – after a heavy shunt in FP2 which required a survival cell change overnight – became the first driver to use the soft tyre and set a sub 1m 12s time, registering a 1m 11.854s, which was quickly beaten by Antonelli and then Fernando Alonso, the latter with a 1m 11.082s.

Friday pacesetter Norris set a new benchmark just after the 20-minute point, moving clear at the top of the times with a 1m 10.262s, with McLaren team mate Piastri less than one-tenth slower on his first lap with the soft tyre.

Max Verstappen moved back up to third with the medium compound, just over four-tenths slower than Norris as track conditions continued to improve approaching the halfway point, although free air was at a premium with 20 cars out on circuit.

With his second set of soft tyres, Piastri moved to the top with a 1m 10.120s, the Australian showing himself to be consistently quicker than Norris in the opening sector before losing time over the remainder of the lap.

Qualifying simulations became the focus for all teams in the final 15 minutes, with Norris setting a new benchmark – a 1m 08.972s – which was comfortably quicker than any of his Friday efforts.

Piastri was left trailing his team mate by more than two-tenths with his next effort, which proved to be the pair's best laps.

Verstappen's first lap on softs left him nearly a full second slower than Norris, as Russell just slotted ahead of the Red Bull driver.

Russell then suffered a bizarre moment as he was nearly collected by the Aston Martin of Alonso at high-speed as both headed towards the pit lane entrance, with the incident placed under investigation.

Sainz slotted his Williams ahead of Verstappen, with the home hero left in fifth from Charles Leclerc's Ferrari and the second Williams of Alex Albon. Stroll, Hadjar and Alonso completed the top 10.

Liam Lawson (Racing Bulls), Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) and Bortoleto (Kick Sauber) finished 11th-13th, with Lewis Hamilton's Ferrari only 14th.
Oliver Bearman (Haas) and Hulkenberg finished ahead of Antonelli, who was blocked by Stroll and Tsunoda on his final lap.

Esteban Ocon (Haas) finished ahead of the Alpine pair, led by Pierre Gasly and then Colapinto, ahead of Qualifying later this afternoon.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Leclerc crashes out after Antonelli spins the Ferrari into the wall

‘I had a really good weekend in the sessions where it mattered' – Piastri on Dutch GP win

Oscar Piastri has extended his championship lead following an eventful Dutch Grand Prix, in which McLaren team mate Lando Norris retired during the closing stages.

Oscar Piastri has taken victory in a hugely dramatic Dutch Grand Prix that saw McLaren team mate Lando Norris retire from the race due to a mechanical failure in the closing stages, marking a potentially seismic moment in the championship battle.

Piastri had made a good start from pole when the race got underway, the Australian going on to build a lead from Max Verstappen after the Red Bull had overtaken Norris early on in Lap 1. Norris, however, went on to retake the position and the pair settled into a 1-2 formation.

The race then faced a potential turn when the Safety Car was deployed after Lewis Hamilton hit the barriers on Lap 23, leading to a flurry of action in the pits. McLaren double-stacked their drivers and, despite a slight delay for Norris, both cars maintained position.

Norris continued his chase of his team mate from there and – despite a second Safety Car after a collision between Charles Leclerc and Kimi Antonelli that put the Ferrari out of the race – the fight looked to still be open as the race entered into its final stages.

However, everything changed when smoke started to emerge from Norris' McLaren with just a few laps to go, forcing him to retire at the side of the track. As the Briton cut a dejected figure, a final Safety Car phase played out which saw Piastri hold onto P1 from Verstappen and seal his seventh Grand Prix win of the season and in the process stretch his championship lead to 34 points.

Verstappen followed in second, while Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar converted an impressive P4 on the grid to third place, marking a maiden F1 podium for the rookie. George Russell took fourth for Mercedes, while Williams' Alex Albon claimed fifth after starting down in P15.

FORMULA 1 HEINEKEN DUTCH GRAND PRIX 2025

Haas' Ollie Bearman – who started from the pit lane – crossed the line in sixth after the American outfit made a one-stop strategy work under the Safety Car, with Aston Martin scoring a double points finish as Lance Stroll and Fernando Alonso grabbed seventh and eighth respectively.

Yuki Tsunoda took two points for Red Bull in P9, while Haas' Esteban Ocon added to his team's points haul by rounding out the top 10. Alpine's Franco Colapinto just missed out in P11, as did Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in P12.

Behind Lawson was Williams' Carlos Sainz, who was earlier handed a 10-second time penalty for a collision with the New Zealander, and Kick Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg and Gabriel Bortoleto were just behind in 14th and 15th.

Antonelli ended a tough day down in P16, the Italian having received two penalties during the latter stages following his collision with Leclerc, while Alpine's Pierre Gasly was the final classified driver down in P17.

Norris led the list of high-profile retirees after his late-race car failure, with the two Ferraris being the other two cars not to make the finish on a difficult day for the Scuderia.

After an exciting end to Saturday's Qualifying session saw Piastri just edge out Norris to take pole position, the paddock reconvened on Sunday for the first race of the second half of the 2025 season, the 72-lap Dutch Grand Prix.

It was confirmed in the build-up to the event that one change had been made to the starting order, with Bearman – who had qualified down in P19 – set to start from the pit lane after the Haas team changed power unit elements in his car under parc ferme conditions.

While rainfall had been forecast entering into the weekend at Zandvoort, the showers had mostly stayed away throughout the event so far – and this again looked to be the case as the race start approached, with the drivers greeted by dry albeit cloudy weather on Sunday. The risk of rain during the Grand Prix, however, stood at 60 per cent.

Meanwhile it was confirmed that Hamilton would be investigated after the race for a potential yellow flag infringement in a pit entry incident.

When the cars had assembled on the grid and the tyres blankets were removed ahead of the event – anticipated to be a one-stop race for many, though a two-stop could also not be ruled out – it was revealed that the majority of the pack would be starting on the medium compound, with the exception of Verstappen, Tsunoda, Colapinto and Hulkenberg running the soft while the Haas pair had bolted on the hard rubber.

Once the formation lap had been completed and the lights went out – under increasingly dark skies – Piastri made a strong start to hold the lead, while Norris soon came under pressure from Verstappen.

The Dutchman then had a wobble into Turn 3 after going around the outside of Norris, but managed to hold position and remain ahead of the Briton. Elsewhere Leclerc had gained a place on Russell to move up to fifth – with Hadjar leading a train of cars in fourth – while Albon had also made an impressive start to climb from P15 to P10.

Just as Piastri had extended his lead to more than two seconds by Lap 4, the McLaren driver was warned that “class one rain” was on the way in a matter of minutes. And as the next few laps ticked down, Verstappen's soft tyres looked to potentially be falling away, with Piastri's advantage growing to nearly four seconds as of Lap 8.

Norris, meanwhile, had closed in on Verstappen – the gap now within DRS range – and ultimately made a move around the outside of the reigning World Champion at Turn 1 on Lap 9, the British driver then given some encouragement by his race engineer to chase down Piastri.

Over in the pit lane, Stroll – who had earlier been noted for a collision with Bortoleto before the stewards deemed that no investigation was necessary – was the first to pit, the Canadian surprisingly emerging with the hard tyre bolted on despite the forecast suggesting incoming rain.

By Lap 12 Norris had pumped in another fastest lap as he continued to eat into Piastri's advantage, while Verstappen had dropped back to more than five seconds adrift of the Briton. Bearman, meanwhile, reported his concerns about Bortoleto's front wing, which had seemingly been damaged during his earlier incident with Stroll.

Shortly afterwards, replays showed Stroll appearing to run over a piece of debris on the track, suggesting that the endplate from the Kick Sauber had fallen off. Elsewhere Antonelli was hot on the tail of Tsunoda in a battle for 11th, while Alpine swapped their cars to put Gasly ahead as Colapinto's soft tyres looked to be fading.

Piastri radioed in about drops of rain on his visor at Lap 15 – and within a couple of laps, McLaren CEO Zak Brown was seen holding out his hand from his position at the pit wall to assess whether the rainfall had indeed arrived. The gap between the papaya cars now stood at three seconds.

Race control announced that Bortoleto was under investigation for driving his car in an unsafe condition, while his manager, Alonso, became the next car to pit for a set of hard tyres as his team mate had done earlier.

Others soon started to follow, with the likes of Tsunoda, Colapinto and Hulkenberg diving into the pit lane – all bolting on the hard compound – just as Norris was asked if he could get closer to the car ahead. “Maybe a touch,” the driver in P2 responded.

As he followed Russell up ahead, Hamilton suggested that an undercut might be necessary to get ahead – but on Lap 23 the Ferrari driver hit the barriers after going wide through the banking at Turn 3, putting him out of the race and sparking yellow flags which then became a Safety Car.

This triggered a flurry of action in the pit lane as most of the pack took the opportunity to make their stop, with McLaren double-stacking Piastri and Norris. All worked out smoothly for Piastri – who re-emerged as the leader – while Norris had a slight delay after being held up by the front jack but remained in second.

While the majority of the field had gone for the hard compound, Verstappen had put on a set of medium tyres and stayed in third, with Hadjar still in fourth from Russell, Leclerc, Lawson, Sainz, Ocon and Albon. The only drivers not to pit were the Haas cars.

All eyes were on how Piastri would handle the restart as the Safety Car phase came to an end on Lap 26 – and the Australian seemed to time it well, maintaining the lead from his team mate. Further back there was trouble for Lawson and Sainz, with contact between the pair seeing both drop backwards.

“He's just so stupid,” Sainz said of his rival as each car pitted due to damage on their respective cars. While these two were now down in P18 and P19, Piastri had built up a gap from Norris at the front to 1.7s by Lap 31 while Russell was trying to find a way past Hadjar in the scrap for fourth. “Moving under braking,” Russell commented as he fought with the Racing Bulls machine.

The Virtual Safety Car was soon deployed owing to a piece of debris on the main straight, with the crowd cheering when said piece of bodywork was recovered by a marshal. Meanwhile Norris was being told “we would try and go to the end on this” in terms of his strategy – and, behind him, a feisty Leclerc snatched P5 from Russell in a close duel.

Russell voiced his unhappiness about the manoeuvre over the radio, while Leclerc suggested that the Mercedes driver had not given him room earlier in the lap. Elsewhere Sainz's tricky day had gotten worse when he was handed a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision with Lawson.

The stewards were being kept busy at Zandvoort, with it then being confirmed that the incident between Leclerc and Russell would be investigated after the race. Up ahead, Norris – 1.7s adrift of his team mate – was told that his best chance to beat Piastri was to do so on track rather than via strategy.

There was also plenty going on further back. Alonso cut a frustrated figure in P13, the Aston Martin driver asking if an undercut was possible as he found himself in a train of cars led by Bearman in P11, with Tsunoda trying to find a way past the Haas.

Over at Mercedes, Russell – seemingly carrying some damage from his earlier altercation with Leclerc – was asked to let Antonelli through, moving the Italian up to P6 as he tried to chase down Leclerc with just over 30 laps to go.

By Lap 48, Piastri was continuing to lead Norris by 1.2s, with Verstappen still making his medium tyres last in third while Hadjar had kept his Racing Bulls in fourth. Sainz, meanwhile, was unhappy to be informed about his penalty for the Lawson incident, the Spaniard commenting: “Who? Who gets a penalty? Me? You are joking.”

With the final portion of the race still to go, there were plenty of questions remaining regarding strategy. If the Safety Car was deployed again, would McLaren pit their drivers or leave them out? Should that scenario not arise, though, Norris had around 20 laps to catch Piastri on track.

Elsewhere, Alonso had pitted earlier on following his frustrations and had found a way past Bortoleto to move up to 15th, while Antonelli and Leclerc each pitted – only for Leclerc to then hit the barriers after being hit by the Mercedes, putting the Ferrari out of the race just out of the Turn 3 banking.

Those earlier questions about a second Safety Car then came to fruition as the vehicle was sent out again, with McLaren carrying out another double-stack for the hard tyres while the majority of the pack also took the opportunity to put on another set of tyres.

Antonelli limped back to the pits, having sustained damage in that clash with Leclerc – and to make matters worse for the Italian, he was subsequently handed a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision, as well as being noted for speeding in the pit lane. Elsewhere, the two Haas cars both made a long-awaited stop, while Tsunoda was told that he needed to manage a throttle issue.

As Lap 57 ticked down, the Safety Car peeled into the pits and Piastri again executed the restart well – and while Norris initially faced pressure from Verstappen, the Dutchman looking racy on a fresh set of soft tyres, the McLaren pair were able to break away.

The intra-team battle was still very much alive, though, with Norris remaining on the tail of Piastri with just over 10 laps to go. Behind them, Antonelli was given a five-second time penalty for speeding in the pit lane, meaning that the rookie – running in seventh – would need to maintain a decent gap from the chasing Bearman in eighth to keep that position.

“Possibly a few very light drops,” Piastri was warned of potential impending rain with a few laps to go – but the race then took a dramatic turn when Norris reported a strange smell from his car just as smoke started to emerge from the back of the McLaren, forcing the Briton to pull over and retire from the Grand Prix.

As the Safety Car appeared for a third time, Norris was seen perching on the grass near to his stricken car, with the retirement marking a potentially pivotal moment in the championship battle. Also still sat in the sand dunes in another section of the track was Leclerc, both drivers cutting pensive figures.

While those watching on tried to digest what had happened, the race was still not over – and the Safety Car again returned to the pits on Lap 70, with Piastri holding off any potential challenge from Verstappen while Hadjar was now looking at a potential debut podium in third.

After a drama-packed 72 laps, Piastri ultimately crossed the line by 1.271s from Verstappen to seal a seventh Grand Prix triumph of the season and extend his championship lead to 34 points over Norris following the Briton's retirement.

Behind them was Hadjar in P3, the Racing Bulls driver marking an impressive afternoon at Zandvoort with his debut appearance on the rostrum. Russell – who will visit the stewards after the race following that earlier battle with Leclerc – claimed fourth, ahead of Albon in fifth.

Bearman grabbed a career-best P6, with Stroll, Alonso, Tsunoda and Ocon rounding out the top 10. Colapinto again missed out on points in P11, as did Lawson (P12), Sainz (P13), Hulkenberg (P14) and Bortoleto (P15).

Antonelli dropped to 16th following his penalties, bringing a tough day for the Italian to an end, while Gasly completed the order in 17th place.

Norris, Leclerc and Hamilton were the three retires from the race, with Ferrari's non-score meaning that Mercedes are now 12 points away from the Scuderia in the fight for P2 of the Teams' Championship.

""It feels good obviously,"" said Piastri. ""I feel like it's a pretty hard act to follow Isack standing up here so I'll try my best. I controlled the race when I needed to and obviously incredibly unfortunate for Lando at the end, but I felt like I was in control of that one and just used the pace when I needed to. It was a bit of a different race to 12 months ago, so [I'm] very happy with all the work we've done to try and improve around here. Very satisfied to come out on top.""

F1 will travel directly from Zandvoort to Monza for the Italian Grand Prix over the weekend of September 5-7. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Leclerc crashes out after Antonelli spins the Ferrari into the wall

‘I had a really good weekend in the sessions where it mattered' – Piastri on Dutch GP win

A collision at the banked Turn 3 ended Charles Leclerc's day early at the Zandvoort Circuit.

Charles Leclerc's Dutch Grand Prix came to an early end after contact with Kimi Antonelli, making it a double retirement for Ferrari on Sunday.

With a fresh set of soft tyres, Leclerc rejoined just in front of Antonelli, the Mercedes driver having pitted a lap early for fresh rubber towards the final third of proceedings.

Coming through the banked Turn 3, Antonelli took the low line on the inside but drifted up high, colliding with Leclerc which sent the Ferrari spinning into the barrier.

While Leclerc retired on the spot, Antonelli was able to recover back to the pits as a Safety Car, but the young Italian was slapped with a 10-second penalty for the incident.

The same spot also marked the end for Lewis Hamilton's race in the second Ferrari, the seven-time World Champion drifting up into the barrier as light rain fell on the Zandvoort Circuit early on.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Leclerc crashes out after Antonelli spins the Ferrari into the wall

‘I had a really good weekend in the sessions where it mattered' – Piastri on Dutch GP win

It was a day of mixed fortunes for Aston Martin in Qualifying for the Dutch Grand Prix, with Lance Stroll making an early exit following a spin into the barriers while Fernando Alonso progressed to P10.

Lance Stroll has given a downbeat assessment of his prospects for the Dutch Grand Prix after a spin into the barriers during Qualifying put him out of the session, meaning that he will line up at the back of the grid in P20.

After a hefty crash in Friday's Free Practice 2 cut short the Canadian's running on that occasion, repair work from the Aston Martin team ensured that his car was ready for action again come Saturday.

However, following a P8 finish on the timesheets in FP3, Stroll's Qualifying came to an early end when he dipped a wheel on the grass a few minutes into Q1, sending the AMR25 into a spin across the gravel before hitting the barriers. Click play on the video player above to watch the incident.

While Stroll was able to keep the car running and limp back to the pits, the damage was seemingly too extensive to send him back out on track, leaving him at the bottom of the order in 20th place.

Reflecting on the incident afterwards, Stroll explained: “I got a wheel on the grass and that was it. It's really frustrating. Nothing more to say.

“We tried to repair what we could, but not possible…”

In terms of how he assesses his chances for the rest of the weekend at Zandvoort, the 26-year-old responded: “Ah, difficult, difficult. Our chances now are kind of done.”

On the other side of the garage, Fernando Alonso capitalised on the pace that Aston Martin had displayed on Friday – a day in which he ended FP2 in second place on the timesheets – by progressing through to Q3.

However, the Spaniard had to settle for the final spot in the top 10, having been unable to catch his rivals ahead.

Asked after the session if he was still pleased with his Qualifying efforts, Alonso answered: “Yeah, I think so. I think once you are in the top 10 it is already a target achieved on the weekend to enter Q3.

“Obviously when you are last in Q3, 10th is not the best starting position but it's what we deserved today. It's one tenth and a half in front of us [to] P9, so it's not like it's even close, so we need to get better for tomorrow.

“We have a different tyre selection than some other teams and hopefully tomorrow it pays off.”

The performance comes after a good outing for the squad just prior to the summer break in Hungary, giving Alonso additional hope for what can be achieved on Sunday at the Dutch Grand Prix.

“I think after Spa we needed some Q3 appearances and [to] feel competitive, so the last two weekends have been good,” the 44-year-old conceded.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Leclerc crashes out after Antonelli spins the Ferrari into the wall

‘I had a really good weekend in the sessions where it mattered' – Piastri on Dutch GP win

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort.

As widely predicted, we have an all-McLaren front row in Zandvoort, with championship leader Oscar Piastri on pole from team mate and title rival Lando Norris. Less expected was the second-row line-up of World Champion Max Verstappen in the Red Bull, alongside the Racing Bulls of Isack Hadjar, in a career-best P4.

George Russell is the lead Mercedes in fifth, followed by the Ferrari duo of Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. Liam Lawson makes it two Racing Bulls in the top 10 in P8, ahead of Williams' Carlos Sainz and fellow Spaniard Fernando Alonso in the Aston Martin.

At the back of the order, the second Aston Martin of Lance Stroll lines up in P19 following his Q1 retirement, while starting from the pit lane will be the Haas of Oliver Bearman. The British driver had qualified one place ahead of Stroll, but has since had multiple power unit elements changed on his car.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Leclerc crashes out after Antonelli spins the Ferrari into the wall

‘I had a really good weekend in the sessions where it mattered' – Piastri on Dutch GP win

The best middle sector out of anyone in Qualifying helped Max Verstappen claim third on the grid for his home event at Zandvoort.

Max Verstappen hailed his Qualifying performance for the Dutch Grand Prix as ""the best I've felt all weekend"", with the home hero set to start third on the grid in Sunday's race.

The four-time World Champion struggled to find pace in his Red Bull during practice at the Zandvoort Circuit, and suggested that even reaching the top five on the grid would be a challenge.

While the Dutchman was unable to challenge the McLaren duo of polesitter Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris, Verstappen was left only 0.263s behind the pair having also surprisingly set the fastest middle sector out of anyone.

""This weekend so far was quite tricky for us but in Qualifying, was basically the best I've felt all weekend, so that's exactly what you want,"" said Verstappen post-Qualifying.

""To be honest to be P3 here, very happy with that. The energy of the crowd of course the whole weekend already has been amazing and to see so much orange on the grandstands is always very special.""

When asked about his chances of challenging the McLarens ahead in Sunday's race and adding a fourth Dutch Grand Prix victory to his credentials, Verstappen was realistic about his prospects.

""Let's see what we can do. I mean, the McLarens have been very fast all weekend,"" said Verstappen.

""It's also important to just focus on our own race and see what we can do, but this has been a good step forward. I hope that we can keep that up also going into the race tomorrow.""

Red Bull team mate Yuki Tsunoda once again struggled to match the performance of Verstappen in Qualifying, eventually posting a time good enough for 13th on the grid.

The Japanese driver was left frustrated at a lack of pace having initially believed his lap times had been strong.

""To be honest, from Q1 I felt pretty on the edge. I gave my best to be honest, today. I have to see where I can improve but I think I was pretty happy with the lap to be honest. Pretty tough,"" he said.

""I'll try my best to score points. At least it's not too far away. Anything can happen so I'll try my best.""

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Leclerc crashes out after Antonelli spins the Ferrari into the wall

‘I had a really good weekend in the sessions where it mattered' – Piastri on Dutch GP win

There was a dramatic moment for Mercedes' George Russell and the Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso during third practice at the Dutch Grand Prix.

George Russell and Fernando Alonso had a very close call that saw them narrowly avoid contact in an unusual incident during third and final practice at the Dutch Grand Prix.

The Mercedes driver was in front of Alonso heading out of the final corner but, as they approached the pit entry, the two-time World Champion had to take evading action when Russell suddenly moved over as if about to pit, only to then continue on for another lap.

Alonso, left with nowhere to go, dived into the pits himself, leaving the Aston Martin man to remark: “They don't look at their mirrors.”

The incident was investigated after the session, with Mercedes handed a €7,500 fine and Russell a warning.

The stewards wrote: “Car 14 [Alonso] was on a push lap and was exiting Turn 14 when Car 63 [Russell] was on a slow lap and had been instructed to enter the pits. Car 14 went on the inside of Car 63 in an attempt to complete the lap but Car 63, taking a wide line before entering the pits, nearly collided with Car 14 at pit entry. Car 63 took evasive action and aborted the pit entry and continued on the track.

“Car 14 had to abort the lap and enter the pit lane to avoid a collision.

“It was clear to us that Car 63 had not been warned of the fact that Car 14 was approaching and that it was on a push lap. The team admitted this at the hearing and acknowledged that they ought to have warned the driver of Car 63 but did not do so. Their failure created a dangerous situation where both cars had to take evasive action to avoid a collision.

“We accept that the driver of Car 63 had no way of knowing that Car 14 was approaching, particularly given the nature of the circuit and the fact that Turn 14 is a blind corner. Merely looking at the mirrors would not have prevented what occurred. We accordingly imposed a fine of €7,500 on the team for failing to warn their driver appropriately.

“Nevertheless, given the nature of the circuit and the slow speed at which he was travelling, it would have been prudent for Car 63 to have kept more to the right of the track to leave space for faster cars coming around that corner. We also administer a warning to the driver for this.”

The star opens up about becoming the elusive and high-ranking Russian puppet master Vadim Baranov in Olivier Assayas' political thriller: ""If I'm going to try be an actor, this is the kind of work I have to challenge myself with.""


							By 

	Lily Ford



Paul Dano hasn't talked about his new film yet. “You're my first,” the American star laughs to The Hollywood Reporter in his first interview about the Venice-bound political thriller. “So let's see.”


	It's another midweek New York day for Dano, but in no time at all he'll be setting foot on the lido — for the first time in his career — to present Olivier Assayas‘ The Wizard of the Kremlin, premiering in competition on Aug. 31. The French filmmaker is beloved on the festival circuit having served on both the juries in Cannes and Locarno. He won best screenplay in Venice for his 2012 movie Something in the Air and in 2016, took home best director on the Croisette for Personal Shopper with Kristen Stewart.

	But it was the five-and-a-half-hour TV show/movie hybrid project Carlos (2010), centered on the life of Venezuelan terrorist Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, that caught Dano's attention. “Carlos, in particular, I think is a pretty astonishing piece of work,” Dano says about getting the opportunity to work with Assayas, a filmmaker he describes as “a fiercely intelligent human being.”


	This precursory knowledge came in handy when flipping through Assayas' and Emmanuel Carrère's Kremlin script. “Knowing the scope he could achieve, the length of time this covered — it was quite an ambitious piece on first read,” Dano says, recalling that there was something “lean and spare” about the draft. The desire to sign on was immediate. “It was pretty cut and dry, frankly: if I'm going to try be an actor, this is the kind of work I have to challenge myself with.”

	











	In The Wizard of the Kremlin, Dano, star of Little Miss Sunshine, There Will Be Blood, 12 Years a Slave and more recently, The Batman, is the enigmatic and cunning Vadim Baranov, the fictional character from Giuliano da Empoli's 2022 novel of the same name. Now retired from business, Baranov is recounting his time as a theater director and reality TV producer-turned-politician. He becomes something of a puppeteer at a tumultuous time for the Russian government — the country is wading through the final years of the Soviet Union and into the stormy seas of the Russian Federation — and we become privy to Baranov's influence over a middle-aged Vladimir Putin (Jude Law), who soars to power in the early 2000s.


	“It's called The Wizard of the Kremlin, right? Like The Wizard of Oz. And I think we all want to see behind the curtain,” Dano says about the elusive inner workings of the Russian court in Moscow. “I certainly found reading the book completely illuminating — getting a window into a country and into a world of politics and power that I do not know much about. There's incredible psychological complexity and it has moral complexity as well, and I think that's actually really important right now.”


	Dano confesses he can't believe the word he's about to use even exists. “It's amazing that ‘post-truth' is something that is part of our lexicon,” he tells THR. “[But] I felt like we had the chance to explore a character like Baranov and try to tell the audience something… And I do think that these politicians have played a big part in creating and perpetuating [a post-truth landscape]. The theater of power, the control of optics and information, and I think in some ways, the obliteration of of truth.”

	











	Needless to say, the actor was “endlessly compelled” arriving on Assayas' set: “I don't know that I've ever kept reading so much about a subject matter while working on something.” Admittedly, it wasn't an era of history that Dano was over-familiar with. He took to documentaries and books to get up to speed as quickly as possible — Kremlin‘s director and titular star were dedicated to creating a character they were both satisfied with.


	“It feels very far from who I am, actually. So I was surprised how compelled I was by it,” says Dano about his soft-spoken, quietly commanding portrayal of Baranov. “It was like a new part of me getting tickled and getting awoken and having to work with: how do I lust for power? What's my relationship to power?”


	Baranov ended up taking a long time to craft. “He is not just based on one character, so you really have to just forge your own path. His father and grandfather were both victims of change in Russia, and [I thought about] what that might energize a young man to want. The desire to be great, to have purpose… He just found that the right vessel to work in ended up being in politics.”


	Dano adds: “I think working in television was the first step to that, especially in trashy television and reality TV — something of the dark arts. You might set out to be a white wizard and you become a dark wizard. You know?” When THR suggests this reality TV-to-politician pipeline sounds awfully reminiscent, the actor simply nods. “I didn't think [this] while we were making it, but when I saw it for the first time, I really thought it was about complicity, how many of us are complicit, how easy it is to be complicit.” Baranov's alignment to Putin, he says, “is purely about being able to touch and wield and influence power.”

	











	Law, in particular, had an abundance of material to work with embodying someone who remains at the forefront of the geopolitical stage. The final product is a no-nonsense and charmless ex-KGB agent who discovered an insatiable appetite for power when thrust to the top of the Kremlin food chain. For a split second, Dano considers what's the more difficult task — playing a real-life politician or a fictional one. Then: “I would wager to say it's scarier to play Vladimir Putin than probably many people. I know Jude put in a lot of work… And I'm sure he was scared, but he did not seem it one bit. I remember [on] his first day, I think I was more nervous to be working with him for the first time than he was to be playing Putin.”


	The pair of them will join fellow castmates Alicia Vikander, Tom Sturridge and Jeffrey Wright on the red carpet for Kremlin at the end of the month. Dano is raring to go ahead of his Venice Film Festival debut — the star has a suit fitting booked after the interview to ensure he's looking “snazzy” — but still, at the height of his career, he's juggling movies with parenthood. Filming in Riga, Latvia for Kremlin wasn't the most ideal of commutes for the father-of-two (Dano is married to fellow thespian Zoe Kazan), but he's making it work. His approach to taking on roles is something akin to “an atom of energy bouncing off of one wall to go in the other direction,” he explains.


	And while he might be a newbie on the lido, Dano's feeling good about Kremlin. “I can't wait to see what other people think,” he tells THR. “I hope that we have some fun reactions and I hope that it stirs something in the culture.”

	











	What does Dano think about sending this film out into the world at a time when democracy often feels as precarious in the West as it does in Russia? “I suppose that is part of the energy in there, in terms of the characters, the creativity, the research,” he responds. “If I'm being honest, I think my first hope with film and with art is that it somehow just either moves you or provokes you in some way, shape or form. I don't think we're ringing the bell, it doesn't quite feel like that. [But] hopefully we're uncovering something and it resonates with people out there.”


	“I learned a lot,” he adds, referencing the sweeping authoritarianism oft associated with the Soviet Union, a system some might say we now find scratching at the Western world's door. “And I think we all have to tread carefully right now.”

One year after premiering 'Conclave' in the Rockies, Edward Berger returned to unveil his latest film, a portrait of a gambling addict in Macao whose luck is running out.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	Few people in the film industry have had a more impressive last few years than Edward Berger, who directed 2022's All Quiet on the Western Front, for which he was Oscar-nominated, and 2024's Conclave, for which he should have been, and Colin Farrell, who starred in 2022's The Banshees of Inisherin, which brought him a long-overdue first Oscar nom, Thirteen Lives and The Batman, to say nothing of the 2024 limited series The Penguin, for which he is currently Emmy-nominated.


	Therefore, it was rather exciting to learn that the two had joined forces for Ballad of a Small Player, a film about a self-destructive gambling addict and con artist in present-day Macao who grows increasingly desperate as his luck runs out. Adapted by Rowan Joffe from Lawrence Osborne's 2014 novel of the same name, and also featuring Fala Chen and Tilda Swinton in supporting roles, Ballad had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival's Werner Herzog Theater on Friday night.

	I'm pleased to report that it is a funny, sad, stylish and altogether entertaining time at the movies. It's also completely different from the two aforementioned Berger films, in terms of size and tone. Those were large-scale epics about matters of social consequence, and became across-the-board Oscar contenders, landing nine and eight noms, respectively. This one is more of an intimate character study and, for me, evoked memories of 2015's Mississippi Grind, 2019's Uncut Gems and, of course, 1974's and 2014's The Gambler. As far as awards, I suspect attention will largely center on Farrell's tour-de-force turn and Joffe's colorful screenplay, both of which could well be Oscar-nominated.

Paul Dano stars in the Olivier Assayas-directed feature as the Kremlin's go-to spin doctor and propagandist, while Jude Law inhabits a ruthlessly ambitious young Vladimir Putin. 


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	Jude Law joked that he hopes he wasn't naive when he “didn't fear repercussions” for taking the part of Vladamir Putin in French director Olivier Assayas' The Wizard of the Kremlin, a fictionalized account of the Russian president's ruthless rise to power throughout the 1990s. The political thriller is premiering at the Venice Film Festival this weekend and Law, Assayas and stars Paul Dano, Alicia Vikander and Jeffrey Wright were all on hand on the Lido on Sunday to discuss its creation.


	“Olivier and I discussed that this wasn't to be an impersonation of Putin and he didn't want me to hide behind a mask of prosthetics,” Law said. “We worked with an amazing makeup and hair team and had references of that period in Putin's life. We tried to find a familiarity on me,” he explained.

	Although the actor's appearance is altered for the part, he speaks in his natural voice throughout the film rather than attempting a Russian accent.

	“It's amazing what a great wig can do,” Law added, drawing laughs from the festival crowd.


The Wizard of the Kremlin adapts Italian author Giuliano da Empoli's award-winning novel of the same name into a tense political drama about the rise of Putin's Russia. Paul Dano stars as Vadim Baranov, a gifted former artist-turned-spin doctor who masterminds propaganda and media manipulation at the Kremlin. Law portrays a younger Vladimir Putin, depicted as ruthlessly calculating and enigmatic, while Alicia Vikander plays Ksenia, Baranov's lover and moral counterweight. Spanning from the 1990s to the 2000s, the film dramatizes wars, disasters, and revolutions through Baranov's eyes, charting his transformation from idealist to architect of authoritarian power — as well as the personal toll of becoming Putin's “wizard.” Dano's character is based on Vladislav Sourkov, the real-life fixer who's been credited for helping choreograph Putin's ascent.

	











	When asked by a journalist whether he could find any positives in Putin's persona while playing the autocrat, Law paused to think, before saying, “Well, I learned judo, so I took my own positive from that.” 


	The actor said he “went down that rabbit hole” of watching archival footage of Putin, and that the “tricky side” of playing the character was how “the public face that we see gives very little away.”


	“There's this mask,” Law added, also referencing journalist Masha Gessen's book “The Man Without a Face: The Unlikely Rise of Vladimir Putin.”


	“So, I was conflicted as an actor, often, when Olivier would want me — understandably, as a character within a scene — to portray this or that with an emotion to motivate the scene,” Law explained. “I felt that conflict of trying to show very little but feel an awful lot from within — and that was the key, quite honestly.” 


	Assayas addressed the timeliness of the Putin story in a world where autocracy seems to be relentlessly on the rise.


	“The film is very much about how modern politics, 21st Century politics, were invented — and part of that evil arose from the rise to power of Vladimir Putin in Russia,” Assayas said. “We made a movie about what politics has become and the very scary and dangerous situation we all feel we are in. We took a case — which was the specific story of Vladimir Putin — but I think it applies to a lot of authoritarian leaders. … What's going on right now is not only terrifying, but especially because we haven't really seen a relevant reaction or answer to it emerging.”

George Clooney, Adam Sandler, Billy Crudup and Laura Dern shine in Noah Baumbach's meta film, which looks poised to contend for Oscars in a host of categories, including best picture.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


Jay Kelly, Noah Baumbach's new film about the personal sacrifices required of people who make movies, and of people who support those people, had its North American premiere at the Telluride Film Festival's Werner Herzog Theater on Saturday night, two days after its international bow at the Venice Film Festival. I have no doubt that upon reading that sentence, some will reflexively say, “Boo-hoo! Who cares about the problems of people in Hollywood? People in the real world have real problems.” And I can understand where they're coming from. But do you know who won't be among them? People in Hollywood, who also happen to account for the vast majority of people in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. For that reason — and even more so because the film is tremendously well made in every regard — I suspect that Jay Kelly will be a significant player this Oscar season.

					Venice Anoints 'Jay Kelly' and George Clooney With Thunderous Standing Ovation		
			









	The film, which Netflix will release in theaters on Nov. 14 and on its streaming platform on Dec. 5, stars George Clooney as the title character, who not only looks and behaves a lot like George Clooney (read: suave and charming) and is also a movie star (described as one of the last real movie stars), but also shares a similar history both personally (hailing from Kentucky) and professionally (a favorite of both critics and the public). I don't at all mean to suggest that Clooney is playing himself — he is, I can say as someone who has covered and crossed paths with him over the decades, a much more thoughtful and generous guy than Kelly — but they certainly share a lot in common.

	











	Jay Kelly, like all big movie stars, is supported by a “team” that includes a manager (Adam Sandler), a publicist (Laura Dern, who won an Oscar for Baumbach's Marriage Story), a makeup artist (Emily Mortimer) and a bodyguard. He has a ton of fans, but also, as is the case with all big movie stars, plenty of people who aren't fans. In Kelly's case, his own two daughters (Riley Keough and Grace Edwards) and father (Stacy Keach) have major issues with him. So, too, does a friend from their long-ago days in acting class (Billy Crudup), an unpleasant encounter with whom sparks an existential crisis for Kelly.


	The film becomes a road movie as Kelly, on the spur of the moment, heads to and through Europe in pursuit of his youngest daughter and en route to a film festival to collect a career achievement award, forcing his entourage to drop everything and join him, and forcing him to be amongst regular people for the first time in decades. The whole ordeal prompts Kelly to think back to key people and decision points in his life, and to literally — through movie magic — walk into those moments as an observer of his younger self (Charlie Rowe). As you may have gathered by now, there are undeniable echoes of Sullivan's Travels and 8 1/2.


	The film's original screenplay, by Baumbach and Mortimer, is razor-sharp — from the “Pickles never expire” scene with one of Kelly's early directors (Oscar winner Jim Broadbent), whose career did; to the interactions between Kelly and his old classmate, which take a wild turn; to the moment in which Kelly and his manager frankly address the nature of their long association. Baumbach has received screenwriting noms for The Squid and the Whale, Marriage Story and Barbie, and this script is in the same league, so I think the awards conversation around Jay Kelly must start there.

	











	Then there's Clooney. It took real guts for an A-lister to take on a part like Kelly; the somewhat dismissive “note” that both Clooney and Kelly occasionally receive is that they're always playing themselves, and this is a film that might further perpetuate that mistaken belief. (After Sunset Blvd., many assumed that Gloria Swanson was actually living a life like the deranged has-been she played in that film, and her career wasn't especially helped by its success.) But only an extremely skilled actor could convey all of the things that are silently going on beneath the surface for Kelly, and I suspect that the Academy, which has nominated Clooney for four previous performances — in 2005's Syriana (for which he won best supporting actor), 2007's Michael Clayton, 2009's Up in the Air and 2011's The Descendants (for which he lost to Jean Dujardin for a performance in another movie about the toll that Hollywood can take on an actor, The Artist) — will do so again for this one.


	Then there's the supporting players from the film's huge cast (which will surely be nominated for the best ensemble SAG Award). At the top of the list is Sandler, who, for nearly 40 years, has been acting in movies, and even if many of them have not exactly been critics' darlings, he has brought a lot of people a lot of joy over those years — and has, by now, actually given quite a few performances for which he stretched himself in impressive ways, including those in 2002's Punch Drunk Love, 2004's Spanglish, 2007's Reign Over Me, Baumbach's 2017 film The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected), 2019's Uncut Gems, 2022's Hustle and now this one. His character is a decent, hardworking guy who loves his family, but is also an operator (“Puppy!”) who always puts his prized client ahead of all else, partly out of a belief that they are truly friends, and then has to confront the possibility that he may have been wrong. I suspect that the combination of accumulated goodwill and this nuanced performance may earn the Sand-man an invitation to the Oscars for the first time as a nominee, as it should.

	











	That same courtesy ought to be afforded to Crudup, who absolutely crushes a complex assignment with very little screen time. The Method acting bit and the parking lot bit are mini-masterpieces.


	I could go on about Dern, Keach, Patrick Wilson, Eve Hewson and the other performers, who shine under Baumbach's direction (Baumbach has never received a best director Oscar nom, but that could change); the collaboration between Oscar-winning cinematographer Linus Sandgren and Emmy-winning production designer Mark Tildesley, which made possible those scenes in which the present meets the past, as well as an impressive opening oner; the original score by the great Nicholas Britell (Succession and Moonlight), which especially punctuates the climax of the film; and more. But the bottom line is that all of these elements will likely add up to a nice array of Oscar noms, and make Jay Kelly a serious contender for best picture.

Also starring Paul Dano and Alicia Vikander, the French director's adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli's bestselling novel premiered in competition in Venice.


							By 

	Jordan Mintzer



	As a French auteur with international pedigree, Olivier Assayas likes to split his time between intimate homegrown dramas and kinetic thrillers that never stay in the same place for too long. On one side, there are the director's very Gallic works like Late August, Early September, Summer Hours, Non-Fiction and recent COVID comedy Suspended Time. And on the other there are English-language flicks like Boarding Gate, Demonlover, Personal Shopper and Wasp Network that are constantly in movement, hopping between continents, cities and multiple genres (suspense, horror, espionage, etc.).

	The writer-director's sprawling new feature, The Wizard of the Kremlin, clearly falls into the latter category, chronicling three decades of life in post-Soviet Russia that saw the rise, and further rise, of Vladimir Putin to supreme leader of the land (or “tsar,” as he's referred to by everyone). The film is filled to the brim with real people and incidents, providing an entertaining primer to explain how a former Communist country was transformed into a cutthroat capitalist regime ruled by an authoritarian modeling himself on Stalin.

The Bottom Line

	
	A portrait of power that's ambitious to a fault.
	



Venue: Venice Film Festival (Competition)Cast: Paul Dano, Alicia Vikander, Tom Sturridge, Will Keen, Jeffrey Wright, Jude LawDirector: Olivier AssayasScreenwriters: Olivier Assayas, Emmanuel Carrère, based on the novel by Giuliano da Empoli

								2 hours 36 minutes			






	Assayas' movie coasts swiftly along, from the fall of the U.S.S.R in the late 1980s to the 2014 invasion of Crimea, with the director applying a fluid, unfussy style as he leaps between offices, hotels, mansions, forests, and streets in Moscow, London and other capitals. But things tend to get muddled whenever he slows down and tries to create real drama or memorable characters, at which point The Wizard of the Kremlin feels clunky and expository, as if the actors were reciting lines from the totalitarian's playbook.

	











	The script (written by Assayas and novelist Emmanuel Carrère, who appears in a small cameo) is based on French-Italian writer Giuliano da Empoli's bestselling novel from 2022, which was itself based on years of research and didn't fictionalize all that much except for its main character — the titular “wizard” inspired by Putin's former right-hand man and spin doctor, Vladislav Surkov. Here he's been renamed Vadim (or Vlad) Baranov and is played by Paul Dano in the actor's charmingly offhand and cerebral manner.


	Dano very much anchors the film, even if his character remains something of a cypher, and not necessarily a likable one, throughout the story. We first meet him when an American professor (Jeffrey Wright) is summoned to his massive estate outside Moscow. The two exchange a few pleasantries, including about their favorite writer Yevgeny Zamyatin, whose 1921 dystopian novel, We, famously inspired Orwell's 1984. Afterwards, Vlad sits down and begins to tell his tale, which lasts for the next two-and-a-half hours.


	The framing device feels a bit contrived, but the scenes between Dano and Wright are good enough to keep us interested. The rest of the action follows Baranov in flashback as he goes from punkish theater director at the tail end of the Soviet era to profiteer during the chaotic reign of a drunken Boris Yeltsin, until he becomes a successful reality TV producer during a ‘90s economic boom that saw the rise of Russia's oligarch class. One of them — the real Boris Berezovsky (Will Keen) — takes Baranov under his wing to help orchestrate the path to power of Putin (Jude Law), a cold, crafty and not-very-marketable former spy who was appointed by Yeltsin to run the FSB (ex-KGB) in 1998.

	











	If you just flinched while reading the name Jude Law, it's certainly jarring when he first appears as Russia's future dictator (is there another word for it?) and warmonger, not to mention a world leader committing crimes against humanity that are still happening right now. Lots of people love Law; far fewer love Putin. But the actor slips into the role flawlessly (with the help of good makeup), never overdoing it and adding a fair amount of gravitas to the constantly shifting scenery. Assayas' film gains momentum whenever he's on screen, and thus loses steam when Putin disappears for much of the third act.  


	The plot also gets bogged down in too many characters and events, which may be pivotal to explaining recent Russian history but not necessarily suitable to a gripping narrative. Assayas wants to pack everything and everyone in — from the Chechen War to the Moscow terrorist attacks to the Sochi Olympics, from dissident poet and politician Edouard Liminov (Magne-Havard Brekke) to Wagner group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin (Andris Keiss), casting lookalikes to play those brief parts.


The Wizard of the Kremlin can feel like a six-hour miniseries screened at 1.5x speed, so much does it zip around to try and tell the full story. And it's clearly an incredible story, revealing how Baranov used his savvy media skills to create the myth of Vladimir Putin, doping the public into propping up a seemingly modest man who turned into a tyrant. Many of the oligarchs backed Putin's rise, and those who eventually turned on him didn't end well. (For those unfamiliar with Berezovsky's fate, it features prominently in the last act.)   

	











	The rise of an authoritarian via a ruthless manipulator recalls last year's Donald Trump portrait The Apprentice in more ways than one, although that film smartly limited its scope to two major players and time periods. Assayas' movie is far more comprehensive but winds up overextending itself. In its closing reels, it casts aside the historical record for an invented domestic drama about Baranov's love affair with on-and-off girlfriend Ksenia (Alicia Vikander), who's attracted to powerful men (including fictional oligarch Dimitry Sidorov, played by Tom Sturridge), though cherishes her own freedom (and yachts and jewelry). Compared to Putin's attempts at world domination, this feels like trite stuff.


	But perhaps the main problem is that we really don't get to know Baranov intimately, even if he narrates the story and appears in nearly every scene. Both by choice and design, he remains a man in the shadows, which means we don't exactly care about his emotional squabbles, nor about what happens to him in the film's shock finale.


	Neither Baranov nor Putin — nor the many oligarchs, whether dead or alive — are the protagonists of The Wizard of the Kremlin, whose main character is ultimately Russia itself. In that sense, Assayas has crafted an ambitious chronicle that serves up plenty of compelling facts, but never turns them into the stuff of legend.

The Yours, C Tour had Cabello performing the 1998 radio earworm on piano.

	Ashley Iasimone



Camila Cabello surprised fans with a piano-ballad rendition of “Torn,” the single that became Natalie Imbruglia's breakthrough hit on U.S. radio in 1998, at a pair of shows in Australia this week (Aug. 27 and 30).

	Melbourne and Sydney, two of the final stops on Cabello's Yours, C Tour — the C,XOXO singer has a Sept. 14 concert slated for São Paulo, Brazil — were a fitting setting to cover “Torn,” recorded by the Australian-born Imbruglia for her 1997 debut studio album, Left of the Middle. Seated at the piano at both gigs, Cabello channeled the sincerity of Imbruglia's vocal performance on “Torn, and on Saturday night shared a video of one of her performances on X.

	“when in australia… you have to sing torn,” Cabello captioned the clip. “ily natalie imbruglia & ily australia.”

	Imbruglia's “Torn” soared to No. 1 on a trio of Billboard charts (Radio Songs, Pop Airplay and Adult Pop Airplay) in 1998, and peaked at No. 42 on the Hot 100. She was nominated for a Grammy for best female pop vocal performance for “Torn,” but ultimately lost to Celine Dion and her inescapable “My Heart Will Go On.” Though Imbruglia's take on “Torn” is the one most pop fans know, it was actually a cover for her, too — as the song was first released by the band Ednaswap in 1995.

	Six Disney Princesses — Jodi Benson (Ariel), Paige O' Hara (Belle), Auli'i Cravalho, (Moana), Susan Egan (Megara), Anika Noni Rose (Tiara) and Ginnifer Goodwin (“Snow White” from ‘Once Upon A Time') –get tested to see how well they know these classic Disney Princess songs.


	Auli'i Cravalho  


	It all depends on you. 


	Jodi Benson


	Sure, she's got everything. 


	Ginnifer Goodwin 


	Every time I see these OG princesses come out, I get emotional.


	Tetris Kelly 


	She's Tiana. This is Princess Tiana. 


	Susan Egan 


	This iconic music. It doesn't get any better.


	Tetris Kelly 


	I am standing with the original Ariel. I mean, performing in front of the original castle. Let's be real. So how did that feel tonight, to look out and see all the people singing back to you? 


	Jodi Benson  


	Oh my goodness, so magical. It's incredible and so special. Every time I get to sing the song, it's magical and special for me. But tonight was extra, extra special just because I got to be with my friends. 


	Paige O' Hara 


	Oh, it's so incredible. You know, we don't get to be together very often. And you know, it's the events like this, where this happens, and it's, it's kind of magical, you know, you kind of pinch yourself.


	Auli'i Cravalho 


	It's absolutely wonderful. You know, we've been in rehearsal last night. We all went home at around 5:30 a.m. setting this all up, the crew also breaking it all down before the park guests come in in the morning, and it still feels like magic. 


	Susan Egan 


	You know, that truly is what the Disney Magic is, is that every few years, you know, you get another generation. But what's really cool is watching the parents who grew up with this music, watch their children get into the music, and it just becomes this, you know, a new core memory for them as parents.

Jim Jarmusch was put on the spot about his feelings over distributor Mubi's controversial ongoing relationship with Silicon Valley-based private equity firm Sequoia Capital at the press conference for his Venice Golden Lion contender Father Mother Sister Brother on Sunday.


	The U.S. director is among hundreds of filmmakers to have signed an open letter calling on the company to hand back a $100 million investment from the investment firm due to its backing of a number of Israeli defence-tech start-ups.


	Mubi has North America rights for Father Mother Sister Brother as well as in a number of other territories, while the company's subsidiary The Match Factory has traditionally sold all of Jarmusch's films.

	The director said he had spoken to Mubi  about the issue and that the company's partner and Chief Content Officer Jason Ropell had called him directly shortly after the letter was published.


	“My relationship with Mubi was started much before that, and they were fantastic to work with on this film. I was, of course, disappointed and quite disconcerted by this relationship, and I think really, if you want to discuss it, you have to address Mubi about it. I'm not the spokesman,” he said.


	“However, yes, I was concerned. I also have a distribution agreement with Mubi for certain territories, which I had entered into before my knowledge of this, but having said that, on a personal level, I have to say I'm an independent filmmaker, and I have taken money from various sources to be able to realize my films and I consider pretty much all corporate money is dirty money.”


	“If you start analyzing each of these film companies and their financing structures, you're going to find a lot of nasty dirt. So it's all there. We could avoid it and not make films at all, but the films are what I choose to carry things I would like to say.”


	Jarmusch added, however, that it was not fair to the onus on filmmakers to address the issue of Mubi's sources of finance.

	











	“The artists, it's not us, it's Mubi, you must address concerning this, and not just Mubi, but other companies as well,” he said. 


	In the original open letter, the signatories highlighted Sequoia Capital's growing investments in Israeli military technology companies.


	It cited Kela Technologies, which was founded in the wake of the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Southern Israel, in which more than 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. Others referenced included military drone manufacturer, Neros, and the unmanned aerial vehicle manufacture, Mach Industries.


	The filmmakers suggested these investments tied Mubi to the ongoing violence in Gaza, where more than 63,000 people have been killed in Israel's retaliatory military campaign and mission to retrieve the remaining Israeli hostages. 


	The deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza is a hot button issue at this edition of the Venice Film Festival, which is unfolding six weeks shy of the second anniversary of the October 7 attacks. 


	Hundreds of protestors made up of largely of local political and grass-root groups, and a smattering of  accredited festival guests, marched across the Venice Lido on Saturday in support of Palestine and to denounce Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.


	They were barred from entering the festival complex but after a brief stand-off turned around and peacefully dispersed. 


Father Mother Sister Brother is constructed in the form of a triptych, the movie tells three stories exploring relationships between adult children, their somewhat distant parent (or parents), and each other. Each of the three chapters takes place in the present, and each in a different country.


	Written and directed by Jarmusch it gathers a starry ensemble cast featuring Tom Waits, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, Cate Blanchett, Vicky Krieps, Sarah Greene, Indya Moore, Luka Sabbat, and Françoise Lebrun.


	The film is presented by Mubi, Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello and The Apartment (a Fremantle Company), in association with Jarmusch's badjetlag and Gillibert's CG Cinema, Cinema Inutile, Films du Losange and Weltkino.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	Director Kent Jones and stars Willem Dafoe and Greta Lee touched down at the Venice Film Festival on Saturday with Late Fame.


	Dafoe stars as forgotten 1970s New York poet Ed Saxberger who is rediscovered by a group of well-heeled young admirers, while Lee plays Gloria, a talented but emotionally complex actress who is connected to the group.


	The wry drama received a rapturous reception from a 1,400-strong audience as it world premiered in Venice's Orizzonti section with the Jones, Dafoe and Lee taking to the stage for a short Q&A after the screening.

	Jones said the film tapped into his and Dafoe's relationship with downtown New York and their memories of the artistic community that thrived in SoHo in the 1970s and 80s and was then swept away by gentrification in the mid-1980s

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	“It's a movie that reflects New York as people live it,” said Jones. “It's an interesting thing in New York because so much changes so constantly, and there's so many things that one remembers from earlier times that are gone, and yet things stay the same visually, so you're haunted by them, and in SoHo, that's particularly present.”


	Jones originally moved to New York in 1980, while Dafoe experienced SoHo at the height of its time as a haven for artists, through his involvement in the experimental theater company, The Wooster Group.


	“Ed's past, the moment when he came to New York, is very close to the moment that I came to New York and the moment that Willem came to New York and so that was very, very important, really crucial to the project,” said Jones. 

	











	Dafoe said watching the film on the big screen – having previously viewed it on a screening link on a laptop – had reinforced his sense of personal connection with the story.


	“I was surprised because something that I say all the time in interviews is in the dialogue and I didn't remember. I used to be the youngest one in every group and then one day I became the oldest one. There was a lot of personal connection,” said the actor. 


	“This is not my life, but how I feel about New York, really being formed by my early days there, and having that be a very romantic, ambitious time… Of course, the comparison ends there, but this was very rich material for me.”


	He said his relationship with the younger cast members playing Saxberger's admirers – including Edmund Donovan as the group's foppish leader Meyer as well as Clay Singer, Luca Padovan, Arthur Langlie and Graham Campbell – sometimes veered into similar territory as the poets with 


	“They would seduce me into telling war stories about things that have happened, you know, way back when and what was it like to work with so and so… I would get puffed up and hold court… so I had lots of connection to this.”


Past Times and The Studio actress Lee said she fell for the character of Gloria from the minute she read the screenplay, by Oscar-nominated May December screenwriter Samy Burch and adapted from late Austrian writer Arthur Schnitzler's eponymous novel set in 1890s Vienna.

	“It was one of those moments, when I thought, ‘Oh, God, I have to play her'. Then when I was lucky enough to get the chance to, I couldn't believe it,” said Lee.


	“From the very beginning, our first conversations that we had about her with Kent, we were speaking about the kind of woman who perhaps doesn't exist anymore. The kind of woman who I loved and is the reason why I'm here today,” she continued.


	“The kind of woman who is incredibly nostalgic and romantic and looking to the past, looking to women like Marlene Dietrich. We watched Shanghai Express thinking about Sally Bowles, Liza Minnelli, incredible women and artists who I hold so dear to myself so it's very personal.


	“And just thinking about what it means to be an artist and to be in pursuit of the thing you love, which is art and the search for beauty and that sense of purpose, what it can bring to you in your life. Those were a few of the things we tried to incorporate into the character.”


Late Famous is the second fiction feature from after Jones after 2018 drama Diane, starring Mary Kay Place as a selfless woman navigating a toxic relationship with her heroin addict son.


	Former New York Film Festival director Jones is also known for his documentaries on filmmakers, including Hitchcock Truffaut and collaborations with Martin Scorsese, including Elia Kazan tribute A Letter To Elia and My Voyage To Italy and most recently, Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints. Scorsese,  takes an executive producer credit Late Fame. 


	Jones' other close collaborators over the years also include French director Arnaud Desplechin, taking co-writing credits on the latter's English-language drama Jimmy P. starring Benicio Del Toro.


	It is the first time the director has directed from a screenplay which is not his own.


	“I got a call from Pam Koffler at Killer Films, and she asked me if I read other people's screenplays. I liked May December. I said send it to me and let me see what I think. I was taken with it and ended up liking the screenplay more than the novella.”

	











	“It's not so much a reflection on fame as much as a reflection on how people are lured by things… a bunch of young guys, who pretend hey know more about poetry than they really do, turn up and say, ‘You're a master. We all love your book.' … Saxberger might have known better on one level, but then on another level, who could resist,” he adds.  


	“Once I was on board, I was involved in everything. Killer is great because they really do feel like the director has the last word,” he continues. “They're very, very supportive. I can't say enough good things about Pam, Christine [Vachon] and Mason [Plotts].”


	Once Dafoe was also on board, Jones and Burch worked together to tweak the screenplay to align it with the actor's real-life New York timeline.


	“It's almost like it was written for him. In the original draft of the script, the reference points were for someone who was older, so we worked on getting it to where Willem came to the city, which was more or less when I came to the city,” he said.


Anatomy of a Fall and Zone Of Interest actress Sandra Hüller had been originally set for the role of Gloria but had to pull out due to a scheduling clash.


	“Somebody said to me, I think that Greta Lee would be somebody who could work,” recalls Jones of the search for a replacement.


	“I kind of closed my eyes, and thought, ‘Why didn't somebody say that to me like five months ago',” he continues, adding that unbeknownst to him at the time, they both shared the same agent.


	Jones says Lee's versatility – ranging from her quietly powerful performance in Past Lives to more comedic roles in Russian Doll more recently The Studio –  shines through in her performance as Gloria, whose outward flamboyance hides a darker reality.


	One of Lee's key scenes in the film is Gloria's rendition of Surabaya Johnny, the tragic 1929 musical song by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht. Its lyrics about a woman in love with a man who treats her badly, chimes with Gloria's character, says Jones.


	“When we first started talking in the script, there was an indication in the first draft that she might do a strip tease. I was like, “I don't really want to do that. I I'm thinking of maybe having her sing, and Surabaya Johnny might be a good,”  recalls Jones.


	“She said, ‘You shouldn't have said that, because now you can't not do it'. She just immediately got to work on it. She was just a joy to work with.”


	Following its buzzy Venice premiere, Late Fame heads to Jones' former home of the New York Film Festival where it will screen with Q&As on September 28 and 29.


Late Fame is a a Killer Films production in association with Fresh Fish Films, Working Barn Productions, Morning Moon Productions and France's mk2 Films, which also handles international sales.

International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor


EXCLUSIVE: The first two episodes of Italian maestro Marco Bellocchio's new series for HBO Max, Portobello, will unspool at the Venice Film Festival on Monday. We've got a first look at the trailer – check it out above.


	The series is the first original Italian production introduced by Warner Bros Discovery for HBO Max and will launch in 2026. It tells the story of “one of the most blatant errors of Italian justice” involving TV presenter Enzo Tortora, and is billed as a tragic tale of the fall of an innocent man.


	In 1982, Tortora is at the peak of success. He hosts Portobello, which reaches 28 million viewers during primetime television, all eagerly waiting for the participant who will manage to get a word out of the program's guest of honor: a parrot.

During those years, the earthquake in Irpinia delivered the final blow to the fragile balance within the criminal organization Nuova Camorra Organizzata. Giovanni Pandico, a trusted subordinate of the mafia boss Raffaele Cutolo and faithful watcher of Portobello from his jail cell, decides to become an informer. While being questioned by the judges, he drops an unexpected name: Enzo Tortora. When, on 17 June 1983, the Carabinieri knock at his hotel door, Tortora believes it's a mistake. However, it is just the beginning of an ordeal that will drag him from riches to rags.”

Weekend Editor


	With multiple projects in the pipeline for the newly constructed DCU, James Gunn is assuring fans that, among them, is a long-gestating series focused on Task Force X leader Amanda Waller, originated onscreen by Oscar winner Viola Davis in 2016's Suicide Squad.


	Speaking to People in a recent interview, the Superman helmer confirmed he and DC Studios co-CEO Peter Safran are still “working on” the show.


	He said, “We're working on it, so we'll see what happens. Some things have moved faster than others. Waller's not been the fastest. But I can't wait to see Viola put on their Waller pants again.”

	Gunn is echoing sentiments both he and Safran expressed back in February, telling Deadline then that Waller — about the amoral U.S. government espionage director who dispatches the criminal misfit Suicide Squad team on missions — remains in the works, despite the project remaining difficult to break.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“We've taken a couple of cracks at Waller, and we haven't been able to land it,” Safran said at the time.


	“We're still working on it,” Gunn added, also noting the duo had to prioritize another spinoff, Peacemaker. “Waller has been tough, the strike was tough on Waller, there was a certain amount time that we needed to do Peacemaker first.”


	“We were going to go with Waller before Peacemaker [Season 2], but I wrote Peacemaker quickly and we were ready to go,” Gunn concluded.


	Davis played Waller in David Ayer's Suicide Squad and its sequel, 2021's The Suicide Squad, from Gunn. News of the Waller spinoff was first announced back in 2022, revealed at the time to feature Watchmen writer Christal Henry as scribe and executive producer alongside Davis. While Peacemaker is a comedy, Waller would fall into the drama category; Davis reprised the character in Peacemaker Season 1. 

	











	A year later, it was announced Doom Patrol creator Jeremy Carver would join Henry to co-write Waller.


	Aside from Waller, Max will release the forthcoming spinoff, Lanterns, aiming to debut in early 2026.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


	Oliver Assayas' topical drama The Wizard of the Kremlin, revolving around a scheming Russian spin doctor who smooths Vladimir Putin's ascent to power in the 1990s, world premiered in Venice this afternoon.


Paul Dano plays the titular role of Vadim Baranov, a former avant-garde artist and reality TV show producer, who becomes the unofficial advisor to ex-KGB agent Putin as rises up the political chain. Jude Law is Putin and is joined in the cast by Alicia Vikander, Jeffrey Wright and Tom Sturridge.


	The drama is getting mixed notices on the Lido. Jude Law comes in for praise from multiple publications but some are struggling with a perceived lack of verve.

	Deadline's Damon Wise describes the film as “engrossing”: “Though it is set almost entirely within the realpolitik of early 21st century Moscow, The Wizard of the Kremlin offers a warning to the West about how that state of affairs came to be.”


	He adds: “Unusually, though it clocks in at a hefty 156 minutes, it seldom drags, and it's almost disappointing that Assayas, who did such a great job with Carlos (2010) didn't take the mini-series route here too. Performance-wise, Jude Law is a surprisingly effective Putin, getting the President's pout to perfection, and giving him a slightly abrasive Estuary English accent. Dano, meanwhile, is up to something much more mysterious and mannered, speaking in a gentle singsong that takes a little bit of getting used to. Physically, he's a good fit for the role too, putting a benign face on a character who borders on sociopathic.”


	The International Cinephile Society gave the film four out of five stars, saying: “Olivier Assayas's latest effort is little more than the dramatization of a couple of Wikipedia pages. But in the hands of the French helmer and his lead man Paul Dano, ironically playing a supporting character, albeit an important one, in the rise of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin to the position of Russian dictator, this epic account becomes an engrossing tale on the power of corruption and the corruption of power.”

	











	Next Best Picture gave the film a score of 7/10, saying: “Olivier Assayas' political epic is crafted with a smart level of clarity that makes the wide-ranging story, filled with many characters, easy to follow. The intelligent screenplay is a delight to listen to”, before adding, “But at the same time, the script is more interesting before Jude Law's Putin shows up. After that point, it becomes a fairly repetitive series of scenes of political philosophizing.”


	Little White Lies struggled with the movie, noting: “Olivier Assayas' mad and maddening take on the mastermind behind Putin never quite lands a proper punch…As it stumbles towards its predictable final scene, The Wizard of the Kremlin fully abandons its attempt at riotous farce to try grasping at the sombre reality of the present. It is a commendable endeavour, but also one that completely misunderstands where the treasure chest of its premise lies, maddeningly pulling away from the welcome provocation of the absurd to add yet another desperate scream to the torturous echo chamber we are all currently trapped in.”


	As did The Playlist, calling it “a bloated bore”: “It might be tempting to compare Olivier Assayas' “The Wizard of the Kremlin” to a piece of Russian literature, but the points of similarity mostly end with it being long and dense. There's not much in the way of philosophical heft or psychological insight as the plot follows many decades in the life of Paul Dano's Vadim Baranov, the fictionalization of a real apparatchik spearheading Putin's communication strategy. While a comprehensive look at how the playbook for the paradoxical “sovereign democracy” came to be, the film proves clunky to watch.”


	Jude Law comes in for praise from multiple outlets. The Telegraph was mixed on the film, but wrote: “The tics of Russia's sociopath-in-chief are captured frighteningly well by Law in The Wizard of the Kremlin, an otherwise so-so new film.” Meanwhile, The Times Of London's review is behind a paywall but the paper declares that “Jude Law is perfect as a petulant Putin”.


	The Independent says “Jude Law is an intense, torso-baring Putin” but describes the movie as “a mediocre drama”: “Olivier Assayas's new film has some anarchic energy to it, but it lacks nuance and insight overall.”


	The feature has been adapted by Assayas and award-winning writer Emmanuel Carrère from Giuliano da Empoli's eponymous 2022 novel inspired by the career of Putin's real long-term adviser and spin doctor Vladislav Surkov.


	Pic is produced by Oliver Delbosc (Curiosa Films) and Sidonie Dumas (Gaumont) in coproduction with France 2 Cinéma with the participation of France Télévisions and Disney+. Gaumont is handling French distribution and international sales.

					By Mike Fleming Jr 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, Film


EXCLUSIVE: In between the albums Born To Run and Born In The USA that made him the world's biggest rock star, Bruce Springsteen took a radical detour, channeling the crippling alienation and crushing depression he was feeling into the seminal album Nebraska. Accomplished in a bedroom with orange shag carpet and with a crude recording system, Springsteen confronted the dark side of the American dream, as ghosts from his past were catching up to him too quickly for mentor Jon Landau to help beat them back. Premiering last night at the Werner Herzog Theater in Telluride, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere starts in a familiar place, startling as it is to see Emmy-winning The Bear star Jeremy Allen White channeling The Boss with the anthem Born To Run. The Scott Cooper-directed adaptation of the Warren Zanes book veers off into unexpected terrain, a terrifying plunge into depression and a love story between Springsteen and Jon Landau (played by Jeremy Strong) as they navigate the dangerous spiral of undiagnosed depression threatening to snuff out Springsteen's spark and maybe his life. Unable to commit to a relationship, ill equipped to handle the fame that put him on the cover of Time and Newsweek the same week when those things mattered and haunted by a toxic relationship with his father Doug (Stephen Graham), Deliver Me From Nowhere is far from the usual rock star movie. Springsteen and Landau were full creative participants in a movie that charts as an awards season contender from Disney's 20th Century Studios when it is released October 24.

DEADLINE: Scott, Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska was the album you played over and over as you worked out the beats of your film Out of the Furnace. What specific themes from that spare and dark album lent themselves to creating the tragic journey of the characters played by Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Zoe Saldana?  

	










			Watch on Deadline		







SCOTT COOPER: Alienation, quiet, despair, violence; characters who live on the margins, characters who reach for the American dream and fall short because that's much of America. You can't make a movie about who Springsteen is, and not feel like you're making a movie about America's soul. So as I was riding Out of the Furnace, it seemed to me I want to speak to the people that we never see in movies. People who live in Braddock, Pennsylvania are unfortunately sometimes forgotten. And even though that's a tough, violent movie, I wanted to make it clear that part of Pennsylvania is not immune to violence. If you ask Braddock's former mayor, John Fetterman, who's now the Senator for Pennsylvania, that city has been forged through fire. Much like Bruce was, as he was writing a very healing but incredibly dark record, with characters that aren't afraid to flinch at the darkest of times.


DEADLINE: In his book, Warren Zanes wrote about how this began with the persistence of Gotham Group's Eric Robinson, who produced with Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Scott Stuber, to get these rights after hearing the author on Mark Maron's podcast. I didn't see an obvious movie there when I read the book. What did you see that lent itself to such cinematic and narrative potential?


COOPER: What I saw in Warren's book is, it wasn't a cradle to the present day biopic. After the success of my first film Crazy Heart, I was asked to make a lot of those, whether it be Elvis, Miles Davis, Chet Baker, artists I adored, but didn't interest me [as film subjects]. What interested me about Warren's book was the emotional honesty and the intimacy of an artist that most people didn't realize was going through one of the most painful times of his life. It's a very specific and deeply personal, and out of that came one of his most enduring works. That felt like a spine that I could run through the film and then I could build it out so it wasn't just the story of a man in a room making a record. Warren's book was the seed, and through a lot of discussion with Bruce and his manager, mentor, confidante and therapist Jon Landau, I was able to hang a narrative on it that worked on a number of levels. We wouldn't have a film, without Warren's book.


DEADLINE: I recall Bruce being last to the party when every band was making videos for MTV…


COOPER: There is a video for Atlantic City.


DEADLINE: And Bruce isn't in it.  He finally relented for Born in the USA, but he has always been private for a global rock star and hasn't gone Hollywood. He has shared a lot of personal stuff with his difficult relationship with his father, telling stories onstage between songs, in his memoir, and his Broadway show. Why did he spark to a narrative film that depicts his existential plunge to rock bottom, so bad that he nearly kills himself in a car driving top speed at night with no headlights. 


COOPER: Why did he want to make this film?


DEADLINE: It's one of the most darkly personal films that I've ever seen about an iconic rock singer, where the artist participated…


JEREMY ALLEN WHITE: I think this is a period in Bruce's life where he was making a big choice. He's spoken a lot about it in in his memoir, and in Warren's book a little bit. He talks about when he was a young man who wasn't sure about his capabilities to be a good partner, to be a family man, to be a father. And I think in this period in his life, he was making a choice to change and follow that. 

	











DEADLINE: There is a girlfriend played by Odessa Young, a fictional composite of women he dated just to show he would not be able to make the commitments you describe until he fixes himself…


WHITE: In the way I was approaching it, this man was fighting for the family that he hasn't had yet. I think it was important that Bruce told this story in this time, because if he didn't make that choice to go in the right direction to seek help, to listen to Jon Landau, I don't know if he could have opened his life up for all of the beautiful things that he has now, Patti and his children.


JEREMY STRONG: Bruce is also a storyteller. He tells stories through music, but has a deep understanding of story. And I remember reading, and I don't know if it's in his autobiography or in one of Dave Marsh's books, but it is Bruce's Statement of the Blues. That is, essentially what it is that matters, how one might gain it and lose it, and the price paid for the attempt. And in a way that's the dramatic structure of almost all of his songs, but he himself understands the power of that structure in human life, and in his own life. So while some people might feel that is such a vulnerable thing to share, being up against the ropes the way he was at this time, I think he understands the power of that vulnerability, and that the wound is inextricably connected to the gift. This movie explores that.


DEADLINE: What was most important to him and Jon Landau when they entrusted you guys to tell the story of the making of that album and Bruce's breakdown?


COOPER: Bruce notoriously has said no to all overtures to make a narrative film since I think 1980. But once he understood that I was going to tell the story of a very specific and very personal time, and for Bruce most personal enduring work, he kept saying to me a couple things. He said, the truth about yourself isn't always pretty. I don't want you to look away or shy away from that truth about me. I know you weren't going to make a hagiography. I said, Bruce, no, I'm going to strip away the mythology. This is not a film about The Boss. This is not about the icon. I said, Jeremy White and I have discussed it, this is a regular man who just happens to be Springsteen. His one directive to me, through the screenplay, production and post was, just make a Scott Cooper film. Don't let anyone off the hook. Don't sand off the edges. I said, Bruce, I'm not sure I know how to do it any other way.


DEADLINE: Jeremy White, Springsteen fans know how hard he was on himself and his band while they recorded Born To Run — which he wanted to scrap when it was finished — Darkness on the Edge of Town and others because he's such a perfectionist. Did that make you think you'd be in for a tough time?


WHITE: I knew that about Bruce and the way he approached his work. And I think I understood how heavy it was for Bruce and for Jon to relinquish total control for the first time ever. They were present and they were always in communication with all of us. They were going to let Scott make the film that he was always going to make, and I was going to do what I did. But I was hyper-aware that they have been very careful and exacting, for about 50 years, about everything and that this was the first time that they've taken their hands off the wheel even for a moment. There was a gravity to that, absolutely.

	











DEADLINE: What was your biggest surprise in terms of how he nurtured, challenged and encouraged you as you prepared to step into his formidable shoes?


WHITE: The first thing that struck me was how available and accommodating he was and how he wanted me to succeed. I know that seems like an obvious thing, but I'm not sure that's always the case necessarily. He was there all the way through in the preparation, always available and we spoke a lot. But then when we started filming, he was around a lot, but I had to keep my head down. I was in such a fragile place and he was so present that I needed to be in my own world because I feel like if we were to communicate too much during the process of filming, I might've shattered, I might have really buckled under the pressure. Our job as actors really is, how much delusion can we muster up? And it's very difficult to live in delusion when you're looking at the man.  


	But he still carried me through. There were some nights I came home and I felt so beat up and like I wasn't measuring up. Every time I felt that way, my phone would ding and I'd have a message from Bruce. It could have been about the smallest moment, a glance, the way that I turned a page in a book. But he always focused on a moment that he found particularly true or honest that I had achieved during that day. Those messages allowed me to close my eyes, get some rest, and wake up the next day and go to work.


DEADLINE: You learn guitar and how to sing like him, and from the opening moments with Born to Run, it's kind of awe-inspiring. I have personally been mangling his songs in my car for over 40 years. It is hard to sing like him…


WHITE: Aw, I bet you would sound pretty good…


DEADLINE: I'm going to go with a sound approximating what you'd hear if you started the car and realize your cat got caught in the fan belt. But you, you fared so well, it left me thinking if this acting thing doesn't work out, you could front a Springsteen tribute band and make a living.


COOPER: And he did that in only six months.


DEADLINE: What was the key for you to find his voice in your voice, and was there a moment that you, Scott, Bruce and Jon said, yeah, he's got this.


WHITE: There was. I had never really sang before, and I worked with a wonderful vocal coach, Eric Vitro. During the process of working with Eric, my focus was, can I sound like him? Can I sing in key? Can I sing at all? And then as we were working, what should be the most obvious thing to me as an actor when approaching this is, what story are you telling? Where are you at? Have you written this down a hundred times? Where are you coming from? What character is Bruce playing? All these were questions that I ignored because I was so focused on sounding like him. It only happened when I let go of trying to sound like him, and I got to sing his songs like they were my own. That was when I was really able to get closer to him. And then it was in Nashville when it clicked for me. That's where me, Scott, and our music supervisor Dave Cobb recorded the majority of the songs for Nebraska. And that's where I found my confidence. Bruce listened to those songs about a week after we recorded them and he said, you sound enough like me, but you're making the songs your own. And he was like, I want that to be what the process of making this movie is like. That gave me such permission to go into the filming process. It put me at such ease to hear that he was pleased with the music, but also that he was supportive of me following my voice throughout the process, not just in the song recordings.

	











COOPER: I'll only add that from the beginning when I said to Bruce and then to Jeremy White, this is not about imitation or mimicry, it's about the embodiment of Bruce's soul. Jeremy has a very nice warm voice that Bruce happens to really like. I think the first song we approached was Nebraska, in Nashville. At that point, look, I knew that Jeremy had the intensity, the vulnerability, the authenticity. He had the two things that most embody Bruce, which is humility and swagger. He's got that. But that day in Nashville, I said, oh man, we're going to be in great shape here.  


DEADLINE: The darker parts of this movie brought up things for me, as they will for a lot of people. Though he eventually quit cold turkey one day, my own dad was an alcoholic when I grew up. I had some frightening childhood moments. It's like you're in a club, and I felt I understood why Will Smith slapped Chris Rock at the Oscars. I'd just read his memoir and the shame he felt as a boy, unable to  protect his mother from being hit by his father when he drank. When he felt his wife had been insulted, he was triggered to do what he did, even though it destroyed what should have been the pinnacle moment of his career. Bruce is part of that club, and you don't shy from it in this film. Can you guys talk a little bit about that all common relationship of fathers and sons of a certain generation, and why they create the kind of darkness and scars that caught up to and crippled Bruce when his career was soaring?


COOPER: The film's about many things, right? It's about a neglected soul repairing itself through music. It's a film about fathers and sons. It's a film about untreated mental health illness, unresolved trauma. You have to remember, Bruce grew up in incredibly poor circumstances. He didn't have warm running water until he was 18 years old. And he had a father who was cold and dispassionate. As Bruce said once, when I'm on stage for three and a half hours performing, I'm really connecting to people, I'm connecting to my fans. I'm reading into that and extrapolating that he didn't connect with some of the most important people in his life, like his father. He said, it's the other 21 hours that are very difficult for me. And much of that came from this relationship, the fathers and the son thing. In Douglas Springsteen's case from that era, men didn't know how to, or couldn't give voice to their pain.


	He didn't know that he was suffering from undiagnosed mental illness, he didn't have the means to seek out therapy, and was never told or directed toward therapy. He just had to live with it, every day. Unfortunately when that happens, the people closest to you suffer. And I'll tell you, Mike, after hearing your story, the amount of people who have seen the film who were there when I was filming, who told me they had the same relationship to their father, it shocked me. It's a very common occurrence. I think a lot of that is men who can't express themselves. And when that bubbles into rage, it comes out like the antidote. The episode with Will Smith, and certainly with Bruce and his father…I know what Bruce has with his own children. I don't know if you overcompensate, but I've seen Bruce with his kids and it's so loving, caring, and warm. I happen to know that his two sons have seen the movie with Bruce, and watching their reaction to the film about their grandfather and their father, I will take that to my grave because it was so moving. It was moving for Bruce to see his kids understand what he endured and that those boys don't have to. I don't know that I can speak directly to your question except to say that a lot of art deals with damage and repairing damage.

	











STRONG: In a piece with David Remnick maybe 20 years ago, Bruce talked about being a repairman, and using music to repair parts of himself. And I think that artists, great artists, are healers, they're wounded healers. If they have the courage to face and address and heal their own wounds, they can then heal others through their work. To me, that is what this is. Exploring the inheritance of the past…in a lyric, Bruce sang. ‘we inherit the sins, we inherit the flames.' He did inherit that in Freehold as a child. What do you then do with these flames so that they don't completely engulf you, so that you can survive? I think he was white-knuckling a lot of his life until this inflection point in 1982. And then he walked through the fire and got to the other side.


DEADLINE: Jeremy White, you played him. How did you connect to the backstory that so haunted Bruce?  


WHITE: I think he grew up in an environment and felt incredibly unsafe like so many children do. It's a sliding scale. It doesn't matter if your parent is mentally ill, alcoholic, narcissistic, whatever it is, unsafe is unsafe, and you grow up and it's difficult to trust and form thorough connection with other people and ultimately trust other people. I knew Bruce was coming from that environment. I spoke to Bruce very often about that panic attack that he had had at the county fair while he was on the road trip going to Los Angeles. And it was one of the first things we spoke about. I said, what did that feel like? What were you thinking about? And he said, I realized I was just an observer in my own life. And what Jeremy said about him performing is true. He was able to find some presence and be truly present and feel like he was connecting when he was playing music. It was the other 21 hours of the day that were very difficult, when he had this period where he just realized he was observing. It was the scariest moment of his life because he just felt like he was a complete outsider, had no control, had no say. And for me, I have my tools, but I am always trying to become more present in my own life. That is a fear that I am very familiar with, of just kind of stepping outside of yourself and being an observer in your own life. When Bruce told me that story, it was something I connected with immediately and very deeply. That was another point for me along with the Nashville recordings where I thought, okay, maybe this is a way in that I could really understand, this is something that Bruce and I share, and I can do his story justice.  


DEADLINE: I got to do a deep dive piece in Deadline's Cannes Disruptors issue this year on Bono. He turned his one-man stage show into a terrific movie for Apple TV+. Jeremy, you mention a sliding scale, and the emotional neglect that came from Bono's father was different from Bruce's. He was 14 when he watched his mother collapse at her father's funeral and she died of a brain aneurysm. His father grieved by never mentioning her name again in the house, and the fatherly approval Bono craved was in short supply. Bono spent his career trying to prove his father wrong and it lent edge to everything that he wrote and did. I knew all that about Bruce from listening to Darkness on the Edge of Town so many times, and from the stories about his father he told between songs in those bootleg concert albums. That became my North Star in trying to defy the terrible self-image I had. I asked Bono, if Bruce had grown up with love from his father, robbing him of that edge, would he have achieved greatness, or been a mechanic who on weekends moonlit as a great wedding singer? Bono said he'd seen Bruce in concert enough to feel he was the world's greatest wedding singer, bringing a congregation of thousands together each time he performs. What do you guys think? Is there a straight road to the top for the talented, or is it that pain that distinguishes the ones who really rise to the top? Those guys are the top voices in the soundtrack of my adult life, maybe because they've bottled that pain and made people like me feel not alone.












STRONG: I don't know if I think you can necessarily pathologize greatness in that way. I do think that that's a force that's operating. But from the very beginning, there was also simply the drive to become a great musician. He worked harder than anybody, and he was ready for it when it came. So yes, there's the devil at your back and you're outrunning something, but I think it would be a mistake to simply say that it's about that. It's also an aspiration towards something transcendent that is a positive thing.


WHITE: I think you can be born with the fire as well. And I think in Bruce's case, he was born with the fire and then also his environment built into that fire.


STRONG: When he saw Elvis on that TV set…


WHITE: And started dancing in the mirror, that was it.


COOPER: I'm interested to hear this. I'm sitting across from two of the best actors of their generation and to hear them espouse about Bruce or other great artists is fascinating. You always wonder because we never really speak about that, what it is that drives him to reach the levels that these two reach.


DEADLINE: Bono chalked up the fatherly emotional neglect to being an Irish thing. His friend Jimmy Iovine would tell him that as the first son in an Italian family, every idea that came out of his mouth, every act was treated as brilliant. The exact opposite of being Irish, which I am…


STRONG: Jon Landau wrote this collection of essays called It's Too Late to Stop Now. He said that ‘when I was 19, I aimed for messianic.' They weren't after small potatoes. They knew that they wanted to bring big medicine to the world, I believe. And they've done that.  


DEADLINE: It brings up an interesting follow-up. You did a lot of research on the relationship between those two guys, a mentor far different than you played last time we were here and it was Roy Cohn showing Donald Trump the ropes in The Apprentice. I don't mean to disparage, but in the docu for Western Stars, Bruce said that if you try to get close to him, his instinct is still to push you away, in a hurtful manner. How much of Jon Landau's heroic efforts to save Bruce from his demons came from his love for the man, versus his determination to see a genius artist reach his potential? Landau after all was the music critic who famously proclaimed Bruce the future rock and roll.  


STRONG: It's a longer conversation than we have time for, but in the period that this film explores, Jon was instrumental in helping Bruce understand and define the nature and beauty of his vision, and give him a broader context for that vision. I think John was indispensable in that way. And of course, as a friend. Over the course of time, they've individuated in their own ways and have had their separate lives. But one of the first things that I witnessed when I went to see them, I saw them play a concert in Denmark. I watched this ritual they have before every show, where they kind of hold each other, and touch each other's foreheads before Bruce goes up the gangplank to the most thunderous sound you've ever heard in your life. And then Jon is the first person there to greet him after the show and they embrace each other. When I saw that, that was everything I needed to know about what this relationship is, how deep it is. They are blood brothers.


DEADLINE: Hardcore Bruce fans know that those father-son fights in the movie that take place in his childhood continued as he got older. His dad would sit in the kitchen, brooding, and turn on these gas jets on the stove that went up to Bruce's bedroom, to smoke out Bruce and his ‘goddamn guitar,' trying to get him to stop playing. He brought in a guy who forced a haircut on Bruce when he when he was laid up after a motorcycle accident leading the son to say he hated his father and would never forgive him. And the father kept telling his son that he couldn't wait for the Army to draft him in Vietnam and straighten him out. But in the same speech onstage, Bruce said his father was relieved when the Army rejected him. The movie climaxes with this slightly awkward moment of grace between father and son that just cut me to the core because I fought with my father, and when we got close he died in Hurricane Sandy. Leaving me with nothing but guilt and shame over our conflicts, because he's not here and we never discussed them and I never said I love you dad. Bono gave his dad a graceful sendoff in his movie. What did that resolution in Deliver Me From Nowhere between father and son mean to you guys, when the father asks the son to sit on his lap? Stevie Graham played the father so touchingly…












WHITE: This allows us to take a moment to just talk about Stephen Graham and how excellent he is as Bruce's father. The quiet despair.  It was remarkable. I remember reading that scene on the page. I mean, I know it happened, but it's an uncomfortable moment. It's a grown man sitting on his father's lap. And I was like, is this going to be, are people going to laugh at this? Is it too uncomfortable or too awkward? Or something like that. But what it is, or what it was for me is just another moment to show Bruce's humility and compassion. Ultimately, he's just making room for his father. And that's what this was about. And I think what father and sons are, it's difficult business regardless of how you grow up. It's tough. He was so desperate for that connection. I remember singing My Father's House, over and over again in Nashville, and I called my dad right after. Because, what it really was for me, that song and that moment is just…like a warning. It was, pick up the phone, tell your dad you love him. You think we'll find a richer connection here or there, but the time is now. You're going to regret it if you don't. I think that moment at the end was, Bruce's forgiveness, opening his arms and making room for connection. If he didn't do it, he would regret it.


DEADLINE: It's a moment to love in a movie with a bunch of them. Like when Jeremy's Jon Landau character is matter of fact-ly telling CBS Record exec Al Teller how Bruce wanted Nebraska released. This stripped down album recorded crudely in a bedroom must be released with no singles. And oh yeah, there will be no tour and Bruce's picture will not be on the album cover, and he will do no press to promote it. It took me back to John Candy talking to the cop who pulled him over for speeding in Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Candy and Steve Martin are in a torched husk of a car, trying to get Martin home for Thanksgiving dinner. The cop says, do you have any idea how fast you were going, and Candy said no, the speedometer melted in the fire. The cop says, no mirrors and no gauges, no roof, and Candy says, true, but the radio plays clear as a bell. Jeremy, you lend Jon Landau the same kind of deadpan sincerity…


STRONG: I remember talking to Jimmy Iovine who was the studio engineer with those guys back in the day, and Jimmy said Jon was always the steady hand, but also the bodyguard between Bruce and the world. That scene was a chance to make that case in Jon's wry manner. But you know, Jon Landau has the strength of a mountain. He's a killer.  As Jeremy said, these guys were so generous with us and just opened up the treasure trove of stuff to drawn from. But I love that scene as well. This is important to me, and I think it's one of the things that I relate to most is something Bruce said once. This ain't a job. This ain't a business. This is a reason to live. The music. All of us here, we feel this way about what we do. It's not a job, it's not a business. And so what I like in that scene is it's a chance to express that.


DEADLINE: Scott, how did you, Bruce and Jon decide how much music to include without making it feel like a jukebox musical?


COOPER: For me, it was never a traditional biopic. It was always about Nebraska. And what were some of the influences that we might hear that really influenced Bruce, like the band Suicide and the song Frankie Teardrop. That was crazy stuff and one of Bruce's all time favorite records.  

	











WHITE: Bruce said, if Elvis was making music today, he'd sound like Suicide. I kind of love that.  


COOPER: the way I pitched the movie to Bruce, I said, look, there's not going to be the type of music that an audience expects. This is not spectacle. It's about a very quiet interior time in your life. We do hear a rousing Born in the USA, which Jeremy performs incredibly. And which both Jon Landau and Bruce said to me was maybe the one time during those Power Station sessions or any other time they were recording, that wow, we have lightning in a bottle. And what does Bruce do? He takes a song that's going to be an anthem, one of his greatest selling hits of all time, and he puts it on the shelf. So the reason I included that was to show, yes, this was where Bruce was going.


DEADLINE: Why do you think he fixated on the spree killer Charles Starkweather, played by Martin Sheen in Terrence Malick's Badlands? He seemed to become a symbol of the darkness Springsteen was going through but that guy was an unrepentant murderer who killed like 10 people.  


COOPER: I know exactly why. He had never seen the film until its first airing on national TV. He saw the rage that fueled this young man's rampage or murder across the American West. But what Bruce saw was, there must be something in this young man to push him to that point. What is that? Was that a father-son relationship or something with his mother? What was he not getting as a young child? It's that sense of disconnection, isolation, alienation, or not belonging. And that was a feeling that at that time, Bruce felt very close to. Starkweather was the first celebrity serial killer. So he was a bit of a rock star in his own way, for doing something terribly wrong. I think Bruce, having been on the cover of Time and Newsweek, this rock star, still carried around inside of him the feeling of being, as he writes in the album, unfit to live. And so I think there's something in that character that existentially spiritually he could relate to. Bruce hadn't gone around killing people, but I think he felt on some level that he had. He always said to me, you never know what you're capable of.


DEADLINE: But if you're not a sociopath, if you have a conscience, those mechanisms limit what you're capable of. The thing that upset me after seeing the movie was how close Springsteen came to harming himself. If he was going to act on that darkness, it would be at his own expense. True?


WHITE: Well, he nearly did on a couple occasions in the film, like the one that you mentioned earlier, driving at 110 miles an hour on a country road at night and feeling like, now's the time I'm going to end it. And the last second he spins out and says, I just can't do it.


DEADLINE: After you introduced the film last night at the Werner Herzog Theater, Bruce's only comment to Scott's speech was, gimme me back my house. Scott, talk a little bit about how your family came to live in Springsteen's LA home, and what happened when your daughter's guitar burned up during those Palisades wildfires.


COOPER: This is my seventh film, and in some ways the most challenging. The day before I started shooting, my father died. The man who introduced me to the album Nebraska. His spirit carried me through a film that's about many things, but a lot about fathers and sons. On that day we shot that touching and awkward scene of reconciliation between Bruce and his father backstage at the LA Sports Arena, I received the devastating news that my house was burning, like so many others in the Palisades fires. I made certain that my wife and daughters were safely ensconced in a hotel. Bruce, who was standing next to me on set, said, Scott, get them out of the hotel, put them into my Los Angeles house. And there we lived, until we got back on our feet. My daughter Stella's guitar burned, and Bruce sent her one from the Born in the USA tour. And if the next house ever burns up, that'll be the first thing that's coming with us.

	











	And that's who Bruce Springsteen is. He's humble, generous, he's endlessly supportive. That's what makes this experience, this journey through memory and regret, truth and a lot of pain, so transformative for me. I'll forever be joined with Jeremy White and Jeremy Strong in ways that I hope will carry me for the rest of my life.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Read This: The CEO of that wannabe ""Netflix Of AI"" thing is extremely high on his own supply","https://www.avclub.com/read-this-showrunner-netflix-of-ai-interviewer","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 00:50:00 GMT","

About a month back, we reported on the advent of Showrunner, a new “streaming service”—currently housed, it feels worth noting, in the bowels of a Discord server—built entirely around generative AI content prompted up by users, and all apparently designed to look like the shittiest Rick And Morty clone you've ever seen. If you've seen stories on Showrunner's whole deal—or, and we'll get to this in a minute, personally subjected yourself to the horrors it's crapping out—you could be excused for thinking that the person behind it must be operating under some “extreme, even for a techbro” levels of optimistic artificial intelligence delusion.

And, wouldn't you know it: Here comes a new interview between The Verge and Edward Saatchi, founder of Showrunner parent company Fable, in which he repeatedly expresses his belief that he's sitting on “the Toy Story of AI.” (Also “the Netflix of AI”; Saatchi is very committed to Showrunner becoming the something of AI.) Saatchi believes that generative AI is not just about making things cheaper and more shittily than they could be made by hand, but in forging bold new frontiers in extremely awkward and unwatchable entertainment. (We're paraphrasing.) Here's his actual take: “We think the Toy Story of AI [drink!] isn't going to be a cheaply produced animated movie, it's going to be something that's playable. Most people feel that generative AI is a tool to make the same, but cheaper, and we're trying to say it's a new kind of medium. Cinema was not about saving theater owners money; it was highly disruptive and took years to explore as a medium. I feel like the industry is kind of cutting off that exploratory element with generative AI by just shoving it into movies.”

Saatchi's current version of his glistening choose-your-own-future is a system where you go into the aforementioned Discord server, select from a pre-existing template, add characters, voices, and a plot outline to it, and then a few minutes later it plunks out one of the worst cartoons you've ever seen in your entire life. (Ugly characters that gesticulate randomly; “performances” cast in awful impressions of celebrity cadences; stage directions being read like dialogue; hack jokebook jokes; etc.) Saatchi is very excited by this, and dreams of getting, say, Disney to license stuff like The Mandalorian to the company so people can have their own “adventures” where Grogu talks about where to go to get a cup of coffee or whatever. (A lot of the clips we watched of Showrunner output, while prepping to write this article, were weirdly fixated on coffee.) Here's what all that sounds like in Saatchi-talk, as he waxes megalomaniacal about getting Dave Filoni to oversee what will definitely not be just a huge number of attempts at tricking the AI into pooping out a sex scene: “These models would have real characters and a world that could be explored through prompting, and you could also inadvertently trigger scenes within those worlds in a way that would make it feel as though you're uncovering something unknown.”

Sincere credit to Verge writer Charles Pulliam-Moore for not taking any of this stuff at face value, and pushing back hard on many of Saatchi's assertions. For instance, Pulliam-Moore, asks, wouldn't creating AI Mandalorian videos like Saatchi is fantasizing about just make users into content creators for Disney—and not just unpaid ones, but actively shelling out what Saatchi hopes will be $10 or $20 a month for the privilege? Saatchi responds by noting he intends to try to partner with smaller creators, too, so you won't just be a big corporation's indentured prompt-serf. “This could create something where creators can earn money when people are emotionally connected enough to their work that they themselves want to make something with it. Compare that to what creators earn just from people viewing their work online. Yes, there is a kind of ‘we're all employees of Disney' element, but from a moral point, I can't think of a better way to do it.” (Saatchi does not follow this up with what feels like it might be the next logical step—i.e., “So I just won't do it, then”—but, then, he's being paid a lot of money not to.)

Because, as with most truly delusional AI things in 2025, Saatchi has already received large amounts of money for this technology, notably a big cash infusion from Amazon. And what has it gotten him so far? Well, as we've alluded, we spent about 45 minutes today clicking around in the Showrunner Discord server to watch some of the videos people are making with it. (We don't hate water enough to actually create any of our own, but all the videos people make are available for others to watch.) Here's a brief survey of some of the amazing things people have been using this revolutionary technology to “create” so far:

All of these scenes, it's worth noting, featured the exact same plinky-plonk music, random arm movements, and no actual resolution or action, because the AI can only crap out meandering dialogue sequences, not actual movement or resolution. Human creativity, move over: “Computer-generated British Kanye West chili joke” is here to take your throne.

Flavortown just got a little more romantic. Hunter Fieri (yes, the eldest son of Guy Fieri) has officially married professional pickleball player Tara Bernstein in Sonoma, California. According to an exclusive with People, their wedding wasn't just a union of two, it was a weekend-long celebration full of family, food, and plenty of personal touches. Held at the family's Hunt Ryde Ranch, the couple pulled off an event that felt part festival, part love story, and honestly, 100% them.

A post shared by People Magazine (@people)

People reports, the party started with a “Denim & Diamonds” welcome dinner, complete with Mexican dishes by Chef Lorena Garcia, a cooler guests could sign instead of a guest book, and video tributes projected under the stars. By the next day, the ranch turned into a wedding wonderland; complete with campsites, a ceremony set on an island beneath a willow tree, and even a petting zoo featuring donkeys adorably named Burrito and Taquito (yes, donkeys with Mexican food names).

The details leaned personal in the best way. Tara wore a custom ballgown designed by Justin Alexander, Hunter's grandmother Mimi took on the role of flower girl at 81 years old, and the wedding party received engraved cowboy boots as keepsakes. Everywhere you looked, it was clear how much thought went into making guests feel part of the celebration.

Naturally, no Fieri wedding would be complete without an epic menu. Hunter and Tara teamed up with chefs like Antonia Lofaso, Cesar Orozco, Aaron May, and Garcia to create a family-style Italian spread, per People. Guests shared platters of pasta, charred meats, and fresh salads, giving the night a cozy, communal vibe.

Dessert came courtesy of Buddy Valastro, who designed a towering six-tier cake featuring nods to both food and pickleball. With multiple flavors and even a gluten-free option, the cake was a showpiece… and a crowd-pleaser. The drinks were just as thoughtful: Hunter had his signature “Fieri Sunrise” cocktail, while Tara's pick was a fresh honeydew mocktail inspired by the US Open.

Hunter and Tara's romance has moved quickly but naturally. People says that they first met at the Super Bowl in 2023, and within nine months, Hunter proposed at the same ranch where they'd later exchange vows. For Tara, it wasn't about a dream wedding she'd pictured since childhood… it was about finding someone who instantly felt like home.

The celebration ended with brunch the following day, but let's be real… the energy carried way beyond the ranch. 

“We work together. We live together. We travel together. We do everything together as much as we can. We support each other, so we're just going to continue to do that and continue to have fun and continue to create success for ourselves.” 

And judging by the joy that radiated through their wedding, married life looks like it's going to be one long celebration.

Gordon Ramsay bravely opened up about his cancer diagnosis recently, sharing a photo with fans on social media. The celebrity chef posted on Saturday, August 30, revealing that he had been diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, which is a form of skin cancer.

“Grateful and so appreciative for the incredible team at The Skin Associates and their fast reactive work on removing this Basal Cell Carcinoma thank you ! Please don't forget your sunscreen this weekend ❤️I promise you it's not a face lift! I'd need a refund…….😜,” Ramsay captioned the post, which included a photo of himself wearing a large bandage and one with stitches just below his ear.

Many rushed to the comments, including his daughter, who left a simple but perfect note for her father. 

“Love you dad ❤️,” Holly Ramsay wrote.

Holly is one of Gordon Ramsay's six children he shares with his wife, Tana Ramsay. Megan Ramsay (27) is the oldest, followed by twins Holly (25) and Jack (25). Matilda (23) was both on Nov. 8, which is the same day as Gordon's birthday. Oscar (6) came next, and lastly, the couple welcomed Jesse (1) in November 2023.

A post shared by Gordon Ramsay (@gordongram)

Along with Holly's comment, many fans also left kind notes, showing Ramsay support. 

“🙏,” dance teacher Abby Lee Miller commented. 

“Glad to hear you're doing well, Gordon, and thanks for raising awareness of how important it is to stay safe in the sun ❤️ Seek shade, cover up, and apply sunscreen regularly and generously ☀️,” one person wrote.

“Heal quickly Chef and thank you for bringing awareness to all of us,” another person commented. 

“Sending hugs and prayers to one of my favorite people. Praying for a speedy recovery. ❤️‍🩹,” someone else said. 

“🙏🏽 hopefully you have a quick and full recovery,” a fan wrote.

“Best wishes for your recovery of the basal cell. My brothers have had the same type of skin cancer and both their prognosis were good. They have recovered both with scars they call battle scars. I wish the same for you, Chef Ramsey. 👨‍🍳,” one fan wrote, sharing their person experience. 

According to the American Cancer Society, “Basal cell cancers (BCCs) usually develop on areas exposed to the sun, especially the face, head, neck, and arms, but they can occur anywhere on the body.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Joanna Gaines Shares Emotional Glimpse of Daughter's Gorgeous Bedroom","https://entertainmentnow.com/hgtv/joanna-gaines-ella-bedroom-college/","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 14:24:49 GMT","

Joanna Gaines is giving fans a sneak peek at oldest daughter Ella's bedroom at the family's Waco farmhouse.

And the reason is both sweet and a little melancholy.

In a new Instagram post, the former HGTV star shows a beautiful video of 18-year-old daughter Ella's bedroom at the Gaines family's Waco, Texas farmhouse.

The room shows sloped ceilings with two skylights and a striking chandelier. The light-filled room is anchored by a bed covered in pink bedding. It has a mid-century modern console table at the end. 

The bed is surrounded by lush green plants of all sizes.  Joanna also takes viewers into Ella's bathroom, which, like the bedroom, is filled with plants.

In the caption, Joanna Gaines explains, “When Ella went off to college, I became the caretaker of her plant babies. I hope these pretty plants like me as much as they liked her!🤞🧚😅”

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

Joanna's sweet video of daughter Ella's room reveals that not only does the college freshman have her mother's love for plants, she also has Jo's eye for design.

But the sweet video also conveys the sadness Joanna Gaines feels faced with Ella's empty room.

The designer has been transparent all along – admitting that even though she had already gone through it with oldest son Drake leaving for college, Ella's move across the country would be a major adjustment.

In a July interview with People, Joanna said, “Ella, our second kiddo, she's graduating this year, so we're going through that again with another kid leaving the nest and trying to stay emotionally stable.”

Chip asked Joanna, “Do you think this is going to be harder [than with Drake?]”

Joanna confessed, “Yes. I think there's an emotional difference. With Ella, we love to go to antiques shops, plant shops and go get coffee — that's our rhythm. I kind of feel like I'm losing a friend in my everyday life.”

“It feels like what's coming this summer will be a tidal wave of emotions, and I am not going to brace; I'm going to stand there and take it with him,” Joanna says referring to husband Chip.

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

Drake Gaines attends the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor in Belton, Texas, That's about an hour from the Gaines' Waco farm. But Joanna reveals that Ella's “heart was captured by a university even farther away than the one where my oldest, Drake, has settled.”

Some media outlets have reported that Ella is attending Parsons School of Design in New York City. But the Gaines have never revealed where she is attending school.

Joanna Gaines' Instagram posts about her daughter's departure focused more on the emotion. The picture showed suitcases and a white stuffed cow at the foot of the stairs at the family's Waco, Texas farmhouse. The caption simply read, “Our little girl, all grown up. ✨🙏🏼🥹 #headedtocollege“

But in the latest edition of the Gaines' Magnolia Journal, Jo admits, “Being in close proximity to my kids is the only way I've known to parent.”

Jo explained, “My confidence as a mom is deeply intertwined with physical presence. I know how to read their faces, I know what foods heal wounds. I know how to stay up late. To be here when they need me. I've had to refine how to show up for each of them, all being so different, but almost 20 years in, I started to feel like I finally had the hang of it… “

But all of that has changed as Drake and Ella moved out. ”I'm already wondering how to hold this—them—well from afar. What does embrace look like when, to me, it feels like my kids are a world away?,“ Joanna Gaines wrote.

“Again, I've found myself without the right answers. Only a comfort that all playbooks start as blank pages and the revelation that maybe my pixie dust wasn't proximity after all, but instinct, and a love so relentless that it simply never gives up.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Are Jessica Simpson & Eric Johnson Back Together?","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jessica-simpson-eric-johnson-back-together/","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 13:43:24 GMT","

Jessica Simpson and Eric Johnson sparked reconciliation rumors after being seen together during a recent trip.

On Friday, the ex-couple was spotted flying Southwest from Burbank to Las Vegas without their three kids, TMZ reports. In the video shared by the outlet, Simpson stunned in an all-red ensemble, while Johnson opted for a laid-back look in a black shirt and cap.

Photos taken inside the plane showed the two sitting next to each other. Upon arrival in Vegas, Simpson and Johnson remained tight-lipped about the current status of their relationship.

However, when someone remarked it was good to see them together, Johnson replied with a slight smile.

Fans are now wondering why Simpson and Johnson traveled together. According to TMZ, the ex-lovers jetted to Sin City to support Ashlee Simpson, who is kicking off her Vegas residency at the Venetian.

Simpson and Johnson announced their separation in January after a decade of marriage.

“Eric and I have been living separately, navigating a painful situation in our marriage,” Simpson confirmed to PEOPLE at the time. “Our children come first, and we are focusing on what is best for them. We are grateful for all of the love and support that has been coming our way, and appreciate privacy right now as we work through this as a family.”

Rumors of their split first made rounds online after Johnson was spotted without his wedding ring in November 2024. Around the same time, Simpson teased her music comeback on Instagram.

Simpson and Johnson met through a mutual friend in 2010 and got engaged after six months of dating. They tied the knot in July 2014 and share three children: Maxwell “Maxi” Drew, 12, Birdie Mae, 5, and Ace Knute, 11.

Meanwhile, fans were quick to react to Simpson and Johnson's reconciliation rumors. One fan commented,“Sometimes, time away is all you need to realize that indeed the grass isn't greener and your issues are salvageable. I know a lot of divorced people who look back and wish they had worked harder at saving their marriage.”

Another wrote, “I hope it is a reconciliation. They've got three kids, and every marriage takes work. Best of luck to them and their family. Hopefully, they've had some time to miss each other and appreciate what they have.”

Someone chimed in, “Leave them alone. Maybe they can work it out! Well wishes for your family!”

So far, neither Simpson nor Johnson has officially confirmed or denied the reconciliation rumors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Fans React as Snoop Dogg Breaks Silence on Controversial Comments: ‘I'm Not Perfect'","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/snoop-dogg-kids-movie-comments-apology/","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 17:16:47 GMT","

Snoop Dogg has apologized after receiving widespread pushback for his comments about the LGBTQ+ representation in Pixar's 2022 movie “Lightyear.”

During an episode of the “It's Giving” podcast, posted on August 20, 2025, the 16-time Grammy winner and coach on “The Voice” complained that the kids' movie included a scene with a lesbian couple and their child, noting that he didn't know how to explain their relationship to his curious grandkids and that it made him “scared to go to the movies.”

On August 31, 2025, Deadline first reported that Snoop has since apologized in writing, responding to an Instagram post in which Emmy- and Grammy-winner T.S. Madison told TMZ that “it is time to have these uncomfortable conversations” rather than refrain from reflecting different types of families and relationships in the media. 

“I was just caught off guard and had no answer for my grandsons,” Snoop wrote in the comments, adding, “all my gay friends no what's up they been calling me with love 💗 my bad for not knowing the answers for a 6 yr old 😳teach me how to learn I'm not perfect 🙌🏿🙏🏾🐾”

A post shared by HOLLYWOOD UNLOCKED (@hollywoodunlocked)

Snoop's apology was in response to clips from a TMZ interview with Madison, a frequent judge on “RuPaul's Drag Race,” on a series of clips from her TMZ interview, in which she said parents need to be able to “explain to your children that other things exist in the world outside of what you have deemed normal in your own home.” 

Madison added, “We've always, as queer people, been pushed to the side and swept under (the rug), so it is time for us to have these uncomfortable conversations. Maybe not at (age) four – maybe Papa will ‘explain that to you in a year or so, just watch the movie.'”

Hundreds of people responded to Snoop's comment on the post, with some insisting he did nothing wrong and others expressing their appreciation for the rapper, known as Papa Snoop to his grandkids, acknowledging that he was open to learning how to handle such situations. 

“I understand,” one person wrote. “In order to properly inform our children, give us an opportunity to prepare. There has been dozens of times I've had my back against the wall and had to explain something unprepared. Then I had to research how to explain it and come back to my kids again to clarify.” 

Another commented, “Snoop did what he knew to do at the time and TS needs to show some grace. Everyone not against the gay and trans community. This is something newly publicly known to us. It's going to take some time to undo the misconceptions we may feel about it. Give us grace and room to grow. Damn.”

During his August 20 appearance on the “It's Giving” podcast, Snoop recalled one of his grandkids asking him about a scene in which two moms were shown holding their baby. 

Snoop said, “They're like, ‘She had a baby — with another woman.' Well, my grandson, in the middle of the movie is like, ‘Papa Snoop? How she have a baby with a woman? She's a woman!'”

The rapper said he immediately thought, “Oh [expletive], I didn't come in for this [expletive]. I just came to watch the [expletive] movie.'” 

Noting that his grandson asked again how two women had a baby together, Snoop said, “It [expletive] me up. I'm like, scared to go to the movies. Y'all throwing me in the middle of [expletive] that I don't have an answer for… It threw me for a loop. I'm like, ‘What part of the movie was this?' These are kids. We have to show that at this age? They're going to ask questions. I don't have the answer.”

Snoop's comments sparked a firestorm of controversy. A spokesperson for the LGBT Foundation told Newsweek, “Seeing LGBTQ+ people on screen is powerful and helps everyone feel seen. Negative remarks from high-profile figures cause real harm by fueling stigma and undermining hard-won progress.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","This ‘Summer House' Star Could Be the Next to Join RHONY","https://entertainmentnow.com/bravo/summer-house-lindsay-hubbard-rhony/","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 14:21:42 GMT","

“Summer House” star Lindsay Hubbard is teasing fans about a potential move from the Hamptons to Manhattan.

In an exclusive Wednesday, Aug. 27, interview with Parade, she revealed she is open to exploring a spot on the “Real Housewives of New York City.”

Hubbard is friends with RHONY star Erin Lichy, and the two have already had conversations about the possibility.

“I think our friendship is just really natural,” Hubbard said regarding their friendship. “So, yeah, do we talk about crossover stuff? We talk about it all the time.”

She added, “And we're always scheming something. Like, currently scheming how to hang out all the time with our babies.”

Hubbard's excitement comes as she balances motherhood, filming commitments, and her ongoing friendship with Lichy, who has been a close friend for years.

Hubbard and Lichy's friendship traces back to a chance meeting at a wedding, where Hubbard swapped dresses with one of Lichy's friends.

Lichy recalled the funny moment earlier in August of 2025 when answering questions on social media.

“So Lindsay and my close friend [Alexandra Smith] were at a wedding together years ago and (not sure why) but they wound up swapping dresses in bathroom and became friendly,” Lichy wrote at the time.

She continued, “When we figured that out, we all went to dinner and we've been friends ever since. We got closer since she became a mom.”

Their bond strengthened after both became parents: Hubbard welcomed her daughter, Gemma, in December 2024, while Lichy gave birth to her son, Jack, in March 2025.

The two recently shared a sweet moment of Gemma and Jack interacting with each other. While the babies looked at each other in the video, the words, “The summer Gemma found her future husband,” were written beneath.

A post shared by Lindsay Hubbard (@lindshubbs)

The caption continued to showcase humor as Hubbard wrote, “We can't wait to be mother-in-laws.”

As both Hubbard and Lichy have spent the summer in the Hamptons, there is the potential for Lichy to make an appearance on the popular Bravo show.

Hubbard didn't give Parade any insight into the possibility. However, the 39-year-old did gush about spending the summer with her daughter.

“It was really important for me to be able to spend a lot of time with Gemma this summer,” Hubbard noted. “She's at the age where she's hitting so many milestones. And summertime is my personal favorite season, as with most, especially here in New York. So, it's been really fun to watch her.”

A deep-pocketed neon-noir starring Colin Farrell as an inveterate gambling addict and see-thru fraud who has three days to fork up the $45,000 USD he owes to his Macau hotel and casino (lest he be deported back to England, or worse), Edward Berger's “Ballad of a Small Player” sounds like a mighty decent bet on paper. And yet something is off from the moment it starts with Farrell's Lord Doyle groaning “fuck” into the bathroom mirror, as if he's just noticed it too. 

The situation doesn't need long to grow more ominous from there, as Volker Bertelmann's thunderous string and horn score — squelching in your face like a wet fart throughout the course of a movie that's meant to feel like a fever dream — accompanies the arch comedy of watching our protagonist try to slip out of his penthouse suite without getting caught. There's a Coen brothers'-like smirk to Lord Doyle's cartoon obviousness, but that doesn't stop Berger from shooting the sequence like it's straight out of “Conclave,” all straight lines and holy purpose.

Anyone with eyes can see that Lord Doyle is an impostor (his green velvet suit screams “I'm bluffing!” loud enough for people to understand it in every language, which is extra silly for someone who exclusively plays a pure luck game like baccarat), but that isn't enough for locals to notice a gweilo like him. In a place built on empty promises, a peninsula whose Eiffel Tower is a copy of a copy of the real one in Paris, he's just another lie that doesn't even have the heart to believe in itself. 

 










The only problem there is that “Ballad of a Small Player” suffers from the same half-defeated identity crisis; much like our dear Doyle (or whatever his real name is), Berger's film is so desperate for a win that it loses any real sense of what the stakes are. Despite promising a welcome throwback to the sort of down-and-out milieu that authors like Graham Greene once put on the map, this Lawrence Osborne adaptation winds up feeling like nothing so much as a quintessential Netflix movie: Easy to watch and impossible to care about. 

I'll say this in its favor: Watching Doyle eat a meal is possibly one of the most uncomfortable things I've ever seen on the big screen, and I would have to imagine that its horror will translate to small ones as well. The man is rapacious — a hungry ghost with a big mouth and an empty stomach. He shoves food into his maw like a human No-Face, and his entire body trembles while he does it, as if Doyle is trying to survive his acute gambling withdrawal by distracting his other senses. Every bite feels like his last, and yet he's also convinced that a single lucky streak is all he needs to clear his debts. Alas, there are some debts that can't be repaid. There are some stains that don't wash out. There are some problems that money can't solve. 

 










One of them seems to be private investigator Cynthia Blithe (Tilda Swinton, splitting the difference between “Michael Clayton” and “Snowpiercer” with a pro forma performance memorable only for the glasses she gets to wear), who's been hired to secure photographic evidence that Doyle is hiding out in Macau. More susceptible to money — or at least more understanding of why Doyle tries to buy his way out of everything — is an enigmatic Rainbow Casino employee named Dao Ming (Fala Chen), who watches the Englishman blow a fortune at her baccarat table only to be endeared by his lost soul sloppiness. Chen is the wraith-like heart of this story, but her character strains belief even in a shaky hand of a movie that operates with all the internal logic of a gambling addiction. 

Then again, so does everything else in “Ballad of a Small Player,” which reshuffles its cards so often that you start to wonder if it's playing with a full deck. Switching gears between heightened comedy, self-destructive bender, ex-pat farce, and an empty meditation on the relationship between capitalism and shame, Berger's film doesn't juggle genres so much as it careens out of control between them, its crumbling hero too narcissistic for anything to matter beyond the tunnel vision of his next line of credit. 

 










Of course, Doyle is only looking for loans while he bides his time for a miracle, but it's going to take something a bit more proactive than that in order to cleanse him of the sins that he's been trying so hard to outrun, or at least out bet. “You can be anyone in Macau,” Doyle tells Cynthia as part of a sales pitch to leave him alone and “live a little,” but Doyle — who's already faked his own death once — will have to become someone if he hopes to survive. 

This movie tries its best to nudge him in the right direction, but the path it offers him to rock bottom — and to the redemption that lies beyond it — proves exasperating. It's some consolation that Doyle travels along the scenic route, as James Friend's ultra-wide cinematography allows the purgatorial casinos of Macau to look as sterile as the fluorescent streets outside are aglow with sizzle and seduction. Still, the film's rich sense of place never catalyzes into a legitimate atmosphere, which makes it that much harder to reconcile the “fun” of Berger's tone and the flustered charisma of Farrell's performance with the soul rot on display. 

“Ballad of a Small Player” mines so much of its queasy momentum from Lord Doyle's relentless desperation and refusal to give up, but the movie doesn't give us much of a reason not to throw in the towel. Doyle's luck might turn before the end of this story — ours will not. 

 










“Ballad of a Small Player” premiered at the 2025 Telluride Film Festival. Netflix will release it in select theaters on Friday, October 17, and on Netflix on Wednesday, October 29.

Paul Dano becomes embroiled in the cold heart of the new Russia in Olivier Assayas‘ mellow recounting of three decades of the post-USSR empire's history in “The Wizard of the Kremlin.” A respectable if minor-register effort from the sometimes-detached director of two “Irma Veps” and “Personal Shopper,” this two-and-half-hour-plus political epic plays out as a long monologue delivered by Vadim Baranov (Dano), a fictional Vladimir Putin (Jude Law) spin doctor, owing to Giuliano da Empoli's debut novel.

Assayas' serialized tour through the dark corridors of the Kremlin and the machinations and theatrics it took to fashion a certain former KGB agent into the most reviled authoritarian of our time is chilled without ever being chilling: It's not a thriller, it's not really a comedy, and it's unlikely to start a revolution despite a cruel jolt of a final shot.

But it's not in Assayas' interest as a left-brained filmmaker to churn often laborious chapters of bureaucracy and percolating political corruption into spectacle: This is the director/writer, recall, whose foray into supernatural horror, “Personal Shopper,” was almost perversely drained of suspense, favoring a more melancholic, introspective ghost story about the tyranny of grief, and without jump scares. Casting the sweet-faced and unflappably mellow Dano — Eli Sunday his Vadim Baranov is not — as Putin's kingmaker also assures that Assayas isn't keen on high drama, with conversations in conference rooms plotting totalitarian takeover rarely rising above library-voice level.

 










Instead, Assayas lets archival footage, from the Maidan uprising that escalated the battle between Ukraine and Russia to Pussy Riot's condemned-as-sacrilege protest performance inside Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in February 2012, tell of the how-the-hell-did-we-get-here violence and chaos brewing outside the Kremlin's walls. Meanwhile, Jude Law, back in his brassy-blond “Young Pope” combover, inhabits Putin not as a cartoonishly ghoulish dictator-to-be but an unremarkable businessman contorted by his own narcissism and ambition. There aren't any standout scenes, though, that give his presence much weight. Cinematographer Yorick Le Saux, who also co-shot Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother” here at Venice and worked with Assayas on many of his recent movies (including the critically maimed Cuban spy drama “Wasp Network”), observes rather than infiltrates. (The movie was shot in Latvia with some CGI-recreated backdrops of Russian landmarks, but it's vaguely wintry and blanched enough to evoke Moscow on its own.)

“Power is addictive,” Baranov tells his girlfriend Ksenia (an underused Alicia Vikander, back with Assayas after the “Irma Vep” TV series) when she asks why he's stuck by Putin's side for so long. Though he says it with such deflated indifference that you're not convinced Baranov really is hooked on power — which makes his character somewhat of an indecipherable enigma, the arc of what drove a onetime avant-garde artist to become a Kremlin lackey so slow-drip that you don't even notice it happening. Which is the point, surely.

 










“The Wizard of the Kremlin” unfolds as a tale told by Baranov to Jeffrey Wright, who plays a scholar of Bolshevik writer Yevgeny Zamyatin, author of the 1924 dystopian novel “We” that eventually inspired George Orwell's “1984.” That demonstrably more famous book has now become low-bearing fruit as a literary harbinger of modern times, collapsing under surveillance-operated totalitarian rule; “We,” overshadowed by its successor and long-banned by the Soviet Union's censorship board, does not come up in these conversations in the West. By the near-present-day setting of the film‘s frame story, Baranov has defected from Putin's regime, but is now ready to break his sanctioned silence and crack open his story for Wright's unnamed initial narrator — before Dano's voiceover takes over the movie in a monologue across nearly 30 years, one so expository and word-heavy that you can at times feel every one of them.

All the characters speak English, in either British or vaguely European accents, lifting Assayas from the burden of getting his actors to speak in a Russian tongue and helping to widen the casting net for one of his starriest ensembles. None of the ensemble really bursts out, grounded down by the mundanity of the approach, which has to be by design. Ksenia, whom Baranov meets at a hedonistic party in the early 1990s as counterculturals rage amid the dawn of a new, post-USSR Russian era, is indicated as a grifting wild thing, the type who always has a mysterious male benefactor to keep her in minks. Afterward, Vikander is all but brushed aside.

 










Baranov and this woman are an odd match from far-flung sides of the intellectual tracks; Dano and Vikander's chemistry isn't especially felt, though the characters keep circling back to each other over the years, eventually wearing us down to accept that they somehow belong together. Assayas is interested in their relationship only as a humanistic foil, a romantic sidenote, to a romance-less political world. Da Empoli's 2022 novel bases Baranov on Putin's real-life former aide and fixer Vladislav Surkov, whose purview included overseeing Russia's relationship with Ukraine; he was dismissed from his post in February 2020, two years before Russia invaded Ukraine. 

Assayas and co-writer Emmanuel Carrère aren't chasing biography, here, though enough actual Kremlin administrators — such as oligarch Boris Berezovsky (Will Keen), found dead in a manner consistent with hanging in 2013 — bounce in and out of the movie that whatever line there is between fiction and fact is erased. In what will inevitably be talked about as an allusion to President Trump, Baranov has a stint as a reality TV producer that shows the earliest wear and tear on his idealism, and how his artistic expressiveness became corrupted by Russia to shape and manipulate national myth.

The scene most likely to get a rise out of Western audiences not caught up on their recent Russian history lands Baranov in the offices of Russia's vaguely monikered Internet Research Agency. Linked to the also-suspiciously-killed former oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian bot company that pumped propaganda into social media and was tied to influencing the 2016 U.S. election, is recreated here almost like a millennial startup out of “The Social Network.” Baranov admonishes Prigozhin for hiring a competent internet braintrust instead of conspiracy-headed burnouts to help twist and break public opinion about the Russian state. Even as Dano delivers Baranov's corrective with an unappeasable even keel, it might be the most sinister the character ever becomes.

 










Assayas is not especially a filmmaker out for blood — his 2012 coming-of-age saga of 1970s revolutionary Paris, “Something in the Air,” fixated on fire and smoke but fell short of burning dramatic intensity, though a curiosity like the dark-web thriller “Demonlover” harnessed exploitation-movie power to rattle against corporate complicity in human degradation. “The Wizard of the Kremlin” operates at a slow burn to chart the banality of evil, though the film could stand to be more pissed off, with a little more venom in its veins, to stir us, maybe not up in arms, but at least up in our seats.

“The Wizard of the Kremlin” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

Jim Jarmusch‘s 14th feature, “Father Mother Sister Brother,” brought the “Down by Law” and “Paterson” director to the Venice Film Festival for only the second time — and inevitably into the controversy surrounding the film's distributor, MUBI.

MUBI, which releases the Venice competition premiere in theaters December 24, is facing external and internal backlash due to MUBI investor Sequoia's ties to the Israeli defense industry. The streamer and distributor accepted a $100 million investment from a company that also backs Kela, a defense startup founded in 2024 by Israeli intelligence veterans after the October 7 terrorist attacks. A list of signatory filmmakers and a letter from MUBI staffers have called upon the company to drop the investor. MUBI CEO Efe Cakarel released a statement earlier this month claiming that the company's relationship with the venture capital firm is not involved in funding the war in Gaza.

Jarmusch was asked during the “Father Mother Sister Brother” press conference by Screen International's Ben Dalton whether he had spoken to the distributor about its funding structure, which has thrown a wave of negative press attention at MUBI all summer. 

 










“Yes, I have spoken to MUBI about it, and I have a very good relationship particularly with [MUBI CCO] Jason Ropell at MUBI who called me immediately. He had not been made aware when this relationship was made,” Jarmusch said. “My relationship with MUBI started much before that, and they were fantastic to work with on this film. I was of course disappointed and quite disconcerted by this relationship. Really, if you want to discuss it, you have to address MUBI about it. I'm not the spokesman. However, yes, I was concerned.”

He added, “I also have a distribution agreement with MUBI in certain territories which I had entered in before my knowledge of this. Having said that, on a personal level, I have to say I am an independent filmmaker and I have taken money from various sources to be able to realize my films. I consider pretty much all corporate money is dirty money, and if you start analyzing each of these film companies and their financing structures, you're going to find a lot of nasty dirt. It's all there. We could avoid it and not make films at all, but the films are how I choose to carry things I would like to say. I'm concerned, but one thing I don't like — and you have not done this — is putting the onus of the explanation of this on us, the artists. It's not us; it's MUBI you must address. And not just MUBI, but other companies as well.”

 










At the press conference also were members of “Father Mother Sister Brother's” ensemble cast, including Cate Blanchett, Charlotte Rampling, and Vicky Krieps. Co-star Indya Moore, who has been a vocal supporter of Palestine and was arrested at a 2023 New York City protest demanding a ceasefire, also spoke up to answer the question.

“Since the genocide of Palestinians began, there has been an incredible amount of creative warfare and resource warfare behind the scenes,” she said. “The issue with the way people are trying to figure out how we are going to work at a capacity that is ethical and not enabling a systematic pipeline that funds these kinds of things to happen to people… a kind of due diligence that people are learning how to do is a developing process. These are not questions we've ever had to ask before, especially as independent artists. We're all trying to figure out how to navigate this and survive. One thing is for sure: If you were to ask me, Indya, why did you work here or work there when this person is there or that entity is behind this thing? Most likely, I didn't know.”

Earlier this month, in response to the backlash, Cakarel said MUBI would install an “Ethical Funding and Investment Policy” to establish future criteria for funding partners, as well as an advisory council of arts to help inform the policy.

 










Israel's ongoing war in Gaza has been a major focus of the Venice Film Festival already. A march of thousands, calling for an end to the war, descended down the Venice Lido Saturday afternoon toward the festival grounds. Last week, “Free Palestine” protests were held outside the Biennale headquarters, calling for the festival to take a public stance on the war. Ahead of the festival, filmmakers including Marco Bellocchio, Matteo Garrone, and Alice Rohrwacher launched an appeal for organizers to take a pro-Palestinian stance.

There's something magical about a soufflé. It is infamously tricky to make, requiring patience, precise temperatures, and meticulous technique. A perfect one needs to combine rich creaminess with feather-light airiness, balancing indulgence with ephemerality. Its existence has been passed down from generation to generation to those who seek to preserve a piece of culinary heritage, explaining the importance of a 45-degree angle spoon to fold, the correct whisking technique, and the precise texture required at each step to result to form crisp outer layers and an oozing center. 

 










As such, the soufflé has long served as a kind of culinary metaphor for highly skilled folly, something nutritionally inconsequential, fleeting, but nevertheless a testimony to its creator's craftsmanship. You marvel at it, even as you wonder whether it was worth the effort.

In the aptly named “The Souffleur,” this metaphor speaks to both the film's strengths and weaknesses. Gastón Solnicki's latest work features a magnetic central performance from Willem Dafoe, it is artfully composed with painterly images, shots of Vienna at sunset are exquisite, and its spartan dialogue possesses a dry wit. Yet for all its craft, the film remains airy and unsubstantial, never quite rising to the full potential of its premise. Like its namesake dish, it is something to admire in the moment, but it evaporates quickly, leaving you more confounded than satisfied.

 










The film begins with archival footage of the groundbreaking of Vienna's InterContinental Hotel, once considered the pinnacle of European luxury. At the time of its construction, it was hailed as the greatest hotel in the world and, we are told, was the first to boast telephones in every bathroom. Fast forward to the present, however, and the grand dame has faded. The chandeliers still sparkle in the ballroom, but the carpets have yellowed, the façade has rusted, and the famous rooftop sign is now a weather-beaten relic. Even the employees, once the guardians of glamour, linger on smoke breaks with the weary disaffection of people simply marking time.

It is in this fading palace that Lucius Glantz (Dafoe), the longtime manager, continues to preside. Having raised his daughter Lilly (Lilly Lindner) within its walls, with the staff functioning as an extended family, Lucius clings to the institution with a faith that borders on delusion. His entire identity is woven into its hallways and kitchens, and the news that an Argentine mogul — played with ironic detachment by Solnicki himself — intends to purchase the hotel and demolish it to make way for a new architectural venture is treated as nothing less than an existential threat.

From here, “The Souffleur” sets out an intriguing promise: that, in the absence of a tangible purpose, we will witness one of Dafoe's signature descents into the unhinged, mirrored against a Vienna that itself seems adrift and hollowed out. Solnicki's Vienna is not the city of Strauss and café culture, but one drained of vitality. Parks are filled with abandoned football goals, tennis matches drag on with no one able to score a point, and the hotel basement brims with strange, steampunk-like machinery that screams obsolescence. Time itself begins to falter — clocks spin strangely, pipes clog without reason, and most tragically, Lucius' once-perfect soufflés have gone from magical to inedible.

 










These surreal flourishes give the film a dreamlike atmosphere, but they also highlight its limitations. Much of the narrative weight falls entirely on Dafoe, and while he is as fascinating as ever — his gaunt face capable of both menace and mischief — the other characters are left as sketches. They break the fourth wall to introduce themselves, but reveal almost nothing beyond their preferred drinks. Even the Argentine developer, briefly gifted a narrated montage of his childhood fascination with the hotel, never seems to acquire a coherent motive or personality. The eventual confrontation between him and Lucius is staged as if it carries mythic significance, but it arrives oddly deflated, neither dramatically explosive nor thematically clarifying.

What works best are the moments of humor, particularly those that seem to wink at Dafoe's own eccentricities. His narration is a constant pleasure — mournful, wry, and suffused with a world-weary poetry. There are few actors whose disembodied voices could carry long stretches of cinema, but Dafoe manages it, turning monologues about marionette mechanics or muttered complaints about hotel politics into something weirdly magnetic.

Still, for a film so light on plot and so committed to gently lamenting a glorious past that can never be restored, “The Souffleur” struggles with precision. At 76 minutes, it risks feeling both overextended and underdeveloped: too meandering to deliver a sharp parable, yet too short to explore its characters and ideas in real depth. One senses that Solnicki wants to make a film about loss — loss of purpose, of grandeur, of relevance — and to tie it to questions of mortality and legacy. But he approaches these themes obliquely, with a shrug more than a scalpel. 

 










The result is a film that glimmers with moments of wit and melancholy but never settles into coherence. Like a soufflé, it is beautiful in concept, fragile in execution, and destined to collapse the moment you press into it.

Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's 2020 novel of the same name, “Hamnet” is an emotionally pulverizing drama that imagines how the death of William Shakespeare and Anne (or Agnes) Hathaway's only son might have inspired the creation of his greatest tragedy; think of it as “Shakespeare in Agony.” And yet the violent beauty of this film, which rips your soul out of your chest so completely that its seismic grief almost feels like falling in love or becoming a parent, is that it's as much about the experience of having a child as it is about the experience of losing one. 

 










More to the point, “Hamnet” is a wrenching story about how those two experiences — so unalike in dignity — might ultimately be catalyzed by the same process of emotional transfiguration. In the first, your heart is placed into someone else's body. In the second, that body is subsumed into the world. To create anything, be it a person or a play, is to give a piece of yourself a life of its own; a life that you will never again be able to control or keep safe. It's to risk the infinite potential of an offering over the unborn reality of an idea, and to accept how even something that looks just like you can grow to assume unimaginable shapes. The author dies so that their work can be reborn anew forever.

In that light, one of the great strengths of O'Farrell's novel is how the lightly historical context it invents around “Hamlet” refuses to align with the play's general plot and most obvious themes, and Chloé Zhao's film — which she co-wrote with the author — respects how that 2+2=5 approach begs for a different kind of equation. Unlike “Shakespeare in Love” (a masterpiece), “Solo: A Star Wars Story” (not so much), or any other examples of modern day origin stories, “Hamnet” doesn't reverse engineer its drama from the stuff of its ultra-familiar source material. Sure, there's a brief aside in which Will (Paul Mescal) jots down the balcony scene from “Romeo and Juliet” after his first kiss with Agnes (Jessie Buckley), and a later moment where their three children roleplay as the witches from “Macbeth” on some gray English morning, but never does this movie rely on the lizard-brain thrill of recognition in order to stand on the shoulders of giants. 




			Popular on IndieWire		






On the contrary, “Hamnet” derives its simple but overwhelming power from the disconnect between intention and response; it's a film that plants its roots in the liminal space between them, and keenly observes how the same kind of no man's land can form between a husband and a wife just as easily as it does between an artist and their work. By that measure, it would be hard to imagine a more fitting tribute to Shakespeare's most widely interpreted play.  

 










When the story begins in 1580, Will and Agnes are both arrestingly self-assured. He's a poor and scruffy Latin tutor whose interest in words, words, words makes him a “useless” disappointment to his domineering father (like Agnes' severe mother-in-law played by Emily Watson, Will's father isn't hateful toward his eldest child so much as he is afraid to love him, lest the world decide to take him back). She's a mystical “forest witch” whose fascination with falconry — and broader attraction to communing with the non-human world — makes her stand out from her family even more than the blood red dress she wears in a world of medieval gray. Will abandons his students at the first sight of Agnes walking by the classroom window, and the two of them are sucking faces a minute later. She makes him feel giddy, and he makes her feel destined. (Will proposes to Agnes by circling her like a child playing duck, duck, goose, a funny bit of blocking in a film that's always careful to let enough light shine through its potentially oppressive darkness). They each see a vision of the world in the other.

Needless to say, Zhao's signature naturalism serves Agnes well. We first see her curled up in the tree hollow where she'll eventually give birth to her eldest daughter, and the elemental nature of Łukasz Żal's cinematography allows her to retain that sense of earthiness wherever she goes. By a similar token, that stark visual language — complicated by Zhao's stately framing and related inclination toward surveillance-like interior shots that suggest the presence of a ghost looking down — helps to disabuse the drama of any potential staginess. Ditto the plainspoken dialogue, the wind that groans outside the Shakespeare family's house like an empty stomach, and the delicate Max Richter score that doesn't intrude on the drama until the film's nuclear-grade sobfest of a finale, which skirts dangerously close to emotional pornography as Zhao cues up the composer's most famous track. (Tear-jerkers come and go, but it's rare to see a movie that feels like it's farming you for moisture.)  

 










Anyway, for a fictionalized story about famous historical figures, “Hamnet” is uncommonly attuned to the base immediacy of their feelings. With actors like these at Zhao's disposal, it would have been a tremendous waste for the movie to focus on anything else. Anchored by the primordial rawness of Buckley's astonishing performance, “Hamnet” is never the least bit at risk of reducing Agnes to a trope. If anything, the film regards her as an even more powerful creative force than her husband; Will scribbles plays offscreen while Agnes sweats, screams on all fours, and shouts at the fates as she gives birth to their three children.

The kids grow up to embody the best of their parents, with Zhao paying special attention to the bond between twins Hamnet and Judith (Jacobi Jupe and Olivia Lynes, both terrific), who play together by swapping identities and trying to fool their parents. It's a fun Shakespearean flourish, of course, but one that lingers here for the casual sense of transference that it seeds for the semi-fantastical heartache that follows when Hamnet volunteers to absorb his sister's plague. Without exaggeration, the image of the cherubic eight-year-old boy standing lost in the bardo against a backdrop of painted trees is among the most devastating things that I've ever seen in a movie (where did he go?), and I spent the remaining hour of “Hamnet” feeling as if the weight of death itself were crushing down on my chest. 

 










Zhao is careful not to gild the lily (that “On the Nature of Daylight” needledrop notwithstanding), but her Shakespeare doesn't exactly need a lot of runway to make his loss feel like your own. Between “Aftersun,” “All of Us Strangers,” and the upcoming “The History of Sound,” no actor in the last five years has made me cry more than Paul Mescal — not because he's so fucking good at playing wounded, but rather because he's even better at playing the hurt of someone who doesn't know how to heal themselves. 

His performance in “Hamnet” is so cathartically transcendent because it at last rewards that search, a search that here extends beyond this world — if not the Globe — as Will starts looking for his son in the space between life and death. The pliability of English drama's most famous speech allows the suicidal dilemma of “To be, or not to be” to double as an invitation to reject its binary proposition, as the movie doesn't invoke it until it's clear that — so far as his increasingly estranged parents are concerned — poor Hamnet is being and not being all at once. He isn't there, but he isn't not there either. “He can't have just vanished,” she and her too-absent husband both agree, though they have very different ideas as to where he might have gone. 

 










If “Hamlet” is typically considered to be a revenge story first and foremost, the extraordinary final sequence of Zhao's film (which is much less open to interpretation), maps a different meaning onto “the undiscovered country” that lies beyond this mortal coil — one that may not align with Shakespeare's intention, but nevertheless hears a resonant stir of echoes in the silence at the end of the show. Hamlet and Hamnet may sound very different to our ears, but as the film's opening title card reminds us, they were interchangeable names at the time.

As we see “Hamlet” performed for the first time with Agnes and her brother (Joe Alwyn) in the audience after months of not speaking to Will, the play metamorphosizes before our eyes into a vehicle for mutual communion between the griefstricken parents. Will's agony takes brilliant and uncontrollable new shape on the stage of the theater, while Agnes' heartache is given the conduit it so urgently needs by virtue of how she projects her own pain onto the performance. 

Just as Hamlet begs Horatio to live on and tell his story, “Hamlet” finds Will pleading with Hamnet to do the same. This tragedy may not be the fate that either the playwright nor his wife ever wanted to imagine for their only son, but his story was never theirs to tell, nor could it ever hope to mean as much to anyone else. Because of “Hamlet,” that angel-faced little boy will die again a million times over for centuries to come. But in that sleep of death and what dreams may come, he will be reborn just as often, his memory rendered eternal across a more brilliant future than even William Shakespeare could have written for him.

 










“Hamnet” premiered at the 2025 Telluride Film Festival. Focus Features will release it in theaters on Thursday, November 27.

Ethan Hawke wears many hats. The multi-hyphenate writer-director-actor returns to the Telluride Film Festival for a Tribute with Berlin prize-winner “Blue Moon” (SPC), in which he plays Broadway lyricist Lorenz Hart. And Hawke is debuting his new documentary “Highway 99: A Double Album,” a two-parter devoted to the life and music of Merle Haggard, which will likely sell to a streamer as it hits the festival circuit. And showing at the Toronto International Film Festival is a new series debuting on FX September 23, “The Lowdown.” After all his recent efforts, Hawke, who has four Oscar nominations (three for collaborating with Richard Linklater), is ready to just talk. “I'm exhausted,” he said over breakfast in Telluride.

Hawke has always loved music, and has learned a lot over the years from playing trumpeter Chet Baker (“Born to Be Blue”) and directing the music movies “Blaze” and “Seymour: An Introduction.” That one debuted at Telluride in 2014. “Seymour was my midlife crisis, right?” said Hawke. “It's an old Shaker expression, but to master a craft, you have to apprentice three that surround it. My real mission is performance. That's what I've done my whole life. That's where the rubber meets the road. But learning about directing, learning about writing, learning about music, learning about these other things helps. It's all connected.”

His two Telluride movies are united in that they're both about songwriters, “two of the greatest American songwriters in the history of America,” he said. Lorenz Hart had partnered with Richard Rodgers on such American songbook faves as “Blue Moon” and “My Funny Valentine.” Hawke's love for Merle Haggard was embedded from his youth. “For most of us, the music that our parents played is somewhere deep inside us forever.”

His dive into Haggard follows “The Last Movie Stars,” about Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, “my love letter to my own profession,” he said. “In thinking about what to do next, I love making documentaries, because it's something you can work on slowly. When I was younger, I used to try to write prose, and I wrote some books because I needed a job to sustain the imbalance of an actor's life. In the last few years, documentary has replaced that part of my life. Before I work on Larry Hart, I'm working on Merle Haggard. Then I take a break. I disappear for 8-10, weeks. I play Larry Hart, and then I come back into me again, and I'm talking about my childhood and my loves and things that are personal to me, and it helps keep me balanced.”

“Highway 99” is Hawke's love letter to music. “I knew that whoever won the election, half the country was going to be despondent. Merle Haggard always wrote about people. He continued his whole life to never write from a left wing or right wing point of view, but from a humanist point of view. Country music is a place where men can express their feelings, where they often struggle, and it's a really safe place to talk about what's going on inside you.”

 










The two-part documentary digs into, among other things, the unrequited love story between Merle and Dolly Parton. And Hawke got to recruit some of his favorite singers to interpret Haggard's songs. He asked them which songs they wanted to sing, and Nora Jones, Valerie June, Steve Rowe and others picked them. “I thought I could tell his life as a musical,” said Hawke. “I could use his own writing to tell his own story.”

When it came to his ninth collaboration with Richard Linklater, “Blue Moon,” Hawke's music movies helped him to prepare for Larry Hart. “Things like studying jazz for Chet Baker, studying the piano with ‘Seymour,'” he said, “studying the pain of trying to be a songwriter through ‘Blaze.'”

The pain of Lorenz Hart comes through in this achingly sad story set at the end of Hart's partnership with Rodgers (Andrew Scott). It all takes place at Sardi's on the opening night of “Oklahoma!” — which Rodgers composed with Oscar Hammerstein II instead of Hart, sealing their split. “If you are feeling a lot of pain,” said Hawke, “there's this idea that success or approval from others is going to quiet that pain or bandage it. But in the history of mankind, it never does. He's heartbroken about Rodgers. He's setting himself up, and he's distracting himself that he's in love with this young woman [Margaret Qualley], and he's not even heterosexual. But he can't deal with the real pain that's happening. He can't look at it for a second. That movie is about a man who died of heartbreak. The alcohol was part of his sadness, the pain was too great to suffer without it. Alcohol is a painkiller.”

 










The movie starts out with Hart walking out of “Oklahoma!” and ponying up to the bar at Sardi's, where the bartender (Bobby Cannavale) tries to keep his drinking under control. Hart is a great talker, the words flow out of him like butter. Hawke has to sustain the rhythm and cadence of long speeches. And theater vet Cannavale, who had bonded with Hawke on “Hurly Burly” when they were both going through divorces, was there for him on “Blue Moon,” running lines. “He was my de facto acting coach,” said Hawke. 

Hawke was a “monk” during production, he said. “I would just sit in my dressing room and listen to Ella Fitzgerald sing Rodgers & Hart songs over and over again. If you listen to the music, you start to realize how well the script is written, because the script functions like a Larry Hart song. It's so funny and absolutely heartbreaking and poignant and witty and irreverent and lewd. So I started looking at that first monologue as the lyrics to the song. Rick [Linklater] was going to be Rodgers. Rick was going to write the music and build it and make sure it was sculpted right, and make sure it was presented right.”

Nailing this performance was about words. “This guy doesn't walk and talk like me, so it's voice and speech,” said Hawke. “He speaks in complete sentences. He speaks with clear ideas. It always has to be the perfect word choice. It had to have the language.”

 










But it was also movement and body language. Hart was short, with a hideous combover. “I grew my hair really long and then shaved the middle so that I could do the combover,” said Hawke, who is just under six feet. “A combover is about the most unflattering look that men have ever come up with. So what happens immediately is your own self-esteem drops, because everybody starts looking at you, talking to you differently. We did all these old school stagecraft tricks to make me smaller.” 

They built a trench in the floor and he bent his legs inside wide pants. “When you do a scene with Margaret Qualley when you're a foot shorter than her, is different than being two inches taller than her, because she doesn't take it seriously.” 

Luckily, Hawke had a decade to get used to the movie. Linklater gave it to him when he was in his early 40s and said, “when you're old enough, we're going do it.” They'd get together every couple of years and do a reading of the screenplay, Hawke said, “and we'd prune it and tweak it and talk about it.” 

The actor didn't feel any anxiety about it until just before shooting in Ireland. “Then I realized that this movie was going to put Rick and me up against the wall of our talent,” he said. “The bullseye in this movie is so small. There's so many ways to go wrong. One room, real time. Larry Hart is dying.”

 










Also, the movie was filmed fast. “Rick had to be incredibly decisive and clear,” said Hawke. “We didn't have a big budget, no budget, but luckily, we didn't need one. We needed ideas and great actors. I knew if the guy playing Rodgers wasn't phenomenal, the movie wouldn't work. That was the biggest challenge.”

In just a few quick scenes during the after party, the movie establishes the relationship between these former partners who are both grieving the breakup. “There's a certain Lennon-McCartney to Rodgers and Hart,” said Hawke. “For these two people who are that creative together for that long. It's a high level of intimacy.”

But Rodgers is moving forward, while Hart is descending into alcohol. Hawke had long admired Scott, who also comes from theater. Qualley does not, but they all rehearsed the hell out of it and it all came together.

Next up: Sterlin Harjo's FX series “The Lowdown,” in which Hawke plays a renegade truth-teller. “I got to have this character built for me by this brilliant young man,” said Hawke. “And I had so much fun.”

It was Canada Day, 1992, Canada's 125th birthday, three months before the release of the Tragically Hip's third studio album, Fully Completely. Gord Downie was sweating under the weight of a thick khaki shirt, hair plastered to his forehead, breathing heavily into his microphone. Thousands of people had turned up to a field next to the Molson Brewery in Barrie, about an hour north of Toronto, for the first of two shows the Tragically Hip would headline in one day on opposite sides of the country. The young crowd was half-drunk and baking in the midsummer sun, and Maple Leaf Flags billowed lazily in Downie's eyeline.

“Welcome to Molsonia! I've decided to change the name,” Downie said. He was trying to bait the crowd, but nobody was catching on. “Happy Stupid Day,” he added, a more manic edge creeping into his voice. The people he was trying to insult were cheering his every word; a few beers deep, they loved the idea of Stupid Day. He jammed another maggot onto the hook and hurled it back into the water: “We could have our own motto: ‘Who are we kidding?'” On the live MuchMusic broadcast beaming this out from coast to coast, a young girl perched on her friend's shoulders stared back at the stage blankly.

Three albums in, Canada's love affair with the Tragically Hip was already a complicated relationship.

Canada's obsession with the Tragically Hip is unique in the English-speaking world. A recent four-part Amazon Prime documentary, No Dress Rehearsal, proposed that the Hip were to Canada as U2 were to Ireland or the Beatles were to Britain, but that's not quite right. Everyone had U2 and the Beatles, regardless of where they were born or brought up. Only Canada truly loved the Tragically Hip. They sold over six million records in Canada alone—that's one album for every six people in the country. All but four of the 13 albums they released went straight to the top of the Canadian album charts, and one of those that didn't—their debut, Up to Here—ended up selling well over a million copies in Canada over the next decade. They were national icons unlike any other group or artist previously, the symbol of a country in the shadow of an economic and cultural superpower.

Formed in Kingston, Ontario, a university city on Lake Ontario, in 1984, the Tragically Hip struck a balance between plaid-shirted everyman relatability and shamanic rockstar mystique. Greg Barr of the Ottawa Citizen wrote in 1991 that the Hip's connection with their audience was based in part on them looking like their fans. They were all people who “have this thing for raunchy music and watching hockey on Saturday night... guys with regular jobs or college students who do their own laundry too.” That may have been true of guitarists Rob Baker and Paul Langlois, bassist Gord Sinclair, and drummer Johnny Fay, but Downie was, at least on stage, a different animal.

Critics at the time often compared him to one of his heroes, Jim Morrison, but there were myriad other descriptions that, taken together, paint the picture of a madman. A composite image generated from Canadian newspaper clippings of the time would show Jack Nicholson in The Shining singing with a “12 cup-of-coffee” intensity, a man who seemed “possessed by the kind of devils who were supposed to have created rock music in the first place” and was “reminiscent of the devil child Anthony, who could turn people into mutants just by staring at them, in a scary old Twilight Zone episode.” Downie was a magnetic presence on stage, dramatic and irrepressible, often devolving into stream-of-consciousness rants and dragging four-minute songs out into 10-minute jams.

Their first two full-lengths, 1989's Up to Here and 1991's Road Apples, had been recorded in Memphis and New Orleans, respectively, and a damp Southern air seeped into their sound. The guitars crunched, Downie's lyrics hinted at a collective outsiderdom—“Hey north, you're south/Shut your big mouth,” he sang through a humid drawl on “New Orleans Is Sinking”—and lines could be traced from his disjointed poetry back to Kingston. But his theatrics and cadence owed more to Morrison than any Canadian icon. Baker and Langlois borrowed consciously from blues and Southern rock, often dousing their guitar sounds in motor oil-thick distortion. It's not that the Hip were pretending to be American; kids on college campuses in Canada could recognize the real-life Ontario jailbreak behind Up to Here's “38 Years Later,” or the crisis in Quebec that animated Road Apples' “Born in the Water.” But the Hip were a blues-rock band from Canada. This was not Canada's answer to Bruce Springsteen.

Their die-hard following at home was built on different foundations. First, Canada is an enormous place—the world's second biggest land mass, pockmarked by mountains and endless rolling plains. Driving from town to town basically takes forever. So most bands simply don't. Smaller acts might stick to their hometowns and immediate surroundings, while major artists hit major cities like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, perhaps a couple of others with NHL teams and airports in between. The Hip hit small towns and out-of-the-way pockets, driving through the night or taking ferries where necessary to make it where others wouldn't dare.

Crucially, while the Tragically Hip were connecting the dots on the map, their music was beamed from coast to coast in a way that few but the biggest American bands would dream of at home. Canadian Content regulations (usually shortened to CanCon) had first been implemented by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in 1971, as a direct and centralized effort to protect Canadian cultural identity despite the enormous appeal of music from the U.S. and UK. The law required 30% of music played on AM radio to be identifiably Canadian, and it prompted a backlash from radio programmers at first, who insisted they would be forced to spin inferior records.

But by the mid-'80s, when video music stations like MuchMusic took off parallel with MTV in the States, Canadian artists were more visible than ever. CanCon effectively created its own ecosystem, in which young artists heard and saw Canadian music, made music of their own, and knew it would have a good chance of making it onto the radio. In 1991, the year before that show in Molsonia, FM radio's CanCon quotas were raised to line up with the AM. Three out of every 10 songs on the Canadian airwaves were Canadian. And an increasing number of those were made by the Tragically Hip.

CanCon also gave Canadian bands a degree of breathing room. Though the Hip toured America and played clubs with the same relentlessness as they did in Canada, Road Apples and Up to Here had done little commercially in the United States. That would have put most artists under immense pressure to succeed on a third album. But the Hip had the high floor of Canadian success. Not only did they not feel pressure to engineer their songs for radio play, they could even experiment and expand their sound with the knowledge that they'd be played by the CBC either way.

Not that the band didn't want success elsewhere. “We were still holding out for the equivalent American success,” Sinclair told Michael Barclay, Ian A.D. Jack, and Jason Schneider in Have Not Been the Same: The Can-Rock Renaissance 1985–1995. Their label, MCA, was convinced the breakthrough was imminent as well. At their behest, Chris Tsangarides, better known for his work in mainstream metal and hard rock, was drafted to produce their album and generate a punchier, more radio-friendly sound. It worked. Where their first two albums retained the jagged edges of their live show, Fully Completely was tighter, slicker, and more dynamic.

Above all, Downie's lyrics had changed. They were weird, a disorienting journey through Canadian history—real and imagined—that led somewhere chaotic and disquieting. Fully Completely's first song was dedicated to Hugh MacLennan and borrowed lyrics from his novel The Watch That Ends the Night—heralded as a classic in Canada but little known elsewhere. “At the Hundredth Meridian” placed itself on the literal dividing line between Western Canada and the Atlantic and Central regions, asking awkward and rhetorical questions: “Me debunk an American myth? And take my life in my hands?” This was all within the first eight minutes. It was, Kirk Makin wrote at the Globe & Mail, “swirling, quavery, complex, challenging and so profoundly Canadian.”

Everywhere on Fully Completely, Downie seemed intent on confronting Canada's foundational myths. “Fifty-Mission Cap” is structurally and musically one of the Tragically Hip's most straightforward songs, a 4/4 rock track that opens up into a two-chord chorus. It's the sort of thing that would (and did) play as well at a bowling alley as a packed-out basketball arena. But Downie's lyrics are peculiar: “Bill Barilko disappeared/That summer/He was on a fishing trip.” It is on its face a curious slice of niche Canadiana, mysterious and mostly forgotten: Bill Barilko, the Cup-winning defenseman for the Toronto Maple Leafs, who vanished into the untamed Ontario nowhere.

Downie had become obsessed with the story, spending evenings in the library researching it. “There was one night, it was close to closing time and I was right up to the point where they were about to discover his body,” he told the Toronto Star. “It was dark and in my mind I was in a bush plane somewhere over Northern Ontario. A librarian tapped me on the shoulder. I jumped right out of my skin.” He interviewed his bandmates' fathers, who told him about the conspiracy theories around Barilko—some thought he had been a Soviet spy, others that he was embroiled in a gold scandal and had been busted by the RCMP. Those were only put to bed when his body was discovered, 11 years later, in 1962, the same year the Leafs won their next Stanley Cup.

The chorus is even more complicated. Downie sings that he “stole” the story “from a hockey card/I keep tucked up under/My fifty-mission cap.” The fifty-mission cap itself was a staple of the elite Allied bomber squadrons during the Second World War. Pilots would remove the stiffening inner ring from their service cap to make wearing a headset in the cockpit more comfortable. Over time, the cap would sag and wear down, accumulating more sweat and dirt after every raid. If surviving even a handful of missions over the skies of Europe was unlikely, living through 50 was a sign of immense courage, impeccable skill, divine provenance, or a combination of all three. A fifty-mission cap told that story.

Unless, of course, you faked it. In the chorus, Downie admits that it isn't really a fifty-mission cap in his hands, with Barilko's hockey card tucked into the lining. “I worked it in to look like that,” he sings, as though it's a baseball glove or too-clean pair of jeans. In an interview with Steve Newton around the release of Fully Completely, Downie was clearly charmed by the idea. “Of course, you'd work it in to look like a fifty-mission cap so as to appear that you had more experience than you really did,” he said.

Maybe Downie was just drawing a parallel between the inexperienced Henry Hudson, who piloted the ill-fated flight that went down with Barilko, and the neophyte pilots of the Allied Air Forces. But it's difficult to ignore the imperfections in this image of elite military pilots, these dashing and supposedly unquestionable heroes. Some of them were just kids. Some of them weren't heroes at all—at least not yet. They were working it in. And if that image of Canadian history could be complicated so quickly, as a chaser to a story about a vanished hockey player, everything was questionable.

Elsewhere the lyrics were more directly adversarial. “Wheat Kings” was torn straight from the headlines, an acoustic track about David Milgaard, a 17-year-old wrongly convicted of a brutal rape and murder in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Milgaard served 23 years in prison before being released earlier that summer of 1992, and eventually fully exonerated. The song begins in a watercolor image of rural Canada, Downie singing of “sundown in the Paris of the Prairies,” but the veil is quickly pulled back to reveal the nightmare in Milgaard's mind, “where the walls are lined all yellow, grey and sinister/Hung with pictures of our parents' prime ministers.” Five of them had served in the time it took Milgaard to be convicted, suffer behind bars, and find freedom.

Most urgent of all was “Looking for a Place to Happen,” which told the bloody and bitter story of European annexation of Native land from two perspectives. First, Downie gave voice to French explorer Jacques Cartier, who callously wanted “To find a place, an ancient race/The kind you'd like to gamble with,” before shifting the focus to an indigenous person fleeing for their life: “I'll paint a scene, from memory/So I'd know who murdered me.” The Hip were not telling the story of a harmonious country. Everywhere on Fully Completely, there seemed to be injustice and death, a beautiful-seeming facade melting away to reveal something grotesque and disturbing.

Fully Completely exploded upon release in Canada, selling 200,000 copies in its five weeks. In the States, it performed so poorly that MCA pulled their marketing budget for it just a fortnight after its release. “Two weeks before the record comes out, all the record company is saying is, ‘It's gonna be big boys, look out!' Then the week after, no one returns our calls,” Sinclair said. “That's the way it is.”

By July 1993, the band's own optimism had curdled. In an interview with the Calgary Herald, drummer Gord Sinclair put it down to an attitude south of the border. “I think Americans have this weird thing about Canada,” he said. “They look north and figure it's just the 52nd state. Being from Canada really does not have much of an impact for them. They just sort of assume that you're a second-class American or American with a funny accent or French.”

Through the nineties, that divide grew. By 1996, seemingly every interviewer prodded Downie about their commercial success in Canada and relative anonymity in the States. It annoyed him. Maybe America was the “big leagues,” he admitted in an interview with Newton at Vancouver's Georgia Straight. But they were a successful band by any metric. “Ultimately, if you want to take our success in Canada and exponentially translate it to America, you're talking about us being Guns N' Roses. Or Counting Crows. Ultimately it's just something that I don't think could ever happen to this band, and never really thought it could. And sometimes the thing I fear, in that context, more than American failure, is American success.”

The more that America ignored the Hip, the more they were lionized at home. Shortly before they embarked on their final tour, in 2016, Dave Kaufman of the National Post wrote that the Hip had “become a part of our landscape, an experience in what it means to be Canadian.” They embodied “gravel parking lots and behind-the-hockey-rink smoke-ups… old theatres in the pines and college students having arguments that don't really matter… waiting in line at Tim Hortons and going to the cottage on a long weekend.”

But even on Fully Completely, the album most laden with references to their homeland, the Tragically Hip didn't get around to singing about illicit joints, campus debates, or waiting for mediocre coffee. They did once reference driving to and from a home in cottage country, the affluent part of the countryside full of idyllic second homes. But that song, “Bobcaygeon,” from 1999's Phantom Power, was a poetic reflection on fascism from the perspective of a disillusioned police officer. It namechecked a British anarchist folk-punk group and nodded to real-life race riots in prewar London and Toronto's West End. It wasn't just an ode to cracking a cold one on a Sunday night, though today you'll still find long-weekenders drinking hard seltzer and listening to Downie sing that “their voices rang with that Aryan twang.”

Kaufman isn't alone in loading the band up with his own national baggage. The Tragically Hip's status as “Canada's Band” has oversimplified their entire existence, flattening them into some kind of nationalistic sing-along outfit, draped constantly in the Maple Leaf, swigging from a can of Molson Canadian, cheering on the local hockey team. (Downie was, for what it's worth, a lifelong fan of the Boston Bruins.) Many people heard the names of their hometowns—places deemed desperately uncool in contrast with small-town America—in Hip songs and felt a natural pang of recognition. The critic and theorist Northrop Frye wrote that “Canadian sensibility is less perplexed by the question ‘Who am I?' than by some such riddle as ‘Where is here?'” Downie's lyrics seemed to exist inside that riddle, briefly fixing the songs in place: here is the Hundredth Meridian, here is Maple Leaf Gardens, here is a nightmare of a bleak museum after dark.

Shortly after Downie died in 2017, University of Alberta musicologist Alexander Carpenter led a semiotic-psychoanalytic study of the Hip's lyrics and concluded that they had become a sort of “fetish object.” There are no neat answers in Hip songs about what it means to be Canadian, no unambiguous stories about the Canadian everyman, or folk tales that link the band to some deep history. The place names and even literal coordinates in their songs invite listeners to draw such connections, but rummage around in the songs themselves, and things are more cryptic. “The Hip, standing in for Canadian identity, give rise to a desire for identity, and then in a circular fashion come to represent identity, but never in a way that is clear or pin-down-able,” Alexander said. In his eulogy for the band on that final tour, Dave Bidini expressed the same idea more poignantly: “Canada is good when it's viewed and heard through the Tragically Hip, and the Tragically Hip is good when they're viewed and heard through us.”

Five years after the Canada Day show in Molsonia, the band was interviewed by its fans for a piece that's since been excerpted by the CBC. Downie was asked by one fan about why he spoke so “bitterly” that day. He explained that alcohol and nationalism were a dangerous mix, and that he felt other bands on the bill had been treated poorly by a boorish crowd. “Ultimately,” he said, “I believe everything would have been way better if we'd done the whole thing on July 2nd—we could have celebrated the Canada of the self and not the Canada that is sold to us.”

Today, Canada finds itself unexpectedly drawn back into these questions of national identity in the shadow of its superpower neighbor. The President of the United States wants to annex his northern neighbor, which has put Canada in the awkward position of having to justify its own existence. This has had mixed results. In January, for example, shortly after the first mention of annexation, outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau could only define Canada by what it was not. “Canadians are incredibly proud of being Canadian,” he told Jake Tapper of CNN. “One of the ways we define ourselves most easily is, we are not American."" A more rigorous defence of Canadian identity and statehood remains a work in progress, which is perhaps forgivable. It is a difficult thing to reckon with in a hurry, and even more difficult to address in soundbites.

Downie's refusal to engage in those sorts of platitudes is what set him apart as an icon in Canadian culture. On May 24, 2016, the Tragically Hip announced that their lead singer had been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, and that their upcoming tour would be their last. The Man Machine Poem tour took the band back across Canada one last time, for 15 shows in 10 cities.

He was sick, often tired, his mental fog constantly lifting and descending. But as well as touring, Downie used his platform in his final months to advocate for reconciliation with Canada's First Nations—picking up where the stark “Looking for a Place to Happen” had left off. The last solo album he released in his lifetime, Secret Path, accompanied by a graphic novel of the same name, was a concept album centered on the story of Chanie Wenjack, a 12-year-old Anishinaabe who died in 1966 trying to escape from one of Canada's many brutal and deadly residential schools. “To become a country, and truly call ourselves Canada, it means we must become one,” he said at a ceremony hosted by the Assembly of First Nations in his honor. “We must walk down a path of reconciliation from now on. Together, and forever.”

Fully Completely is an extension of that spirit. It remains cryptic and contradictory, a Canada written in riddles and red herrings, as indecipherable and unknowable as the country itself. It confuses and complicates the country's underlying stories, confronts the grisly past and unjust present in the stubborn hope that there might be a better future. It's a sonic attack on Molsonia, the sound of a Canada of the self.

	In Donald Trump's increasingly addled worldview, if he can imagine it, he has the authority to do it. “I have the right to do anything I want to do. I'm the president of the United States,” he told reporters this week in the Oval Office, justifying his decision to deploy armed National Guard units to Washington, D.C., and his threats to send forces to Chicago and beyond. “If I think our country is in danger — and it is in danger in these cities,” he said, “I can do it.”Trump is using the military to beta-test an American police state. And he is going about it in a way that could stoke conflict between military units of Republican- and Democratic-governed states, says Ret. Maj. Gen. Paul Eaton, who spoke to reporters on a conference call, Tuesday. “That's the scariest thing about what we're watching right now.” 


	Trump signed a stark executive order this week directing the Pentagon to “immediately” create a special police unit inside the D.C. National Guard to enforce “public safety and order” in continued response to the “crime emergency” he's declared in the nation's capital. (Earlier this year, the federal government touted that violent crime in the district was at a three-decade low.) 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	But the executive order is not limited to the federal capital, where Trump wields broad powers. The order calls for building similar capacity in Guard units across the country, as well as the creation of a “standing National Guard quick reaction force” available for “rapid nationwide deployment.” Trump's order anticipates Guard members “quelling civil disturbances and ensuring the public safety.”Trump's move to direct the might of the U.S. military internally is raising alarms among legal scholars. “There is no statutory authority to federalize the National Guard for the purpose of policing local crime,” says Liza Goitein, a national security expert at the Brennan Center, who highlighted for reporters the pernicious effects of Trump's orders. “At minimum, using soldiers as a domestic police force creates a chilling effect” — in particular, she said, for people seeking to protest “the person who commands the soldiers.”Trump's order does more than marshal the military. It envisions civilians entering the fray to enforce the president's notions of law and order. The executive order calls for the creation of an online portal where Americans with “law enforcement or other relevant backgrounds and experience” can apply to “join Federal law enforcement entities” to “support the policy goals” of the president. 

	











	The language of the order, first flagged by The New York Times, is ambiguous. Would these civilians join in a paid capacity? Or as “civilian volunteers,” as the Times described it, resembling a federal posse? A White House official would not clarify beyond telling Rolling Stone that the portal hopes to attract qualified applicants who support Trump's initiative to “crackdown on crime” in D.C.

	











	Trump's order puts a task force chaired by top White House adviser Stephen Miller in charge of the recruiting effort. Trump's most nakedly authoritarian lieutenant, Miller regularly demonizes anyone to the left of Trump's MAGA movement. In an appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity this week, Miller described Democrats in ways that would make a demagogue blush:

	“The Democrat Party is not a political party, it is a domestic extremist organization,” Miller said. He peppered his diatribe with false claims that the Democratic Party does not “represent American citizens” and but is “devoted exclusively” to the “defense of hardened criminals, gang bangers and illegal-alien killers and terrorists.” Miller blasted Democratic mayors as “evil,” while falsely alleging they are “rejoicing in” subjecting residents to a “constant blood bath.” He called Trump's militarization of the streets of the nation's capital a “liberation,” declaring: “President Trump has literally set the people of Washington, D.C., free.”

	Strident “enemy-within” bluster is not new from the Trump administration. But advancing the notion that Trump's militarized police state ought to be turned against one of the two major political parties is harrowing — and a bright-red flag for anyone tasked with recruiting security forces. 


	The language of Trump's EO itself is also troubling. It can read like a dog-whistle to the right's own extremists. The ranks of the Oath Keepers, for example, are brimming with ex-military and law enforcement. As detailed in court proceedings, its leaders were waiting on an invitation from the president during the tumult of Jan. 6 to join a violent crackdown on Trump's enemies in D.C. The militia group had infamously stationed its own, armed, “quick reaction force” across the river in Virginia. These convicts are now at large after Trump's mass pardon spree. 


	Beyond this troubling recruiting, “the mission is the problem here,” Max Rose, a former Democratic congressman from Staten Island, New York, tells Rolling Stone. “The president's intent is to scare the hell out of millions of people — principally his political opponents,” Rose says. “That's why it's being done in such a public, brazen manner.”


	Rose, like Eaton and Goitein, was a panelist on the press call, which was organized by the Vet Voice Foundation, a group devoted to defending democratic values. Its CEO, Janessa Goldbeck, denounced Trump's “steady march” to using the military as a “partisan tool,” calling the new executive order the “most dangerous step yet” by the president. “It's a blueprint to use America's military forces to police our own citizens,” she said.

	











	Several panelists on the call highlighted the danger of Trump potentially shattering precedent by deploying National Guard units from one state into another — against the will of that state's governor. “This norm has been treated as inviolable, because the alternative is blatantly unconstitutional,” said Goldbeck. “Put bluntly, the Constitution prevents states from invading other states.”


	This invasion threat is no longer an abstraction. In a press conference this week, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois spoke directly to “my fellow governors” who might consider sending National Guard units “into my state against the wishes of its elected representatives and its people.” Pritzker spoke with a firmness that could be read as a veiled threat: “Any action … violating the sacred sovereignty of our state to cater to the ego of a dictator,” he said, “will be responded to.”


	Retired Maj. Gen. Eaton is a Vet Voice adviser. Using military jargon, he raised the specter of a “blue-on-blue” conflict — a form of “fratricide,” as he described it — in which American military units “wind up shooting at each other” when they “both believe they're doing the right thing, but their chain of command is flawed.”

	Eaton imagined a dangerous scenario in which a state like South Carolina or Mississippi were to deploy Guard troops to California, only to be told by the governor: “You will not enter the state of California.”  


	“This can spin out of control if the governors feel that they are the last line of defense for the U.S. democracy,” Eaton says. And America's current cold war between Republican and Democratic governed states could suddenly turn hot. “The last time America had a blue-on-blue,” he cautions, “was the Civil War.”

	As we learned from the original Spinal Tap, all things must pass — or choke on someone else's vomit, or die in a bizarre gardening accident, or explode onstage. So it's appropriate that the film's long-delayed sequel, Spinal Tap II: The End Continues (in theaters Sept. 12), functions as a very funny elegy for the entire rock & roll era, with returning original cast members Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer leaning hard into their fictional band's creakiness as they prepare for the Tap's final concert. 


	“The thing that David St. Hubbins used to say,” says McKean, channeling his own character, “ is that rock & roll keeps you young, but only if you die young. Otherwise, you just age like a regular old person.”
















	The creators of the greatest music-world comedy ever made never saw much money from it, and the sequel exists only because Shearer recently spent some of his Simpsons voice-acting fortune (he's Mr. Burns and Ned Flanders, among many others) on a legal battle to get the rights back. “We sat and said, ‘Well, what do we do with this?'” says Rob Reiner, who again serves as the film's actual director while co-starring as obtuse fictional director-interviewer Marty DiBergi. “At first we said, ‘Ah, forget it. We are not gonna do anything.' And then we started talking.” (To hear Reiner's full interview on our Rolling Stone Music Now podcast, go here for the podcast provider of your choice, listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or just press play above.)

	The actors and Reiner began meeting daily at Shearer's house in Santa Monica. “Some days we would completely waste,” McKean says. “We'd get into talking about old show business and prehistoric TV.… We would waste as much time as we could, as long as there were snacks.” Still, Reiner began outlining ideas on a whiteboard, “and when we got enough of them, it became apparent — ‘Oh, yeah, there's something here,'” Shearer says.


	In the decades between films, Spinal Tap have taken major steps into quasi-reality, releasing albums and touring in character, and the movie is able to use footage of moments like their actual 2007 Live Earth performance as flashbacks. Further blurring the metafictional line, Paul McCartney and Elton John show up in the sequel as themselves, and actually play with the band. Both roles are bigger than mere cameos, and John, in particular, is key to the film's climax. (A new version of “Stonehenge,” featuring John on vocals, is out now, the first single from the film's accompanying album.)


	Both John and McCartney were game for the comedic improvisation required, with Sir Paul drawing on his Hard Day's Night-era screen presence. If anything, it was far scarier for the cast to have to play music with them. “They're so fucking good,” says Guest. “They're so smart. There's no sense of them pushing it. It's completely natural.” 


	Guest was particularly awed by John's willingness to push past his current health issues for the role. “He was such a good sport,” he says. “It was insane. This is a person who's had some physical things, serious things in the last years. He came in sort of limping, and I thought, ‘Oh, my God, we're doing this stunt, what if something happens,' you know? And he was amazing. I mean, imagine if he'd said, ‘This is bullshit, I'm walking out' — no movie! It was just so generous.”


	After the 1984 film, Guest, of course, went on to direct multiple classic features (from Waiting for Guffman to A Mighty Wind, which reunited the Tap members as different characters) using the wildly influential Spinal Tap framework of comedic faux-documentaries with improvised dialogue. But he's been quietly retired for nearly a decade.  “I have all these other things I do,” Guest says. “I go hiking and I walk in rivers and I ski and I play music every single day.”

	When we meet his character, Nigel Tufnel, he's similarly moved on from his career, albeit with a new occupation as the owner of a cheese shop that accepts guitars in trade. The idea came from a fantasy Guest had when he visited a real-life store, run by a cheesemonger who had a Tufnel-like accent. “I was walking around London, and I went into one of the most famous cheese shops,” Guest says. “And there was a help-wanted sign on the door. I thought, ‘I'm gonna call Jamie [Lee Curtis, his wife] and tell her I think I'm gonna do this. I could work here! I could learn about this!'”


	Inevitably, the new film introduces a new drummer, in the form of the gifted, tatted-up real-life musician Valerie Franco, after some very famous percussionists make brief cameos to turn down the life-threatening gig. “We wanted to see some female drummers, because we thought that would be an interesting thing for this boys club,” says McKean. “She's the spirit of rock & roll. She's what's going to be left behind.”

	There's a new song, too, “Rockin' in the Urn,” which introduces a defiant note amid the film's nods to mortality. “I just thought it was the silliest way to say ‘We're never gonna die,'” says Shearer. “‘We'll live forever.' And make it as stupidly literal as possible.”


	It's unclear whether the film will truly mark the end of Spinal Tap. There are no plans for a real-world tour, though the band hinted at a one-off performance at what Shearer calls a “very historic site” — which a recent report suggests is the actual Stonehenge. In any case, McKean says, “If you only halfway exist, then vanishing altogether is not a big chore.”

Snoop Dogg has addressed the controversial comments he made over his response to his grandson's questions about a same-sex couple in Lightyear, and the backlash that ensued.


	“My bad,” he wrote in a comment on an Instagram post shared on Wednesday from Hollywood Unlocked. It features the hosts discussing Snoop Dogg's comments with media personality Ts Madison.


	“I was just caught off guard and had no answer for my grandsons,” he wrote. “All my gay friends [know] what's up, they been calling me with love. My bad for not knowing the answers for a 6 yr old. Teach me how to learn. I'm not perfect.”


	During a recent appearance on the It's Giving… Podcast, Snoop told a story about watching Lightyear with his grandson when Snoop said his grandson asked him, “‘Papa Snoop? How she have a baby with a woman? She's a woman.' Ah shit, I didn't come in here for this shit. I just came to watch the goddamn movie.” Snoop said he encouraged his grandson to just watch the movie, but his grandson continued to ask more questions.

	











	“I'm scared to go to the movies now,” Snoop said. “Y'all throwing me in the middle of shit that I don't have an answer for.” In a since-deleted part of the podcast, he said that the Lightyear scene “threw me for a loop,” adding, “I'm like, ‘What part of the movie was this?' These are kids. We have to show that at this age? They're going to ask questions. I don't have the answer.”

Lightyear screenwriter Lauren Gunderson also responded to the topic on Wednesday.  “So. I created the LIGHTYEAR lesbians,” Gunderson wrote in a statement on Instagram. Gunderson detailed that “a key character needed a partner, and it was so natural to write ‘she' instead of ‘he.' As small as that detail is in the film, I knew the representational effect it could have. Small line, big deal. I was elated that they kept it.


	“I'm proud of it. To infinity. Love is love,” Gunderson continued. “I was one of a few writers they had on it over the years, which is very common for screenwriting of course. I had very little to do with the final script. But I was proud to see a happy queer couple (even for a few seconds) onscreen. I know they got a lot of shit for this inclusion, but stuff like this matters because beautiful love like this exists.”

	Extremely rich New Yorkers are having what The New York Times is calling a “freakout” over the New York City mayoral race. 


	“The Hamptons is basically in group therapy about the mayoral race,” Robert Zimmerman, a political fundraiser, told the Times.


	At the root of this panic is Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist who won the Democratic primary mayoral primary in June. He is running to freeze rents, crack down on bad landlords, raise the minimum wage, and tax the rich. 


	“I don't think we should have billionaires,” he said in June. (New York City has more billionaires than any other city.)


	“What they're discussing is not just Mamdani and his policies, but [former Gov. Andrew] Cuomo and [Mayor Eric] Adams and whether anyone can beat him,” Zimmerman said. 


	“Everyone's talking about it all the time,” writer Molly Jong-Fast, who has a house in the Hamptons and votes in New York City — which is not uncommon among New York's elite — told the Times. 

	











	Mamdani beat Cuomo 56 percent to 44 percent in the primary in June, despite being hugely outspent. It sent a signal to the establishment that they may not have the ultimate power. 


	Elites have threatened to leave New York City and its taxes if Mamdani is elected, but history and data shows they will stay. 


	As Mamdani and his 50,000 volunteers campaign across the five boroughs, Cuomo and Adams, who are both running as independents, are turning to the Hamptons, where Mamdani has not held any events. 

	











	“While they're wining and dining billionaire types, Zohran is bringing thousands of New Yorkers together,” political consultant Rebecca Katz told the Times. Her firm, Fight, produces ads for Mamdani.


	One person who is in the so-called “Anyone But Mamdani” set is billionaire grocery store tycoon John Catsimatidis. Mamdani has proposed creating city-owned grocery stores that would keep prices low by not making a profit. Catsimatidis told Fox Business in June that if Mamdani wins, he will close his grocery store chain, Gristedes.


	“If the city of New York is going socialist, I will definitely close, or sell, or move or franchise the Gristedes locations,” he said.

	Democratic donor Patricia Duff, who married real estate billionaire Richard Cohen in June, told the Times, “Mamdani has a great smile and is wonderfully articulate. His social media is entertaining, and his promises sound fine until you look at the fine print and they're not realistic. It's fantasy land.”


	“Even overpriced lobster salad can't seem to make people out here feel better,” said Zimmerman, the fundraiser.

	It's not easy to be a convincing humorist in pop music. By design, lyrics are always meant to be a little quirky but few pop stars have mastered the art of hamming it up quite like Sabrina Carpenter. On Man's Best Friend, Carpenter is in break-up mode the only way she could be: sad but still horny and altogether self-aware.


	Just a year out from her blockbuster breakthrough Short n' Sweet, the singer's seventh album was created with a tight crew who had been integral to her previous release: Jack Antonoff, Amy Allen and John Ryan. Together with Carpenter's innuendo-laden wit at the helm, the album zeroes in on the updated Seventies pastiche that worked so well on her biggest hits. She's a little bit ABBA and a lotta bit Dolly: the Pennsylvania-native hits a charming Southern twang over swathes of synths, airy guitar riffs, and funky nü-disco beats. Her new songs are united in their grooviness as Carpenter's heartbreak and disappointment in her male options takes her on a thoroughly modern tour of what dating, embracing, and then flipping the script on the humiliation ritual that is being a woman who dates men. 

	











	From the opening “Oh, boy” on “Manchild,” Carpenter spends the entire album dishing out tough love for her lovers, unrelenting in listing out her grievances. On “Tears,” she only “gets wet at the thought” of him “being a responsible guy.” On both “My Man on Willpower” and “Nobody's Son,” she's exhausted by her lover's selective control. On the former, they're together but he's not as touchy and clingy and feral for her as he used to be. On the latter, they've broken up and he hasn't caved on calling her yet.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Carpenter has few peers these days when it comes to turning some of the most uncomfortable or even painful feelings when you're crying over an ex into giggle-worthy treats. “Never Getting Laid” stands out. The slow burning, sexy song has her wishing the best for her ex — so long as he stays in his house and never looks or touches another woman again. She drinks the pain away on “Go Go Juice,” running through the numbers on her phone over a two-steppin' beat that belongs in your local honky tonk.

	The two standouts on the album are when Carpenter is at her flirtiest and her wit is at its quickest. The funky “When Did You Get Hot?” has her encountering a long time acquaintance who she didn't remember looking so cute. “You were an ugly kid, but you're a sexy man,” she comments, in a line that can only work with her winking delivery. “House Tour,” a coulda-been Song of the Summer contender if only it had come out a month earlier, is bold enough to have made 1983 Madonna seethe with jealousy. She's beckoning a new lover to come see her house because she's “just so proud of [her] design.” On the chorus she assures “I just want you to come inside/But never enter through the back door.


	It may have taken Carpenter six albums to finally find the right formula that works for her as a budding pop diva, but now it's clear there's no looking back. If Short n' Sweet solidified her stardom, Man's Best Friend plates her status in gold.

Glen Powell plays a disgraced college quarterback who attempts to rebuild his career in disguise in the upcoming Hulu series Chad Powers.


	The streaming service shared the first trailer for the sports series Saturday, with Powell's character explaining, “I'm gonna do a Mrs. Doubtfire, but with football,” alluding to the 1993 comedy where Robin Williams assumed the identity of an elderly British nanny to spend time with his own children post-divorce. (Instead of posing as British, Powell's character instead becomes West Virginian.)


	Powell's Russ Holliday is a hot-shot college QB whose career is forever tarnished after blowing “the Big Game” by showboating. He then assumes the identity of “Chad Powers” — thanks to a wig, mustache and some face prosthetics — in an attempt to walk-on the South Georgia football team.

	The series was produced by former NFL quarterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning, with the latter also appearing in the show as a rival coach. It was Eli himself who created the “Chad Powers” character and concept back in 2022, when the retired QB donned disguise and assumed the name during walk-on tryouts for the Penn State football team in a video short:

A researcher is leading calls for a federal inquiry to finally shed light on Australia's best-known UFO mystery, Westall 1966.

More than 200 students and teachers at Westall primary and secondary schools were said to have witnessed up to three unidentified flying objects in broad daylight on 6 April 1966.

Multiple witnesses describe fast-moving, shimmering, silver objects that flew over the schools and disappeared behind pine trees in The Grange Reserve.

Army, Air Force, Department of Supply and police officers swarmed the scene, with students and staff saying they were ordered to never speak of what they saw.

Nearly 60 years on, there remains no official account from the authorities.

Grant Lavac, a Melbourne researcher, has initiated a petition for an independent inquiry to “uncover the truth”.

“It continues to be a fascinating unsolved cold case that has people asking questions.

“As a researcher I feel for the witnesses – for those who were children on the day – and want to know what they saw in the skies and why they were told to shut up about it.”

In the decades since, the federal defence department has resisted FOI requests to release its file on Westall 1966.

Three years ago, Lavac interviewed ex-students for his documentary The Westall Witnesses, and was struck by how genuine they were and how vivid their descriptions.

“I certinaly believe that what they saw was what they were telling me.

“Obviously memories fade, but nearly 60 years later they regather every year to keep alive their memories and recollections.

“It was incredibly compelling.”

Lavac says witnesses dismissed therories that the UFOs were everyday objects like weather balloons. 

“They say it wasn't a weather balloon or hot-air balloon. It was like nothing that they'd seen before and moving in ways they couldn't understand.”

Recently, an academic suggested they were high-tech, top-secret devices used to measure atmospheric radiation from Pacific nuclear tests. 

Lavac hopes an inquiry could lead to the Department of Defence again handling reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP).

The RAAF ceased reporting protocols for UAP in 1996.

“If it's just something as prosaic as a balloon, then why not now give the witnesses the truth?

“If it's not prosaic, then it's a compelling reason for the RAAF to devote resources to investigate (UAPs) in our air space which could present a national flight risk or national security risk.”

At the time, Dandenong Journal was the only newspaper to cover the event, under headlines Flying Saucer Mystery: School Silent and What was it?

The coverage featured a student's hand drawn sketch of a round object with “a hump on top and round things underneath”, as well as interviews with students and teacher Andrew Greenwood.

It remains one of the Journal's most sought-after stories, with requests from across the world to republish the 1966 report.

Academic and researcher Shane Ryan, who gathered more than 140 eyewitness accounts over the past two decades, has signed Lavac's petition.

He says there is perhaps more interest than ever in what occurred that day, as well as in uncovering files at the National Archives of Australia or the relevant government departments.

“Given that most surviving witnesses involved in the incident are now in their 70s and older, it is time for a concerted effort to be made to bring the truth of the incident, whatever it was, out into the open.”

In 2015, something extraordinary happened behind the scenes of U.S. military and veterans affairs: the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), after years of resistance and secrecy, granted disability compensation to USAF veteran John Burroughs for injuries sustained during a 1980 encounter with UAP — unidentified aerial phenomenon — in Rendlesham Forest, England. This wasn't a vague acknowledgment or routine settlement — it was a stunning moment of government admission, albeit buried beneath layers of classification.

Dr. Christopher “Kit” Green, a former CIA medical officer with Top Secret/SCI clearance, confirmed publicly that Burroughs's medical records were among only a handful in his entire intelligence career that were formally classified. The reason? Embedded within those records were connections to special access programs (SAPs), sensitive technologies and electromagnetic field studies so compartmented that even Green, a lifelong intelligence insider, was initially denied access.

More shockingly, Green concluded that Burroughs's injuries were caused by broadband non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation — the kind associated with classified directed-energy technologies and some of the more exotic components of UAP encounters documented by AATIP (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program) and AAWSAP (Advanced Aerospace Weapon System Applications Program). One of the 38 DIA-funded DIRD papers, authored by Green himself, directly explores how such radiation affects human tissue. Coincidence? Hardly.

So why didn't this explosive case — one that intersects national defense, medical ethics and advanced aerospace science — change the way we study UAP?

Because it was inconvenient.

Burroughs's injury placed the Pentagon, the VA, and multiple intelligence entities in an untenable position. To admit the cause of his injuries was to open the door to the idea that UAPs are not only real — but interact physically, energetically, and dangerously with our personnel. It would mean acknowledging that the United States government not only knows this, but has known it for decades.

And yet, no major scientific body followed up with peer-reviewed studies. No mainstream media outlet gave it more than a passing glance. No Congressional panel asked why a U.S. service member's heart was damaged by a technology allegedly unknown to science.

Senator John McCain, whose staff received the list of the 38 AAWSAP papers from the Defense Intelligence Agency in early 2018, was one of the few who took the matter seriously. His involvement, and the behind-the-scenes pressure from a small group of courageous officials, finally forced the VA to disentangle Burroughs's classified medical records. It was a rare triumph of transparency. But without sustained public attention, even that victory was quietly absorbed by the vast bureaucracy of secrecy.

Today, we stand at a crossroads.

UAP hearings are making headlines. Whistleblowers testify before Congress. Government officials use terms like “nonhuman intelligence.” And yet, the only case in which a U.S. veteran received documented government recognition of UAP-induced injuries remains largely ignored.

What does that tell us?

That disclosure isn't just about aliens. It's about systems of control, institutional fear and the profound difficulty of telling the truth when that truth threatens powerful interests.

John Burroughs' story should have been the Rosetta Stone for unraveling the physiological effects of UAPs on humans. It should have sparked a new wave of funding, studies and international cooperation on pilot safety and anomalous exposure. Instead, it remains a suppressed landmark; a proof buried beneath redacted memos and FOIA denials.

It's time to bring it back into the light.

Because if we won't protect those who risked everything in service of our country — and who were injured by something we dare not name — then disclosure is not only delayed.

It is denied.

Viral News

Emma Stone is ready to talk about aliens. While promoting her new sci-fi comedy Bugonia at the Venice Film Festival, the 36-year-old actress revealed that she believes in extraterrestrial life and thinks it's self-centered to assume otherwise. 

Stone, who stars as Michelle Fuller, a pharmaceutical CEO mistaken for an alien and kidnapped by two conspiracy theorists, shared her thoughts on the universe and what inspired her belief in life beyond Earth.

Speaking at Thursday's press conference, Stone said, “I don't know about looking down on us, but one of my favorite people who has ever lived is Carl Sagan.”

“I watched his show Cosmos, and I fell madly in love with his philosophy and science and how brilliant he seems to be. I think he very deeply believed that the idea that we're alone in this vast expansive universe is a pretty narcissistic thing to think.”

“So yes, I'm coming out and saying it, I believe in aliens! Thank you!”

Earlier in the conference, the La La Land star playfully hinted that she could even be an alien herself. Asked how she's managed to remain grounded despite global fame, Stone teased: “How do you know I'm not an alien?””

She then reflected more seriously, “I think there's a tricky aspect to that answer that's probably longer than anything that anyone would want to listen to right now.”

“But I think everyone sort of deals with that now. We all can relate to that feeling of someone thinking they know you, feeling like you don't have much control of the avatar outside of me. Because there's me, and then there's me, here.”

“There's the person who comes here, and then there's the person who I am with my friends and family. They're the same person, but it's what I do to keep myself sane.”

Stone also revealed she shaved her head for the role after her character Michelle is captured by Teddy (Jesse Plemons) and Don (Aidan Delbis). In one scene, her kidnappers cut off her hair in the back seat of a stolen Range Rover, using no CGI, just Stone's real locks falling onto the leather seats.

Speaking about the experience, Stone said, “It's the easiest thing. You just take the razor and shave it. It's so much easier than any other hairstyle.”

She also told Vogue in August about the surprisingly blissful moment that followed, “[There's] no better feeling in the world. The first shower when you've shaved your head? Oh my God, it's amazing.”

The haircut also carried a personal resonance for the actress. In 2012, her mother, Krista, lost her hair while undergoing treatment for triple-negative breast cancer, a fight she survived. Stone recalled to Vogue, “She actually did something brave. I'm just shaving my head.”

John Edward never imagined he'd use his psychic abilities to help solve some of America's most chilling crimes. But when FBI agent Robert Hilland reached out in 1998 about one particularly frightening case involving convicted murderer John Smith, Edward couldn't ignore the call.

Years later, Edward, 55, and Hilland have reunited to write Chasing Evil: Shocking Crimes, Supernatural Forces, and an FBI Agent's Search for Hope and Justice. The book recounts the case of Smith, who was convicted of killing his first wife in 2001, and other cases that Hilland and Edward worked together to solve, including the murder of Annie Le and Michael Vick's involvement in a dog-fighting ring.

“I think this book [is] the punctuation at the end of that chapter,” the self-proclaimed medium shares exclusively in the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now. “When [Hilland] came to me and said he wanted to tell this story, I was OK with it. The main case of the [book] kind of took a lot out of [Hilland]. Now, [we] get the chance to control the narrative.”

Edward and Hilland built an unexpected partnership, each utilizing their unique abilities to work on cases until Hilland's retirement in 2022. Edward tells Us that working with the law enforcement veteran helped him heal his own complicated relationship with his father, a New York City police officer who was skeptical of the supernatural.



“I recognized that there was a part of me that was seeking my dad's approval, and this gentleman [Hilland] was representing that concept for me,” Edward recalls. “I wasn't just helping this guy on the cases; it was a deeper connection. I was trying to prove to my dad that I had value when it came to what I do.”

 

Edward recognizes that true crime is more popular than ever but says that Chasing Evil is unique due to its supernatural element and exploration of psychic phenomena.

“This is almost like a new genre. It's a hybrid of those two worlds,” he says, adding that his father would be “proud” of the book.

Ultimately, Chasing Evil shows readers that justice does exist, according to Edward: “There are people that are out there doing something for the greater good.”

Chasing Evil: Shocking Crimes, Supernatural Forces, and an FBI Agent's Search for Hope and Justice will be available in bookstores nationwide on Tuesday, September 2.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Feature: Sarah Francis, Psycho or Psychic","https://stateoftheart.net.au/features/feature-sarah-francis-psycho-or-psychic/","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 00:48:11 GMT","

Manan: What is Psycho or Psychic about?

Sarah: It's a ‘journey of self'. As Luna discovers something about her that is strange and different from others, she sees a wall too big to climb that separates her from the world where others exist. But then ‘love' strikes her heart. She leads you through the way she experiences the world, and you soon discover it is vibrant, raw and full of life.

You'll see stories that the audience will ‘categorise' into one of these [psycho or psychic] extremes of a large spectrum. These stories might be clear, come as a surprise or be weaved through the narrative of Luna's experience of the world that you might not have realised the show took a turn until you're on the other side of the ‘scene' or show!

Ultimately it's about the power of love. However, not in a way that is ‘typical' or expected. It's better for you to ‘feel' the experience – which is why the show exists.

You say your show is inspired by real life experiences. Which experiences?

The inspiration to create the show was actually an experience of ‘falling in love'- the first time we met our eyes locked and I felt like, “this guy really knows me”, the whole world melted away. All through a glance. It fascinated me how unreal and different it was to anyone else I had met… and so began my digging into as many ‘unreal' experiences I've had, and stories I've shared with others that brought me amazement.

I kept digging and eventually I found my way back to some experiences when I was quite young –  predicting events, hour long de ja vu's and some unimaginable experiences, such as meeting someone and knowing this was the last time I'll see them alive (well, later realising alive in their body).

In the show there is a story that unfolds based on a work colleague. She was young and had the ‘whole world' ahead of her. When I knew it was the last time I'd see her alive I tried to ask her if there was anything she wanted to experience before she ‘became an adult' and work became the focus. She was so at peace, her response was something like “no, I live everyday as if it it's the most beautiful day there is”. She had no idea how much reassurance it gave me, knowing that when that time comes she will be ready. The kicker was when someone told me she had died. I ‘saw' her driving on the road, and a ‘lady holding a bag crossing the road' (a ghost) had stopped and looked at her, standing in the headlights of the car. I knew she saw a ‘kangaroo' (but it was something else), she tried to swerve to go around it… but lost control of the car and hit a tree, she died on impact. Then I asked a friend, “how did she die?” and they told me that it was a car accident, that she had hit a tree on the way to see her brothers. It was devastating and the whole town mourned her loss.

This event holds a special place in my heart, not only because I felt like I could ‘see' what happened before knowing the facts, but also because of what happened a few years later – which I share in the show.

How did you develop the show?

I started with one story. In the beginning it was going to be a love story, but I never wanted it to be the ‘main' attraction. The part of this love story that pulls me is how this world we can see and touch, and the world where we are guided by sense and a ‘pull' to something ‘invisible', collide. And so the show began to unfold. The name Psycho or Psychic came early on as I reflected on some of these experiences. I thought to myself, “Wow, am I a psycho or mentally insane?!?” I also worked as a psychic for a few years, so Psycho or Psychic seemed quite fitting and funny.

A few months later I heard a song in my head – Led Zeppelin's ‘Immigrant Song'. It was stuck in my head until I applied for Sydney Fringe, and it's the inspiration for the character ‘Evil Luna'.

Different things will ‘pop' up and I'll sit with it until it reveals why it's here and how to ‘use it'. I listen to my inspiration and let myself laugh at ‘dreaming' the show into being. I think about it all day. I get so close to it that I need space and I start from scratch and rewrite it with different eyes, then I go back through it and ask myself,“Where is my fun? Am I excited about this?” If not, it goes. If I'm laughing when I'm trying to deliver it, it stays. And then it's about how I can become the character so much I don't laugh at their ‘personality' or choices. I really let the characters guide me.

I keep creating and building it one step at a time.

Your show is categorised as physical theatre and circus, spoken word & storytelling, and comedy. How have you combined these?

Great question! Honestly?! Physical theatre wasn't a separate option so circus had to come along. Please note, you won't see any circus!

Comedy because I want people to feel like they are allowed to laugh at inappropriate moments and difficult subject matter, and it allows me space to take risks.

 Storytelling because my passion lies in crafting a good story to share. Also to reach more variety of audiences as it's the first time the show is being staged.

Through humility, satire and music choices I see comedic moments. It's not stand up by any means, but hopefully some people will catch my quirky humour and feel invited to laugh as much as they like. Physical theatre is a part of my discipline. Training as a professional dancer, I feel like movement is much clearer to me than words. Everything is a story and beautiful. I still identify quite a lot with using my body to express emotions and stories. Anyone who knows me well will tell you I tell a 2-minute story over 10 minutes while I laugh about it, dance and act it out, becoming all the characters in the story just so you get a good feel of it haha. It's a bit manic. Of course, this is a much more polished approach to my mind palace of sharing stories.

But that's how the script began! A 2-hour show.

You are known for your sound baths. Will we experience some of them?

Am I? Thank you, I'm glad it's gaining traction. First I was a professional dancer, performing nationally in Perth and Sydney Festivals among other events in WA and the ACT. I still love working as a professional dancer.

It is these experiences and my love of movement that motivates my continued exploration of the human body, which led me to sound bowls back in 2020. The power of listening to specific energy frequencies had profound effects for recovery and finding calmness within my body, helping me to move with greater clarity and freedom.

But no, sound baths are connected to my business ‘Embody your Essence', assisting neurologically with clients to rediscover their essence and be themselves freely in their bodies, not my performance work. Well, at least not yet anyway.

Holly Rowan is credited as the “Outside Eye”. What does that mean?

Holly and I met back in 2023 at a dance class in Melbourne. We bonded over embodiment practices, dancing and weird and wonderful things about life. Hitting it off so easily, and knowing they are a Theatremaker and Embodiment Practitioner themselves, made the decision to work with Holly very easy. Holly reached out when they saw my post about the show and shared they had previously presented a work that had similar themes and ‘clown' components, so I knew her input would be invaluable.

We agreed a ‘directors' role would have more time with the show's development than we are able to commit to and Holly saw ‘Outside Eye' as a fit title for the work we are doing together. Essentially, Holly uses their skills to help me unlock parts of the show, characters or staging that I can't see while being ‘in it'. Ideas I can go further with- because being on the ‘outside' of the process, they see potential I might have overlooked, and together we flesh out how that looks and feels, keeping true to the show's integrity.

What do you hope audiences take away from your show?

I hope the experience of watching the show will answer that. I don't want to force a felt experience by ‘labelling' an outcome I hope for, I believe that defeats the audience's journey of discovering it for themselves. However I hope the audience can see how much fun I've had in creating it for them, and maybe that will lead the way. But I tell you what! I would love to hear about what the audience takes from it after the show!

John Edward never imagined he'd use his psychic abilities to help solve some of America's most chilling crimes. But when FBI agent Robert Hilland reached out in 1998 about one particularly frightening case involving convicted murderer John Smith, Edward couldn't ignore the call.

Years later, Edward, 55, and Hilland have reunited to write Chasing Evil: Shocking Crimes, Supernatural Forces, and an FBI Agent's Search for Hope and Justice. The book recounts the case of Smith, who was convicted of killing his first wife in 2001, and other cases that Hilland and Edward worked together to solve, including the murder of Annie Le and Michael Vick's involvement in a dog-fighting ring.

“I think this book [is] the punctuation at the end of that chapter,” the self-proclaimed medium shares exclusively in the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now. “When [Hilland] came to me and said he wanted to tell this story, I was OK with it. The main case of the [book] kind of took a lot out of [Hilland]. Now, [we] get the chance to control the narrative.”

Edward and Hilland built an unexpected partnership, each utilizing their unique abilities to work on cases until Hilland's retirement in 2022. Edward tells Us that working with the law enforcement veteran helped him heal his own complicated relationship with his father, a New York City police officer who was skeptical of the supernatural.



“I recognized that there was a part of me that was seeking my dad's approval, and this gentleman [Hilland] was representing that concept for me,” Edward recalls. “I wasn't just helping this guy on the cases; it was a deeper connection. I was trying to prove to my dad that I had value when it came to what I do.”

 

Edward recognizes that true crime is more popular than ever but says that Chasing Evil is unique due to its supernatural element and exploration of psychic phenomena.

“This is almost like a new genre. It's a hybrid of those two worlds,” he says, adding that his father would be “proud” of the book.

Ultimately, Chasing Evil shows readers that justice does exist, according to Edward: “There are people that are out there doing something for the greater good.”

Chasing Evil: Shocking Crimes, Supernatural Forces, and an FBI Agent's Search for Hope and Justice will be available in bookstores nationwide on Tuesday, September 2.

A new brain imaging study published in Scientific Reports provides evidence that conspiracy beliefs are linked to distinct patterns of brain activity when people evaluate information. The research indicates that people who score high on conspiracy belief scales tend to engage different cognitive systems when reading conspiracy-related statements compared to factual ones. These individuals relied more heavily on regions associated with subjective value and belief uncertainty.

“Our motivation for this study came from a striking gap in the literature. While conspiracy theories have a profound impact on society—from shaping political engagement to influencing health decisions—we still know very little about how the brain processes such beliefs,” said study author Shuguang Zhao of the Research Center of Journalism and Social Development at Renmin University of China.

“Previous research has focused on general belief processing, but the specific neural mechanisms that sustain conspiracy thinking remained unclear. The COVID-19 pandemic made this gap even more urgent. During this global crisis, conspiracy theories about the virus—whether it was deliberately created, or that vaccines were part of hidden agendas—spread rapidly across digital platforms.”

“Such crises tend to heighten uncertainty and fear, creating fertile ground for conspiracy narratives,” Zhao continued. “Observing how these beliefs flourished in real time underscored the importance of understanding not just what people believe, but how their brains evaluate and sustain these beliefs when confronted with threatening or ambiguous information.”

“Personally, I was also motivated by this broader social context: as misinformation accelerates in times of crisis, uncovering the cognitive and neural basis of why some individuals are more vulnerable to conspiracy narratives is crucial for promoting critical reasoning and resilience against misinformation.”

The research team recruited 388 Chinese-speaking participants who completed a set of online surveys designed to measure general conspiracy beliefs. These included items from three well-established scales: the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs Scale, the Conspiracy Mentality Scale, and the Conspiracy Theory Ideation Scale. Each item was rated on a seven-point scale, and the total scores were used to identify individuals with either high or low levels of conspiracy belief. The top and bottom ten percent of scorers were invited to participate in a brain imaging experiment.

From this pool, the researchers selected 31 participants: 19 high-belief individuals and 12 low-belief individuals. All were between 18 and 32 years old, right-handed, and free from psychiatric or neurological disorders. Before undergoing brain scanning, participants completed practice trials to ensure they understood the task.

Inside the MRI scanner, participants were shown 72 statements formatted to resemble posts from Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform. Half of the statements reflected conspiracy theories, and the other half presented factual information from state media sources. Each post was presented both visually and through audio recordings to control reading speed. After each statement, participants rated how much they believed the information using a seven-point scale ranging from “not at all” to “completely.”

The researchers used high-resolution brain imaging to record blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals throughout the task. This method allows scientists to infer which brain regions are more active based on changes in blood flow. They then analyzed the data to compare brain activity during the evaluation of conspiracy versus factual information across the two belief groups.

At the behavioral level, both high- and low-belief participants were more likely to believe factual statements than conspiratorial ones. However, high-belief individuals were significantly more likely to endorse conspiracy-related content compared to their low-belief counterparts. Notably, the groups did not differ significantly in their belief ratings for factual information, suggesting that the belief gap was specific to conspiracy-related content.

“One surprising finding was that individuals with high conspiracy beliefs did not differ from low-belief individuals when evaluating factual information,” Zhao told psyPost. “Their bias only appeared with conspiracy-related content. This suggests that conspiracy beliefs are not about being generally gullible, but rather reflect a selective way of processing information that aligns with conspiratorial worldviews.”

Brain imaging results revealed a double dissociation. When evaluating conspiracy-related information, high-belief individuals showed greater activity in two key regions of the prefrontal cortex: the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. These areas are thought to be involved in emotional value assignment and monitoring uncertainty during belief evaluation. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex helps assign meaning or value to information, especially when evaluating how well it aligns with prior beliefs. The dorsomedial region is often linked to handling ambiguity and maintaining stable beliefs over time, even when evidence is ambiguous or conflicting.

In contrast, low-belief participants exhibited more activity in the hippocampus and the precuneus when evaluating conspiracy content. These regions are associated with memory retrieval and self-referential thinking. The hippocampus plays a central role in integrating new information with existing knowledge and storing episodic memories, while the precuneus is involved in recalling past experiences and imagining future events. The pattern suggests that people who reject conspiracy narratives may be more likely to evaluate claims by drawing on past knowledge and contextual memory.

Importantly, the group differences in brain activity emerged only when participants evaluated conspiracy-related statements. There were no significant neural differences between high- and low-belief individuals when reading factual information, again pointing to a content-specific effect rather than a generalized cognitive style.

“The most important takeaway is that conspiracy beliefs are not simply a matter of being more gullible or less intelligent,” Zhao said. “Instead, our results show that people with high levels of conspiracy belief process information through different neural pathways compared to those with low levels.”

“At the behavioral level, we found that high-belief individuals were more likely to endorse conspiracy-related statements, but they evaluated factual information just as accurately as low belief individuals. This suggests that conspiracy thinking is a selective bias—it shapes how people respond to conspiratorial content, rather than causing a general inability to recognize facts.”

“At the neural level, we observed a clear divergence. High conspiracy believers showed stronger activation in the ventromedial and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, regions involved in value-based judgment and managing uncertainty. In contrast, low conspiracy believers engaged the hippocampus and precuneus, areas important for retrieving and integrating memories when evaluating new information.”

“Taken together, these findings suggest that conspiracy beliefs persist not just because of what people believe, but because of how their brains evaluate and sustain certain types of information. This helps explain why conspiracy theories can be so resistant to counterevidence and why they often thrive during times of social crisis.”

But the study, like all research, includes some limitations. The sample size was relatively small, and all participants were native Chinese speakers recruited from a university setting. This raises questions about how well the findings would apply to other cultural contexts, particularly in societies with different media landscapes or conspiracy traditions. Additionally, the use of Weibo-style posts added ecological validity within China, but results may differ in other social media formats or in more interactive communication settings.

“Our next step is to move beyond conspiracy beliefs and examine how people process misinformation more broadly, especially in the context of rapidly advancing AI,” Zhao explained. “As AI systems are increasingly capable of generating large volumes of content, including plausible but misleading explanations, it is crucial to understand how such information affects trust, reasoning, and decision-making.”

“In the long run, our goal is to uncover the cognitive and neural mechanisms that make people vulnerable to AI-driven misinformation, and to explore how labeling, explanation style, or source cues might mitigate these risks. By doing so, we hope to contribute to strategies that help individuals navigate an information environment where truth and falsehood are becoming harder to distinguish.”

The study, “Neural correlates of conspiracy beliefs during information evaluation,” was authored by Shuguang Zhao, Ting Wang, and Bingsen Xiong.

   13:35 EDT 31 Aug 2025, updated  13:37 EDT 31 Aug 2025    By EMMA RICHTER, US NEWS REPORTER and GERMANIA RODRIGUEZ POLEO, US CHIEF REPORTER   

President Donald Trump was seen heading to the golf course on Sunday as false conspiracy theories about his health continue to swirl. 

The Republican, 79, donned black pants, a black shirt, and a white USA hat as he entered a black SUV at the White House. 

His motorcade arrived at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia around 10am. 

Trump's latest appearance comes just a day after he was captured heading to the course with his granddaughter Kai Trump on Saturday. 

Before that, unfounded rumors started circulating online claiming that the President was sick or even died - with the hashtag '#whereistrump' going viral on Friday. 

The speculation began after several White House reporters noted the president had not been seen in public since a marathon cabinet meeting on Tuesday and had no events scheduled all weekend.

And the unfounded rumors went into overdrive after Vice President JD Vance told USA Today he was ready to step in for Trump if 'If there's a terrible tragedy.'

The rumors were also fanned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who asked people to pray for Trump as he claimed without evidence, that the president was in a 'health crisis,' and looked like he was about to 'collapse.' 

But the rumors were quashed by Axios journalist Barak Ravid who revealed a US official had confirmed the president is in good health. 

'Trump is OK. Will play Golf this morning,' Ravid wrote on X shortly before images emerged of the president and his granddaughter.

Earlier this week Trump sat down for a mammoth cabinet meeting ahead of Labor Day to, 'celebrate the victories American workers have experienced over the past eight months', per the White House.

On Wednesday, he had a meeting with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Israeli official Ron Dermer to discuss a post-war plan for Gaza.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed in July that the president was suffering from 'chronic venous insufficiency,' that was causing 'mild swelling' in his lower legs.

The president's physician revealed in a memo that his condition was, 'a benign and common condition' in elderly people, but that there was no evidence of any serious arterial disease.

People with the condition often are advised to lose weight, walk for exercise and elevate their legs periodically, and some may be advised to wear compression stockings. Severe cases over time can lead to complications including lower leg sores called ulcers. Blood clots are one cause, but was ruled out, Leavitt said.

Leavitt said the condition wasn't causing the president any discomfort. She wouldn't discuss how he was treating the condition and suggested those details would be in the doctor's letter, which was later released to the public.

But the letter was the same as what she read, and it did not include any additional details.

Trump also sparked concern after bruising was spotted on the back of his hand, however his physician revealed that it was a result of 'irritation from frequent handshaking and use of aspirin 'as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention' treatment.

Despite the conspiracy theories surrounding his health, Trump's Truth Social account was active on Friday when he issued a statement about tariffs after a federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs

The post said: 'ALL TARIFFS ARE STILL IN EFFECT! Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong.

'The U.S.A. will no longer tolerate enormous Trade Deficits and unfair Tariffs and Non Tariff Trade Barriers imposed by other Countries, friend or foe, that undermine our Manufacturers, Farmers, and everyone else.'

Lisanne Froon, 22, and Kris Kremers, 21, arrived in Panama airport brimming with excitement.

After months of planning, the two Dutch students set out to hike the famed El Pianista' trail, eager for discovery and adventure.

The trek, which cuts through a dense cloud forest on the slopes of the Baru volcano, was meant to be the highlight of their trip. 

But within hours they had vanished, leaving behind one of the most disturbing mysteries of modern travel.

Months later, fragments of their remains were found scattered along a remote river bank deep in the jungle.

Investigators tried to reconstruct the girls' final days through strange photos found on their camera after they disappeared.

But, without clear evidence, speculation flourished, and theories ranging from accidental misadventure to more sinister explanations - such as foul play, kidnapping, or even organ tracking quickly spread.

The women embarked on their excursion on the morning of April 1, 2014.

According to some accounts, they had brunch with two Dutch men before setting off and brought along a dog from a nearby restaurant, IL Pianista, though details vary.

The hike should have taken roughly three hours to complete but the pair had still not returned by nightfall.  

Some sources claim the owners of the restaurant raised the alarm when their dog returned home that evening without Kremers and Froon.

Further panic ensued among locals when efforts to contact Kremers' father Hans were unsuccessful and they missed an appointment with a local guide the following day.

The girls' families arrived in Panama on April 6 as a major search operation got underway - with a $30,000 USD reward for anyone could find the women.

Sniffer dogs scoured the rugged landscape for any sign of Froon and Kremers but found no trace.

It would be a further two months before authorities were able to find anything relating to their disappearance.  

On June 14, a blue backpack belonging to Froon was found along the Culebra River near Alto Romero, well off the main El Pianista route by a local woman. 

Despite Panama's rainy season, the backpack appeared clean and dry, containing $88 in cash, sunglasses, both women's bras, their phones, and Froon's camera.

Locals claimed it had not been there the day before, fueling suspicions. Nearby were Kremers' denim shorts. There are conflicting reports as to whether they were carefully placed on a rock or simply found in disarray remains disputed. 

The friends' phones revealed that around six hours into their hike someone tried to ring the emergency services 77 times.

The first distress call attempt was made by Kremers' iPhone 4 at 16:39.  Shortly after that, another attempt was made from Froon's Samsung Galaxy S III at 16:51. 

None of the calls got through due to lack of reception in the area.

On April 4, Froon's phone battery became exhausted after 05:00 and the phone was never used again.

Between 5 and 11 April, Kremers' iPhone was turned on multiple times but the correct PIN code  was never entered again - hinting that she was not the one handling the phone.

The most perplexing clues about what happened in the women's final hours came from from Froon's camera.

Investigators discovered 133 images taken as late as seven days after their disappearance, including 90 taken in pitch darkness during the pre-dawn hours of April 8, 2014. 

The majority show little beyond blackness or foliage illuminated by the flash, suggesting the friends were deep in the jungle.

A few images reveal seemingly deliberate arrangements including red plastic on sticks, tissues, a small mirror on a rock, and one image, timestamped 1.49am, which shows the back of Kremers' head. 

Previous speculation suggested blood could be seen near her temple, though clearer versions did not confirm an injury. 

Adding to the mystery is the missing photo #509: it does not appear in the memory card's file structure, raising questions about whether it was deleted intentionally, corrupted, or never existed in the first place.

Subsequent searches along the river unearthed scattered human remains: a foot in a boot, a piece of a pelvis, and various bone fragments. 

DNA matched them to Kremers and Froon.

Puzzlingly, while parts of Froon's remains still retained some skin, Kremers' bones appeared 'bleached,' with high phosphorus levels that did not match local soil conditions. 

A Panamanian forensic anthropologist noted the absence of cuts or marks on the bones, adding another layer of intrigue.

The minimal remains meant that a cause of death could not be determined, however, the most likely theories suggest the women either suffered an accident or got lost and died of exposure.

But, the unusual photos combined with the bizarre findings sent the conspiracy theory mill into overdrive and sparked suggestions the women had been stalked, kidnapped and murdered while hiking on the trail. 

The official investigation shifted stance over time. Panamanian authorities initially classified the case as homicide, then abduction. 

By March 2015, however, it was formally closed with the conclusion that both women died in a hiking accident. 

Dutch forensic teams thought rugged terrain, 30- to 40-meter cliffs, and swift river currents could explain the condition of the remains.

But, despite the official explanation, the debate over what really happened continues to this day.

Many find aspects of the narrative inconsistent with the physical evidence.

These include the sudden appearance of the backpack, the bleached condition of Kremers' bones, the missing photo #509, and 77 failed emergency calls that suggest a prolonged struggle for survival. 

New and often polarizing theories have surfaced in recent years.

Highlighting suspicious details and strange camera images, some investigators believe the women were victims of kidnapping or murder. 

They note that the late discovery of their remains - months after large-scale searches- could signal third-party involvement, as could possible tampering with the camera or the staging of belongings, Medium reports.

Another elaborate theory posits that organ traffickers were informed about the two tourists, leading to abduction on the trail and captivity for several days before the women were killed.

Most researchers consider this scenario extremely unlikely, given the lack of supporting proof. 

Many experts still support he official accident explanation, suggesting the pair simply went off-trail, became disoriented, and succumbed to natural hazards.

'We don't know if anybody was involved - we cannot exclude that,' Jürgen Snoeren, co-author of Lost in The Jungle, previously told The Sun.

'We believe the most likely explanation is that they had an accident - but it's not 100 percent.

'The only way to make a full conclusion is when we find the rest of the bodies. I think there should still be remains there in the jungle from the girls. But it's a hell of a job.'

Over the last five years, the public have continued to express an interest in the case.

In 2021, Dutch authors Marja West and Jürgen Snoeren published a book offering new perspectives on the mystery after trawling through police files. 

Their work noted unresolved inconsistencies that keep alternative theories alive.

By the 10th anniversary in April 2024, the saga had still not been forgotten. 

Advances in forensic methods and persistent amateur investigations prompted calls for reevaluation of bones and digital data. 

In September 2023, a documentary reexamining the women's final days and alleged investigative oversights threw the case back into the spotlight - sparking a fresh debate about how evidence was gathered, cataloged, and analyzed. 

Throughout these developments, the relatives of Kremers and Froon have stood by the official conclusion of a tragic accident, finding some comfort in closure even as the public's fascination persists.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","other"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","His search for the Titanic concealed a top-secret military operation. How the iconic discovery unfolded","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/31/science/titanic-discovery-anniversary-bob-ballard","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 16:00:00 GMT","


            Forty years ago, in the early hours of September 1, grainy black-and-white images of a metal cylinder appeared on the video feeds in the command center of Knorr, a research vessel searching the Atlantic seafloor for the world's most famous shipwreck: the Titanic.
    


            Members of the four-person watch team, suspecting the object might be a sunken ship's boiler, were unable to tear themselves away from what was unfolding on the screen, so they dispatched the team's cook to rouse Bob Ballard, the expedition's chief scientist who had been searching for the wreck since the 1970s. He was awake, reading in his cabin bunk.
    


            The cook “didn't even finish his sentence. I jumped out. I literally put my flight suit over my pajamas, which I didn't take off for several days after that,” recalled Ballard, senior scientist emeritus in applied ocean physics and engineering at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.
    


            CNN spoke to Ballard, and a member of his team, Dana Yoerger, a Woods Hole senior scientist in marine robotics, ahead of the 40th anniversary of the Titanic's discovery. They recounted the unusual chain of events that led to that stunning sighting — and how the adventure didn't stop there.
    


            “As I came in, we had a picture of the boiler on the wall, and we looked,” Ballard said. “We realized it was definitely (from the) Titanic, and all bedlam grew loose.”
    


            Even before Ballard and his team found the wreckage 73 years after the iconic vessel set sail in 1912, the Titanic was a source of ceaseless fascination. The “unsinkable” ship went down on its maiden voyage in a gilded age with American's wealthiest on board, a tale of human folly, class prejudice and technological failure.
    


            Its discovery in 1985 only intensified the Titanic's pull on the public imagination; it unleashed a 1997 blockbuster movie that remains one of the highest grossing in film history, several documentaries and museum exhibits, and for those with deep pockets, high-stakes trips to see its final resting place about 13,000 feet (3,900 meters) below the ocean's surface, one of which, in 2023, resulted in fresh tragedy.
    


            For ocean explorers such as Ballard and his colleagues, finding the Titanic was like climbing Mount Everest for the first time. The prototype technology that made it possible has since transformed deep-sea exploration and science, vastly expanding scientists' knowledge of the ocean. But even with the right tools, it took an inspired shift in strategy to uncover the iconic shipwreck.
    


            The 1985 search for the Titanic was not Ballard's first attempt at locating the wreckage. A 1977 expedition failed when a 3,000-foot drilling pipe to which sonar and cameras were attached snapped in two, according to Ballard's 2021 memoir, “Into the Deep.” The experience, along with the need for live imagery, convinced Ballard that remotely operated underwater vehicles that could stream video back to the exploration vessel were a better way forward, but he struggled to find funding for his vision.
    


            Ultimately, the US Navy supported the development of Ballard's technology, a deep-sea imaging system nicknamed the Argo. The Navy was interested in using it to determine why two nuclear submarines, the USS Thresher and the USS Scorpion, had sunk in the Atlantic in the 1960s, as well as for broader Cold War intelligence-gathering purposes.
    


            Ballard convinced Navy officials to build in some time to search for the Titanic during the expedition to survey the submarines, a ploy that ultimately acted as a cover story for the Navy's secret mission.
    


            “What people didn't know at the time, at least a lot of the people, was that the Titanic (search) was cover for a top-secret military operation I was doing as a naval intelligence officer,” Ballard said. “We didn't want the Soviets to know where the submarine was.”
    


            Despite years of planning, Ballard wasn't optimistic that he would find the Titanic for two reasons: The time allotted for the search was short and a French team, led by engineer Jean-Louis Michel of the French oceanographic institution IFREMER with whom Ballard had been cooperating, was using a new, sophisticated ship-mounted sonar system to locate the ship's final resting place.
    


            “The agreement was that the French would find it,” Ballard said, “(and) once they found it, I'd have plenty of time, a week would be sufficient, to film it.”
    


            The French team, while close, missed the wreckage, and Ballard's “camera on a string,” as he described it, spotted the wreck — aided by a significantly narrowed search area following the French sonar scanning.
    


            Ballard had what he called a “light-bulb moment” while mapping the debris of the Scorpion sub that was pivotal to the mission success. Its debris field was a mile-long trail, not in a small circular area as expected. Heavier objects sank straight to the seafloor, but lighter debris went down at a slower rate, and ocean currents carried them farther away.
    


            He realized that the Titanic, which fell to a similar depth as the Scorpion sub, would have a similar, if not larger,  debris field and that looking for this stream of detritus would be easier than finding the hull and other heavy parts of the vessel.
    


            “It was the technology and the knowledge of how to use it,” Yoerger said. But also “the big thing that led to our success was Ballard's strategy. He wasn't trying to find the ship, he was trying to find the debris field, which is a much bigger target, and one that's particularly well-suited to finding with your eyeballs.”
    


            The Argo took black-and-white video of the Titanic in 1985, while an older system called ANGUS, with its 35-mm camera system, captured blue-hued still images revealing the wreck's existence. The team returned a year later with more advanced, color cameras to record every inch of the wreckage, including the ship's swimming pool, grand staircase and bow, generating iconic images still familiar today. 



            Ballard also became the first person to visit the wreck that year via Alvin, a crewed submersible that he had previously piloted, which took more than two hours to reach the seafloor. Once there, he spotted poignant artifacts, including a child's doll, uncorked champagne bottles and silverware. He saw no human remains.
    


            Trails of rust covered the Titanic, created by bacteria that feasted on the metal, creating long, reddish spikes — a phenomenon Ballard named “rusticles,” a word that subsequently entered the Oxford English Dictionary.
    


            Ballard recalled that some areas, covered in a protective pink paint when the ship was built, looked pristine. To preserve the “very hallowed ground,” Ballard said he advocated using a similar approach — protective paint perhaps applied by underwater robots — to prevent the wreckage from eroding further.
    


            The Titanic's final resting place was far from Ballard's only discovery in a long, distinguished career as a scientist and explorer. Expeditions to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge provided key evidence for plate tectonics, while a voyage to the seafloor along the Galápagos Rift revealed the existence of hydrothermal vents and the fantastic life forms that live on them — showing that life could thrive without sunlight and precipitating new theories about its origins.
    


            Ballard went on to discover several other storied wrecks: the Nazi warship Bismark, the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown and PT-109, a Navy vessel commanded by President John F. Kennedy in his mid-20s during World War II.
    


            But his golden touch faltered in 2019 when an expedition to locate Amelia Earhart's downed plane turned up empty. The explorer said he thought it would be possible to find the aircraft with the help of new technologies. “It's still on our checkbox,” he said.
    


            While human-operated submersibles still have a role to play, he said that the future of ocean exploration is remote and robotic, and he ultimately envisions that uncrewed ships will ply the world's oceans. To date, about 27% of the seafloor has been mapped.
    


            “We're now getting to where we can launch multiple AUVs, autonomous (underwater) vehicles, sort of a pack of dogs that you can send out. … We can put all those assets in the water at the same time,” said Ballard, whose Zoom handle is Captain Nemo after the fictional character in Jules Verne's “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.”
    


            “I mean, it's all about bottom time. The real calculation you make is how long you are underwater.”
    


            Yoerger has turned his focus away from the ocean floor and is developing an underwater robot that can explore the twilight zone — the midwater ocean 200 to 1,000 meters (about 650 to 3,300 feet) below the ocean surface, just beyond the reach of sunlight, which plays a key role in regulating the globe's climate by mitigating the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
    


            At 83, Ballard is still actively exploring the ocean. In July, he returned from a 21-day expedition aboard the Nautilus operated by his nonprofit, the Ocean Exploration Trust, to Guadalcanal, in the Solomon Islands in the Pacific. There, he began mapping vessels and planes lost during five major World War II naval battles between August and December 1942.
    


            “I love it when kids tell me to stop discovering things, so there's something left for them to find,” Ballard said.
    


            But he said he's confident plenty of unknowns remain about the ocean for the next generation of explorers.

Chinese president hosts bilateral meetings on sidelines of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin

Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have met on the sidelines of a showpiece summit in China that seeks to challenge US-led, western-dominated blocs and is being attended by the leaders of more than two dozen nations.

The Chinese and Russian leaders, who are closely allied under what they have termed a “limitless” partnership, discussed Putin's recent meeting with Donald Trump, according to a Kremlin official, who gave no further details.

The bilateral meeting was one of several for Xi on Sunday, who is hosting the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin. The SCO is a 10-member bloc of Eurasian nations, and the summit is also being attended by the leaders of 16 observer or “dialogue partner” nations.

Xi personally welcomed several leaders including the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, before the delegates attended a formal reception.

Xi told the welcome reception that in the past century there had been a “significant increase in instability, uncertainty and unpredictable factors”, and that the SCO had become an “important force in promoting the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind”.

Footage published by Russian state media showed Xi and Putin, who arrived in Tianjin with an entourage of senior politicians and business representatives, warmly greeting each other at a photocall before calling in an interpreter for a lengthy and animated conversation.

Putin and several other attenders are expected to stay on for a military parade in Beijing on Wednesday to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, which China refers to as the war of resistance against Japanese aggression. The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, is also expected to attend.

The Tianjin summit is the largest held by the bloc since it was formed in 2001. The SCO is a key part of Beijing's push for stronger multilateral alternatives to western or US-led blocs such as Nato.

Putin told the Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Saturday that the SCO meeting would “consolidate solidarity” among the Eurasian nations and “help shape a fairer multipolar world order”.

The goal appears to have been helped by the upheaval brought by Trump's tariff regime and other foreign policy moves. Modi and Xi's meeting took place five days after Washington imposed punishing 50% tariffs on Indian goods due to Delhi's purchases of Russian oil.

It is Modi's first visit to China in seven years, and comes amid efforts by China and India to rebuild trade ties and resolve long-running Himalayan border disputes.

“We are committed to progressing our relations based on mutual respect, trust and sensitivities,” Modi said after meeting Xi.

Xi said China-India ties could be “stable and far-reaching” if both sides focused on viewing each other as partners instead of rivals, state media reported.

In a meeting with Erdoğan, Xi said China and Turkey should strengthen cooperation in the area of counter-terrorism, according to Chinese state media. Xi also met leaders of the Maldives, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, and the autocratic leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, a key ally of Putin.

The bilateral talks were held at the Tianjin Guest House, an intimate venue surrounded by lush greenery. Large sections of Tianjin were closed to traffic and a significant police presence was deployed around the city.

Lim Chuan-Tiong, a researcher with the Institute for Advanced Studies on Asia at the University of Tokyo, said Putin and Xi meeting again was a sign of the continuation of their “limitless” partnership, and closing ranks while both deal with a common foe – the US.

“As long as the mutual opponent [US] has not been defeated, China and Russia's off-limits cooperation will remain,” Lim said. “Their cooperation also serves to highlight a global order that exists beyond the United States.”

Moscow's claims over Ukraine and its full invasion in 2022, as well as Beijing's claim over Taiwan and threats to invade, have further isolated both governments from western and other democracies.

Russian analysts have said the Ukraine war is now a main pillar of the bilateral relationship and that Moscow would want know how Beijing would respond if the US were to ask it to put pressure on Russia to end the fighting.

“The longer the war [on Ukraine] drags on, the more Russia will need China's assistance, whether economically or other forms,” Lim said. “China also recognises that it is unlikely for Sino-US relations to return to their pre-2018 state and thus has no choice but to accept a close alignment with Russia.”

Beijing purports to take a neutral stance on the Ukraine war but has become an economic lifeline for Russia, and Ukraine has accused it of providing direct aid to Moscow's campaign. The two countries have separately increased joint military drills.

A Chinese academic who spoke on condition of anonymity said Moscow had expected more support from its ally but Beijing had been at pains to avoid further punitive sanctions.

“China says there is ‘no limit' but in practice it hesitates, constantly looking over its shoulder, wary of pressure from the west, the EU and Nato. It has never really taken Russia seriously – and Russia saw through this long ago,” the academic said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of eight other nations are set to meet in northern China for the latest summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in a possible challenge to often incoherent approaches by the United States to trade and regional conflicts.

The 10-member group that will gather Sunday and Monday in the port city of Tianjin has grown in size and influence over the past 24 years, even while its goals and programs remain murky and name recognition low. Some call it the scariest grouping you have never heard of.

The full membership includes Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Originally seen as a foil to U.S. influence in Central Asia, the original organization picked up four new members with the addition of India and Pakistan in 2017, Iran in 2023 and Belarus in 2024.

Some of those are clear foes of the West, especially Iran and close Russian ally Belarus. Others including India, China and Russia have a more nebulous relationship, either because of Washington's wobbly stance on Russia's war with Ukraine or because of chaos surrounding U.S. tariffs that have upended key trading relationships with countries such as China and India.

The SCO's two-day summit may shed more light on issues surrounding the group's activities and intentions.

Canada needs new playbook for relations with China amid Trump chaos: report

Since its 2001 founding, the SCO primarily has been dominated by China, the regional economic superpower, with Russia seeking to use the group to maintain its influence over former Central Asian Soviet republics Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

While Russia's economic influence has declined steadily, especially under increasingly severe Western sanctions, both Russia and China have used the alliance as a framework for regional military cooperation, albeit limited to joint drills and firing competitions.

Belarus, Iran, Pakistan and India joined later in an apparent attempt to share in the SCO's budding influence, though the value of their membership is debatable. Iran and Belarus have faced international condemnation over sanctions and human rights violations, while Pakistan is highly dependent on China for military hardware.

India has long stuck to a self-avowed policy of neutrality, though that may be part of a strategy of self-interest.

Since the Russia-Ukraine war began, India has become a major buyer of Russian oil, increasing tensions with Washington. Modi also remarked on “steady progress” in improving relations with China after meeting its top diplomat in August and noted “respect for each other's interests and sensitiveness.''

India's SCO entry potentially challenges Russian and Chinese domination over the association. Despite their trade ties, India is unlikely to offer meaningful support for Russia's war in Ukraine or China's claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea.

India has also long sought a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council but has received only tepid back from China and Russia, possibly to prevent their influence with the West from being diluted. Still, New Delhi stands to lose little as long as Washington continues to broadcast uncertainty with its foreign trade.

Opinion: Trump is putting the screws to India over Russian oil imports, creating an opportunity for Canadian energy

India has said it will not sign a joint statement with the SCO because it sees a pro-Pakistan stance in the omission of a mention of a deadly April 22 terror attack on tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Yet expectations have not been high for India to sign.

Beijing has given few hints of what solid progress it expects from the summit, which is in keeping with the secretive nature of its diplomacy and politics.

The official Xinhua News Agency on Monday called the gathering the “largest-ever SCO summit in history” and said it would be used for “charting the blueprint for the bloc's next decade of development.”

The leaders of about a dozen other countries are joining the summit as SCO dialogue partners or guests, including Egypt, Nepal and several Southeast Asian nations.

Xinhua spoke of the organization being guided by the “Shanghai Spirit, which features mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development.”

Citing growing trade and rail freight between China and other members, observer states and dialogue partners, Beijing seems eager to emphasize the bloc's economic benefits.

Xinhua noted documents would be signed including a notice of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which the ruling Communist Party will mark with a military parade in central Beijing on Sept. 3.

University of Chicago political scientist Dali Yang said the SCO is one of the most prominent regional organizations China has cofounded.

“For China's leadership, there is a lot of emphasis on maintaining existing relations in the international arena even though the SCO has not been effective in dealing with the major challenges of today,” Yang said.

The summit comes just days before a massive military parade through Beijing marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender at the end of WWII attended by Xi and other leaders, including a rare showing by North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Yang said.

The SCO seems to show a desire to move from a dialogue platform to a “full-fledged mechanism of practical cooperation that brings tangible results to the citizens of the member states,” said June Teufel Dreyer, a University of Miami expert on Chinese politics. Yet the questions remain, ”to what end and how?”

For Xi, “presiding over the gathering in Tianjin should net him some favorable publicity and possibly further his image as leader of a new global world order,” Dreyer said.

            A flotilla of ships departed from Barcelona to the Gaza Strip Sunday with humanitarian aid and activists on board in the largest attempt yet to break the long Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory by sea.
    


            This comes as Israel has stepped up its offensive on Gaza City, limiting the deliveries of food and basic supplies in the north of the Palestinian territory. Food experts warned earlier this month that the city was in famine and that half a million people across the strip were facing catastrophic levels of hunger.
    


            The Global Sumud Flotilla is carrying food, water and medicine. Activists on board demanded safe passage to deliver the much-needed aid and the opening of a humanitarian sea corridor, according to a statement. The almost 23-month war has killed more than 63,000 people, with at least 332 Palestinians dying of malnutrition, including 124 children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.
    


            The maritime convoy of about 20 boats and delegations from 44 countries is claimed to be the largest attempt to date to break the Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip by sea, which has now lasted 18 years. They will be joined by more ships from ports in Italy and Tunisia in the coming days, on the route from the western end of the Mediterranean to the Gaza Strip, organizers said.
    


            Thousands of supporters flocked to the Barcelona pier, some of them wearing kaffiyehs and chanting “Free Palestine!” and “Boycott Israel!” to send off a wide variety of boats, flying Palestinian flags, from rundown old luxury yachts to tiny wooden sailboats and industrial-looking vessels. One of them, the Sirus, is more than 100 years old.
    


            Around 70 boats are expected to take part in the final leg of the journey, flotilla spokesperson Saif Abukeshek told Spanish public television after the departure. The fleet could reach Gaza around Sept. 14 or 15, he added.
    


            “The story here is about Palestine. The story here is how people are being deliberately deprived of the very basic means to survive,” said Swedish activist Greta Thunberg at a news conference. She is one of the most recognizable figures on the expedition, formed by hundreds of activists, politicians such as the former mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, and journalists.
    


            Ships carrying tons of humanitarian aid departed from the Italian city of Genoa and will join the expedition in the coming days.
    


            It is not the first time Thunberg has attempted to reach Gaza waters this year. She was deported by Israel in June when the ship she was traveling on with 11 other people, the Madleen, was stopped by the Israeli military.

            “It has been very clear that Israel has been continuously violating international law by either attacking, unlawfully intercepting the boats in international waters, and continuously preventing the humanitarian aid from coming in,” said Thunberg in an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday.
    


            The Global Sumud Flotilla will be the fourth attempt to break the maritime blockade so far this year. The Conscience first tried in May, but was attacked by drones after setting sail from Malta. After the Madleen, the Israeli military stopped another aid ship, the Handala, in late July, detained 21 international activists and reporters and seized its cargo, including baby formula, food and medicine, according to the Freedom Flotilla Coalition.
    


            In a news conference before the departure in Barcelona, actor Liam Cunningham played a video showing a girl singing while planning her own funeral. The girl, Fatima, died four days ago, he said.
    


            “What sort of world have we slid into where children are making their own funeral arrangements?” Cunningham told reporters.
    


            An Israeli official said Saturday that the country will soon halt or slow humanitarian aid into parts of northern Gaza, as it expands its military offensive against Hamas, a day after the city was declared a combat zone.
    


            The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when an attack by Hamas militants inside Israel claimed the lives of 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 people hostage.

1:00 JST, September 1, 2025

ALEXANDRIA, Egypt — About 7,500 buildings are at risk of collapse in Alexandria, Egypt, a city that has seen many such disasters.

About 30% of all collapsed buildings in Egypt from 2014 to 2020 were in Alexandria, which faces the Mediterranean Sea.

Scientists are pointing out a possible cause for the collapses: higher sea levels caused by global warming.

With a population of about 5.6 million, Alexandria is the second largest city in Egypt. The city has been dubbed the Pearl of the Mediterranean due to the blue sea and historic townscape that make up its breathtaking scenery.

In late July, debris from building collapses was seen scattered throughout a residential area near the seashore. Naglaa Abdelnabi, 36, and her family members were doing household chores under a canvas tarp being used as a roof in the ruins of a collapsed apartment in the Al-Raml district. Her family had lived in the apartment for 25 years.

She came back from an outing one day to find the building had disappeared. As the family could not afford to move into another house, Abdelnabi lived on streets before eventually returning to the ruins where the apartment used to be.

“I also lost my possessions, and there's nothing I can do,” she said.

On the opposite side of Alexandria Port, a leaning eight-story condominium looked as if it was relying on a neighboring high-rise building to stand. According to residents on the top floor of the about 50-year-old condominium, water erupted from the ground when construction began on the neighboring high-rise about 10 years ago, and the condominium started to lean. Cracks began forming in the pillars and walls a few months ago, and residents, fearing the building may come down, have no choice but to consider moving.

About 1,000 buildings collapsed or partly collapsed in Egypt from 2014 to 2020, killing more than 480 people, according to data compiled by Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism. In Alexandria, 287 buildings collapsed, the highest of any city in the country and nearly double the number in Cairo, which recorded the second highest number.

An average of two building collapses occurred each year along Alexandria's seashores from 2001 to 2009, according to a report by a study group that included U.S. university researchers carried in a science journal in February this year. The number has been rising rapidly since around 2011, reaching 22 collapses each year from 2010 to 2021.

A combination of factors such as aging buildings and maintenance issues was once considered to be the cause of Egypt's building collapses. However, a new assumption has surfaced: Alexandria's conspicuously high number might be due to higher sea levels.

The report published in February explains that Alexandria's seashores have eroded about 3.6 meters on average annually over the past 20 years. It points out that encroaching sea water alongside changes in underground water levels have caused the ground to sink and buildings to collapse.

The Egyptian government is viewing the situation with a rising sense of crisis. It has constructed coastal levees and scheduled demolitions for about 7,500 buildings in Alexandria that are at risk of collapsing, among other measures. Additionally, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who inspected some sites in mid-July, announced a plan to build 55,000 alternate housing units.

The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) announced in March that the world's average temperature and the rate of sea level rise each hit a record high in 2024. The rise in sea level doubled from 2.1 millimeters annually between 1993 and 2002 to 4.7 millimeters between 2014 and 2024.

The WMO urged that swift countermeasures are needed to cope with global warming, warning that higher sea levels have damaged ecosystems and infrastructures in coastal areas.

Other countries, including Tunisia, Italy and the United States, have also confirmed that buildings have been damaged mainly due to shore erosion. Taking countermeasures on an international scale has therefore become an urgent task.

For decades, police, medical examiners, and coroners have used the term used to cover up killings in police custody.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Anton Black was 19 years old when police officers chased him, shackled him, and left him face-down on the ground, struggling to breathe. He died from asphyxiation. Despite tireless objections from his family, the Maryland Medical Examiner called his death an accident.

Until now. After Maryland's former head medical examiner testified in 2021 that Derek Chauvin was not responsible for George Floyd's death, concerns arose that his pro-law enforcement bias may have affected his office's decisions during his seventeen-year tenure. The resulting independent audit released in May 2025 revealed Mr. Black is not alone — almost forty additional in-custody deaths that had been deemed accidental or undetermined should have been categorized as homicides.

Anton Black was a Black man, a demographic more likely to face police violence. And he had a mental disability — severe bipolar disorder  — which, also, made him more likely to experience police violence. But officers at the scene of his death claimed he exhibited “superhuman strength” to justify their use of extreme violence against him. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“Superhuman strength” is an apparent reference to the now debunked “excited delirium.” For too long, excited delirium has been a tool in the back pockets of police, medical examiners, and coroners used to cover up killings in police custody, leaving families without answers — or justice. Maryland's audit is a good start at righting this wrong, but a national reckoning is needed.

That's because this is not just a Maryland problem. Excited delirium was cited by police and other officials in the widely known police-perpetrated killings of George Floyd and Elijah McClain. But it is a pseudoscientific concept that no national medical organization recognizes, and which the Maryland Medical Examiner is no longer permitted to use. It's nevertheless still a part of policing across the country (including in Maryland where excited delirium remains part of law enforcement training materials). Sometimes linking excited delirium to drug use or mental illness, proponents of its validity have for years argued that it causes an array of amorphous “symptoms,” including extreme violence and aggression; superhuman strength; imperviousness to pain; unresponsiveness to police; hallucinations, paranoia, or fear; and notably, sometimes sudden death.

Miami coroner Charles Wetli and psychiatrist David Fishbain created the concept of excited delirium in 1985 to explain the deaths of seven recreational drug users, five of whom died in police custody. Though the authors themselves acknowledged their article was largely speculative, they continued to promote the concept.

In the 1980s, Wetli attempted to explain the deaths of thirty-two Black women found dead in Miami with excited delirium. It turned out the women had been murdered — many of them showed clear signs of strangulation. Wetli nevertheless persisted for decades in suggesting at least some of the women died of excited delirium. But the medical evidence never supported his claims.

Modern-day proponents of this pseudoscience remain a small community of “experts” steeped in pro-law-enforcement bias who have engaged in what appears to be an ideologically-driven promotion of excited delirium. They have successfully convinced law enforcement agencies, medical examiners, and coroners (who often have no medical training and are sometimes just the local prosecutor or sheriff) across the country that excited delirium is real.

Excited delirium is not merely a discredited pseudoscience that law enforcement continues to accept. Its vague symptoms give officers the latitude to “diagnose” any number of people with excited delirium. They serve to transform normal responses to fear and distress into “symptoms” of a “disease” that purports to cause hyper-dangerousness and threaten the lives of police officers. It is then used to justify using more violence against people in distress and serves as a cause of death if they die afterwards. It's a veritable multitool. And, these “symptoms” mirror stereotypes of Black people (especially Black men) and persons with disabilities, putting them even more at risk of police violence.

Since its invention, excited delirium's prevalence in the law enforcement community has never waned. In 2015, Natasha McKenna, a 130-pound Black woman, was incarcerated in Fairfax County, Virginia, when her mental health started deteriorating. During a time of psychiatric crisis, six deputies repeatedly stun gunned Ms. McKenna — who was naked and already handcuffed — causing cardiac arrest. The deputies later claimed Ms. McKenna exhibited “super-human” or “demonic” strength, but video of the incident does not support those fantastical claims. The medical examiner, again, claimed excited delirium was the culprit.

Excited delirium allows law enforcement's use of extreme force to go unchecked and unexamined. As a post hoc explanation, it serves to justify uses of extreme violence against and — and even the killing of — people in crisis, especially people with disabilities, and particularly those of color. What happened with the Maryland audit, pointing to dozens of lost lives erroneously explained away, should be the canary in the coal mine for jurisdictions throughout the country who still use excited delirium.

A few jurisdictions have banned use of the term excited delirium — and New York is currently considering a bill that would prohibit public officials from referencing the syndrome in trainings, policies, procedures, death certificates, and autopsy reports. But simply banning the term does not remove excited delirium's influence. The racist and ableist underpinnings of the term and the unexamined ease with which law enforcement adopted it, suggest the need for deeper structural changes.

            The Israeli security cabinet convened on Sunday to review plans for seizing control of Gaza City, as the government faces mounting international pressure and unprecedented domestic opposition, even from Israel's own security leaders.
    


            The review is merely a formal update for the full security cabinet, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz already approved the IDF's plans earlier this month. But it comes as Israel faces a crucial few weeks at home and abroad.
    


            Alongside the planned military escalation, Netanyahu and the cabinet – made up of senior officials including Katz and far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir - are expected to discuss a diplomatic offensive in response to the anticipated wave of recognition for Palestinian statehood at next month's UN General Assembly.



            Netanyahu is considering measures ranging from full annexation of the West Bank, to partial annexation of selected settlements, to sanctioning the Palestinian Authority, according to two Israeli officials.
    


            Annexing any part of the occupied West Bank by applying Israeli sovereignty would violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions and spark an enormous diplomatic backlash. But it's exactly what Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners are demanding.
    


            As it considers what steps to take in the West Bank, the Israeli government is pushing forward with the military assault on Gaza City despite growing pressue to pursue a diplomatic route would end the nearly two-year war.
    


            The Israeli military carried out intense strikes in and around Gaza City in recent days as it prepares to take over and occupy the city itself.
    


            At least 47 people were killed in Gaza City alone on Saturday, according to Gaza hospital figures. An additional 24 people were killed in Gaza City since Sunday morning, figures showed.
    


            Hamas continues to have a presence in Gaza despite nearly two years of fighting and  one of the latest Israel attacks killed Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida, Katz said.
    


            “Soon, as the campaign in Gaza intensifies, many more of his partners in crime - the murderers and rapists of Hamas - will join him there,” he added.
    


            Hamas did not immediately comment on Israel's claim that Abu Obaida had been killed.
    


            The attacks also come amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in the battered enclave, as the Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday that another seven people died of malnutrition, bringing the total deaths from malnutrition to 339.
    


            The most significant opposition to Israel's takeover of Gaza City is the country's security establishment, led by IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir, who has warned Netanyahu and his cabinet that the Gaza City offensive will endanger the remaining hostages, risk soldiers' lives, and deepen the humanitarian crisis in the enclave.
    


            Two Israeli sources told CNN that Zamir's main concern and focus is the fate of the hostages, and he is expected to urge the cabinet to discuss negotiations on the latest ceasefire proposal before escalating the war. The sources said this position is endorsed by most of the heads of other security agencies, as well.
    


            Earlier this month Hamas accepted the Qatari and Egyptian mediators most recent offer for a 60-day temporary ceasefire, during which 10 of the living hostages would be returned in exchange for a mass release of Palestinian prisoners. The offer is based on a similar proposal presented by the US special envoy Steve Witkoff in July, originally crafted in coordination with Israel.

            However, Netanyahu, in coordination with the White House, has recently shifted strategy. After months of insisting on negotiating only phased and partial frameworks, he now says he is willing to discuss only a comprehensive deal that would release all of the hostages and end the war on Israeli terms and conditions.
    


            As a result, Israel still hasn't responded to Hamas's acceptance of the Qatari-Egyptian proposal on August 18.
    


            According to two senior Israeli officials, Netanyahu does not intend to raise the negotiations in Sunday's cabinet meeting as well, though the issue may come up during the presentation on Gaza City. The fact that the deal isn't formally on the agenda indicates how low the proposal is on Netanyahu's priority list.

NEW YORK (AP) — So much has happened for Naomi Osaka — in tennis, away from tennis — since she first played Coco Gauff at the U.S. Open back in 2019.

Over that time, Osaka has won two Grand Slam trophies to raise her career total to four, helped spark a global conversation about mental health by revealing she felt anxiety and depression, taken a series of breaks from the tour and become a mother.

The Gauff vs. Osaka matchup in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows on Monday serves as both a reminder — to them, to others — of that night six years ago, as well as all that's transpired since.

“Just to be at this point of my life and to be playing her again,” Osaka said, “is, honestly, for me ... kind of special.”

Osaka was 21 and the reigning champion at the U.S. Open and Australian Open; Gauff was 15 and playing in only her second Grand Slam tournament and first in New York. Osaka won in straight sets in Arthur Ashe Stadium, but what was most memorable was what happened after the last point.

Gauff was crying, and Osaka walked over to console her and suggest that she address the crowd — highly unusual for the loser of a match. But Osaka knew the fans would want to hear from the young American who already was showing signs of becoming the star she is today.

“I remember it was a tough moment for me, because it was a hyped-up match. I remember looking back at it. I guess I put way too much pressure on myself thinking I maybe had a chance in that moment to actually do something, which I definitely did,” Gauff said Saturday, “but I think it was just I felt more expectation that I should, than maybe belief.”




Osaka recalls recognizing how much talent and poise Gauff possessed for such a young player.

“I thought she just handled herself really well,” said Osaka, who is seeded 23rd at Flushing Meadows and recently began working with Iga Swiatek's former coach, Tomasz Wiktorowski, “and I knew she was going to be back there.”

After winning the U.S. Open again in 2020, Osaka triumphed at the Australian Open in January 2021. At the next Grand Slam tournament, she pulled out before her second-round match and explained the off-court struggles she had been dealing with, then took the first of a handful of mental health breaks.

The Australian Open, 4 1/2 years ago, was the last major where Osaka made it to the fourth round until now. She was off the tour for part of that stretch while on maternity leave.

On Saturday, she spoke about “the journey getting back here.” 

“I just feel happy,” said Osaka, 27, “because I feel like all of my hard work is amounting to something.”

Gauff, now 21, won the U.S. Open in 2023 and the French Open this June and is seeded No. 3 in New York while working with a biomechanics expert to retool her problematic serve.

“Naomi and I, we aren't super close or anything, but we're definitely friendly with each other. I support her from afar in all the things that she's done on and off the court,” Gauff said.

“It would be a cool kind of deja vu-type of situation,” she said, guessing that this rematch will be in Ashe, too, “but hopefully it will be a different result.”

House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requesting the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) regarding Jeffrey Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell.

Comer sent the letter on Sunday, saying his committee is ""reviewing the possible mismanagement"" of the federal government's investigation of Epstein and Maxwell, including Epstein's death.

The letter set a deadline of Sept. 15 for the Treasury to produce relevant SARs.

""It is essential that Treasury produce to the Committee certain SARs to assist the Committee's oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell,"" the letter states.

Fox News Digital reached out to the Treasury Department for comment on the letter but did not immediately hear back.

Earlier this year, Comer established the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, which requested that the Department of Justice release all Epstein-related records. The DOJ began handing over records to the committee on Aug. 22.

Comer has also issued deposition subpoenas to several former government officials, including former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Other figures also compelled to appear were former FBI Director Robert Mueller, former FBI Director James Comey and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

Mueller was set to appear before the House Oversight panel on Tuesday as part of the probe, though a source familiar with the investigation told Fox News Digital that lawmakers ""learned that Mr. Mueller has health issues that preclude him from being able to testify."" 

""The committee intends to withdraw its subpoena,"" the source said.

Mueller would have been the second witness to appear in-person before the committee after former Attorney General Bill Barr did so last month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","The Enemy That Hegseth and Trump Insist on Honoring","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/hegseth-confederate-reconciliation-monument-restored-military/684066/","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The U.S. won the Civil War. So why is the administration so keen on the Confederate side?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced earlier this month that he would return a Confederate memorial to Arlington National Cemetery, he blamed “woke lemmings” for it having been taken down. Created by the sculptor Moses Ezekiel, the statue in question, which Hegseth described as “beautiful and historic,” features sentimental images of Confederate soldiers and loyal Black slaves. It was first installed in the cemetery in 1914 and was removed in late 2023, as part of the Biden administration's larger effort to remove memorials that glorified the Confederate cause and to rechristen bases whose names lionized traitors to the United States. The war against the Confederacy killed more than 300,000 members of the military that Hegseth leads—a grim fact that the defense secretary trivializes in his efforts to score political points against the left.

Hegseth's move is one of several by the Trump administration to bring Confederate commemorations back. On Thursday, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon is returning a portrait of Robert E. Lee to West Point. The Pentagon has reinstated old base names—in defiance of a law, enacted in 2021 over Donald Trump's veto, that required their removal—by identifying honorable but previously obscure veterans who share a surname with rebel generals such as Lee and George Pickett. A statue of the Confederate general Albert Pike, pulled down during the 2020 George Floyd protests, is being reinstalled in Washington, D.C., by the National Park Service.

Clint Smith: Arlington's Civil War legacy is finally laid to rest

“Unlike the left, we don't believe in erasing American history—we honor it,” Hegseth said after announcing the return of the Ezekiel sculpture. That claim is hard to square with Trump's recent complaint on Truth Social that the Smithsonian Institution is “OUT OF CONTROL” because of its museums' focus on “how bad Slavery was.”

At best, Hegseth is going out of his way to needle and mock Americans who rightly see the Confederacy for what it was—a treasonous, doomed effort to keep millions of Americans in bondage. At worst, he and the Trump administration are making common cause with apologists who believe that the wrong side won the Civil War. Many people who refuse to repudiate even Confederate leaders claim they are merely honoring battlefield sacrifices of common soldiers. Americans should reject this sophistry.

My family has a tradition of military service. When I was a U.S. Army artillery officer during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, I thought about my immigrant grandfather, who had been an artilleryman during World War II. Despite my love and admiration for him, I sometimes found him scary when I was a child—he had a quick temper and a thick Sicilian accent that I often struggled to parse. Once I'd seen combat, I felt proud to have shared an experience with him and wrote to him to discuss it. That he died before my letter reached him in Los Angeles is one of my great regrets in life.

But my reverence for my grandfather didn't change an important fact about his service: He had fought in Mussolini's army. He and his comrades had tried to repel the American invasion of Sicily—the combat debut of the 82nd Airborne Division, the very unit in which I served as it moved toward Baghdad six decades later. Fortunately, my grandfather lost.

Many Americans have ancestors who took up for bad causes. My children are descendants, on their maternal side, of two great-grandfathers who fought in Normandy on D-Day. One landed on Utah Beach. The other was already present as a soldier in the German army. I hope my kids never feel obliged to make excuses for the latter's cause.

Clint Smith: Actually, slavery was very bad

As a military brat, I lived in Germany at a time when many people vividly remembered the war years. On weekends, my family and I used to hike through Bavarian fields that abutted small graveyards, where fresh flowers lay alongside crosses holding the pictures of young Wehrmacht soldiers. These families were mourning their sons, brothers, and fathers without glorifying Hitler or National Socialism.

Americans can similarly pay proper respect to military sacrifice while rejecting Confederate nostalgia. In small-town public squares across the South—a region in which I have spent much of my adult life—I have seen countless statues and monuments dedicated to local residents who did not return from the Civil War. Many of these solemnly recount the names of the dead without rhapsodizing about the Confederate cause.

Like many institutions, the Virginia Military Institute, my undergraduate alma mater, has struggled to balance the two impulses. The school was deeply enmeshed in the Confederate cause. In its graduation rituals every May, the school commemorates cadets who died for the Confederacy at the 1864 Battle of New Market. It also holds a huge commissioning ceremony to honor the newest officers from VMI, who are entering the Army those cadets were fighting.

The New Market commemoration includes the placement of wreaths on the graves of six VMI cadets who died. Looming over those graves is a statue called Virginia Mourning Her Dead, also by Ezekiel, the creator of the Arlington memorial. Before becoming a sculptor, Ezekiel was the first Jewish person to attend VMI, and he saw combat at New Market. One of his closest friends, a 17-year-old named Thomas G. Jefferson, was among the 10 cadets who died in the battle.

When I attended the school, a second Ezekiel statue stood on campus. It featured the Confederate general Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, who had taught at VMI before the war. In 2021, VMI took down this statue and later relocated it to the New Market battlefield museum. The institute wasn't erasing history; it was recognizing that an institution that educates officers for the U.S. military should not revere generals who helped lead wars against it. The school left in place the monument to the dead cadets, who, like their counterparts in countless other armies, were average teenagers, whipped up in the pursuit of adventure and eager to prove their manhood.

The Ezekiel work now set to be returned to Arlington—likely sometime in 2027, after a refurbishment—goes far beyond commemorating dead soldiers. It bears a Latin inscription that translates as “The victorious cause was pleasing to the gods, but the lost cause pleased Cato.” This quotation, from the poet Lucan, is widely interpreted as an observation that righteous efforts sometimes fail. But nothing was righteous about the rebellion against the United States, and paeans to it do not belong in a U.S. military cemetery.

I loved my grandfather who served in Mussolini's army, and I am proud of my alma mater. But I am also proud to have held a commission in the Army that defeated them both.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

When Amy Morin was 26, her husband of five years died suddenly of a heart attack.

They'd started building a life together, including buying a house and becoming foster parents. So ""when he died, all of the lifelong dreams I had with him died, too,"" says the now 46-year-old psychotherapist and author.

Morin didn't think she'd get married again. ""I found love once,"" she says she thought, and that was it.

But a few years later, she started dating her now husband, Steve Hasty. The two had met online in high school and reconnected when she needed a date to a wedding. They ended up getting married when she was 30.

These days, her relationship with Hasty is the most monumental in her life, she says. ""He's my biggest cheerleader,"" she says. He gives her honest feedback and supports her in her life decisions, big and small.

Plus, Hasty dared Morin to dream big and reinvent herself. He's one reason she's now a full-time author and speaker, and the reason the two live full-time on a boat off the Florida Keys.

Throughout her 20s, Morin had a pretty typical life.

She had a 9-to-5 job as a therapist that felt ""safe and comfortable,"" she says. She started freelance writing about marriage, travel and technology to ensure she made enough to cover her mortgage alone. And that's what she thought her life would look like going forward.

But when she met Hasty, she learned ""he had hopes and dreams of living on a sailboat,"" she says. So she started asking herself, ""What might that look like?"" Was it something she wanted to do? Could she dive into writing full-time if they made the move?

In 2012, an article Morin wrote went viral, which led to a bestselling book, ""13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do."" With more writing opportunities coming her way and Hasty's support, she decided to take the plunge into full-time writing and speaking, and the two moved onto their sailboat.

Her relationship with Hasty offers meaningful companionship. But it also introduced her to a life she never imagined for herself and ""just opened up new possibilities,"" she says.

Ethereum is on a roll, and it seems like it's going to keep rolling. Major players are predicting a 100x appreciation, and the catalyst? Unprecedented institutional adoption. This isn't just a bump; it's a seismic shift in the cryptocurrency payments landscape. But with opportunities come challenges, so let's dive into what's driving this growth and what institutional investors can do to stay ahead.

Joseph Lubin, one of the masterminds behind Ethereum, claims that the asset's growth is directly tied to Wall Street's growing interest. Big names like JPMorgan and BlackRock are piling into Ethereum, hinting that decentralized finance (DeFi) is becoming less of a fringe concept and more of a mainstream financial tool. This isn't just good for liquidity—it's a signal that Ethereum is maturing as a financial cornerstone.

With more institutions throwing their weight behind Ethereum, we might see a surge in staking and participation in DeFi protocols. They could also be the driving force behind innovations like decentralized payroll tools and crypto payment platforms, setting Ethereum up as a major player in the finance world.

Of course, this growth won't come without its hurdles. More corporate involvement often means more scrutiny. Regulatory bodies are likely to keep a close eye on how Ethereum is being used, and compliance will remain a hot topic. The legal status of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies has always been murky and that's a huge turn-off for institutional investors who need a clear path forward.

Regulatory challenges could slow down Ethereum's ascent. The evolving landscape, especially with new SEC regulations in the U.S., could complicate how institutions engage with Ethereum and DeFi. Compliance isn't optional; it's essential if they want to avoid a regulatory headache.

Ethereum is generally more volatile than Bitcoin. We're talking about daily price movements that can exceed Bitcoin's by around 10%. For institutional investors, that means more potential for gains, but also more risk.

To balance the volatility, many institutions opt for a mix of Bitcoin and Ethereum in their portfolios, taking advantage of both assets' unique traits. They can hedge their bets while keeping an eye on Ethereum's potential, especially as it gains traction in institutional circles.

So how should institutional investors approach this complex world of Ethereum? Here are a few strategies to keep in mind:

Diversification: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Consider spreading your investments into stablecoins and other crypto assets to cushion against Ethereum's volatility.

Stablecoin Reserves: Keeping a chunk of treasury in stablecoins is a smart move, especially when Ethereum prices drop. It allows for quick capital deployment when the right opportunity shows up.

Risk Management: Build solid financial forecasting models and conduct regular risk assessments to manage exposure and avoid budget shortfalls from sudden price changes.

Compliance Focus: Being ready for regulatory changes isn't just smart; it's necessary. Building trust through compliance will save a lot of headaches down the road.

Partnerships and Innovation: Investing in blockchain infrastructure projects or partnering with them can address long-term challenges and help set institutions apart in a crowded market.

As Ethereum grows, it's going to change the financial landscape in some significant ways. The merging of traditional and decentralized finance is both exciting and fraught with challenges. With the right strategies and a focus on compliance, institutional investors can not only survive but thrive in this ever-evolving market.

Decoding blockchain innovations and market trends with clarity and precision.

- Pyth Network partners with U.S. Department of Commerce to publish GDP/PCE data on-chain via Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, marking first U.S. government blockchain data distribution.

- Collaboration with Chainlink expands data to 100+ blockchains, enhancing transparency while 70% PYTH token price surge reflects institutional/retail confidence post-announcement.

- Technical upgrades like Entropy V2 and xStocks RFQ system drive DeFi-TradFi integration, with Q1 2025 TTV hitting $149.1B (376.6% YoY growth) despite quarterly dip.

- Analysts project $0.30 price target as 24.1M PYTH whale accumulation and exchange outflows mirror Solana's bullish patterns, aligning with Trump-era crypto-friendly policies.

The Pyth Network (PYTH) has emerged as a standout in the blockchain space, driven by a confluence of strategic institutional validation and robust technical momentum. At the heart of its ascent is a historic partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce to publish GDP, PCE Price Index, and other macroeconomic data on-chain via blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana [1]. This collaboration marks the first time a U.S. government agency has leveraged blockchain to distribute official economic data, a move that aligns with the Trump administration's broader agenda to position the U.S. as the “blockchain capital of the world” [2].  

The U.S. government's endorsement of Pyth is not just symbolic—it's a structural shift in how data is verified and consumed. By using Pyth's pull oracle model, the Department of Commerce ensures cryptographic immutability and real-time accessibility of economic data, enabling smart contracts to replace traditional paper-based agreements [3]. This partnership has already spurred a 70% surge in PYTH's token price within 24 hours of the announcement, signaling institutional and retail confidence in the network's credibility [4].  

Moreover, Pyth's collaboration with Chainlink amplifies its institutional appeal. Together, they are distributing U.S. economic data across 100+ blockchains, creating a decentralized infrastructure that enhances transparency and accountability in public information systems [5]. This dual-validation approach—backed by both government and industry leaders—positions Pyth as a critical node in the blockchain-driven data ecosystem.  

Pyth's technical advancements further solidify its investment thesis. The launch of Entropy V2 in July 2025 introduced customizable gas limits and error handling, streamlining on-chain randomness for developers [6]. Meanwhile, the xStocks RFQ system minimizes slippage for tokenized equities by sourcing direct price quotes from market makers, a feature that bridges traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) [7].  

The network's Total Transaction Value (TTV) reached $149.1 billion in Q1 2025, a 376.6% year-over-year increase, despite a 14.9% quarterly dip [8]. This growth is underpinned by Pyth's expanding dataset, which now includes 85 Hong Kong-listed stocks and plans to integrate employment and inflation metrics [9]. Analysts project PYTH's price could reach $0.30 as institutional adoption accelerates, with key resistance levels at $0.2653 and $0.3665 [10].  

The U.S. government's adoption of Pyth reflects a broader shift toward blockchain as a tool for public accountability. By making economic data tamper-proof and accessible, Pyth addresses long-standing concerns about the trustworthiness of traditional statistics [11]. For investors, this represents a unique opportunity to capitalize on a network that is not only solving real-world problems but also aligning with macroeconomic tailwinds.  

Whale accumulation of 24.1 million PYTH and a 77.2 million PYTH outflow from exchanges further reinforce a bullish on-chain narrative, mirroring patterns seen in high-growth assets like Solana [12]. With the Trump administration's pro-crypto policies and Pyth's technical edge, the network is poised to dominate the onchain data infrastructure space.  

Pyth Network's partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce is more than a headline—it's a catalyst for institutional-grade blockchain adoption. By combining government validation with cutting-edge technical execution, Pyth is building a moat around its role as a trusted oracle for economic data. For investors seeking exposure to the next phase of blockchain innovation, Pyth offers a compelling case of strategic alignment, technical superiority, and market momentum.

Dogecoin fell 5% in the 24-hour period from Aug. 28 at 09:00 to Aug. 29 at 08:00, tracking broader risk-asset weakness, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model.

Between Aug. 24–25, an unknown whale shifted 900 million DOGE (~$200 million) to Binance wallets, fueling concerns of distribution and triggering market volatility, the model showed.

Open interest in DOGE futures slipped 8% after the inflows, reflecting lighter speculative positioning. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows whales continue to build exposure, with 680 million DOGE accumulated in August, signaling institutional demand despite retail selling.

However, Dogecoin's network fundamentals remain firm, with hashrate climbing above 2.9 petahashes per second, underscoring mining security at record levels.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists stunned as strange islands and hidden springs appear in the Great Salt Lake","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250831010526.htm","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 11:03:45 GMT","

 As Great Salt Lake's levels continue to sag, yet another strange phenomenon has surfaced, offering Utah scientists more opportunities to plumb the vast saline lake's secrets.

Phragmites-covered mounds in recent years have appeared on the drying playa off the lake's southeast shore. After several years of scratching their heads, University of Utah geoscientists, deploying a network of piezometers and aerial electromagnetic surveys, are now finding out what's going on under the lakebed that is creating these reed-choked oases.

Bill Johnson, a professor in the Department of Geology & Geophysics, suspects the circular mounds have formed at spots where a subsurface plumbing system delivers fresh groundwater under pressure into the lake and its surrounding wetlands.

""Water in the lake has spent a significant time underground on its way to the lake. But where that happened, we don't know,"" said Johnson during a recent visit to one of the mounds, a research site known as Round Spot 9. ""Did that happen somewhere in the uplands where the water spent time in the ground and emerged in the stream before going to the lake? Or was it transmitted directly to the lake?""

On this day, Johnson and graduate student Ebenezer Adomako-Mensah were checking piezometers they had installed there last year to record underground water pressures at various depths and locations around the island.

Mapping the lakebed' subsurface

In February 2025, Johnson hired a Canadian firm, Expert Geophysics, to conduct airborne electromagnetic surveys over Farmington Bay using a circular device hanging under a helicopter. The pilot flew a grid pattern over the bay, collecting data that will help locate freshwater deposits lurking under the lakebed.

The equipment generates current in the loop, which transmits a frequency deep into the lakebed below. A receiver suspended in a ball at the center of the hoop records the electromagnetic signals bouncing back.

""It'll give you a spectrum, basically, of magnetic fields, and we'll use that data to create a 3D image of what's under the Earth,"" said Jeff Sanderson, a crew leader with Expert Geophysics.

As low lake levels persist, the lakebed will increasingly serve as a source of wind-blown dust affecting Utah's population centers. Ongoing research by U atmospheric scientists suggests that the disturbed lakebed crusts that keep sediments in place can be regenerated when they are submerged.

One goal of Johnson's research is to determine whether the groundwater can be tapped to restore broken lakebed crusts, thereby reducing dust pollution.

""It looks like it's a from a water resource that could be useful in the future, but we need to understand it and not overexploit it to the detriment of the wetlands,"" said Johnson, who has served on the Great Salt Lake Strike Team, the university-state agency partnership exploring ways to reverse the lake's decline.

Armed with new data, Johnson secured preliminary funding from the Utah Department of Natural Resources to investigate to characterize this underground water resource. The research team, which includes other senior geology faculty, including Kip Solomon, Mike Thorne and Michael Zhdanov, is seeking to discover the breadth and depth of the freshwater under the lake.

For example, Solomon's lab is using isotope analysis to determine the age of the groundwater and its recharge elevation, or where it originated in the mountains. Thorne is constructing on-ground resistivity profiles. And Zhdanov and Michael Jorgensen are processing the electromagnetic data gathered in the airborne geophysical surveys to construct a 3D image of the subsurface beneath the lake.

""We hope to map out the boundary between fresh water and salt water, and find the location of freshwater springs that are discharging groundwater into the lake,"" said Solomon, who is scheduled to present preliminary findings recently at the Geochemical Society's 2025 Goldschmidt conference in the Czech Republic.

For Johnson, the groundwater mystery began several years ago when he was traveling Great Salt Lake's North Arm by airboat and observed something strange. Water and gas were roiling the surface in a circle about twice the size of the airboat, suggesting that groundwater was rushing under pressure into the lake at that spot.

Johnson dropped a 30-foot depth gauge into the swirl, but it failed to hit the bottom of the shallow lake.

""I always wondered what the heck that was, because it seemed like groundwater was coming to the system at a huge rate,"" he said. Later on, he and others noticed mounds appearing on Google Earth images of the Farmington Bay playa.

Where does the groundwater come from?

Previously, it was believed that direct groundwater discharge accounts for just 3% of the lake's water budget, but recently gathered data using chemical mass balance methods indicate it may be as much as 12% and new insights are emerging.

For starters, Johnson's team has found that fresh water at depth in several spots far offshore.

""We didn't expect that. We expected that fresh water would be coming into the system at the periphery, farther away from the lake,"" he said, ""and yet there it is, all the way underneath the causeway in Farmington Bay.""

Johnson's team has located freshwater almost everywhere they looked in tight sediments 30 feet below the surface. The new geophysical data indicate these sediments are up to 10,000 feet deep.

""We don't know if it's freshwater that deep, but it is certainly going to be fresh a long way down, and it could be fresh all the way down,"" Johnson said. ""The last thing I want to do is get this hyped as a water resource, but it's very clear, and it's under pressure. And in my mind, it could help mitigate any dust generation on the exposed playa.""

The focus of Johnson's research homes in on one of at least 18 mounds detected off the lake's southeast shore, most of them choked with thickets of phragmites, the water-hogging invasive reed cluttering the lakeshore.

A vast underground plumbing system

On Round Spot 9 in Farmington Bay, Johnson's team has installed three sets of four piezometers at various distances from the edge of the 250-foot-diameter island. The four instruments are placed at varying depths, 7, 11, 30 and 60 feet, connected to the surface via white PVC pipes.

Accompanied by grad students like Adomako-Mensah, Johnson has regularly visited the site this year by mountain bike or airboat to recover data that is already telling an interesting story.

Near-surface water is the purest measured at the center of the mound and gets progressively more saline as you move closer to the edge, while deep water is fresh at all locations. In other words, the groundwater is not reaching the surface on the periphery of the island, but mostly at the center. Why?

""Those show that the fresh water in the center is pressured the deeper you go; the more hydraulic head it has. It really wants to come up,"" Johnson said. ""And that's true also in the perimeter, but it's freshwater at depth there. It's not coming up because it's capped.""

Johnson believes there are hundreds of these groundwater-fed oases scattered across Great Salt Lake's exposed playa, suggesting the presence of a vast underground reservoir connected to the surface by a plumbing system that is only now getting close study, thanks in part to the lake's decline.

With his colleagues' help, the geologist hopes to discover where the water came from, when it fell as snow and most critically, how much is there.

""The last thing we wanted to do is for this to be characterized as a water resource we should be tapping,"" he said. ""It's much more fragile than that, and we need to understand it better.""

Google's Pixel phones are chock-full of helpful, smart features, and they capture some of the best-looking photographs on a mobile device. It's why they're among our favorite Android smartphones. But like several of its peers, Google doesn't have many of its best features turned on by default. For example, Call Screening blocks unwanted phone calls on your behalf, and you need to turn it on yourself.

That's what I'm here for. I test smartphones for a living, and I'm constantly switching to a new device every week or two. I'm an expert at running through the settings of every phone I test and toggling on the features I want. To get the most out of your new Pixel, follow these steps, some of which may even help you turn off things you don't care for, like a few of the generative AI features on the Pixel 10.

Keep Your Pixel Updated

Unlike many other Android phones, Google's Pixel devices get software updates immediately when Google sends them out. That's one of the big perks of owning the phone made by the company that manages Android. Many of the settings I'm running through here are based on the Android 16 build in the Pixel 10 series—you may find some pathways or settings are slightly different on your device if you're not on the latest version. Note: Some features are also exclusive to select Pixel phones.

To update your Pixel, head to Settings > System > Software updates > System update. To check which model Pixel you own, go to Settings, scroll to the bottom, and click About Phone.

Table of Contents

The best features on Google's Pixel phones revolve around the Phone app. No one wants endless robocalls and scams from telemarketers. That's why the first thing I do when setting up a new Pixel is open the Phone app and tap the three-lined icon on the top left (also called a hamburger menu). Tap Settings > Call Screen and toggle on Automatically screen calls. You can choose Basic, Medium, or Maximum protection, and each mode ramps up the screening, with the latter screening unknown numbers.

Within the Phone app's Settings menu, there are several other call features I recommend you turn on. Scam Detection is in beta, but it'll run in the background and will alert you on a call if it thinks you're being scammed. It doesn't run for calls from your contacts; calls aren't recorded, and all of this works locally on the device. Hold for Me is another excellent feature that lets you skip the annoying hold music—turn it on while on a call, and your phone will listen on your behalf and ring when the person you're speaking with returns and ends the hold.

Direct My Call is useful if you're calling a business and they have a complicated phone menu. Once toggled on, it'll show a live transcription on your phone screen during the call, with buttons you can tap (i.e., Press 0 to talk to an agent). Call Notes, once toggled on, will ask if you want to activate it at the beginning of each call. It'll transcribe and summarize calls, so if you're particularly forgetful, you'll be able to see a summary of your calls (you can choose to make it automatically start for calls from non-contacts). The data is stored on the device, and you can have it delete the notes after a set period.

Available on the latest Pixel 10 series at the moment, Voice Translate will translate phone calls in real time, and it'll even use generative artificial intelligence to approximate the voices of the people on the call, so that it feels like you're actually talking to each other and not a robot. You'll need to toggle this on in the middle of a call. And finally, Take a Message is sort of a revamped version of voicemail. When you don't answer, it'll ask callers to leave a message, which you'll be able to see transcribed in real time. It'll even generate insights or tasks based on the transcript, so if your wife called and reminded you to grab milk on the way home, it should show up as a recommendation to add to Google Keep.

One of the best features that originally debuted in the Pixel 2, Now Playing listens for ambient music in your environment and will display the song information straight on your lock screen—no need to guess who the artist is or run a manual sound search. (You can still do that if the music is loud enough by tapping the mic icon on the Google Search widget on the home screen.)

To enable it, head to Settings > Sound & vibration > Now Playing and toggle it on. By default, the feature works exclusively on-device, but you can turn on Enhance Now Playing to have it automatically use Google Search to expand the detection capabilities and provide album artwork. You can also enable Now Playing history, which can be handy if you forgot to save the song you heard to your music app.

It's really annoying when auto-rotate kicks on and changes your screen orientation when you didn't want it to. Sure, you can just turn off auto-rotate in the quick settings tile, or you can enable Face Detection. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Auto-rotate screen and toggle on Face Detection for the phone to use the selfie camera to understand when you've actually put your phone in landscape mode, or when you're just lying down and staring at the screen sideways.

Similarly, if you're annoyed at how quickly the phone's display times out, you can extend the time manually, or use Adaptive timeout and Screen attention. In the Display & touch menu, tap Screen timeout to find these options. Adaptive timeout turns off your screen if you're not using the phone, and Screen attention won't turn off the screen as long as it detects you're looking at it.

One of the more underrated features on Pixel phones is the accuracy of Assistant Voice Typing. It's the little mic icon on the Gboard keyboard that lets you use voice-to-text when messaging a friend or searching on the web. By default, it works OK, but when you tap it for the first time, you'll be asked to download a faster voice model, and you can head to Settings > System > Keyboard > On-screen keyboard > Gboard > Voice typing to make sure that Advanced features is toggled on.

With this, the voice-typing assistant will automatically add punctuation, and will understand certain commands like “Next paragraph,” “delete,” “lol emoji,” and “send,” making the experience as hands-free as possible. Google has also incorporated some generative AI here, so you can say things like, “Rephrase it,” and the assistant will rewrite the message in different phrasing. That's totally optional. I mostly just love the accuracy of the voice-to-text and the ability to move the cursor to the next line, delete words, and send messages without having to tap the keyboard.

There's a whole Personal Safety app that has features like checking in with friends and family once you've safely arrived home, but you should also make sure to do a test run of Google's Pixel Satellite SOS function before you end up in a remote area with zero cell service (this one is only available on the Pixel 9 and newer).

It'll allow you to message emergency services using satellites when there's no Wi-Fi or cellular connection. Head to Settings > Safety & emergency > Pixel Satellite SOS and Try a demo to get the full experience. I have a more detailed breakdown of how it works here.

There are other safety features you should enable in the Safety & emergency menu. Car Crash Detection will sound an alarm and ask if you need help if the Pixel detects a crash. If you confirm or don't respond, it'll call emergency services, and you can enable emergency sharing with your emergency contacts. You should also turn on Crisis Alerts, which will notify you of natural disasters and public emergencies in your area.

There are ways to keep your Pixel secure even if you left your phone behind in an Uber or even if someone snatched it out of your hands. But you'll have to enable these protective features first. Head to Settings > Security & privacy > Device unlock. Assuming you have a pin or pattern unlock on your phone (please use one), you can enable Theft protection. This is comprised of Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock. The former will lock the screen if it detects someone has grabbed your phone and run away. The latter locks the screen after your phone goes offline, in case the thief turns off mobile data and Wi-Fi.

Within Theft protection is Identity Check—toggle it on. It uses the fingerprint or face scanner to verify that you're using the phone when trying to access certain sensitive data, like passkeys or opening the Find Hub app. You can also set Trusted Places here, so your phone will know it needs to be extra cautious when you're away from these trusted locations, like your home.

And you should also toggle on Remote Lock, which allows you to remotely lock your phone if it's stolen or lost. You'll need to go to android.com/lock to do this and add your phone number. It doesn't require a Google Account. (This only works if the device is online.)

Google also renamed its device-tracking app to Find Hub earlier this year. You should hop into it, find your devices, and toggle on Find your offline devices. This allows the network to find and locate your devices, even if they're offline. Location info from the Find Hub app is encrypted, and only you can see it.

If you want the maximum protection Google offers, you can enable a relatively new mode called Advanced Protection. (You'll have to restart your device for the full features to take effect.) Head to Settings > Security & privacy > Advanced Protection.

When you toggle on Device protection, it will automatically enable Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and trigger Inactivity reboot, which will restart your phone if it stays locked for three days. Advanced Protection will also block 2G networks, which are less secure, block harmful web pages, warn you of non-HTTPS sites, and warn you of scams and suspicious links in Google Messages. We've got a full breakdown of how this function works here, if you're interested.

You can create a Private Space on your Pixel with a fresh Google Account for sensitive apps and information (you can also use an existing account). You can hide it behind a custom lock that's separate from the one for your device, and install apps specifically for this space (even if you already have the same app installed).

When the Private Space is locked, these apps will stop working, and you won't get notifications from them. Head to Settings > Security & privacy > Private Space to set it up. You can set how often the Private Space locks, hide it completely, and delete it if you don't need it. It doesn't transfer to new Pixels, so you'll have to set it up again.

Magic Cue is a new feature on the latest Pixel 10 phones. If you opt in, it'll process data from select apps, like Gmail, Calendar, Keep, and Contacts, and serve up that information in relevant situations, primarily in the Phone and Messages apps. For example, if a friend texts asking what time the dinner reservation is, Magic Cue will find it instantly and serve up the answer so you don't have to hunt for it. If you're calling your airline about your booking, Magic Cue will show the confirmation number and other flight details on the screen so you don't have to switch apps during the call. All of this is processed on-device.

Head to Settings > Magic Cue to check out the new capabilities, but this is also the place to go if you want to disable it partially or completely.

Instead of tapping the screen to see the time, you can enable Always-On Display to see a clock at any moment. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Always-On display to enable it. Now, when the screen turns off, it'll still show the time, date, and weather, plus icons for apps with any notifications. You also have the option to show the lock screen wallpaper with the always-on display, but that'll suck up more battery. (I prefer to just have a black screen.)

While we're talking about the display, make sure your Pixel is using the highest screen resolution. In Display & touch, scroll down to Screen resolution and choose Max resolution. It may eat up more battery life, but you paid for a high-quality display! Use it. Smooth display sits right below, but it's finally enabled by default, allowing your phone to hit a 120-Hz screen refresh rate.

The lock screen is fairly customizable. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Lock screen to customize how notifications appear (compact or full list), hide silent notifications, hide sensitive content, and add shortcuts to the left or right corner (like Flashlight or Wallet). You should also enable Dynamic clock, which changes the size of the clock based on what's on the lock screen. To change the appearance of the lock screen clock, head to Settings > Wallpaper & style and Clock (on the lock screen tab). There are several styles to choose from, and you can adjust the colors and size.

As for your lock screen wallpaper, tap on a photo and then tap Effects. You can customize how photos of your loved ones appear—within shapes, a fresh background color, with real-time weather animations, or a Cinematic look that adds depth.

If you want to restart your Pixel or turn it off, you have to pull down the notification drawer and tap on the digital power button. What about the physical power button? Google defaults it to triggering its Gemini voice assistant. You can actually get the power menu back by pressing the power button and the top volume button simultaneously, but if you want the old-school behavior back, head to Settings > System > Gestures > Press & hold power button.

If you go this route but still want to access Gemini, you can just say, “Hey Google,” to set up voice commands, or use the Gemini widget on the home screen to activate it. To add a widget, press and hold anywhere on the home screen, tap Widgets, and scroll to Gemini.

This is for the Pixel 10 series, but these phones can now record in the AV1 video format. This greatly saves storage space, so if you're someone who takes a lot of video, it's the smart approach. However, AV1 isn't supported universally. You shouldn't have issues uploading AV1 videos to Instagram, for example, but you'll want to check if the source you want to upload to supports it. To switch to AV1, open the camera app, click the gear icon on the left, then tap the three dots at the top right. Scroll to the bottom, tap on Video format, and choose AV1.

Speaking of video, Google's Pro Pixel phones, since the Pixel 8 Pro, have been able to use a feature called Video Boost. This sends your footage to the cloud for processing, improving color, brightness, and stabilization, while reducing noise. Depending on the length of the video, the processing can take 20 minutes, several hours, or even a day. You'll be notified when it's ready, and until then, you can use the native footage you originally shot. It's a smart way to level up the video quality (the Pixel 10 Pro can even upscale it to 8K), even if it'd be nice if Google just improved native video capture. To enable Video Boost, switch to the Video tab in the camera app, tap the gear icon in the camera app, and toggle it on.

Another one for Pixel 10 users, Pro Res Zoom is available on the Pixel 10 Pro models, and Camera Coach is on all Pixel 10 phones (though there's a chance one of these could come to older Pixels). You can learn more about how these camera features work here, but Pro Res Zoom essentially stitches hundreds of frames together once you go past 30X to 100X digital zoom, and employs generative AI to fill in the details of the image. That results in spectacularly sharp zoomed-in photos, but it may leave a weird taste in your mouth because parts of it were AI-generated. You can turn it off! Open the camera, press the gear icon on the bottom left, and tap the three-dot menu icon. Tap Model download and then the trash icon next to Pro Res Zoom.

Camera Coach teaches you how to take better photos. It scans the scene, then runs you through several steps that can range from zooming in, switching to Portrait mode, or even shifting a few paces to the left. It's a helpful feature, but there's an odd “Get Inspired” button that will generate some photo ideas you can try. If you don't like that, or don't care for Camera Coach at all, just head to the camera settings and hit the toggle off for Camera Coach.

While you're there, I like to turn on features like Framing Hints, which adds cues like a level so your photos are straight. Rich color in photos uses the Display P3 color format for more vibrant colors in your images, though it's not as widely supported as sRGB.

The Modes section of the Pixel Settings menu is pretty powerful, but I specifically like the Bedtime mode. Head to Settings > Modes > Bedtime to turn it on and customize it. You can tell it when exactly to turn on and off, at a specific time, or when your phone is charging. You can then customize which of your contacts are allowed to cut through the mode (or specific apps), while enabling features like Grayscale mode to remove all color from the screen.

As you set it up, you can toggle on Bedtime activity, which shows you how much time you spend on your phone before bed, and Cough & snore info. The latter will use your phone's microphone to detect coughing and snoring.

Clear Calling: Trouble hearing people on the other end? Google has an easy solution called Clear Calling, which reduces background noise in your caller's environment, allowing you to hear them better. You can turn this on by heading to Settings > Sound & vibration > Clear Calling.

Notification History: Ever accidentally swipe a notification away before you could read it? Toggle on Notification history by heading to Settings > Notifications > Notification history, and you'll be able to view all the notifications that showed up on your device in the last 24 hours.

Adaptive Vibration: Your Pixel knows if it's sitting in your back pocket, on a table, or in a bag. Adaptive vibration will adjust the strength of the vibration so that you can hear or feel it even if you're in a loud area. Head to Settings > Sound & vibration > Vibration & haptics > Adaptive vibration to turn it on.

Edit the Quick Settings Tiles: The Material 3 Expressive redesign is playful, but it also makes a little more efficient use of space in the Quick Settings tiles when you pull down the notification drawer. If you don't care for the default layout, swipe down twice on the notification drawer, tap the pen icon, and you can now move tiles around, hide them, or add new ones.

Battery Percentage: It bugs me when there is no percentage on the battery bar at the top right of the phone. Tell me exactly how much juice I have left! To enable the percentage, head to Settings > Battery > Battery percentage. Take a look around here and turn on Adaptive charging if you want to prolong the health of your phone's battery (it's under Battery health). You can also choose to limit charging to 80 percent, which will improve the overall lifespan of the battery.

Show Keyboard in App Drawer: Swipe up on the home screen, and it'll open the app drawer, but if you want to immediately search for an app or, well, anything, you'll have to tap on the top search bar to bring up the keyboard. If that's cumbersome, you can have the keyboard automatically open when you swipe up. Long-press anywhere on the home screen, tap Home settings > Search settings > Swipe up to start search. Now, when you open the app drawer, the keyboard will open, ready to go.

Flip to Shhh: Flip your Pixel screen down on a table, and it'll automatically turn on Do Not Disturb. You can turn this on in Settings > System > Gestures > Flip to Shhh, and you can then configure the mode in Settings > Modes > Flip to Shhh.

Live Translate: If you frequently receive messages from family members in a different language (and don't speak the language very well), you can toggle on Live Translate at Settings > System > Live Translate. This will detect other languages, like in the Messages app, and show you translations automatically.

Andrew Ferguson, the Trump-appointed chair of the Federal Trade Commission, recently expressed concern that “Alphabet's administration of Gmail is designed to have partisan effects.”

In a letter addressed to Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Ferguson pointed to a recent story in the New York Post describing complaints by Targeted Victory (a consulting and PR firm that's worked with the Republican National Committee and Elon Musk's X) claiming that Gmail flags emails linking to the Republican fundraising platform WinRed as spam, without doing the same to emails linking to the Democratic platform ActBlue.

“My understanding from recent reporting is that Gmail's spam filters routinely block messages from reaching consumers when those messages come from Republican senders but fail to block similar messages sent by Democrats,” Ferguson wrote.

He warned Alphabet that if Gmail's filters “keep Americans from receiving speech they expect, or donating as they see fit, the filters may harm American consumers and may violate the FTC Act's prohibition of unfair or deceptive trade practices,” adding this could lead to “an FTC investigation and potential enforcement action.”

In response, a Google spokesperson told Axios that Gmail's spam filters “look at a variety of objective signals – like whether people mark a particular email as spam, or if a particular ad agency is sending a high volume of emails that are often marked by people as spam,” and they said the company applies this approach “equally to all senders, regardless of political ideology.”

The spokesperson also said, “We will review this letter and look forward to engaging constructively.”

Conservatives frequently complain that they are being censored or otherwise treated unfairly by digital platforms, including Gmail. In 2023, the Federal Election Commission dismissed a complaint from Republicans over Gmail's spam filters, and a federal court also dismissed an RNC lawsuit with similar complaints. (The RNC seems to be reviving that lawsuit.)

Earlier this month, a federal judge blocked the FTC's investigation into the left-leaning group Media Matters over its research into antisemitic content on X, describing the investigation as “a retaliatory act.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Meta Stock Drops On News It Used Taylor Swift As Chatbot Without Permission","https://gizmodo.com/meta-taylor-swift-chatbot-no-permission-2000651450","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 17:41:50 GMT","

Meta has ignited a firestorm after chatbots created by the company and its users impersonated Taylor Swift and other celebrities across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp without their permission.

Shares of the company have already dropped more than 12% in after hours trading as news of the debacle spread.

Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, and Selena Gomez were also reportedly impersonated.

Many of these AI personas engaged in flirtatious or sexual conversations, prompting serious concern, Reuters reports.

While many of the celebrity bots were user-generated, Reuters uncovered that a Meta employee had personally crafted at least three.

Those include two featuring Taylor Swift. Before being removed, these bots amassed more than 10 million user interactions, Reuters found.

Under the guise of “parodies,” the bots violated Meta's policies, particularly its ban on impersonation and sexually suggestive imagery. Some adult-oriented bots even produced photorealistic pictures of celebrities in lingerie or a bathtub, and a chatbot representing a 16-year-old actor generated an inappropriate shirtless image.

Meta's spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that the company attributes the breach to enforcement failures and assured that the company plans to tighten its guidelines.

“Like others, we permit the generation of images containing public figures, but our policies are intended to prohibit nude, intimate or sexually suggestive imagery,” he said.

The unauthorized use of celebrity likenesses raises legal concerns, especially under state right-of-publicity laws. Stanford law professor Mark Lemley noted the bots likely crossed the line into impermissible territory, as they weren't transformative enough to merit legal protection.

The issue is part of a broader ethical dilemma around AI-generated content. SAG-AFTRA voiced concern about the real-world safety implications, especially when users form emotional attachments to seemingly real digital personas.

In response to the uproar, Meta removed a batch of these bots shortly before Reuters made its findings public.

Simultaneously, the company announced new safeguards aimed at protecting teenagers from inappropriate chatbot interactions. The company said that includes training its systems to avoid romance, self-harm, or suicide themes with minors, and temporarily limiting teens' access to certain AI characters.

U.S. lawmakers followed suit. Senator Josh Hawley has launched an investigation, demanding internal documents and risk assessments regarding AI policies that allowed romantic conversations with children.

One of the most chilling outcomes involved a 76-year-old man with cognitive decline who died after trying to meet “Big sis Billie,” a Meta AI chatbot modeled after Kendall Jenner.

Believing she was real, the man traveled to New York, fell fatally near a train station, and later died of his injuries. Internal guidelines that once permitted such bots to simulate romance—even with minors—heightened scrutiny over Meta's approach.

Activision Blizzard and Microsoft's Call of Duty franchise could take its blockbuster success to the big screen.

According to Puck's Matt Belloni, Paramount is currently negotiating for film rights to the long-running shooter series. Getting this IP is said to be a “tough priority” for new Paramount head David Ellison, since it'd be another major gaming property in the studio's portfolio after Sonic the Hedgehog. There's a new Call of Duty game annually—Treyarch and Raven's Black Ops 7 lands in November—and typically among the bestselling titles of each year.

Way back in 2015, Activision Blizzard opened a movie studio to kickstart a Call of Duty cinematic universe, starting with a film that never materialized. The publisher hasn't tried making a movie since then, as it's had a busy couple of years. But now it's part of Xbox, which is slowly embracing adaptations: along with the now-ended Halo show, there's a Gears of War movie coming and a TV show based on Obsidian's Grounded. (Blizzard games Overwatch and Diablo also had shows in the works, but the developer's deal with Netflix fell through.)

What does a Call of Duty movie look like? That's a good question, since the series has jumped between various real and fictional wars over its 21-year lifetime, from World War II to the modern day and far future. (Don't forget the one set in space!) Or failing that, it could always take the easiest route possible and do a movie based on the ever-popular Zombies or Warzone modes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT, AC Milan's Yunus Musah Set for Serie A Move After Deal ‘Agreed'","https://www.si.com/soccer/usmnt-ac-milan-yunus-musah-serie-a-move-deal-agreed","Sun, 31 Aug 2025 19:15:00 GMT","

After a summer of transfer rumors and a reported exit plan from AC Milan, U.S. men's national team midfielder Yunus Musa looks set to join Serie A side Atalanta on loan, according to Fabrizio Romano and several reports. 

The deal is reportedly worth up to €25 million ($29.2 million) combining the loan fee and the buy option.

Should the deal be completed in full, Milan would profit off Musah, after acquiring him from La Liga's Valencia CF in 2023 for $21 million. Prior to that, Musah had starred with Arsenal's academy in England. 

The move is set to be completed just before Monday's European transfer deadline, ending a dramatic summer for the midfielder who was recently left off head coach Mauricio Pochettino's roster for September friendlies against South Korea and Japan.

With Milan, Musah made 82 appearances and recently started as a right wingback in Friday's 2–0 win over Lecce, where fellow American Christian Pulisic scored his first goal of the Serie A campaign. 

The USMNT midfielder was one of several European-based players to miss the Concacaf Gold Cup, where the USMNT eventually lost to Mexico in the final with an MLS-heavy roster. 

“Honestly, I was gutted that I couldn't go to the Gold Cup,” Musah told ESPN. “The coaches were all disappointed that I didn't go but ultimately I needed to make that decision for myself because I needed to switch off after a tough season. I needed that time off. Ultimately it was to take that period off then so that I could be in good shape to be able to carry on now the whole season and be able to give my best for club and the national team.”

Atlanta are next on the pitch after the September international break, taking on Lecce at home, and Musah could face his former Milan side on Oct. 29. Meanwhile, his next chance to crack at the USMNT roster comes in October with friendlies against Ecuador and Australia.

Local organizers are already starting to cut back on one of the tournament's hallmarks.

President Donald Trump has celebrated next year's World Cup as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to show off the United States. But in many host cities, that honor is tempered by a growing concern over shouldering millions of dollars in security and logistical costs.

Local host committees, private organizations established to stage the World Cup in their areas, find themselves squeezed between two much bigger forces. Soccer governing body FIFA — for whom the quadrennial tournament is a leading source of revenue — significantly constrains local organizers' ability to raise their own funds. While Congress has approved $625 million in security funding nationwide, local governments still have to find the money to cover other expenses that could run up to $150 million per city. 

“There's a little bit coming in, but certainly there is not enough to cover our cost,” said Lisa Gillmor, mayor of the Bay Area city of Santa Clara, California, where six matches will be played. “It's a tall task to take on.”

Local and state governments are scrambling to bridge the gap. Houston and Dallas are tapping tens of millions from Texas' Major Events Reimbursement Program Fund. Kansas' Wyandotte County, home to Kansas City, is considering a new hotel tax. Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey put in a supplemental budget request for $20 million to be spent “in coordination with FIFA based on their needs.”

Some host cities are already starting to cut back on their World Cup dreams, especially around “FanFest” events that are a hallmark of the modern tournament. While all of the host cities in Canada and Mexico have committed to hosting the sprawling watch parties for the full duration of the 39-day tournament, fewer than half of those in the United States have. The others are likely to either shrink the festivals' length or consider other ways to engage non-ticketed fans. At least two U.S. host committees have privately confronted FIFA over its lack of support on expenses like staging and entertainment, according to two people familiar with the planning at the local level.

Nowhere is the situation as tense as in California, where the state's refusal to deliver more funding to two venues due to its own budget problems has driven the Los Angeles organizers to consider their own watch parties beyond FIFA's control. The international federation countered with threats to deny public viewing licenses if the host committee deviates from its preferred format.

The dispute provides a window into the larger structural imbalance that's been a source of ongoing friction between FIFA and the host cities. FIFA controls nearly all of the event's lucrative revenue streams: global sponsorships, ticket sales, in-stadium advertising, broadcasting rights. Host committees, meanwhile, are on the hook for major public-facing costs, from policing to transportation, and now, weeks of free entertainment for tens of thousands of fans.

At a meeting this week with executives from the 11 host committees, the head of the White House's World Cup Task Force sent a clear message: The federal government would help with security needs, but nothing more.

“That's obviously an economic issue. Taxpayers can't flip the bill for everything,” task force executive director Andrew Giuliani said in an interview. “There are certainly other very important things that President Trump has prioritized throughout this administration.”

The first and last time the United States hosted the men's World Cup, in 1994, a central organizing committee coordinated events across all cities, including ticket sales, sponsorships and licensing rights. The tournament generated a $50 million surplus, which was used to establish the U.S. Soccer Foundation to grow the sport domestically.

That experience also awakened the organization that controls the World Cup to its moneymaking potential. Since then, FIFA has doubled the tournament size, from 24 to 48 teams, and began to stage it across multiple countries. (The 2026 cup will be the first with three co-hosts.) The final match has come to resemble the Super Bowl, with a half-time show and premium hospitality packages. FIFA will spend $3 billion to stage next year's tournament, a federation official said, and expects to bring in $13 billion in revenue over a four-year period from 2023 to 2026.

Cities have come to compete aggressively to share in the wealth and attention the World Cup generates. In previous tournaments, including in 1994, host nations — many with a federal sports ministry — dealt with FIFA through a single, centralized organizing committee.

But this time, FIFA and American planners have chosen a decentralized model through which the 11 U.S. cities awarded matches have independent relationships with Zurich-based organization . Each has negotiated a so-called host agreeement that outlines how financial and legal liabilities once the responsibility of a national organizers fall instead on local hosts.

But this time, FIFA and American planners have chosen a decentralized model in which city committees maintain their own relations with the Zurich-based federation. Host agreements delineate which costs are assumed by each side, legal and financial liability falling to local organizers rather than a national umbrella organization.

The Bay Area Host Committee, for example, agreed to pay $25 million to modify Levi's Stadium, located between San Jose and San Francisco. (While FIFA has assumed responsibility for exterior fencing at stadiums, according to an official, interior modifications — typically to convert football fields for soccer use — fall to local organizers.) The host agreement obligates the committee to provide free public transportation for ticketholders, police escorts for dignitaries, and no-cost security, fire and medical services.

But in Los Angeles, those negotiations did not go so smoothly. Stan Kroenke, owner of the Los Angeles Rams and its SoFi Stadium — the most expensive sports venue on earth — expressed an interest in hosting the World Cup final. But Kroenke recoiled at the cost of improvements that FIFA demanded for its marquee match, which he seemed unlikely to recoup given the way revenue would be split. Relations between FIFA and the LA host committee have been fractious ever since.

“I know FIFA can be rapacious,” said a California state lawmaker granted anonymity to speak frankly about dynamics between the two entities. “It's been a constant challenge and source of complaint for the host committee.”

FIFA has tightly monitored how host committees are allowed to raise money to offset their costs, with the biggest point of tension surrounding sponsorships. FIFA has claimed the most commercially viable categories, like beverages and autos, for itself, leaving host committees to sell only limited local packages in less consumer-oriented sectors like real estate and utilities. Whereas FIFA's global sponsorship packages have been selling for between $50 and $100 million, host committees' “Supporter Program” deals have been typically priced between $3 to $5 million.“If you're going to be very tight about what [FIFA is] willing to give to the host committees to help them raise money for the sponsorship packages, you can't also impose multimillion-dollar requirements on top of their core costs,” said one person close to the planning at the host-committee level, granted anonymity to candidly discuss business practices.

The overall price tag to put on matches is expected to run between $100 million and $200 million per city, depending on factors such as the number of matches that will be played there and necessary improvements to transportation and infrastructure. FIFA argues that the local committees knew what they were taking on when they signed host agreements, and that the federation's Miami-based team has been working with the committees to identify cost savings.

“We want to make sure that this is financially viable for all involved, including us,” said a FIFA official who works directly with the host committees granted anonymity to speak candidly. “Where that ends up and how balance sheets look, I can't tell you. But where we can come up with creative ways to look at categories, or work with cities on finding new opportunities, we have a team that does it every single day.”

“It's a partnership,” the official said. “No one wants them to fail.”

Unable to access FIFA's commercial bounty, host cities are relying on private donors, local sponsorships and whatever government dollars they can secure. Georgia, which will host a semifinal at Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, has allocated $25 million for public-safety and security infrastructure. Washington state lawmakers set aside nearly $47 million for World Cup expenses, a large portion of which is funding a makeover of Seattle's Lumen Field. Miami-Dade County pledged $46 million in subsidies and free services to support the tournament.

This summer, Congress approved $625 million to reimburse local law enforcement costs, which will be allocated across the 11 U.S. host committees via a FEMA grant program. That group encompasses six jurisdictions that the Justice Department identified this month for “sanctuary city” practices. Giuliani, the head of the White House's task force, said host committees should expect close scrutiny of how they use federal money.

“This is not going to be a slush fund that a leftist politician can use for whatever they'd like,” said Giuliani, who discussed the reimbursement process in his meeting Tuesday with host committee executives. “We want to make sure that this money is actually accountable. We're of course going to check the receipts and make sure that actually is going to law enforcement.”

In South Florida, where seven matches will be played, unrelated fiscal pressures are pushing local government officials to unwind commitments made in more economically flush times. The city of Fort Lauderdale has already moved $350,000 previously assigned to World Cup expenses to its homelessness budget instead, WLRN reported. In nearby Miami-Dade, the county commission is now considering whether to claw back a $10.5 million payment made in May to the local host committee.

Many local organizers across the country worry they will never be able to make it all add up, with the deficit saddled by wealthy stadium owners designated as the host committees' financial backstop. In California, the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers football franchises have aggressively lobbied Sacramento to increase the $10 million allocated in direct support for World Cup operations, plus access to another $7 million in pre-appropriated funds for security around their stadiums.

Unable to cut back transportation and security costs without jeopardizing public safety, American host cities facing a budget crunch are looking first at the fan festivals. They can cost $1 million each day per city, amounting to up to one-quarter of an overall host committee's costs.

“They want everybody to put on a fan festival, which is great,” said Alan Rothenberg, who chaired the 1994 organizing committee. “But they're saying you can't commercialize it. So that's where the issue is. A lot of risk and limited reward.”

FIFA first launched the fan festivals in 2006 after recognizing that many fans arrived on match days without tickets. Organizers designated expansive spaces with giant screens where fans could gather away from the stadium — a crowd-control measure with the trappings of a cultural celebration.

The events have grown more central to the tourist experience, and a fixture of World Cup imagery broadcast worldwide. FIFA's requirements for the festivals, which have historically been free for the public, are now outlined for host committees in a 159-page document including signage guidelines, food and beverage standards, and medical facilities.

The seemingly innocuous parties have already become a political flashpoint. In 2014, after hundreds of Brazilians took to the streets in protest of high spending on the World Cup, Recife's mayor pulled public funding for the FanFest. FIFA threatened legal action against the Brazilian city, as the Associated Press reported at the time, ultimately forcing a cut in its festival budget from $8.5 million to about $4.5 million.

FIFA initially asked host cities to plan facilities that could accommodate 15,000 visitors and to operate them for the full length of next year's tournament, which will extend more than a week longer than any past World Cup due to the competition's expanded size. The three cities in Mexico and two in Canada agreed to do so, even though they will be hosting fewer matches than any of the U.S. cities.

Philadelphia, site of a July 4 knockout match, has committed $30 million in city funds for events related to the United States' 250th anniversary, including a FanFest celebration at Lemon Hill for the World Cup's duration. So will Dallas and Houston, which are receiving tens of millions of dollars each from Texas' Major Events Reimbursement Program. New York/New Jersey, which will have both a match during the tournament's opening weekend and the final on its closing day, will maintain its fan fest throughout.

“The FIFA Fan Festival is an important responsibility and priority for our team as we prepare to welcome the world in 2026,” NYNJ host committee spokesperson Natalie Hamilton told POLITICO in a statement. “Fundraising is a key tenet of its success, and our team is dedicated to delivering this central fan destination for local communities, families and fans from around the globe.”

But most U.S. cities have balked at that expectation, leading FIFA early last year to soften its demands around FanFest venue size and duration. Now the federation is considering the possibility of allowing host committees to generate revenue by selling FanFest tickets, said a person familiar with the conversations between FIFA and the host committees. Nonetheless, for many American cities plans remain in limbo.

“Most cities haven't definitively told us, ‘This is exactly what we're doing. This is exactly when we're doing it,'” said the FIFA official who works directly with the host committees.

At least a half-dozen host cities are planning on keeping the festival open only on days when the tournament is most active in their areas. Seattle and Boston are even weighing whether to host watch parties without the official FanFest branding. Los Angeles is exploring a hybrid solution, in which the host committee would open with a weeklong FIFA-approved celebration at the Memorial Coliseum before shifting to smaller regional events that will be operated outside the federation's purview.

“The Los Angeles World Cup Host Committee is working closely with FIFA on a community engagement model that better fits the needs of the region, which is vast and spread out,” Kathryn Schloessman, CEO of the Los Angeles World Cup 2026 Host Committee told POLITICO in a statement. “In addition to the FIFA Fan Festival, we plan to host regional watch events that touch every corner of the county, ensuring it is easy and accessible for all our residents to participate in celebrating this major event.”

But FIFA appears unlikely to immediately acquiesce to cities' efforts to reduce costs. A federation official, granted anonymity to discuss the organization's internal thinking, emphasized that any public viewing would still need to apply for a license subject to approval from both FIFA and Fox, the tournament's broadcaster.

The White House task force does not intend to get involved in the budget disputes, according to Giuliani.

“I want to make sure that those fan festivals, whether they're open for 20 days or for 40 days, that they're safe. That's really what our focus is on this,” Giuliani said. “But if, for some reason, in Philadelphia, let's say a fan festival is only open for 20 days. Well, then you know what? They can go on the other side of the fan festival and run the Rocky Steps. Yeah, they can go to Constitution Hall and learn about American history.”

Arthur Rinderknech is making his mark this fortnight at the US Open, where he has advanced to the fourth round in New York for the first time. The 30-year-old will face his biggest test yet on Sunday when he meets  former champion Carlos Alcaraz in the pair's fourth Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

Ahead of the clash, ATPTour.com looks at five things to know about Rinderknech.



Frenchman's New York breakthrough
Rinderknech had never been beyond the third round in his previous 19 major appearances but he has broken new ground this week in New York to reach the fourth round for the first time. The No. 82 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has defeated Roberto Carballes Baena, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Benjamin Bonzi and will now face Alcaraz on Arthur Ashe Stadium on Sunday afternoon. World No. 2 Alcaraz is expecting a tricky test on court.

“He's really difficult to play against, really aggressive, big serve, trying to go to the net,” said Alcaraz, who beat Rinderknech at Flushing Meadows in 2021. “It is going to be really difficult.”

College roots in Texas
While many future pros were travelling on the junior circuit, Rinderknech was charting a different course, 8,000 kilometres from home. The Frenchman chose to play college tennis at Texas A&M University, spending four years in College Station, a town better known for college football than tennis.
“I felt like it was the best fit for me,” Rinderknech told ATPTour.com in the past. “I wasn't the best in juniors. I was probably only ranked about fifth, sixth or seventh at my age in France, so I didn't have much help. I wanted to keep playing tennis, not only go to school, and I could do both of them in the States, so that's why I decided to go there. It was just a great experience and I kept improving.”
Business background
Rinderknech is already thinking about life away from tennis. A business graduate from Texas A&M, the Frenchman recently took part in the ATP Player Mentoring Programme, designed to help players explore career interests beyond the sport. He was mentored by Denise Melone, Managing Director at global communications agency Havas, gaining valuable insight into the business world. The initiative connects players with industry leaders to expand their professional networks and prepare for opportunities post-tennis.

Family support
Tennis runs deep in the Rinderknech family. His father, Pascal, runs a tennis club in Paris, while his mother, Virginie, once played professionally, winning a match at Roland Garros in 1986. Alongside his parents, the 30-year-old is supported by wife and former collegiate player at Texas A&M University, Hortense Boscher. The pair married earlier this year in France.
Captured first Top 10 wins earlier this year
Rinderknech has enjoyed success on the biggest stage already this season. He upset World No. 3 Alexander Zverev in five sets in the first round at Wimbledon to earn just the second Top 10 win of his career. His first arrived only two weeks prior at The Queen's Club, where Rinderknech overcame American Ben Shelton. Can he make it a hat-trick of Top 10 victories against Alcaraz?

Alexander Bublik has dominated on serve throughout the US Open and he used his delivery to great effect in the early hours of Sunday morning to reach the fourth round at Flushing Meadows for the first time.

Despite letting slip an advantage in the fourth-set tie-break, the 23rd seed surged past 14th seed Tommy Paul 7-6(5), 6-7(4), 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-1 after 1 a.m. to set a clash in the last 16 against Jannik Sinner, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings.

On-court reporter Pam Shriver told Bublik his serve ""is incredible"" and the Kazakhstani had a quick reply.

""Yes, it is,"" Bublik told the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd. ""I have no explanation, but I was playing today and I was like, 'Eventually it's going to happen, right?' He had a couple of set points and then I was serving for the match. I was like, 'Okay, let's hope not today'. I have [my] next match against Jannik, so probably that will be the match I will drop a couple of serves.""



Bublik has faced 12 break points in the tournament, but held firm. Sinner will take a 4-2 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series into their showdown, but Bublik has won two of their past three meetings, including a victory in Halle this year.

""That's tough, really tough. In five-set format I haven't done it yet,"" Bublik said. ""But I'll try to use my chances.""

The 28-year-old hit 22 aces against Paul and won 83 per cent of his first-serve points. He also used his drop shot to great effect against the American to keep him off balance throughout.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Sainz incredulous after being hit with penalty for Lawson clash

With his seventh win of the season and Lando Norris retiring, Oscar Piastri now sits with a 34-point lead in the Drivers' Championship.

Dutch Grand Prix winner Oscar Piastri claims ""there is a long way to go yet"" in his quest for a maiden Drivers' title, having taken a substantial points lead over McLaren team mate Lando Norris after his retirement.

Piastri took a lights-to-flag victory at the Zandvoort Circuit, leading all 72 laps from pole but having faced constant pressure from behind by Norris.

The pivotal moment came on Lap 64, as Norris stopped out on track with smoke coming from the back of his McLaren having reported an issue over the radio.

With Norris out, Piastri rattled off the remaining laps for his seventh win of the season and now has a 34-point lead in the Driver's Championship with just nine races remaining.

""I controlled the race when I needed to and obviously incredibly unfortunate for Lando at the end, but I felt like I was in control of that one and just used the pace when I needed to,"" he said.

""It was a bit of a different race to 12 months ago so very happy with all the work we've done to try and improve around here. Very satisfied to come out on top.""

The result was dramatically different from last season, with Norris having taken victory by 22 seconds while Piastri had to settle for fourth.

Piastri also seemed on the back foot this weekend compared with his team mate and title rival initially, but peaked at the most crucial moment to take pole position on Saturday.

""Nothing special, just trying to improve everywhere we can,"" when asked what had changed from 12 months ago.

""At the start of this weekend it was looking like a difficult one and managed to get it together in Qualifying and then I was happy with the pace I had today.

""Very happy, obviously a couple of Safety Cars that spiced it up a little bit and we weathered it all so very proud of the whole team.

""It wasn't just myself that improved to get here it was the whole team around me, without them none of this is possible. It's a big team effort.""

While Norris' retirement has handed Piastri a healthy lead in the Drivers' Championship in the first race after the summer break, the Dutch GP victor stated: ""Starting out on top is a good way to go so if we can keep it running then that would be great, but there's a long way to go yet and keep doing it one race at a time.""

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Sainz incredulous after being hit with penalty for Lawson clash

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.

McLaren's MCL39 is proving to be an excellent all-rounder – but the thing it likes best is medium-speed corners, and there's a lot of those at Zandvoort. The result, in Qualifying, was Oscar Piastri pipping Lando Norris to pole, as the papaya cars locked out the front row.

Behind them, it's more of a Stroopwafel-fight. Max Verstappen will start third – but Isack Hadjar did a magnificent job to join him on the second row, ahead of George Russell and the Ferraris.

On race day there will be different tyre strategies in play, and capricious weather around to mix things up. So let's take a look at the tactical options the teams have when the lights go out…

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Sainz incredulous after being hit with penalty for Lawson clash

Lewis Hamilton's Dutch Grand Prix came to an early end with a mid-race accident at Zandvoort.

Lewis Hamilton only made it a third of the way into Sunday's Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, with the seven-time World Champion dramatically crashing out.

Hamilton was negotiating the Turn 3 banking on Lap 23 of 72 when he put a wheel on the slippery white line – amid light drops of rain – and lost control of his Ferrari.

After sliding into the wall at the exit and causing significant front-end damage, Hamilton parked up, apologised over the radio and headed back to the paddock with his helmet still on.

“It's a driver error, but when there are drops of rain you do find painted surfaces become slippery first,” commented ex-F1 driver Jolyon Palmer during F1 TV's coverage.

When he made it to the media pen, Hamilton himself said: “I generally felt like it was going okay. I had good pace compared to Charles [Leclerc] ahead of me and my tyres were still okay.

“The rear was getting a bit twitchy… I got to Turn 3 and had a snap and I couldn't recover it.”

“It's not a normal sort of thing for me to have, [to] crash out of a race. I can't really say too much more about it.”

Ferrari went on to suffer a double DNF when Leclerc dropped out of proceedings following a clash with Mercedes rival Kimi Antonelli through the same Turn 3 section.

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Sainz incredulous after being hit with penalty for Lawson clash

A busy F1 ACADEMY Qualifying session at Zandvoort ended with home favourite Maya Weug at the head of the field.

Ferrari driver Maya Weug returned to the top of the timesheets in Zandvoort as she secured pole position in a remarkably competitive and eventful F1 ACADEMY Qualifying session.

Weug triumphed in the ever-changing conditions to finish just 0.039s ahead of Red Bull's Alisha Palmowski, who came within touching distance of claiming her first pole. McLaren driver Ella Lloyd was the next to narrowly miss out as she rounded out the top three around the Dutch circuit.

Earlier rainfall had left the track damp, but the clear skies indicated that the drivers' decision to start on wet tyres wouldn't last for too long. With lap times initially 10 seconds adrift of those recorded in practice, Aiva Anagnostiadis was the first to fall victim to the challenging conditions as she skidded into the gravel after making contact with her Hitech TGR team mate Nicole Havrda.

Once Anagnostiadis' car was recovered, the surface rapidly dried out and Williams' Lia Block was the first to make the gamble of switching onto slick tyres, but it would take a while before she saw any drastic improvement.

As the transition away from wet tyres continued, plenty of drivers took time to get used to the slippery track, with many taking the escape road at Turn 1 while others tapped the barriers and locked up. This came to a head with the session's second red flag, caused by Aurelia Nobels driving wide and beaching her car in the gravel.

With just a handful of minutes remaining, it was impossible to predict who would finish in pole position as the times tumbled dramatically, but it was ultimately Weug whose final effort of 1m 38.834s was enough to seal the top spot.

Behind Palmowski and Lloyd, three-time polesitter Chloe Chambers was fourth, with Mercedes' Doriane Pin in P5. Block ended in sixth position ahead of Aston Martin's Tina Hausmann, and Nina Gademan will start on reverse pole position in Race 1 for Alpine after taking P8 – this will get underway at 1705 local time.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Sainz incredulous after being hit with penalty for Lawson clash

Charles Leclerc and Kimi Antonelli have each given their take on the collision that occurred between them at the Dutch Grand Prix, an incident that ultimately put Leclerc out of the race.

Charles Leclerc believes that Kimi Antonelli was “overly optimistic” in their collision at the Dutch Grand Prix, with the Monegasque admitting that the incident “cost a lot” after he retired from the running on a day in which Ferrari recorded two non-finishes.

As the race headed towards its final phase, both Leclerc and Antonelli made a pit stop and the two cars emerged next to each other on track. Antonelli then tried to overtake the SF-25 approaching the banking at Turn 3, but in the process made contact that sent Leclerc into the barriers and out of the race.

While the Mercedes managed to limp back to the pits and continue in the Grand Prix after some repairs, Antonelli was handed a 10-second time penalty for causing the collision as well as receiving an additional five-second penalty for speeding in the pit lane, all of which dropped him down to a final position of P16.

At the time, Leclerc had appeared to suggest over the radio that his pit stop just prior to the incident had been “unnecessary”. When quizzed on this later on, the 27-year-old explained: “I don't think this should be the story of the day.

“The strategy, we can discuss about it and I just let the team know, but that's not what created the incident. What created the incident is Kimi being overly optimistic on the inside of Turn 3, which is fine – you've got to be aggressive and mistakes happen.

“But it hurts, because it cost a lot to the team after what was a good race. I think the pace was good. I had to be very aggressive to make up the places that we had lost because of being unlucky during the first Safety Car. We did kind of everything right, so it was a shame.”

Having earlier gained positions during the race – which saw him make a bold move on George Russell during a close battle with the Mercedes – Leclerc was asked whether this had been an encouraging sign that there is more performance in Ferrari's car.

“Yeah. It's been a very difficult weekend,” said Leclerc. “Apart from the race, it's been an uphill weekend, so I hope we can start on a better foot in Monza and have a better weekend overall.”

Antonelli also gave his take on the incident, with the Silver Arrows driver feeling that he had been enjoying a good Grand Prix up until that point.

“It's a shame because the race was looking good, the pace was very strong and we were coming back and, yeah, I tried,” conceded Antonelli.

“It didn't feel like I overshot massively, it was a bit unfortunate because, while I was trying to keep it tight, it came a bit down from the banking and that was the moment when the contact happened.

“It was a shame, I feel sorry because obviously it's not nice to take someone out. At least [there were] some positives today, and we move forward.”

Looking forward, Antonelli is hopeful that he can continue to build on those positives from the event as he looks to work on his Saturday performances in particular.

“I think race pace has always been strong this year, and it's nice that this is developing and it's getting stronger and stronger,” the 19-year-old said. “It's now more about nailing Qualifying in order to start more at the front, because then it's completely another story.”

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Sainz incredulous after being hit with penalty for Lawson clash

The drivers and teams report back on all the action from final practice and Qualifying at Zandvoort for the Dutch Grand Prix.

After Norris dominated the three practice sessions in the build-up to Qualifying, McLaren were again the team to beat during Saturday's session. While Piastri had the upper hand in Q1, Norris returned to the top in Q2 – before Piastri ultimately set the quickest time of all in Q3, securing pole position ahead of his team mate. Norris had to settle for second, meaning that the reigning Teams' Champion locked out the front row in Zandvoort.

Lando Norris, 2nd, 1:08.674

“I'm pleased to be starting on the front row, but I'm a little disappointed to not be on Pole. It was close – it's been close the whole weekend and I had decent laps, so it's not the end of the world. We're in a good position to fight, it's a long race with a lot of laps, and we'll see what the weather holds. We'll have some fun tomorrow.”

Oscar Piastri, 1st, 1:08.662

""I'm really pleased with that. The car has felt good all weekend, so I am super happy to come away with it. I've been chipping away steadily all weekend and managed to put it all together for my final lap, so I'm stoked to be on Pole. There are a few variables in play for the race, so let's see what happens. I'm looking forward to it.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“A strong and successful Qualifying in Zandvoort as we lockout the front row for tomorrow's Grand Prix. With just a few milliseconds deciding Pole position, both Oscar and Lando displayed solid performances in tricky conditions, driving on the limit in an extremely close session to set the two quickest-ever laps around this circuit.

“As with today's wind in Q3, there are many variables that will contribute to tomorrow's race, including a persistent risk of rain, making it an interesting afternoon. However, we will work to put ourselves in the best position possible to capitalise on our grid positions and start the second half of the season with a pleasing result.”

Verstappen did not appear optimistic about Red Bull's prospects after a tricky Friday at Zandvoort, having predicted that it could be a struggle to reach the top five in Qualifying. However, after placing fifth in FP3, the Dutchman proved to be McLaren's closest challenger come Qualifying and ended the session in third, a result he was “very happy” with. Tsunoda was again unable to match his team mate and found himself being eliminated in P12, leaving the Japanese driver with the target to move into the points on Sunday.

Max Verstappen, 3rd, 1:08.925

""I am happy with our performance today and things all came together for Qualifying. This weekend we have been struggling a bit with the balance but today felt a lot more normal after making some final adjustments just ahead of Qualifying. This really brought the balance together for us, which was a big positive and this made it more fun to push the car to the limit around this track. The wind also made things a bit trickier but this was the same for everyone. Our fight will be to keep the others behind and hopefully we have enough pace for P3. We will need a bit of luck to win here but I want to target a podium tomorrow.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 12th, 1:09.622

""I believed that I did my best today to be honest. I was happy with the lap, it felt clean and there weren't any mistakes from my end so it was strange that we didn't extract the peak performance to get into Q3.  The car was good and the pace was there, the result didn't match the way I felt during the session. I'm disappointed and frustrated in the result today, but I shall keep digging to find performance tomorrow. I qualified close to the points, so there is potential to score and that's what we'll aim to do as I felt confident in the car, so we'll see what tomorrow brings where anything can happen.""

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

""I think P3 was the absolute best Max could have done today, there were a lot of teams competing for P3, Mercedes, Ferrari and probably Fernando in the Aston as well. Max did an incredible job to have such a strong Qualifying and so did the Team. It has been no secret we have struggled with car balance all weekend and the Team kept trying things out on both sides of the garage, which ultimately put the car in a better window, so credit to them. We unlocked some performance in the car and are extracting just about everything we can from it. Generally, the car has improved from where it was for most of the weekend and with that, we should be able to see performance in the race. It will be similar to Quali and a big fight behind the McLarens with four or five cars on very similar pace. Yuki has had a weekend where he has again shown progress, he has been at a reasonable gap to Max on a difficult track. He didn't improve on his second set in Q2 and missed out by just one tenth, so it is still close and he is still building up. The pack is going to be very tight tomorrow, and we will see if we have the pace in the race to move through the field. We are looking forward to the race, the level of support the Team get here from the fans is just amazing. It's not something you get in many other places in the world.""

It was another impressive performance for Racing Bulls on Saturday. Hadjar impressively claimed a career-best P4 in Qualifying, a result that the Frenchman labelled as “really unexpected” after some struggles on Friday. He was pushed by team mate Lawson, who also reached the top-10 shootout and ultimately took P8, though was left disappointed by not dramatically improving between Q2 and Q3.

Isack Hadjar, 4th, 1:09.208

""I am super happy, this is an outstanding result for the Team. We didn't expect to reach Q3, as our performance yesterday wasn't amazing, but we managed to deliver a really strong lap when it mattered. Liam was pushing me hard, the car felt great, and we kept making the right improvements with each run. I feel confident for tomorrow, the car is working well, so there's no reason why our race pace shouldn't be strong. The race should be straightforward, I've got a good view into Turn 1, and the goal is to maintain position and score good points.”

Liam Lawson, 8th, 1:09.500

“It's good to be in Q3 but, of course, the ambition is always to be starting further up. Our speed was very promising throughout Qualifying and unfortunately we went slower in Q3, so there will be some things to look into. The tyres are very sensitive here in Zandvoort and getting the balance right with the wind is tough. The track is very physical and it will be important to have a strong start tomorrow given how tricky it is to overtake. The car has great potential and overall it's a positive Qualifying for the team.""

Guillaume Dezoteux, Head of Vehicle Performance

“For the third time in a row, our two cars make it to Q3! Isack got the perfect lap together in his last attempt which puts him on the second row for the starting grid tomorrow. It's a fantastic result for us after a difficult start of the weekend on his car. Liam was solid all way through the qualifying session, beating our direct competitors and securing the 8th place. Tonight, we will study the various race strategies, and our target is to bring home a good number of points.”

Russell was the best of the rest behind McLaren in final practice but could not quite match that in Qualifying, ending the session in fifth – an outcome that the Mercedes driver felt was deserved due to not “getting things right”. Antonelli only just missed out on Q3 and blamed a “little mistake” for costing him the lap time, leaving him in P11.

George Russell, 5th, 1:09.255

""I am a bit disappointed with P5 today. That said, the field has been really tight since the beginning of the weekend, and we couldn't take anything for granted. We didn't put the lap together at the end of Q3 and, whilst we could have fought for the second row, it is where we deserved to be. Isack (Hadjar) did an amazing job to get ahead of us so congratulations to him.

""We will see what we can do tomorrow. Our long run pace felt good in FP3, and I am therefore hopeful that we can be in the fight for the podium, irrespective of our starting position. We know that our battle remains with the Ferraris and the Red Bull of Max (Verstappen) given the Constructors' standings. Hopefully we can have a good Sunday and add some solid points.""

Kimi Antonelli, 11th, 1:09.493

""I am disappointed after today's Qualifying. I missed out on Q3 by a small margin; on my final lap in Q2 I made a small mistake into the chicane and that proved the difference between getting through and being eliminated. We knew that we would have to execute well given how tight the field was; little mistakes would make a huge difference and so it proved. Losing track time in FP1 did not help with that as it cost me some learning that I could not use in Qualifying. I need to make sure I cut out these errors.

""On the positive side, I was feeling good in the car in both FP2 and FP3. That bodes well for tomorrow's race. We did some long run work in FP3 and that was competitive, so I am looking forward to the Grand Prix. It is a difficult circuit to overtake at and starting from P11 will not make it easy. However, I will reset tonight and be ready to give it my all tomorrow.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""We have struggled to consistently unlock the pace of the car so far this weekend here in Zandvoort. The windy conditions have made it a handful for both George and Kimi and, whilst there have been flashes of performance, we knew Qualifying would be tricky. That proved to be the case with Kimi unfortunate to be eliminated in Q2. George was able to progress to Q3 but some snaps of oversteer cost him a place on the second row.

""Starting P5 and P11 at a circuit that is notoriously difficult to overtake means we will have our work cut out tomorrow. Our long run pace in FP2 with George and FP3 with Kimi did look solid though. Hopefully that can provide some opportunities for both to make up positions. The weather can also be unpredictable here in Zandvoort too and, with rain forecast for the morning, that may also add another layer of jeopardy.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""We lacked a bit of pace today and ultimately that cost both drivers places on the grid for tomorrow. We had two clean sessions in both FP3 and Qualifying so there isn't really anything we can point to that we should have done differently. With that said, the grip hasn't been amazing and in the windy conditions the car has been a bit of a handful. George's final lap went towards oversteer after a snap at Turn 9. Once that happens it's difficult to improve but realistically a second-row grid slot was the best we could have achieved.

""Kimi had four decent runs, improving each time but he missed out on Q3 by a couple of hundredths. It was therefore not a great day, but both have opportunity to move forward in the race tomorrow. Our long run pace from practice looked solid so hopefully we will finish tomorrow in a better position.""

Ferrari displayed progress between FP1 and FP2 on Friday, and Hamilton felt that this had continued into Saturday. After ending final practice in P14 on the timesheets, the seven-time champ reached Q3 in Qualifying for the first time since Silverstone and claimed seventh, leaving him to hail a “more enjoyable” weekend so far. Leclerc placed one spot ahead in sixth but was more critical of his own performance, having been struggling with the car in Zandvoort.

Charles Leclerc, 6th, 1:09.340

""It's been a difficult weekend overall, which makes it tough to build up to the race in the way we want to. The balance of the car makes it tricky to drive and I didn't put it all together in qualifying. It's just that kind of weekend for us, but we may be able to play with strategy tomorrow. We'll do everything we can to fight our way forward and bring home a good result for the team.""

Lewis Hamilton, 7th, 	1:09.390

""Today was a challenging one in terms of getting the car fully into the right performance window. We showed promising pace on the medium tyre in FP3, but weren't able to fully translate that into qualifying, and there's still work to do compared to the teams ahead. That said, after the summer break our priority was to keep building, and today was an encouraging step forward. This circuit is always difficult when it comes to overtaking, so if the weather does bring some mixed conditions tomorrow, hopefully it will create opportunities and make the race exciting for the fans.""

Fred Vasseur, Team Principal

""Today we made a good recovery after yesterday when we were losing 6 to 7 tenths in two corners and struggling. But it meant we were having to come from too far back. We need to do a better job on Friday because looking to make a one second step up is too much in terms of set-up and too much for the drivers.

""At this track, it's difficult to find the right balance and the correct approach for the tyres. The layout of the track with the corners from 7 to 10 puts a lot of load on the tyres and if you are over the limit you can lose a lot in the final part. It's a bit frustrating as I feel P4 could have been possible, but Charles admitted he made a mistake at turn 10. Lewis has had a very good weekend so far but it's the same story as Charles, in that we started from too far back from yesterday when we were not in the right set-up window.

""I think we have a good opportunity to do well tomorrow as our race pace seems okay. McLaren are far ahead but then it's close between ourselves, Verstappen and Russell, so it will come down to strategy and tyre management.""

Both Williams drivers had featured inside the top-10 positions during Saturday's earlier practice session, but Albon exited Qualifying in P15, the Thai driver voicing his unhappiness about his tyre issues. Sainz had a better outing and progressed to Q3, maximising the session to reach P9.

Alex Albon, 15th, 1:09.652

""It's been a frustrating afternoon. We've been quick all weekend and strong in Qualifying, but on our second lap in Q2 we just didn't have the tyres. The operating window is so small, and after queuing for several minutes in the pitlane our out lap was compromised. Obviously, it wasn't intentional, but for us every detail has to be perfect, and the out lap is crucial.

""I was confident we could comfortably make the top ten, but we were out of the window. The margins between Q2 and Q3 are so tight now that you can't afford mistakes or a poor out lap.

""Tomorrow will be tough as this track can be a bit of a train, but let's see what the weather brings and what we can do.""

Carlos Sainz, 9th, 1:09.505

""Once the track temperatures went up, we lost performance from FP3 to Qualifying and I felt it straight away. We needed very solid laps to progress through the session and, whilst it's slightly disappointing to not be higher up the order, we maximised what we could and P9 is a decent position to fight tomorrow. We'll keep an eye on the weather and give our best during the race.""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""Well done to Carlos – really great execution and well done to the team in what I suspect is the closest grid we've seen in Formula 1. With Alex, the pace was clearly there today, and I'm confident he had the pace to reach Q3. But we're right on a knife edge with getting the tyres to work, and a slightly slower out lap behind another car tipped us the wrong way. That's something we'll review and make sure we refine operationally going forward.

""More importantly, though, we need to give ourselves more flexibility to cope with a wider range of situations. Irrespective of today, we know the race car is strong. Overtaking is never easy here, but there will be potential opportunities tomorrow – especially if the weather comes into play.""

After showing impressive pace on Friday, Aston Martin still looked in good form on Saturday but could not quite replicate Alonso's P2 result from second practice. The Spaniard was involved in an unusual incident with Russell during FP3 – which resulted in the former having to take evading action at the pit entry – before going on to reach Q3 in Qualifying, where he had to settle for P10. Stroll was back in action following repair work on his car after his crash on Friday, but a solid showing in FP3 was followed by a spin off track during the opening stages of Q1. The damage proved too great for him to continue, leaving the Canadian with his work cut out on Sunday.

Fernando Alonso, 10th, 1:09.630

""We aim to be in Q3 every weekend and so we're pleased we've achieved that today, but we seemed to be lacking some pace compared to yesterday. There were some tricky wind conditions out there and it was easy to be caught out.

""It's difficult to overtake here, so we'll see what we can do from P10 and hopefully fight for some points.""

Lance Stroll, 20th, no time set

""Unfortunately, there was no chance to bring the car back out and run again because there was too much damage.

""It's a shame after the hard work the team has put in overnight to get the car back running ahead of FP3. And the car has felt comfortable so far this weekend with the package looking pretty strong. We will see what we can do from the back of the grid tomorrow.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""We have looked competitive across the practice sessions, but Qualifying is when it really counts and we did not maximise our potential today.

""Fernando made Q3 and will line up in P10, which gives us a good chance to bring home some points tomorrow. Lance's session ended early when he picked up damage after contact with the barriers.

""We should have some decent race pace, but it's not easy to overtake here. Let's see what we can do tomorrow to allow both cars to move up the field.""

Hulkenberg's run of difficult Qualifyings continued in Zandvoort as the German exited Q1 down in P17, just one position higher than where he finished earlier in the day during Free Practice 3. As for Bortoleto, the rookie did not manage to extend his own pattern of recent Q3 appearances. The Kick Sauber driver will line up in P13 for the Dutch Grand Prix.

Nico Hulkenberg, 17th, 1:10.195

“It was incredibly close out there – just eight tenths covering the top 18 – so missing out by a tenth is frustrating, but that's how brutal qualifying can be. It came ultimately down to a couple of corners where we didn't quite make it. There's always something you want to improve, but you work with what you've got and focus on making the most of it.

“Looking ahead, overtaking around here is going to be tough – probably even harder than it was in Hungary. Track position will be key, and we may not be looking quite as strong on pure pace. We'll look at all our options now strategy-wise and see how we can recover.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 13th, 1:09.622

""Qualifying has been a bit though today. I bottomed out a couple of times in Q1, which cost me some time, and the conditions were rather unstable overall. After Q1, I asked the team to check the floor and make some adjustments within the parameters, but even with that, the lap in Q2 just wasn't enough to get me into Q3. On top of it, I caught some dirty air from Yuki [Tsunoda] in the middle sector on my last attempt, which didn't help, and I lost a bit of time compared to my earlier push. I think Q3 could have been possible if everything had gone perfectly, but that wasn't the case. Still, tomorrow is a new day, and we'll focus on making the most of the opportunities we'll get in the race. Our race pace was decent yesterday, so if we stick to our plan and execute well, we might gain some positions and climb through the field.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

""Although rain stayed away for qualifying, the changing wind direction provided an additional challenge for the drivers, making it difficult to string a lap together. In Q1, Gabi managed P15 – he was not entirely happy with the car, but it was a good enough time to put him through to Q2. Nico, on the other hand, ended up just 0.15s short of progressing in what was, again, a very close midfield battle. Gabi ultimately progressed to P13, with a small moment in turn nine affecting an otherwise strong lap. He set an identical time to Tsunoda and missed out on Q3 by only 0.05 seconds. Looking ahead to Sunday, the field remains very close. Zandvoort is not an easy track for overtakes, but as we have shown in previous rounds, we are increasingly capable of making up ground in a race.""

After a decent showing on Friday, Alpine had reasons to remain positive from their Saturday performance. While the team placed at the bottom of the timesheets in final practice, a solid improvement saw Gasly reach P14 in Qualifying, leaving the Frenchman to happy with the steps forward. Colapinto, meanwhile, only just missed the cut for Q1, an outcome that the Argentine driver blamed on traffic.

Pierre Gasly, 14th, 1:09.637

“Overall, I am happy with the outcome of today's Qualifying and I am pleased with how we turned things around as a team from Free Practice 3. We seemed to lack pace earlier today so to be in the fight for Q3 was good. Even though we are in fourteenth place, only a tenth and half was the difference to reaching Q3 and a hundredth between another two positions such are the small margins. Of course, we need more, but considering where we are with the car at the moment, we can be pleased with our effort. These close margins makes it exciting and puts even more on both the team and driver not to make any mistakes and maximise everything. We know this is not an easy track to overtake but we will see what we can do tomorrow. I would not mind some rain! It is a race and anything can happen.”

Franco Colapinto, 16th, 1:10.104

“It was a very tight Qualifying today. In Free Practice 3, we really struggled but in Qualifying the car was much stronger and in a much better place. We had the potential to go through to Q2, but we were very unfortunate with some traffic in Sector 3 on my final push lap. I had two cars in front of me, which was not useful, and lost some downforce as a result of the dirty air in Turns 11, 12 and 13. It's disappointing to miss out by such a small amount, especially from things outside our control. We were having a good session and on a good lap at the end so it's very disappointing. We want to perform as a team, we want to do better and all of us are pushing. We looked decent on high fuel on Friday so we hope to be strong tomorrow, whatever the weather.”

Flavio Briatore, Executive Advisor

“Naturally it's disappointing not to reach Q3, that's always the aim. But as is the recurring theme in 2025, the field is incredibly close and separated by the finest of margins. I can't remember a time like this in all my time in Formula One and it's great for us and the fans to see it being so competitive. We went backwards a bit on set-up in practice and tested out some things, but we reverted back to what we knew worked and the drivers felt a bit more comfortable. Both Pierre and Franco have been working extremely hard with the engineers and have been applying themselves well. It's been bright sunshine one minute and rain the next in Zandvoort, so let's see what tomorrow brings for the race.”

It proved to be a tough day for Haas in Zandvoort. Both drivers were some way off the top 10 in FP3 and neither Ocon nor Bearman were able to progress beyond Q1 in Qualifying, meaning that the American outfit could be facing a difficult Sunday as they look to improve on their P9 position in the Teams' Championship.

Esteban Ocon, 18th, 1:10.197

“It was a difficult session but things had started to get better, especially on the last set of tires. We had the pace to get into Q2 – it was only one tenth that separated us from it, but unfortunately I went a little wide in Turn 11 and that cost me a little bit. Both Ollie and I had the pace to get into Q2, but we just didn't make it unfortunately. We need to reflect on why that is and if we can do a better job in the race tomorrow. Historically, we've had better race pace, so let's see if we can do something different, we knew it was going to be tough.”

Oliver Bearman, 19th, 1:10.262

“The first run went really well and I had a good feeling in the car, it seemed like we were in a good window. On the second run we were on used tires and we still looked to be pretty decent, but then going onto new tires everyone else improved and I didn't manage to make that improvement. I had a very different feeling underneath me compared to the previous set of tires, and there is a small change we made between the two runs, so we need to see if that was the cause of our issues or not. Our race pace has been okay, I'm not super hopeful, but we'll see what we can do.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“It's a tough result to take. You can see when we get things right, for example – the potential of the car from the first run in FP3 and Q1 with Ollie. The car is very good, but for one reason or another, we haven't been able to get the best out of it consistently. We have to put it together, if we work together and really pay attention to the detail and deliver – if we do that, I have no doubt we can get there. But we need to get there as we're going to run out of races to perform this year.”

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“On a track where overtaking is definitely difficult, qualifying takes on even more importance than usual in deciding the race result. While the McLarens seem to have the edge over the rest of the field, their two drivers are separated by almost nothing, just 12 thousandths of a second in fact. It's very close behind this pair, with the remaining 18 drivers all within the same second. Therefore, all the ingredients are in place to produce a closely contested, unpredictable race, with the changeable weather adding another unknown factor to the mix, as well as the possibility of Safety Cars always present on a track where mistakes are always punished.

“Although simulation shows that the two-stop strategy has a slight advantage in terms of overall time, we are well aware that the teams will try and make only a single pit stop, because track position established on the opening lap is all important. Therefore we believe that a strategy based on a first stint on the Medium and a second with the Hard is the most likely, as it allows teams to cover for the possibility of rain or a Safety Car. For those opting for a two-stop the most likely choice is to use all three compounds, also because only McLaren and Aston Martin have two sets of Hards available and Hadjar has two Mediums.

“The increase in the pit lane speed limit from 60 to 80 km/h will have a significant impact on the time lost during a pit stop, dropping from around 22 seconds to 19 or 20. But that's not enough to make the two-stop really attractive. As for the undercut, we saw here in Zandvoort last year that it is very effective which is one more factor to take into consideration in preparing for the race.”

Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley star in — and are generating considerable Oscar buzz for — the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's bestselling 2020 novel of the same name.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


Hamnet, the latest work of the wonderful Chinese filmmaker Chloé Zhao, who won best picture and director Oscars for 2020's Nomadland, is an adaptation, written by Zhao and Maggie O'Farrell, of O'Farrell's bestselling 2020 novel of the same name about the Shakespeare family. A tearjerker of the first order, it has become — in the wake of its Aug. 29 world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival, and subsequent screenings here, including the one that I caught on Saturday at the Werner Herzog Theatre — the most talked-about film at the fest. It also has generated a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score (including a THR rave) and widespread Oscar buzz, not least for its lead performers.

Paul Mescal, an Oscar nominee for 2022's Aftersun, plays William, a man of words, and Jessie Buckley, an Oscar nominee for 2021's The Lost Daughter, plays Agnes, a woman of nature. Both emanate from troubled families, happen upon each other, fall in love almost instantly, and quickly begin having children — Susannah (Bohdi Rae Breathnatch), and then twins, Judith (Olivia Lynes) and Hamnet (Jacobi Jupe). Then, after a few years of happiness, tragedy strikes, claiming the life of Hamnet — a name which, it turns out, was interchangeable in the 16th century with the name Hamlet, and, according to this story, inspired the play with that title.

	As is also the case with another film at the fest, Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, there is not a lot of joy in Hamnet — it's primarily a film about heartbreaking loss and crippling grief — but it is beautifully shot by the Oscar-nominated cinematographer Łukasz Żal (Ida and Cold War); features stunning sets by the Oscar-nominated production designer Fiona Crombie (The Favourite); is bolstered by a memorable score by Max Richter (Arrival); and showcases affecting performances by Mescal and Buckley. Along with the film, director and screenplay, all of the above seem like top-tier contenders for Oscar nominations, at the least.


	I would just caution that, while there are clearly many fans of the film in Telluride, I have also encountered a number of people from the industry who quietly profess to have not connected with it at all, with the term “trauma porn” coming up more than once. Plus, Telluride attendees have been known to get a bit of a Rocky Mountain high, on occasion, about films that later came back to earth — see 2021's C'mon C'mon and Cyrano, 2022's Empire of Light and Women Talking, 2023's Saltburn, and yes, 2024's September 5. So I will be very curious to see how Hamnet plays in the weeks and months to come — its next stop is the Toronto International Film Festival, and then Focus Features will begin rolling it out in theaters on Nov. 27 — when people will see it in the wake of such huge hype.

Lanthimos and Stone's prior collaborations include the Academy-embraced 'The Favourite' and 'Poor Things.'


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	The team that brought you 2018's The Favourite, 2023's Poor Things and 2024's Kinds of Kindness — filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos and actress/producer Emma Stone — has struck again, this time with Bugonia, which had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on Aug. 28 and has been screening at the Telluride Film Festival over the Labor Day weekend. I caught it on Saturday at the Werner Herzog Theater, and I'm quite confident that, like the daring The Favourite and Poor Things, and unlike the slight Kinds of Kindness, it will be a significant awards season player.

	











	Adapted by Will Tracy, a former editor of The Onion who later wrote on Succession and penned 2022's The Menu, from Jang Joon-hwan‘s 2003 South Korean film Save the Green Planet!, Bugonia is an absurdist comedy. It centers on two American oddball cousins (Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis), one of whom “does his own research” and the other of whom follows him deep down a rabbit hole, who team up to kidnap an American corporate titan (Stone) because they believe she is actually an alien intent to destroy the earth. As a massive effort to locate the CEO is mounted, the abductors and the abductee (who is chained up in the basement of the abductors' home) engage in a battle of wits, with the abductors growing increasingly menacing as the clock ticks toward a lunar eclipse at which they expect her to take them to her leader.

	At a time when social isolation, information silos and the deliberate propagation of misinformation in the real world are fueling widespread and dangerous conspiratorial beliefs and real acts of violence, a story like this, with characters like these, seems frighteningly plausible. Though elements of it evoke thoughts of The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, it also calls to mind dark social satires like 1975's Dog Day Afternoon and 1976's Network, the latter of which was name-checked by Stone, during a post-screening Q&A, as a film that seemed sensationalist when it was released, but 50 years later seems stunningly prescient.


	I think that it's very possible that members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will appreciate the intent of Bugonia — which Focus Features will release in U.S. theaters on Oct. 24 — and recognize it in a variety of categories, including best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay. The Academy, as it is currently composed, has far less of an aversion to “genre films” than the organization used to. See: Oscar recognition for 2017's The Shape of Water, 2019's Parasite, 2022's Everything Everywhere All at Once and, yes, Poor Things.


	But whatever happens in other categories, I think it's almost certain that Stone, a four-time Oscar nominee who won best actress for 2016's La La Land and Poor Things, and Plemons, a best supporting actor Oscar nominee for 2021's The Power of the Dog, will be nominated for lead acting awards in recognition of performances that required a tremendous level of commitment — and make a haunting impression.

Plus: Laufey, Deftones, Tyler, The Creator and BigXthaPlug shake up the top 10.

	Keith Caulfield



Stray Kids earn their seventh No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart as KARMA debuts atop the list dated Sept. 6. The set earned 313,000 equivalent album units in the United States in the week ending Aug. 28, according to Luminate. Of that sum, traditional album sales comprise 296,000. Both figures mark career highs for the act.

	











KARMA also lands the third-biggest week, by units, of 2025 among all albums, as well as the year's second-largest sales week.


	All seven of the group's Billboard 200 chart entries have debuted at No. 1, beginning with ODDINARY in 2022. Last year, when HOP debuted atop the list, Stray Kids became the first act to debut at No. 1 with their first six entries in the 69-year history of the chart. With KARMA's arrival, they extend that record. The Billboard 200 began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in March 1956.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In addition, with a seventh No. 1, Stray Kids surpass BTS, Linkin Park and Dave Matthews Band for the most No. 1s among groups on the Billboard 200 this century (since 2000). 


	Also in the top 10 on the latest Billboard 200 chart, Laufey scores her first top 10 with the No. 4 arrival of A Matter of Time; Deftones land their seventh top 10 with the No. 5 bow of private music; Tyler, The Creator's Cherry Bomb re-enters the chart at No. 6 following a 10th anniversary reissue; and BigXthaPlug notches his highest-charting effort yet with the No. 7 debut of I Hope You're Happy.

	











	The Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption as measured in equivalent album units, compiled by Luminate. Units comprise album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. The new Sept. 6, 2025-dated chart will be posted in full on Billboard‘s website on Sept. 3, one day later than usual, owed to the Labor Day holiday on Sept. 1 in the U.S. For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


	Of KARMA's 313,000 first-week equivalent album units, album sales comprise 296,000 (it debuts at No. 1 on the Top Album Sales chart), SEA units comprise 16,000 (equaling 23.12 million on-demand official streams of the sets songs; it debuts at No. 34 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise 1,000.


	In 2025, the three largest weeks for albums, by units, are the opening frames of Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem (493,000), The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow (490,000)and KARMA (313,000). In traditional album sales, the two biggest weeks of 2025 belong to Hurry Up Tomorrow (359,000) and KARMA (296,000).


KARMA's album sales were aided by its availability across 11 CD variants and three vinyl variants (all containing collectible items such as photocards, with some items randomized), including signed editions.


	As KARMA is mostly in the Korean language, it is the 29th mostly non-English-language album to hit No. 1, and the second of 2025 (following Bad Bunny's Spanish-language DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS). Four mostly non-English titles topped the list in 2024, and all were mostly Korean-language efforts. Of the 29 mostly non-English-language albums to reach No. 1, 19 are mostly Korean, six mostly (or all) Spanish, one mostly Italian, one entirely French and two mostly a blend of Spanish, Italian and French.

	











	The KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack is a non-mover at No. 2, its peak, on the Billboard 200 with its best week yet: 125,000 equivalent album units earned (up 16%). The gain was boosted by the film's sing-along release in movie theaters and on Netflix and the set's arrival on CD. The CD was sold mostly via online retailers after only being available to purchase as a digital download previously. Album sales (across all configurations) totaled 18,000 for the week (up 236%). A wider release for the CD is due on Sept. 5.


	Further, KPop Demon Hunters has spent six nonconsecutive weeks at No. 2. It's the first soundtrack in the modern era (since May 1991, when the chart began utilizing Luminate's electronically monitored tracking information) to spend at least six weeks at No. 2 without reaching No. 1.


Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem falls 1-3 after a dozen nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1, earning 116,000 equivalent album units in the latest tracking frame (down 4%).


	Laufey achieves her first top 10 album on the Billboard 200 as A Matter of Time debuts at No. 4 with 99,000 equivalent album units earned — her biggest week ever. Of that sum, album sales comprise 71,000 (her best sales week; it debuts at No. 2 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 28,000 (equaling 38.57 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs; it debuts at No. 11 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise a negligible sum. The set's first-week sales were bolstered by its availability across eight vinyl and three CD variants (each with one signed edition) and a cassette.


A Matter of Time is Laufey's third studio album. The singer-songwriter's second effort, 2023's Bewitched, reached No. 18 in 2024, won a Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album and has earned over 950,000 equivalent album units in the U.S.

	











A Matter of Time marks the highest-debuting jazz album on the Billboard 200 since the Dec. 1, 2018-dated chart, with Michael Bublé's Love debuted and peaked at No. 2. (Jazz albums are defined as those that are eligible for, or have charted on, Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart.)


	Deftones score their seventh top 10 effort on the Billboard 200 as private music premieres at No. 5 with 87,000 equivalent album units earned — the band's best week by units. Of that starting sum, album sales comprise 66,000 (the group's largest sales week since 2016's Gore bowed with 69,000; private music starts at No. 3 on Top Album Sales), SEA units comprise 20,500 (equaling 26.72 million on-demand official streams of the set's songs, it debuts at No. 20 on Top Streaming Albums) and TEA units comprise the remaining sum. (First-week sales were helped by the set's availability across seven vinyl variants, three CDs, a cassette and a boxed set with a branded piece of clothing and a vinyl LP inside.)


	The new album — the band's 10th full-length studio effort — was preceded by its track “My Mind Is a Mountain,” which became the band's first No. 1 on the Mainstream Rock Airplay chart (dated Sept. 6).


	Tyler, The Creator's Cherry Bomb, first released in 2015, returns to the Billboard 200 following a 10th anniversary reissue. The set reenters the chart at No. 6 with 52,000 equivalent album units earned (up from a negligible sum in the previous week). For its 10th anniversary, the set was reissued on three vinyl variants, CD and in three deluxe boxed sets (each containing a piece of branded clothing and a copy of the CD). Album sales largely drive the set's reentry, comprising nearly 51,000 of the set's units for the week. Cherry Bomb debuted and peaked at No. 4 on the May 2, 2015-dated chart.

	











	BigXthaPlug lands his highest-charting album, and second top 10, on the Billboard 200 with the No. 7 bow of I Hope You're Happy. The set earned 47,000 equivalent album units in its first week, with SEA units comprising 41,000 (equaling 54.59 million on-demand official streams of its tracks; it debuts at No. 3 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 5,000 (it debuts at No. 22 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000.


I Hope You're Happy was preceded by a trio of charted songs on the Billboard Hot 100: “All the Way” (featuring Bailey Zimmerman; No. 4 peak in April), “Home” (featuring Shaboozey; No. 77 in July) and “Hell at Night” (with Ella Langley; No. 49 in August).


	Rounding out the top 10 of the latest Billboard 200: Alex Warren's You'll Be Alright, Kid drops 5-8 (just over 38,000 equivalent album units earned, down 4%), Gunna's The Last Wun falls 4-9 (38,000, down 20%) and Morgan Wallen's chart-topping One Thing at a Time dips 7-10 (nearly 38,000, up less than 1%).

""I was just caught off guard and had no answer for my grandsons,"" the rapper wrote.

	Mitchell Peters



Snoop Dogg is speaking out after facing backlash for his recent remarks about LGBTQ+ representation in children's movies.


	On Wednesday (Aug. 27), the 53-year-old rapper addressed the controversy in the comments section of a Hollywood Unlocked Instagram post, where media personality T.S. Madison had criticized him for his reaction to a same-sex couple depicted in the 2022 animated film Lightyear.


	“I was just caught off guard and had no answer for my grandsons,” Snoop wrote. “All my gay friends [know] what's up they been calling me with love .”


	He added, “My bad for not knowing the answers for a 6 yr old … teach me how to learn I'm not perfect.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Snoop's comments came days after he appeared on the Aug. 20 episode of Dr. Sarah Fontenot's It's Giving podcast, where he recalled taking his grandson to see Lightyear. During the film, he discovered that one of the female characters was in a same-sex marriage and had children with her wife.


	“Why my grandson in the middle of the movie like, ‘Papa Snoop, how she have a baby with a woman? She a woman,'” Snoop recounted. “I didn't come here for this s-t, I just came to watch the goddamn movie.”




	The “Drop It Like It's Hot” rapper continued, “So it's like, f—k me, I'm scared to go to the movies now. Like, y'all throwing me in the middle of s—t that I don't have an answer for,” Snoop said. “It threw me for a loop. We have to show that at this age? Like, they're going to ask questions. I don't have the answer.”


	His remarks sparked swift backlash online, with many accusing him of being homophobic. Among those who responded was Lightyear writer Lauren Gunderson, who addressed the controversy in a Threads post on Aug. 27.


	“As we wrote early versions of what became LIGHTYEAR, a key character needed a partner, and it was so natural to write ‘she' instead of ‘he,'” Gunderson wrote. “As small as that detail is in the film, I knew the representational effect it could have. Small line, big deal. I was elated that they kept it.”


	The writer continued, “I had very little to do with the final script. But I was proud to see a happy queer couple (even for a few seconds) onscreen. I know they got a lot of s—t for this inclusion, but stuff like this matters because beautiful love like this exists.”


Lightyear features a brief scene in which Alisha, a central character, is revealed to be queer and in a committed relationship with another woman. The two share a kiss, a moment that led to the film being banned in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The scene also drew criticism from right-wing political figures in the United States, who accused Disney of promoting a “pro-LGBTQ+ agenda.”

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	If Béla Tarr made Abigail's Party if might look something like this, an elevated cringe comedy that marks a return, of sorts, to the kind of portmanteau movie Jim Jarmusch made in the late '80s and early '90s. The theme is very simple — family — but there are other overlaps too, with jokes that recur, like various iterations of the British phrase “Bob's your uncle”, which clearly tickled Jarmusch somewhere on his travels. It's slight for sure, and true to his word in Cannes 2023 it does make his last film, Paterson, look like a Jean Claude Van Damme action film, but it's good to see that he's moved away from his not very productive period spent fruitlessly trying to re-energize stale horror tropes.

	True to form, Father Mother Sister Brother brings together an extraordinarily eclectic cast; some of them familiar faces from the Jarmusch cinematic universe, but, trust me, you won't have seen them quite like this before. Split into three sections, interspersed with trippy light patterns and a plangent avant-garde guitar score by the director himself and frequent collaborator Annika Henderson, it looks at three family units in three time zones, moving slowly east from the nondescript nowheresvilles of north-east America, to Dublin then Paris.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Linked by Dusty Springfield's slinky cover of “Spooky”, which has no apparent thematic relevance whatsoever, Jarmusch's triptych opens with “Father”, which stars Adam Driver and Mayam Bialik as Jeff and Emily, two straitlaced siblings traveling upstate to see their father (Tom Waits). As evidenced by their conversation, Father is something of a conundrum to the pair of them (“How does Daddy survive, exactly?”), and they don't seem especially close either. Inevitably, the meeting is a disaster, and Jarmusch keeps things dryly tantalizing, hinting at Father's bohemian past with references to books by Reich and Chomsky, a very funny checklist of every drug under the sun, and, most baffling of all to Emily, what appears to be a genuine Rolex on the old man's wrist.

	











	The second story, “Mother”, is completely unrelated, this time reversing the dynamic with the effect that Mother (Charlotte Rampling) is a well-to-do and possibly rather racy novelist, whose two misfit daughters are coming to visit. Timothea (Cate Blanchett) is the practical but nerdy type whose car breaks down along the way; Lilith (Vicky Krieps) is the pink-haired dropout type, who forces her girlfriend to drop her off round the corner so that she can pretend that she can afford an Uber. As in the first episode, it seems like nobody really wants to be there, especially when the older woman pours the tea. “Shall I be mother?” says Mother. You might as well start sometime,” says Lilith.


	The third part, Sister Brother, is by far the weakest, partly because it doesn't share the heightened awkwardness of the previous two excerpts. This one stars Indya Moore as Skye and Luka Sabbat as Billy, two siblings dealing with their parents' estate, but, disappointingly, there's no side to their conversation, as there has been previously. It has precedent in Jarmusch's low-key canon, like the intimate scenes with two Japanese tourists in Mystery Train, but it sticks out a little uncomfortably here, guiding the film to its oblique, see-yourself-out conclusion rather than providing a satisfying ending.


	Whenever films like this pop up, there's always a chorus of “BUT WHO'S IT FOR?”, a complaint that the director has likely been dealing with since his first brush with arthouse stardom over 40 years ago with Stranger Than Paradise. Indeed, compared to 2005's Broken Flowers, this is a wilfully obscure step back to his deadpan, experimental roots, a gentle, almost deliberately un-film that is best not viewed in too much proximity to the witching hour. Nothing seems to land, but somehow it lingers; enjoy it or not, Father Mother Sister Brother will worm its way into your brain like false memory syndrome, a fitfully funny, if never laugh-out-loud reminder that you can't choose your family.

EXCLUSIVE: Decades after her work in Vertigo, Picnic and Bell Book and Candle made her Hollywood's biggest and most glamorous star, Kim Novak today came back for another closeup as the Venice Film Festival honored her with the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement. The festival is also screening Kim Novak's Vertigo, a documentary by Alexandre Philippe about a career that ended when she made the decision she'd had enough of the movie game. It is amusing how smitten that director clearly is with Novak, but after an hour on the phone with her, I too fell under her spell. After I told her to bring mosquito spray to Venice, she asked me about myself, and was soon counseling me on life in general and how best to help my 90-year old mother transition from a lonely apartment to an assisted living facility that might make her feel part of a community. “Tell her, don't ever let anyone make her feel trapped,” she said. We called that the Kim Novak Rule as we continued the search, and believe it or not, the very next day after our interview, we found the perfect new home for my mother. I could see why her fans adored her and her movies so much.

	Much like her idol Marlene Dietrich, Novak walked away from the business under her own steam, and has largely kept to herself, marrying an equine veterinarian and busying herself raising horses and painting. Docu director Philippe grew up in a home with the same deep red wallpaper as in the iconic Vertigo scene where a surveilling James Stewart first glimpses Novak in all her gorgeousness. The director devotes a lot of the film in giving Novak the chance to relive that Alfred Hitchcock-directed classic that cast her in dual roles. Though it fell flat upon release, Vertigo is now acknowledged as one of the all time greats. In the docu,

	Novak has little to say in the movie about her provocative relationship with Sammy Davis Jr,  which Colman Domingo is trying to turn into a Sydney Sweeney film. After a gossip columnist proclaimed the couple altar-bound, Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn put out the word that Davis Jr. might lose his other eye to the mob goons he would send if the relationship continued. Sources told me that their dalliance was actually not much more than a fling and that Novak wasn't heartbroken when it went public, because it created a reason to exit an affair that wasn't going to lead to marriage. And maybe there was an element of Novak just wanting to stick it to her iron-fisted movie boss Cohn whom she respected but fought with over the shackles of the studio contract system. 

	











DEADLINE: You grew up in Chicago, went on a road trip to promote a new line of home freezers, and embraced the suggestion of one of the two other models to check out Hollywood while you were on the West Coast. On a lark, you were an extra in a picture, got discovered and within two years you were the biggest female star in the business. Was it really that fast and that simple?  


KIM NOVAK: Yes. It was funny because when I left Chicago to go on the modeling job, my mom and dad took me to the train and we all thought I'd be back soon. By the time I came back, I was a famous movie star. It was only within months really, before I did my first movie. It hit, things clicked and everything in my life changed.


DEADLINE: Sounds like a lot to adjust to?


NOVAK: Somehow when it's happening to you, it feels like it's the way it's supposed to happen. You either can go with it and I chose to go with it. But of course, the journey is not always perfect, and you run into lots of things that you want to resist. A lot of people get tunnel vision and they've got in their mind a goal of what they're going to do and how they're going to react. It's fine to focus on a certain direction, but I learned you have to keep your eyes open to what's going around you. It was so important that I went on a modeling job, but then everything just seemed to fall in place to change things. Then it becomes a matter of being able to recognize the path that you're on, and that often it'll take detours, but you've got to willing to follow the detours and recognize when doors open and be willing to go through them when they do. You also need to know when it is time to resist and say no, I'm not going down that road.


	I've often wondered, how did this happen to me? Why did this happen? Timing is everything. And I had a lot of good luck, obviously, to get where I did. It came at the expense of giving up my life in Chicago, but on the other hand, there was more that made me want to go away somewhere. I knew I didn't want to stay in Chicago. I remember at the time I was going out with this person and he wanted to get married. He didn't want to take no for an answer. For me, it's always better when that happens to write something out. I wrote a poem, I always like to write poetry, and I wrote this poem about how I could not be with anybody right now because I need to find where I'm going to go in this world. And as long as I don't know it, I can't decide something that I still haven't experienced or know that I wanted in my life anyway. I must've done a good job on that poem. He never called me back.


DEADLINE: It is clear from the docu that you didn't succumb to the superficial star adulation that always proves hollow, and that you bristled under a system of being told what movies to do. Actresses now make those choices and while the Metoo revelations and the disparity in pay between actresses and actors shows the perils facing up and comers, it's a lot better than when you were a big star. What were the things you bristled against?


NOVAK: It wasn't just the movies you were told to do. They even told you who to go out with. I mean, in other words, you needed to go out and promote your studio, so every time there was a premiere of a movie, you had to go, and they wanted to tell you who to go with.


DEADLINE: They wanted the illusion you were half of a glamour couple and being romanced by the biggest stars?


NOVAK: I did that for a bit, but you find yourself sitting in the limo with a stranger. You have no idea who he is or what it's about, but you're doing what the studio tells you to do. I did a bit of that but finally thought, I can't take this anymore. If I'm going, I want to go with who I want to go with, or I'm not going, period.  

	











	You had to make choices. I can't imagine those things go on today that you had to choose things from a career point of view of building yourself as a star and promoting your studio, because now there's no contract like that. It was hard, but so much of it was faith, and I had wonderful opportunities because of Harry Cohn. Yes, he was a dictator and everything you don't want in someone that you're working for. But on the other hand, he really knew the difference between good and bad scripts. He let me work on some incredible movies with incredible directors. But then when he passed away, suddenly there was nobody who knew what was really good, who to put in what movie…they just didn't know.


DEADLINE: How is that possible?


NOVAK: They never had an opportunity to use their own judgments because Harry Cohn made all the decisions. And so it all fell apart. And that's why I left. I felt I was at a stalemate and finally thought, wow, I'm not going to stay around Hollywood and just wait for something good to happen. I still owed them one movie when I left. They offered me some beach party movie that was so stupid and made no sense to me. And I thought, you know something, I'm not going to do it. I'm going to do what I love best, which has always been painting and art.


DEADLINE: That had been a creative outlet you found while acting?


NOVAK: Art is one of the things that saved me in my life. I think if I didn't have it, I couldn't have lived in the Hollywood system as it was at the time. Many people couldn't take it, and it could take your life. And being a survivor, I felt I had to do that. I had some place to go. Somewhere that was more valuable from my perspective of doing. Art was my comfort zone.


DEADLINE: It seems funny you say that no one knew how to pick good scripts like Harry Cohn, and yet in the documentary you say he gave you the Vertigo script and contracted your services to another studio, but said, I'm going to let you do this with Alfred Hitchcock because I respect him, but the script is terrible. How did you react to that proclamation?   


NOVAK: Well, when he said it, I was still new in the business. I didn't even know the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock. So I listened to what Harry Cohn said, that he's a really good director, doing a lousy script. That's the actual words he said, lousy script. But I had been in Picnic and some good movies that he put together and that I was so right for, when I was under contract. They weren't all Vertigo or Picnic or Bell Book and Candle. There were some others that were not so good, but I had no say so about them. But there was one I really wanted to do, and I fought for and did it even when he told me I shouldn't do this movie, it's not good. I really loved the script. And that was called Middle of the Night.


DEADLINE: A May-December romance written by Paddy Chayevsky from his play, and directed by Delbert Mann…


NOVAK: Here was a brilliant writer and wonderful director. And Frederic March was an incredible actor. I loved the part so much, and I wanted it because it wasn't one of those glamour parts. It wasn't about her being so pretty or anything. It was about a real working girl, who allowed herself to be in love with an older man. I wanted to do it so badly and [Cohn] said, I don't want you to do this movie. It's not going to be a commercial success. And it wasn't. But I will never change anything about it or the experience. I got to work in New York, and I was finally working in a way that I really liked. We had rehearsals. All the Hollywood movies I'd done before, we never rehearsed. We just shot it whichever way it was set up on the schedule. But in that movie, we shot it in two or three weeks, but that was because we rehearsed for a couple of weeks. It was such a joy to be able to get to know the characters and their proper perspectives. So afterwards when it came out and it was not a hit, he said, ‘I told you this was not going to be good. You shouldn't have done it.' But I look back and I'm so glad I did. But I also look back and realize I didn't really fully appreciate the gifts [Cohn] gave me and opportunities to play in some incredible movies with great directors.

	











DEADLINE: I wrote a book about The Three Stooges, who labored 24 years on the Columbia lot doing shorts for Harry Cohn. I came away feeling he really liked them and especially Moe Howard, but he wasn't above making them feel insecure about how the short subjects department was going to be shuttered. There were a lot of years when The Stooges were afraid to ask for raises, even though their classic shorts were often more popular than the feature films they preceded on the big screen. And when Cohn died, it was Red Skelton who remarked on the large attendance at Cohn's funeral and quipped that when you give the people what they want, they come in droves. Talk about the Harry Cohn you knew.  


NOVAK: He really had an iron fist, on everything. And I resented him in a lot of ways. On the other hand, one time, when Christmas was coming up, I thought, that bastard, I'm going to do something. I think I was mostly living at the studio then because I worked so hard, and I went in the kitchen and I made up a big batch of chocolate fudge.


DEADLINE: Why?


NOVAK: I thought, I'm just going to see how he reacts. So I went to his office and he says, ‘what are you here for? What do you want? I said, ‘I don't want anything. I want to give you something. He said, oh? And I presented it with the homemade chocolate fudge. And I swear for the only time I've ever seen it with him, he melted. He didn't want me to see it, but I could see it in his expressions, it was like no one ever did this for me before. No one ever brought me a present. And it touched him somehow. And after that, I resented some things, like you had to do this and do that. But at the same time, I suddenly found somebody that was vulnerable also. It took chocolate fudge to show a softness that certainly, I don't know that anyone ever saw that in him, but I saw it for a brief time. And then he said, ‘well, go on. Get out of here.' So I mean, I did see both sides of the man.  


DEADLINE: You don't spend time on the documentary on this, but you had a famous friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. after you met on the Steve Allen Show. After a gossip columnist reported you were headed toward marriage, legend has it that Harry Cohn got a message to Sammy and said he was going to send some mob guys and take out the one working eye he had. Cohn was protecting his investment in making sure his biggest star was not on the arm of a Black man, as unfair as that seems now. Sammy Davis Jr. had a rougher road to stardom than you because of the rampant racism he battled in Hollywood and Las Vegas, but you both had reps for being defiant and principled. How did you react?  


NOVAK: We both reacted the same way. How dare you tell us how we're supposed to live our lives. How dare you tell us who we can see and who we can't see. It brought out the defiance in both of us, because [Cohn] actually threatened [Davis Jr]. I mean, for me, it was, well, your career is going to go to hell. I said, ‘Hey! You're not going to threaten me with that.' I want to do what I think is right, and I don't think this is right. I've always been against racial things like that. To me, it was almost a challenge. I didn't realize how badly [Cohn] would react, from the point of view of his health, because he died very shortly after that. I feel bad about that. But on the other hand, it was wrong. I think he was racist, and I think that he felt that this would get all the racists against me. And from his perspective, it was [Davis Jr's] life that was threatened, not mine. But it became, what are you willing to stand up for in life? And you've got to be willing to stand up for what is right over wrong and in humanity. It's what we're going through in our country right now, and we can't be afraid and not do something because someone wrongfully tells you that you shouldn't do it. You've got to be able to stand up to what you think is right, and for good things and good reasons.

	











DEADLINE: But from his standpoint of running Columbia Pictures, you are Harry Cohn's biggest asset, and he felt this might puncture the Dream Factory balloon and destroy that asset. He protected his investment, but it has to be doubly detestable for you to have it reinforced that you're considered a possession as opposed to a person who works for a boss.  


NOVAK: Right. That's absolutely right. Yeah.


DEADLINE: Did you cool your relationship with Sammy just out of concern for his family's safety?


NOVAK: It's one thing for you to stand up for yourself and what you believe in. But then when I saw that it was really a threat against his life…as wrong as it was, you still had to deal with it. They put guards at my gate and everything, and that bothered me. I wanted to react to it and be defiant. But on the other hand, when I found out that they were not only threatening him with his life, but his family? Of course that became the important thing. So they made him marry this Black actress and it only lasted a year. The whole thing still seems crazy to me. But I felt in a way that by seeing him, it would make other people feel that it was not an evil thing to see a Black man.


DEADLINE: Thankfully, it's not a stigma anymore.


NOVAK: I thought maybe I could help people see it, but unfortunately, there was still so many other people that were not willing to move forward and into a better way of thinking. It was just crazy. But I was hoping to get a reaction that would help, that would be liberating to people rather than be looked upon badly. I was hoping I could have an influence on turning the corner on all of that.  


DEADLINE: But this was also the 1950s, where you had the Jim Crow South and the brutal murder of Emmett Till fresh in people's minds. The Civil Rights movement had only just begun to take root.  


NOVAK: I thought I could get it to move faster. Sometimes you think you can be more of an influence, and you learn that you're not. Here I was, a big star, maybe the biggest one, at the top of everything. And yet I was not able to advance the way people reacted. I really thought I was going to be able to help, and Sammy did too.


	Because for him, he was constantly having to prove himself worthy. And that's why he was so brilliant at it. He wouldn't take anything less because it required for him as a Black man to have to prove himself to be better than anybody else at what he did. Some of the stories he told me from when he was in the service were unbelievable, how they treated him and what he had to endure. I mean, it's unbelievably awful how it was at that time.  


DEADLINE: It was eye-opening for you to see the limit of influence Hollywood's biggest actress could have on the culture, but a surprise for me was how little time you had to enjoy the glamour that should have come with your standing. I figured you'd have lived like a queen in great opulence and a mansion. But you say in the documentary that you worked night and day, and you spent most of your time living in a room atop a soundstage that the studio provided you. Would you say that being Hollywood's biggest female star was overrated?  


NOVAK: Glamour, you say? Well, there was glamour, but it was not my choice to live that way. It never was. I've always been Marilyn Novak, not Kim Novak.


DEADLINE: They made you change the name for fear of confusion with Marilyn Monroe…


NOVAK: They had another name they picked out for me, and I just wouldn't accept it. Harry Cohn was livid. He said, this is the name you are taking, this is who you are. I said, no, I'm not. I wasn't going to have people call me Kit Marlowe, like I was some kitten. I mean, there's nothing kitten-like or cat-like about me, and I just couldn't do it. And I'm so glad I didn't, because keeping the name Novak made me real, to me. I had a family, I had roots, and Kit Marlowe had no roots or a family. She was just a made-up pretender. I couldn't do it. And I'm so glad I stood my ground.  

	











DEADLINE: You did that yet again when you went on strike, and got your salary doubled from $1250 a week to $3000. How hard was it to stand up like that and buck an established system where actresses were taught to feel disposable and to keep their mouths shut even as they were being paid a fraction of what their male co-stars got?   


NOVAK: That was the exact moment when I was to make Vertigo. I had no idea that Vertigo would turn out to be what it became, but I had to be willing to hold out for it and have the belief that what is right will win. And it was right to get paid more. Right and wrong was always important, and I believed that by really holding on for what I really believed in, it would work out. But it was always a risk; I could have lost the opportunity to play that role. I didn't know it was going to be a hit, but nonetheless, it was an opportunity to work with supposedly a great director.  But I had to gamble. I'm not a gambler, but I had to gamble nonetheless, and it worked out.


DEADLINE: You didn't know Vertigo would be a classic, but you probably also didn't know that when Harry Cohn loaned you out to Paramount Pictures to make that movie, he likely was pocketing fees that exceeded what you were being paid on a weekly basis, right?  


NOVAK: Well, absolutely. Although I didn't know that, but of course it had to be. I was aware the fact that I wasn't getting more, but he was, and he was not appreciating at that time that I was a real value for him. I was not being valued enough for what I did and what I contributed.


DEADLINE: It wasn't only Cohn. Years later, you made a movie called The Legend of Lylah Clare, played the lead role and only learned after the fact they had dubbed your voice with that of a German-speaking actress. How did you find that out and how did that feel?  


NOVAK: Yeah, well, it wasn't until the premiere. I hadn't seen any of it, and all of a sudden I'm watching myself, and hearing this voice coming across. I thought, oh my God! [Director Robert Aldrich] wanted me to speak with a German accent, but I didn't think that it was right, so I didn't do it. He didn't say anything, and then he went ahead and did that. If he'd have told me, you have to do it, this is what I want you to do, I would've done it probably. But he never insisted on it. So as I say, when I went to the premiere and suddenly I hear it, I was just livid that I was not given the chance to do it. If that's what he really wanted, he should have said so, and I'd have followed through. But to all of a sudden hear that? I was furious. I remember leaving the theater and he was in front, and I wouldn't even talk to him. I just got in my limo and left.


DEADLINE: How do you think your sometime costar Frank Sinatra would have reacted, had that been done to him?


NOVAK: Oh my. There was a man who held out for what he believed, and he was a great influence, in telling me that I should stand up and hold out for more money in my contract. And he was the one, Frank Sinatra, who convinced me to go with his agents because he said, they'll get you the deal and it'll work. And when I said, well, it's all right, I'll figure it out, he said, no, you're worth more. You've got to stand up to it. He was very influential in making my life better.  


DEADLINE: In the docu, you talk about doing Pal Joey with him. You worked hard training and learning all these dance moves. And Sinatra comes in and refuses to do much of the dancing. How surprised were you?  

	











NOVAK: Well, see now, in this this time in my life, I totally understand it. But at one time, he was a best friend when I first did a movie with him. He was so caring and thoughtful and wonderful. But then when we did Pal Joey, it was like he suddenly thought he was the big man over everything and anything. I was like, really? I worked so hard on those dance moves, over and over, and this was all news to me. I never did dancing or singing, but I wanted to be ready for it. It was an opportunity for me to show what I could do. I worked so hard, and God knows Rita Hayworth did also. And then he comes onto the stage for the first time, after we've been working on these routines for weeks. And he said, I'll do this. I'm not going to do that. No, I won't do that, but I'll do this. And then he walked off, and left us with [the mess]. We had so much planned, I was so excited. To me, he was like a different person. That's how I looked at it then.


DEADLINE: Maybe by then your former best friend felt he needed to protect his brand and had the clout to do it?


NOVAK: I realize now that he was a reactor, and I am also. And he was reacting to the part and to the script. He became Joey in Pal Joey, and he was totally acting like the character he was playing. And I realized that for him, it was also necessary to believe in what he was doing. When he became Joey, it was amazing. I thought, how could he be so different? How could he change so much? And I really resented it. In fact, he asked me to go out again with him. I wasn't interested. I didn't want to go out with him because I thought, well, he's a phony. But now, when I look at it in retrospect, and of course I've thought of this now for quite a while, I realize what he was doing. He was just learning his part, learning to be Joey, and he became Joey. And that was right for him. He became a lot of the characters he played. And that I understand, totally, because I also had this fear of becoming too deeply involved in the characters. I would paint them, or rather, draw them in my script, and I got to know them so much that I became them and they became me. That's a lot of what he was going through. So I understand it, now. He was reacting. He wasn't acting. 


DEADLINE: We discussed your complicated relationship with Harry Cohn, who, like your directors Hitchcock and Otto Preminger, had reputations for being tyrannical. And even though you had a rep for standing your ground, you got along great with all of them. How do you explain that?  


NOVAK: Well, because they respected you for being on time, for really working hard and learning your lines. Otto Preminger was so hard on so many people, but usually because they showed up a few minutes late.  My God, he didn't forgive them for that. Or if they didn't know their lines, they'd ask the script girl, what was it I just said? Where did I leave off? He found that intolerable. Me? I always was prepared. I always knew all my lines, and I was always right on time. Those things mattered to me, and those things mattered even more to him. And so it was a matter of respecting someone worthy of being respected. He seemed surprised that I took it seriously. It wasn't, oh, come on, so I'm a little late. I went for coffee. He didn't understand that and that was not okay with him.


	So all I had to do was be honest and not dishonest. I did what he wanted, but I mean, I did it for my reasons. But in his appreciation, we became great friends. I watched him so many times be so hard on people. But the other thing about Otto Preminger is, he realized at the same time how vulnerable I was. Some people were not as vulnerable and they could take it. But he knew I couldn't take it. I mean, I had to do the right thing because I couldn't take it. If he was yelling at me, I would just start to cry, go to my dressing room. And so he knew enough to respect and treat me gently. He did treat me very gently.

	











DEADLINE: You talk wistfully in the documentary about Marilyn Monroe, and how she was a cautionary tale. What is interesting is the way you describe your home life in Chicago before you came, it doesn't sound like there was a ton of love there. Then you become the biggest star in Hollywood. I always thought Marilyn Monroe was an unloved person who sought out love and adulation that could proved superficial and empty. I cannot imagine you would have been able to walk away from the business if you craved that adulation the way Marilyn Monroe did.  


NOVAK: Yeah, that's true. But you realize, I came from a family that who I was as a person and how I behaved in my life really mattered. They gave me my roots. And poor Marilyn, she had no roots. I was vulnerable, but not as much as Marilyn was vulnerable. I mean, she was totally vulnerable. And being vulnerable is, you hurt easy, but you also can get high on little crazy things like someone saying, I love you, and suddenly you feel, oh, I'm lovable. And then you suddenly realize that it wasn't genuine. And so she was so much more vulnerable in that way. But it's because she didn't have the things that I learned from my family, a sense of right and wrong and decency and all of that. She used herself a lot physically to appeal to men, but it was for the wrong reasons. But only because she never had anyone to teach her right from wrong and what was okay and to set limits.


DEADLINE: You discussed having had several houses burn to the ground. You lost a complete memoir you had written in one of them. Did the whole book really perish in the flames?  


NOVAK: Yeah, it sure did. I mean, how was stupid was I? I made copies, but kept all the extra discs right in the house. So I lost it all, and it was hard for me to accept. But on the other hand, I rationalized it by saying, and this is true actually, that it was a catharsis, writing that book. I got quite far in the writing, doing it all myself with no one helping me, just pouring out all my feelings and reactions and my time in Hollywood. It was totally exhausting, but in the best way. But then when I lost it, as I say, in order to survive a loss that felt so tremendous, I took to calling it a catharsis. And that turned out to be true. I really got what I wanted and needed out of it. I've never been a person who cared about how much money I made, it was most important to work on something good that was important to me. So money didn't come into it.


DEADLINE: Makes it easier when you don't need the cash, even though the trauma of losing that memoir and many of your paintings, well that's something some in Hollywood are still dealing with after losing their homes in the LA wildfires. Maybe it's just stuff, but it's your stuff, your memories…


NOVAK: I feel so badly for all of them. For me, it became bearable, after I rationalized it.


DEADLINE: That made you not be bitter or beating yourself up for not putting those backup discs someplace safe, and you could focus on the value of writing a memoir for you and no one else?


NOVAK: That's it, exactly. Even if it was just for me and no one else. I actually came to that thinking pretty fast because the loss was overwhelming. I needed to know that I accomplished what I needed to accomplish, which was making peace by putting all my thoughts together. That's what I had to gain. The other stuff like money, didn't matter. I got what I needed, and that was catharsis.  

	











DEADLINE: Even though your rise was meteoric, actresses had it harder than they do today. But then we watched the appalling revelations that came out of the MeToo movement, and the abuses of actresses by Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men. It makes you wonder, how much have things really changed? If you were talking to a young actress who is poised to have a career, what would you say about guardrails that might keep her on the right track, and avoid looking for instant gratification like Marilyn Monroe did that puts one in danger of being used?  


NOVAK: Well, I think more than anything, and it covers all of these things is, be true to yourself. Don't do something just because you're told to. Find roles you want to play, for the right reasons. If they're the right reasons, you'll be able to identify with that character. Don't give in to allowing yourself to be something you're not, or to allow yourself to give up your sense of right and wrong. And I mean, it's just so, so important to hold on to that respect for good over evil, and to really care about what you stand for. It may sound silly to them and they might say, what I stand for is I want that part. But I really feel that if it's meant to be, it will be. And if it's not, it won't happen.


	Just like my book, it was meant to burn up in the fire. It was meant for me to learn the lesson of why I did it. I'd have kept going, but fate or God or whatever you want to call it, stepped in and brought another fire and I might have lost it all there.  


DEADLINE: You are able to compartmentalize adversity better than I would be…


NOVAK: You know what the best thing was to come out of one of those fires? I had just raised three geese. There was an island that got flooded, and my husband and I were going down the river in a kayak, and we saw this nest. We rescued these eggs that were in the nest. And my husband being a veterinarian, he had the equipment where we were able to get them hatched. I talked to those eggs, every day. So by the time they were hatched, I was definitely their mother. And when the fire happened, the geese still needed their mother very much.


	Now, they were at the stage of going out on dates and staying overnight, and so they were not there when the fire happened. But they came back in the morning and were in total shock. Here's their house, burned down to the ground. They start freaking out. And so I right away hopped in a little rowboat I had, and they jumped in and we just stood off in the distance, watching as I tried to help them understand that things happen in life and that how we react to them is what matters. And I remember Bob, my husband, being on the shore thinking, what the hell are you doing out there with these geese when we've just lost everything? But I knew they were like my kids, and they couldn't understand it and I had to explain it to them. But Bob didn't appreciate that, because what I also needed was to be with him, to help him understand that it happened for some kind of reason.  


DEADLINE: How did you help him rationalize the trauma of what you both lost?


NOVAK: It was a place we didn't build. It was like a lodge, old, and this had a lot to do with the old wiring. And so I said, we will be able to get a new house and make it just the way we want it. I had just redecorated everything in this house because nothing was like I wanted it. We both loved the property, there were three islands on it with our horse riding trails and everything was still possible, after we did it over with all this new stuff. It took a lot to convince him. One day, he said, you were right. Thank God it burned down, because neither one of us liked it. We just loved the property because it gave us things for our horses and everything else. And so I think one good quality I have always had is, I could see something good coming from something that was bad.

Leanne Morgan fans are clamoring for more! And they're about to get it.

Netflix has announced that the comedian's second standup special will drop November 4.

The hour-long show is titled “Leanne Morgan: Unspeakable Things.”

Leanne put up a video on her Instagram account right after she filmed the show saying, “I just finished filming my Netflix special and I feel relieved and tickled, and the audience could not have been any better. And I'm just thrilled. And I hope y'all like it.”

The comedian filmed the special in Wilmington, South Carolina in June.

According to Netflix, ‘Unspeakable Things” will feature Leanne “opening up about everything — from newfound stardom and family life to trying CBD for the first and last time.”

When it comes to Netflix comedy specials, Leanne Morgan has big shoes to fill. 

And those shoes are her own.

Leanne's first Netflix comedy special, “I'm Every Woman,” is the streaming service's most viewed comedy special by a woman comedian since 2023. 

The success of her first special led to a deal with Netflix for two more specials. 

“Leanne Morgan: Unspeakable Things” is the first. The comedian told The Hollywood Reporter that the next special is slated for 2027.

A post shared by LeanneMorganComedy (@leannemorgancomedy)

Fans of comedian Leanne Morgan have turned her Netflix sitcom “Leanne” into a top ten hit and a viral sensation, with some saying they've binge-watched the first season's 16 episodes in one session.

Now one media outlet- Film Fanatics- is reporting that “Leanne” has been picked up for a second season.

While Netflix has not released official word of a renewal of the series, there's good reason to hope that Film Fanatics' inside scoop is legit.

The show has been a hit for the streaming service, with devoted fans bombarding Leanne's social media sites with questions about when they can see more.

In an August 26 Instagram post, Leanne took her fans on a tour of her sitcom's set, explaining that she specifically asked that her fictional home be pretty, because her home in Tennessee is pretty.

But while her fictional and real life homes may be similar, the plot of “Leanne” does not reflect the comedian's real life.

Leanne told The Hollywood Reporter, “That was Chuck [Lorre's idea]. He didn't want to base it on my real family. And he liked the idea of starting over because it's a theme that people can relate to. I balked at first. But I think it's the smartest thing we did because I really would've felt protective over my children, my grandchildren and [husband] Chuck Morgan.”

A post shared by LeanneMorganComedy (@leannemorgancomedy)

If a sitcom and a standup special aren't enough, Leanne Morgan continues to tour the country doing standup. Fans can catch her live in person on her “Just Getting Started” tour.

The tour has dates scheduled through October 26.

Find details and tickets here.

You can head over to Prime Video, Tubi, or Freevee to watch Leanne Morgan's 2019 special, “Leanne Morgan: So Yummy.”

The 82nd Venice Film Festival has yielded at least one standout, unanimously liked by critics and audiences, turning it into the hottest ticket for an event that also welcomes public ticket-buyers: Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice,” which Neon already has for stateside release. 

The South Korean “Old Boy” and “The Handmaiden” filmmaker has never been nominated for an Oscar, but this exuberantly well-directed satire starring Lee Byung-hun as a literal paper-pusher pushed to the murderous brink by a depressed job market is a timely, invigorating catch for Venice. Man-soo (Lee) is laid off from his job, and sets about killing off the competition to make himself the only standing specialist in his field.

Led by filmmaker Alexander Payne and including master, decorated directors like Romania's Cristian Mungiu and Iran's Mohammad Rasoulof, the jury will no question award “No Other Choice” a prize. Whether that's the Golden Lion for best film, best director Park, or best actor Lee is anyone's guess, but it's almost certain to be one of them. IndieWire also earlier declared “No Other Choice” an Academy Awards contender; Neon, though, has a very busy international slate with Cannes winners “It Was Just an Accident,” “Sentimental Value,” “The Secret Agent,” and “Sirat,” which could all be in the running for the Best International Feature shortlist.

But back to Venice: Netflix has premiered two out of its three festival titles so far, Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly” and Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein.” Jacob Elordi has earned strong critical notices for his physically transformative portrayal of Victor Frankenstein's monster; critics, meanwhile, like George Clooney's turn as a famous Hollywood actor at the end of his tether well enough in Baumbach's comedy. But critical reaction has been split on the latter, which is more sentimental and misty-eyed than Baumbach's past films. In other words, if you're a “Margot at the Wedding” fan, this one's not for you, but word has been high back in Colorado in Telluride. 

Head juror Payne is close with Clooney after directing him to an Oscar nomination in “The Descendants,” but Adam Sandler is the standout (and with the narrative backing him) in the movie as Clooney's manager. I could imagine the Venice jury going the unexpected route — remember when Lucrecia Martel's jury awarded “Joker” the Golden Lion? — and honoring Sandler.

Of the Netflix offerings so far, Aussie leading man Elordi, who has steadily been building a great career out of “Euphoria” and since, feels like a worthy contender for a Venice acting prize, too. Del Toro, meanwhile, won the Golden Lion in 2017 for “The Shape of Water”; Venice is a hospitable environment to the beloved Mexican filmmaker, whose new film has its range of ardent fans and admirers even if some reviews are less keen on his latest, high-budget gothic vision.

 










Swept aside due to its position as the first screening of the festival after Paolo Sorrentino's muted opener “La Grazia,” László Nemes' post-World-War-II, “Come and See”-esque coming-of-ager “Orphan” hasn't elicited much chatter. It's a skillfully shot and disturbing portrait of Budapest 1957 about a young boy meeting the surly man who claims to be his long-lost father. Nemes hasn't hit the zeitgeist since his 2015 perspectival Holocaust survival drama, “Son of Saul,” which won the Best International Feature Oscar. 

The war in Gaza has been a focus of this year's festival between protests and press-conference remarks; that Nemes spoke out against Jonathan Glazer's Oscar speech for “The Zone of Interest” addressing the Israel-Palestine conflict last year has left some unable to separate art from artist at this juncture, but the jury's job is to look at the films on their own terms.

Yorgos Lanthimos' sci-fi satire “Bugonia,” starring Emma Stone as a CEO executive kidnapped by conspiracist Jesse Plemons because he thinks she's an alien, made a strong early impression on the festival. But Lanthimos won the Golden Lion for “Poor Things” in 2023;  as much as the jury shouldn't be biased toward past wins, I don't see this extraterrestrial-among-us hostage thriller taking the top prize.

 










Olivier Assayas' “The Wizard of Kremlin,” with Paul Dano as a fictional kingmaker to Jude Law's Vladimir Putin, premiered on Sunday and has earned tepid reviews. Homegrown Italian filmmaker Gianfranco Rosi's black-and-white documentary “Below the Clouds,” a portrait of Neapolitan everyday-ers under Mount Vesuvius, could stand to earn some kind of filmmaking prize for its ruminative black-and-white cinematography and patient editing. That the Biennale is more generous toward including documentaries in competition than, say, Cannes, is starting to amount to something. Laura Poitras' “All the Beauty in the Bloodshed,” after all, won the Golden Lion in 2022; her piercing journalism portrait “Cover-Up” played out of competition here.

There's still much to come, from “The Brutalist” Oscar nominee Mona Fastvold's historical musical drama “The Testament of Ann Lee” (which Brady Corbet co-wrote and produced, as Fastvold did 2024 Venice winner “The Brutalist”) to Benny Safdie's A24 solo directing outing “The Smashing Machine” and Kathryn Bigelow's Netflix thriller “A House of Dynamite.” Tonight, Jim Jarmusch's latest, “Father Mother Sister Brother” will premiere. But right now, the easiest mark if you're predicting a Venice award winner is, full stop, Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice.”

 










Stay tuned for updates in this post as more Venice contenders shake out.

In appearing to give you nothing, Jim Jarmusch‘s almost perversely downplayed trio of short stories “Father Mother Sister Brother” winds up giving you almost everything if you can tap into its cool vibrations.

Packed into the film‘s triptych of globe-spanning episodes about estranged adult children and their late-in-life parents coming together again (at least geographically speaking, when not emotionally) is a profound appeal: If we as children don't bother to ask our parents questions, meet them halfway, why should they bother with us? If you felt not loved by your parents enough as a child or rejected by them as an adult, maybe that's because they felt you didn't need them anymore, and so resumed living their own lives. What if familial damage is too late to repair? Jarmusch would argue it's not, though with his hushedly sad new movie, he's not about to coax his characters along the psychoanalytic dotted line from childhood resentment to coughed-up, adult-age catharsis.

Writer/director Jarmusch has called “Father Mother Sister Brother,” which he wrote in three weeks, an “anti-action film,” but if you're looking closely enough or tuned in to its hangout-movie sensibility, it has more action than most bona fide action movies, even when much of the action here is offscreen, under-the-surface, unsaid. He cuts through the scrambling frequency of stunted emotions like a hyper-focused samurai, with a katana in bullet time, a reverb-guitar-driving musical score he wrote himself encouraging you to pause and smell the roses. Or at the very least, watch the skate kids do ollies in slow-mo.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Jarmusch, the slow-cinema beat poet who has long eschewed theatrical drama in favor of slices of life in which nothing much happens, yet everything also does, drains “Father Mother Sister Brother” of easy or any resolution. It's a meditation on, not a mining of, ordinary people who bring to their present some kind of past discontent that's never articulated. With words, anyway. 

Like Adam Driver and Mayim Bialik in the section “Father” as siblings doing a wellness check on their hermit-crab father (a wonderfully gristly septuagenarian Tom Waits, who's been kicking with Jarmsuch for decades now). They resemble more a pair of child welfare agents or insurance salespeople in their chilly remove from their dad when they show up to his porch, having spent the car ride over equivocating about a prior incident at their mother's funeral. Some years back at her memorial, their father had some kind of breakdown. In that car ride, the brother and sister talk like nervous neighbors over a fence.

The story resets, and the characters shuffle: Gathering across the pond in Dublin are Timothea (Cate Blanchett) and Lilith (Vicky Krieps) at their mother's (Charlotte Rampling) home for afternoon tea in “Mother.” Lilith, a hustling fashionista and influencer with teased-out pink hair, seems to have money troubles, unable to afford the Uber there or back despite a designer bag over her shoulder and in conspicuously consumptive, boho-chic digs. 

 










An androgynously styled, brown-bobbed Blanchett has a permanently bemused smile pasted on her face, even when her car breaks down, unfazed by whatever small inconveniences life chucks at her. And in a Jarmusch movie, it isn't much. The wryly observant Rampling, meanwhile, gives the best, most effortless, and oh-so-her performance in the movie as a contentedly unanchored writer who is perhaps a widow, but who's certainly (right?) looking forward to seeing her daughters. She takes a therapy session over the phone on her couch, sharing how her only wish is that her grown daughters don't try to stir anything up. But what would that be?

Finally, in the third segment, “Sister Brother,” twin siblings Skye (Indya Moore) and Billy (Luka Sabbat) meet in Paris to microdose psilocybin and sift through the remaining personal effects left behind by their parents, who died in a plane crash over the Azores. While this might be the least potent of the three stories only because it has the most traceable dramatic structure, the wistful chapter ends “Father Mother Sister Brother” on a note of guarded hope and humanity that reminds of Jarmusch's ripened optimism in cynicism-stirring times, a patient balladeer who believes life is worth living. 

That's despite the first story, “Father,” feeling like a less disillusioned twist on Raymond Carver that leaves the parent-child divide unresolved, Jeff (Driver) and Emily (Bialik) not wanting to stay a minute longer in their father's house, unready to let go of whatever their beef is. “What do we say we toast to family relations?” their spacing-out father says over a coffee (can you toast with coffee?). It's telling and tricky and pointed he's not simply saying “family”; it's easier, after all, to put quotation marks or some distance around any earnest feeling. Sometimes, we only stay linked to the people who birthed us and raised us because of the nagging, plugged-into-our-DNA directive of family relations. Not always because we actually love them.

 










Jarmusch may not be explicitly referencing Carver, though both artists have made an unadorned style their identity. I thought so much of the last line of the final story of Carver's “What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,” a collection of crisply distilled everyday American tales about nothing and everything. In “One More Thing,” an alcoholic preparing to run out on his family like he's readying for nuclear war, and for reasons not spelled out in Carver's compressed, real-time prose, wants to say “one more thing. But then he could not think what it could possibly be.” In other words, the characters in “Father Mother Sister Brother” brush up against revelation, but they haven't the emotional vocabulary or even the literal words to get there, and Jarmusch doesn't coax it out of them.

The below-the-line assemblage of craftspeople here includes cinematographers Frederick Elmes and Yorick Le Saux, splitting the duties across on-location shooting sites that — in the age of AI, CGI, and the cost of production in the United States demanding films shoot in places like Hungary for Pennsylvania — feel real enough to touch. Even Jarmusch's apparent use of rear-screen projection in several driving scenes feels cozier and more tactile than many actual locations I've seen in recent movies. That “Father Mother Sister Brother” is produced by fashion house Saint Laurent lends toward some thoughtfully chosen costume and set design, with the detail even of a more grandly ambitious (i.e., expensive and not independent) film. Rampling's teatime spread, for one, is just beautiful enough that Krieps' character has to snap a pic for the followers.

 










In nestling “Father Mother Sister Brother” along the shelf of past Jarmusch joints that also rove and ramble with a shuffling futility and a disregard for manufactured drama, this feels closest to “Coffee and Cigarettes” or “Night on Earth”: Vignettes with loosely connective tissue, here in this film a Rolex watch that appears in all three sections and characters using the British idiom “and Bob's your uncle” to the confusion of a few others. “But Tim's our uncle,” Jeff tells his father in one of the film's drollest retorts. The laughs here are as dry as a cough post-bronchitis.

And “Father Mother Sister Brother” is about as dry as a physical copy of short stories you've loved since you were a child. There are no protagonists or antagonists, just people moving through life, Jarmusch catching moments of them the way that David Lynch once caught ideas like fish moving down a stream. This is a movie Lynch would've admired, brittly funny and content to linger in doorways and thresholds for as long as it takes until somebody breaks the awkward silence. Or not. At the end of “Mother,” Rampling, Blanchett, and Krieps stand at the doorway, waiting for Krieps' Uber, but they have nothing to say to each other. Jarmusch, though, has plenty to say. Let's hope those idea-fish keep coming down the river.

 










“Father Mother Sister Brother” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival. MUBI opens the film in the U.S. on December 24.

Jim Jarmusch‘s 14th feature, “Father Mother Sister Brother,” brought the “Down by Law” and “Paterson” director to the Venice Film Festival for only the second time — and inevitably into the controversy surrounding the film's distributor, MUBI.

MUBI, which releases the Venice competition premiere in theaters December 24, is facing external and internal backlash due to MUBI investor Sequoia's ties to the Israeli defense industry. The streamer and distributor accepted a $100 million investment from a company that also backs Kela, a defense startup founded in 2024 by Israeli intelligence veterans after the October 7 terrorist attacks. A list of signatory filmmakers and a letter from MUBI staffers have called upon the company to drop the investor. MUBI CEO Efe Cakarel released a statement earlier this month claiming that the company's relationship with the venture capital firm is not involved in funding the war in Gaza.

Jarmusch was asked during the “Father Mother Sister Brother” press conference by Screen International's Ben Dalton whether he had spoken to the distributor about its funding structure, which has thrown a wave of negative press attention at MUBI all summer. 

 










“Yes, I have spoken to MUBI about it, and I have a very good relationship particularly with [MUBI CCO] Jason Ropell at MUBI who called me immediately. He had not been made aware when this relationship was made,” Jarmusch said. “My relationship with MUBI started much before that, and they were fantastic to work with on this film. I was of course disappointed and quite disconcerted by this relationship. Really, if you want to discuss it, you have to address MUBI about it. I'm not the spokesman. However, yes, I was concerned.”

He added, “I also have a distribution agreement with MUBI in certain territories which I had entered in before my knowledge of this. Having said that, on a personal level, I have to say I am an independent filmmaker and I have taken money from various sources to be able to realize my films. I consider pretty much all corporate money is dirty money, and if you start analyzing each of these film companies and their financing structures, you're going to find a lot of nasty dirt. It's all there. We could avoid it and not make films at all, but the films are how I choose to carry things I would like to say. I'm concerned, but one thing I don't like — and you have not done this — is putting the onus of the explanation of this on us, the artists. It's not us; it's MUBI you must address. And not just MUBI, but other companies as well.”

 










At the press conference also were members of “Father Mother Sister Brother's” ensemble cast, including Cate Blanchett, Charlotte Rampling, and Vicky Krieps. Co-star Indya Moore, who has been a vocal supporter of Palestine and was arrested at a 2023 New York City protest demanding a ceasefire, also spoke up to answer the question.

“Since the genocide of Palestinians began, there has been an incredible amount of creative warfare and resource warfare behind the scenes,” she said. “The issue with the way people are trying to figure out how we are going to work at a capacity that is ethical and not enabling a systematic pipeline that funds these kinds of things to happen to people… a kind of due diligence that people are learning how to do is a developing process. These are not questions we've ever had to ask before, especially as independent artists. We're all trying to figure out how to navigate this and survive. One thing is for sure: If you were to ask me, Indya, why did you work here or work there when this person is there or that entity is behind this thing? Most likely, I didn't know.”

Earlier this month, in response to the backlash, Cakarel said MUBI would install an “Ethical Funding and Investment Policy” to establish future criteria for funding partners, as well as an advisory council of arts to help inform the policy.

 










Israel's ongoing war in Gaza has been a major focus of the Venice Film Festival already. A march of thousands, calling for an end to the war, descended down the Venice Lido Saturday afternoon toward the festival grounds. Last week, “Free Palestine” protests were held outside the Biennale headquarters, calling for the festival to take a public stance on the war. Ahead of the festival, filmmakers including Marco Bellocchio, Matteo Garrone, and Alice Rohrwacher launched an appeal for organizers to take a pro-Palestinian stance.

	Daniel Kreps



Cyndi Lauper performed the last show of her farewell tour Saturday at the Hollywood Bowl, where guests like Joni Mitchell, Cher, SZA and more helped send off the singer onstage.


	Mitchell, in only her second public live appearance of 2025, first joined Lauper for a rendition of “Carey,” the Blue classic that Lauper herself had covered a dozen or so times in concert, including at a 2000 tribute concert for Mitchell:


	For the next song, Lauper was joined onstage by John Legend, who assisted the singer on her hit “Time After Time”: 


	The encores featured two more surprise guests: First, SZA came out for the Lauper's “True Colors,” while the final song of the Girls Just Wanna Have Fun Farewell Tour was, fittingly, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” with none other than Lauper's friend and former tour mate Cher joining her onstage for the finale:


	In an interview with Rolling Stone last fall, Lauper said of the farewell tour, “Oh gosh, it's a bucket list. I haven't done an arena tour since ‘86. I'm excited because I get to have all these fantastic young women on tour with me. So many years, I was told I can't do a women's tour because nobody will go see it. ‘Women don't sell like men sell.' Then I toured with Cher and we played for a million people. So bullshit.”

HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) — After the U.S. government loaded children onto planes overnight to be sent back to their native Guatemala, a federal judge temporarily blocked the flights — with the youngsters still inside — as their attorneys said authorities were violating U.S. laws and sending vulnerable kids into potential peril.

The extraordinary drama played out over predawn hours on a U.S. holiday weekend and vaulted from tarmacs in Texas to a courtroom in Washington. It was the latest showdown over the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration — and the latest high-stakes clash between the administration's enforcement efforts and legal safeguards that Congress created for vulnerable migrants.

For now, hundreds of Guatemalan children who arrived unaccompanied will stay while the legal fight plays out over coming weeks.

“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” said Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, who noted her ruling applies broadly to Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. without parents or guardians. 

Minutes after she concluded a hastily scheduled hearing Sunday afternoon, five charter buses pulled up to a plane parked at the border-area airport in Harlingen, Texas. Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers — perhaps 50 — toward the plane in a part of the airport restricted to government planes, including deportation flights. The passengers were wearing colored clothing that is used in government-run shelters for migrant children.

The U.S. government insists it's reuniting the Guatemalan children with parents or guardians who sought their return. Lawyers for at least some of the minors say that's nonsense and argue that in any event, authorities still would have to follow a legal process that they did not.




One girl said her parents, in Guatemala, got a strange phone call a few weeks ago saying the U.S. was deporting her, said one of the attorneys, Efrén C. Olivares of the National Immigration Law Center. Other children — identified only by their initials — said in court documents that they had been neglected, abandoned, physically threatened or abused in their home country. 

Sunday's court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in Washington, but similar legal actions also were filed elsewhere. 

In a lawsuit in Arizona, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project said one of its clients is a 12-year-old asylum-seeker who has chronic kidney disease, needs dialysis to stay alive and will need a kidney transplant. Two other plaintiffs, a 10-year-old boy and his 3-year-old sister, don't have family in Guatemala and don't want to return, according to the group.

Families scramble to Guatemalan air base

As the developments played out in the U.S., families gathered at an air base in Guatemala's capital, Guatemala City, in anticipation of the flights. Gilberto López said he drove through the night from his remote town after his 17-year-old nephew called at midnight, saying that he was being deported from Texas.

The boy left Guatemala two years ago, at age 15, to work in the U.S. and was detained about a month ago, López said.

Migrant children who arrive in the U.S. without their parents or guardians are routinely handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. They often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a relative — living in the country.

Many of those from Guatemala request asylum or pursue other legal avenues to get permission to stay the U.S.

An attorney with the National Center for Youth Law said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children — particularly Guatemalans — in facilities of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. 

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin. 

Then, on Friday, advocates began getting word that their young clients' immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said. 

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that officials had drafted a list of children to return to Guatemala. Advocates learned that the flights would leave from the Texas cities of Harlingen and El Paso, Aber said.

It's unclear whether any planes actually departed. Government lawyer Drew Ensign told the Washington judge that one plane might have taken off but then returned. 

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday. 

The judge said that after being awakened at 2:30 a.m. to address the emergency filing from the children's lawyers, she spent hours trying to reach federal attorneys and get answers. 

“I have the government attempting to remove unaccompanied minors from the country in the wee hours of the morning on a holiday weekend, which is surprising,” Sooknanan said at the hearing, later adding: “Absent action by the courts, all of those children would have been returned to Guatemala, potentially to very dangerous situations.”

The rapid-fire developments resembled a March weekend showdown over the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Advocates implored a federal judge to halt deportations they believed were imminent, while the Trump administration was mum about its plans.

That judge appeared in civilian clothes for a Saturday night hearing and tried to block the flights, but they went ahead, with the government saying the order came too late. 

The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. unaccompanied, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat. The Guatemalan government has said it's ready to take them in.

It is another step in the Trump administration's sweeping immigration enforcement efforts, which include plans to send a surge of officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, ramping up deportations and ending protections for people who have had permission to live and work in the United States.

Backed by Trump, the WLFI token is poised for a bullish trend ahead of its 483 million unlock. Will an imminent release push its price to 2.5? Dive in for more insights now.

Written by Charles Ledoux

Translated on August 31, 2025 at 14:47 by                                        Simon Dumoulin


On the 4H chart, the WLFI token displays an ascending broadening wedge pattern, often considered bearish, but capable of triggering upward breakouts when momentum is strong. The recent bounce from the lower support line near $0.26 has pushed the price above $0.359, signaling the formation of a higher high.

WLFI faces a resistance zone between $0.40 and $0.43. Breaking through this threshold would propel the token toward its peak at $0.55. At this level and with initial volatility, a retracement is possible.

In this context, a correction to $0.43 would offer an attractive entry point for those looking to invest in the project. This liquidity zone could serve as a bounce area. However, a breakdown below $0.40 would drive it lower.

From an orderflow perspective, WLFI is clearly bullish, having liquidated its trendline to the upside at $0.31. This price could constitute the second support to the south in case of a massive drop in the coming days.

As WLFI's spot listing on exchanges like Bitget or Binance is imminent, all eyes are on the token's reaction around its upper resistance line at nearly $0.42. In case of a bullish breakthrough, additional gains could be triggered with the arrival of new liquidity on listing day.

Conversely, a rejection at resistance would maintain the wedge pattern and likely trigger a pullback toward the lower support zone near $0.29.

It will be essential to monitor volumes during its release on Monday around 4 PM, as well as the resistance zones mentioned.

Latest analysis by AI Agent for $WLFI:– 15 days and 13 hours remaining until launch based on all the information in the internet and past experiences– With a circulating supply of 5 billion, the first-day price could reach up to $5.07, and for 10 billion up to $2.50#WLFI pic.twitter.com/ZBLe3wIAD2

Regarding price outlook for the token, it could exceed $10 this year. Additionally, according to AI analyses, the token might explode to $2.5 upon release, as indicated by Tansu Yengen.

With positive momentum currently, WLFI's price action during listing could prove decisive in shaping its short-term trend. Experienced crypto investors will therefore be watching closely in the coming hours.

Buying WLFI tokens on Bitget presents a strategic opportunity to capitalize on the September 1st listing. Here's a guide incorporating the AI trading agent GetAgent:

NEW YORK—Daniil Medvedev announced on social media Sunday that his nearly decade-long relationship with coach Gilles Cervara had ended following the 2025 US Open.“Amazing 8-10 years together,” the former world No. 1 wrote, “20 titles, world number 1 but most importantly a lot of fun moments and memories that will stay with us forever.

Under Cervara, Medvedev topped the ATP rankings and reached six Grand Slam finals, winning one at the 2021 US Open to prevent Novak Djokovic from clinching the Calendar Year Grand Slam.

Medvedev's last match with Cervara came at the 2025 US Open, where he suffered a third straight Grand Slam first-round defeat.

The 29-year-old has struggled mightily at major tournaments since the 2024 Australian Open, where he fell in the final to Jannik Sinner from two sets up. In four major appearances in 2025, Medvedev won just one match, and suffered three consecutive first-round losses.At the US Open, he took a second straight Grand Slam defeat to Benjamin Bonzi, who also defeated him two months ago at the Wimbledon Championships. It was during their match on Louis Armstrong Stadium that Medvedev incurred a $42,500 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct for berating umpire Greg Allensworth and delaying play for over six minutes as Bonzi served for the match. Medvedev ultimately lost in five sets and will drop further down the rankings after starting the year at No. 5.

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Jubilant Hadjar seals his maiden F1 podium at Zandvoort

DHL Fastest Lap Award – 2025 Dutch Grand Prix

The second retirement of the season for Lando Norris has put him on the back foot in his title fight with Oscar Piastri.

Lando Norris was left to come to terms with a pivotal retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix, claiming it was ""out of my control"" as he now trails McLaren team mate and title rival Oscar Piastri by a substantial margin.

Having quickly moved back ahead of Max Verstappen after losing second position on the opening lap, Norris shadowed Piastri for much of 72-lap race.

On the cusp of DRS range – the one-second-or-under gap required to use the drag reduction system –  Norris looked set to challenge his championship rival in the closing stages. But with eight laps remaining, the Briton reported over the radio he could smell smoke.

Shortly after, Norris was forced to come to a stop out on track and record his second retirement of the season, following contact with Piastri in Canada.

With Piastri taking his seventh win of the year at Zandvoort, Norris now sits 34 points adrift in the title battle having come into the first race weekend after the summer break just nine points behind.

“It's just a tough race,"" said Norris when asked about his feelings.

""I was a bit disappointed, but there's nothing I could really do about it in the end. Frustrating, but it's out of my control, so nothing I could do.”

Norris had looked stronger than Piastri for much of the weekend, having also taken victory at the Zandvoort Circuit 12 months ago, but crucially missed out on pole position by 0.012s.

Despite having to chase his team mate, Norris often looked the quicker of the two in the race but believed being able to overtake for the lead would have been incredibly difficult.

""You can't do a lot around here. I felt a bit quicker [than Oscar] but you have to be about eight-tenths quicker to overtake around here and I'm not eight-tenths quicker,"" said Norris.

“To follow within two seconds for pretty much the whole race was a good drive. There was nothing more I could really ask. You start to get dirty air at around four seconds. To be around three or two, I wasn't really expecting it today.

“I thought I did a good job, but it doesn't help much, doesn't mean much. It doesn't mean I got more points or whatever, it's just reassuring that the pace was strong, and I look ahead to the next one.”

""Tonight, I have the pleasure of singing with someone who is a true example of hard work, perseverance, talent, and beauty,"" Shakira said.

Belinda surprised Shakira fans who attended the Colombian superstar's eleventh concert on Saturday (Aug. 30) at Estadio GNP Seguros in Mexico City. The Mexican singer joined Shakira on stage to perform the iconic ballad “Día de Enero” together, creating one of the most emotional moments of Shakira's Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran international tour.

	











	The Mexican pop star became the second female guest artist of the tour, following fellow Mexican singer Danna's appearance earlier that week (August 26) during the kick-off of the second leg of the Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran World Tour in the Mexican capital.

	“Tonight, I have the pleasure of singing with someone who is a true example of hard work, perseverance, talent, and beauty,” Shakira said while introducing Belinda to the 65,000 fans who packed the venue, according to promoter OCESA. 


	Belinda, dressed in a shiny silver crop top, white fringe pants, and platform shoes, joined Shakira during the acoustic segment of the show to sing the heartfelt track. The song, originally dedicated to Shakira's ex-partner Antonio de la Rúa, is from her 2005 album, Fijación Oral Vol. 1.


	This special version of “Día de Enero” blended Belinda's soft and sweet vocals with Shakira's signature melancholic touch, making for a moving duet. Shakira hadn't performed the song live since 2007, but it made its way back into her setlist on Aug. 11, when she began the second leg of the tour in Tijuana, Mexico.

	











	Belinda and Shakira's friendship appears to have grown closer since they were spotted together at a party thrown by Venezuelan singer and content creator Lele Pons in Miami in 2024, a celebration of Shakira's track “Soltera” whose guests included Danna and Kenia OS. 


	At the end of Saturday night's performance, an emotional Belinda knelt down as a sign of respect and gratitude toward Shakira. “I love you. Thank you for this opportunity — I'll never forget it. We love you!” the 36-year-old artist said, visibly moved. Shakira responded by kneeling alongside her and embracing her warmly, as the crowd erupted in applause. Shakira will continue her tour in Mexico, where she is scheduled to complete 17 shows as part of the second leg of Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran.


	She is set to return to Estadio GNP Seguros on Sept. 18, where she will make history as the first artist ever to perform 12 concerts from the same tour at the iconic venue (formerly known as Foro Sol).
