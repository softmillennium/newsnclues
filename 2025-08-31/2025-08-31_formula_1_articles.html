                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘I had a really good weekend in the sessions where it mattered' – Piastri on Dutch GP win It was a day of mixed fortunes for Aston Martin in Qualifying for the Dutch Grand Prix, with Lance Stroll making an early exit following a spin into the barriers while Fernando Alonso progressed to P10. After a hefty crash in Friday's Free Practice 2 cut short the Canadian's running on that occasion, repair work from the Aston Martin team ensured that his car was ready for action again come Saturday. Reflecting on the incident afterwards, Stroll explained: “I got a wheel on the grass and that was it. Our chances now are kind of done.” On the other side of the garage, Fernando Alonso capitalised on the pace that Aston Martin had displayed on Friday – a day in which he ended FP2 in second place on the timesheets – by progressing through to Q3. Asked after the session if he was still pleased with his Qualifying efforts, Alonso answered: “Yeah, I think so. I think once you are in the top 10 it is already a target achieved on the weekend to enter Q3. “Obviously when you are last in Q3, 10th is not the best starting position but it's what we deserved today. “We have a different tyre selection than some other teams and hopefully tomorrow it pays off.” “I think after Spa we needed some Q3 appearances and [to] feel competitive, so the last two weekends have been good,” the 44-year-old conceded.</p>

2025 Dutch Grand Prix: Sainz incredulous after being hit with penalty for Lawson clash

Matt Youson takes a look at the different pit stop and tyre options that are available to the teams in the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.

McLaren's MCL39 is proving to be an excellent all-rounder – but the thing it likes best is medium-speed corners, and there's a lot of those at Zandvoort. The result, in Qualifying, was Oscar Piastri pipping Lando Norris to pole, as the papaya cars locked out the front row.

Behind them, it's more of a Stroopwafel-fight. Max Verstappen will start third – but Isack Hadjar did a magnificent job to join him on the second row, ahead of George Russell and the Ferraris.

On race day there will be different tyre strategies in play, and capricious weather around to mix things up. So let's take a look at the tactical options the teams have when the lights go out…
