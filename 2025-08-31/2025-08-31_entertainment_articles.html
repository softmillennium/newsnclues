                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley star in — and are generating considerable Oscar buzz for — the adaptation of Maggie O'Farrell's bestselling 2020 novel of the same name. It also has generated a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score (including a THR rave) and widespread Oscar buzz, not least for its lead performers. Telluride Awards Analysis: For Yorgos Lanthimos' Haunting 'Bugonia,' Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons Are Likely Headed Back to the Oscars 'H Is for Hawk' Review: Claire Foy and Her Bird Fly High in a Tender but Overlong Grief Drama Paul Mescal, an Oscar nominee for 2022's Aftersun, plays William, a man of words, and Jessie Buckley, an Oscar nominee for 2021's The Lost Daughter, plays Agnes, a woman of nature. As is also the case with another film at the fest, Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere, there is not a lot of joy in Hamnet — it's primarily a film about heartbreaking loss and crippling grief — but it is beautifully shot by the Oscar-nominated cinematographer Łukasz Żal (Ida and Cold War); features stunning sets by the Oscar-nominated production designer Fiona Crombie (The Favourite); is bolstered by a memorable score by Max Richter (Arrival); and showcases affecting performances by Mescal and Buckley. I would just caution that, while there are clearly many fans of the film in Telluride, I have also encountered a number of people from the industry who quietly profess to have not connected with it at all, with the term “trauma porn” coming up more than once. Plus, Telluride attendees have been known to get a bit of a Rocky Mountain high, on occasion, about films that later came back to earth — see 2021's C'mon C'mon and Cyrano, 2022's Empire of Light and Women Talking, 2023's Saltburn, and yes, 2024's September 5. So I will be very curious to see how Hamnet plays in the weeks and months to come — its next stop is the Toronto International Film Festival, and then Focus Features will begin rolling it out in theaters on Nov. 27 — when people will see it in the wake of such huge hype.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Decades after her work in Vertigo, Picnic and Bell Book and Candle made her Hollywood's biggest and most glamorous star, Kim Novak today came back for another closeup as the Venice Film Festival honored her with the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement. The festival is also screening Kim Novak's Vertigo, a documentary by Alexandre Philippe about a career that ended when she made the decision she'd had enough of the movie game. It is amusing how smitten that director clearly is with Novak, but after an hour on the phone with her, I too fell under her spell. After I told her to bring mosquito spray to Venice, she asked me about myself, and was soon counseling me on life in general and how best to help my 90-year old mother transition from a lonely apartment to an assisted living facility that might make her feel part of a community. 'Portobello' Trailer: First Look At Marco Bellocchio's HBO Max Riches-To-Rags Series - Venice Film Festival 'The Wizard Of The Kremlin': What The Critics Are Saying About Political Drama Featuring Jude Law As Vladimir Putin Much like her idol Marlene Dietrich, Novak walked away from the business under her own steam, and has largely kept to herself, marrying an equine veterinarian and busying herself raising horses and painting. Docu director Philippe grew up in a home with the same deep red wallpaper as in the iconic Vertigo scene where a surveilling James Stewart first glimpses Novak in all her gorgeousness. The director devotes a lot of the film in giving Novak the chance to relive that Alfred Hitchcock-directed classic that cast her in dual roles. Though it fell flat upon release, Vertigo is now acknowledged as one of the all time greats. Novak has little to say in the movie about her provocative relationship with Sammy Davis Jr,  which Colman Domingo is trying to turn into a Sydney Sweeney film. After a gossip columnist proclaimed the couple altar-bound, Columbia Pictures boss Harry Cohn put out the word that Davis Jr. might lose his other eye to the mob goons he would send if the relationship continued. Sources told me that their dalliance was actually not much more than a fling and that Novak wasn't heartbroken when it went public, because it created a reason to exit an affair that wasn't going to lead to marriage. And maybe there was an element of Novak just wanting to stick it to her iron-fisted movie boss Cohn whom she respected but fought with over the shackles of the studio contract system. DEADLINE: You grew up in Chicago, went on a road trip to promote a new line of home freezers, and embraced the suggestion of one of the two other models to check out Hollywood while you were on the West Coast. On a lark, you were an extra in a picture, got discovered and within two years you were the biggest female star in the business. It was funny because when I left Chicago to go on the modeling job, my mom and dad took me to the train and we all thought I'd be back soon. It was only within months really, before I did my first movie. It hit, things clicked and everything in my life changed. But of course, the journey is not always perfect, and you run into lots of things that you want to resist. A lot of people get tunnel vision and they've got in their mind a goal of what they're going to do and how they're going to react. It was so important that I went on a modeling job, but then everything just seemed to fall in place to change things. Then it becomes a matter of being able to recognize the path that you're on, and that often it'll take detours, but you've got to willing to follow the detours and recognize when doors open and be willing to go through them when they do. You also need to know when it is time to resist and say no, I'm not going down that road. I've often wondered, how did this happen to me? It came at the expense of giving up my life in Chicago, but on the other hand, there was more that made me want to go away somewhere. I remember at the time I was going out with this person and he wanted to get married. He didn't want to take no for an answer. For me, it's always better when that happens to write something out. I must've done a good job on that poem. DEADLINE: It is clear from the docu that you didn't succumb to the superficial star adulation that always proves hollow, and that you bristled under a system of being told what movies to do. Actresses now make those choices and while the Metoo revelations and the disparity in pay between actresses and actors shows the perils facing up and comers, it's a lot better than when you were a big star. What were the things you bristled against? NOVAK: It wasn't just the movies you were told to do. They even told you who to go out with. I mean, in other words, you needed to go out and promote your studio, so every time there was a premiere of a movie, you had to go, and they wanted to tell you who to go with. DEADLINE: They wanted the illusion you were half of a glamour couple and being romanced by the biggest stars? NOVAK: I did that for a bit, but you find yourself sitting in the limo with a stranger. I can't imagine those things go on today that you had to choose things from a career point of view of building yourself as a star and promoting your studio, because now there's no contract like that. It was hard, but so much of it was faith, and I had wonderful opportunities because of Harry Cohn. Yes, he was a dictator and everything you don't want in someone that you're working for. But then when he passed away, suddenly there was nobody who knew what was really good, who to put in what movie…they just didn't know. NOVAK: They never had an opportunity to use their own judgments because Harry Cohn made all the decisions. I felt I was at a stalemate and finally thought, wow, I'm not going to stay around Hollywood and just wait for something good to happen. They offered me some beach party movie that was so stupid and made no sense to me. DEADLINE: That had been a creative outlet you found while acting? NOVAK: Art is one of the things that saved me in my life. I think if I didn't have it, I couldn't have lived in the Hollywood system as it was at the time. Somewhere that was more valuable from my perspective of doing. DEADLINE: It seems funny you say that no one knew how to pick good scripts like Harry Cohn, and yet in the documentary you say he gave you the Vertigo script and contracted your services to another studio, but said, I'm going to let you do this with Alfred Hitchcock because I respect him, but the script is terrible. How did you react to that proclamation? NOVAK: Well, when he said it, I was still new in the business. I didn't even know the reputation of Alfred Hitchcock. So I listened to what Harry Cohn said, that he's a really good director, doing a lousy script. That's the actual words he said, lousy script. But I had been in Picnic and some good movies that he put together and that I was so right for, when I was under contract. There were some others that were not so good, but I had no say so about them. But there was one I really wanted to do, and I fought for and did it even when he told me I shouldn't do this movie, it's not good. And that was called Middle of the Night. DEADLINE: A May-December romance written by Paddy Chayevsky from his play, and directed by Delbert Mann… NOVAK: Here was a brilliant writer and wonderful director. And Frederic March was an incredible actor. I loved the part so much, and I wanted it because it wasn't one of those glamour parts. It wasn't about her being so pretty or anything. It was about a real working girl, who allowed herself to be in love with an older man. It's not going to be a commercial success. But I will never change anything about it or the experience. All the Hollywood movies I'd done before, we never rehearsed. But in that movie, we shot it in two or three weeks, but that was because we rehearsed for a couple of weeks. So afterwards when it came out and it was not a hit, he said, ‘I told you this was not going to be good. But I also look back and realize I didn't really fully appreciate the gifts [Cohn] gave me and opportunities to play in some incredible movies with great directors. DEADLINE: I wrote a book about The Three Stooges, who labored 24 years on the Columbia lot doing shorts for Harry Cohn. I came away feeling he really liked them and especially Moe Howard, but he wasn't above making them feel insecure about how the short subjects department was going to be shuttered. There were a lot of years when The Stooges were afraid to ask for raises, even though their classic shorts were often more popular than the feature films they preceded on the big screen. And when Cohn died, it was Red Skelton who remarked on the large attendance at Cohn's funeral and quipped that when you give the people what they want, they come in droves. Talk about the Harry Cohn you knew. NOVAK: He really had an iron fist, on everything. And I resented him in a lot of ways. On the other hand, one time, when Christmas was coming up, I thought, that bastard, I'm going to do something. So I went to his office and he says, ‘what are you here for? And I presented it with the homemade chocolate fudge. And I swear for the only time I've ever seen it with him, he melted. He didn't want me to see it, but I could see it in his expressions, it was like no one ever did this for me before. No one ever brought me a present. And after that, I resented some things, like you had to do this and do that. But at the same time, I suddenly found somebody that was vulnerable also. It took chocolate fudge to show a softness that certainly, I don't know that anyone ever saw that in him, but I saw it for a brief time. And then he said, ‘well, go on. DEADLINE: You don't spend time on the documentary on this, but you had a famous friendship with Sammy Davis Jr. after you met on the Steve Allen Show. After a gossip columnist reported you were headed toward marriage, legend has it that Harry Cohn got a message to Sammy and said he was going to send some mob guys and take out the one working eye he had. Cohn was protecting his investment in making sure his biggest star was not on the arm of a Black man, as unfair as that seems now. Sammy Davis Jr. had a rougher road to stardom than you because of the rampant racism he battled in Hollywood and Las Vegas, but you both had reps for being defiant and principled. NOVAK: We both reacted the same way. How dare you tell us who we can see and who we can't see. It brought out the defiance in both of us, because [Cohn] actually threatened [Davis Jr]. You're not going to threaten me with that.' I've always been against racial things like that. To me, it was almost a challenge. I didn't realize how badly [Cohn] would react, from the point of view of his health, because he died very shortly after that. But on the other hand, it was wrong. I think he was racist, and I think that he felt that this would get all the racists against me. But it became, what are you willing to stand up for in life? And you've got to be willing to stand up for what is right over wrong and in humanity. It's what we're going through in our country right now, and we can't be afraid and not do something because someone wrongfully tells you that you shouldn't do it. DEADLINE: But from his standpoint of running Columbia Pictures, you are Harry Cohn's biggest asset, and he felt this might puncture the Dream Factory balloon and destroy that asset. He protected his investment, but it has to be doubly detestable for you to have it reinforced that you're considered a possession as opposed to a person who works for a boss. DEADLINE: Did you cool your relationship with Sammy just out of concern for his family's safety? NOVAK: It's one thing for you to stand up for yourself and what you believe in. But on the other hand, when I found out that they were not only threatening him with his life, but his family? Of course that became the important thing. So they made him marry this Black actress and it only lasted a year. The whole thing still seems crazy to me. But I felt in a way that by seeing him, it would make other people feel that it was not an evil thing to see a Black man. DEADLINE: Thankfully, it's not a stigma anymore. NOVAK: I thought maybe I could help people see it, but unfortunately, there was still so many other people that were not willing to move forward and into a better way of thinking. But I was hoping to get a reaction that would help, that would be liberating to people rather than be looked upon badly. I was hoping I could have an influence on turning the corner on all of that. The Civil Rights movement had only just begun to take root. And yet I was not able to advance the way people reacted. I really thought I was going to be able to help, and Sammy did too. Because for him, he was constantly having to prove himself worthy. And that's why he was so brilliant at it. He wouldn't take anything less because it required for him as a Black man to have to prove himself to be better than anybody else at what he did. Some of the stories he told me from when he was in the service were unbelievable, how they treated him and what he had to endure. DEADLINE: It was eye-opening for you to see the limit of influence Hollywood's biggest actress could have on the culture, but a surprise for me was how little time you had to enjoy the glamour that should have come with your standing. Would you say that being Hollywood's biggest female star was overrated? DEADLINE: They made you change the name for fear of confusion with Marilyn Monroe… NOVAK: They had another name they picked out for me, and I just wouldn't accept it. He said, this is the name you are taking, this is who you are. I wasn't going to have people call me Kit Marlowe, like I was some kitten. I mean, there's nothing kitten-like or cat-like about me, and I just couldn't do it. And I'm so glad I didn't, because keeping the name Novak made me real, to me. DEADLINE: You did that yet again when you went on strike, and got your salary doubled from $1250 a week to $3000. How hard was it to stand up like that and buck an established system where actresses were taught to feel disposable and to keep their mouths shut even as they were being paid a fraction of what their male co-stars got? I had no idea that Vertigo would turn out to be what it became, but I had to be willing to hold out for it and have the belief that what is right will win. And it was right to get paid more. Right and wrong was always important, and I believed that by really holding on for what I really believed in, it would work out. But it was always a risk; I could have lost the opportunity to play that role. I didn't know it was going to be a hit, but nonetheless, it was an opportunity to work with supposedly a great director. DEADLINE: You didn't know Vertigo would be a classic, but you probably also didn't know that when Harry Cohn loaned you out to Paramount Pictures to make that movie, he likely was pocketing fees that exceeded what you were being paid on a weekly basis, right? Although I didn't know that, but of course it had to be. Years later, you made a movie called The Legend of Lylah Clare, played the lead role and only learned after the fact they had dubbed your voice with that of a German-speaking actress. NOVAK: Yeah, well, it wasn't until the premiere. I hadn't seen any of it, and all of a sudden I'm watching myself, and hearing this voice coming across. [Director Robert Aldrich] wanted me to speak with a German accent, but I didn't think that it was right, so I didn't do it. If he'd have told me, you have to do it, this is what I want you to do, I would've done it probably. If that's what he really wanted, he should have said so, and I'd have followed through. But to all of a sudden hear that? I remember leaving the theater and he was in front, and I wouldn't even talk to him. I just got in my limo and left. DEADLINE: How do you think your sometime costar Frank Sinatra would have reacted, had that been done to him? There was a man who held out for what he believed, and he was a great influence, in telling me that I should stand up and hold out for more money in my contract. And he was the one, Frank Sinatra, who convinced me to go with his agents because he said, they'll get you the deal and it'll work. And when I said, well, it's all right, I'll figure it out, he said, no, you're worth more. He was very influential in making my life better. DEADLINE: In the docu, you talk about doing Pal Joey with him. You worked hard training and learning all these dance moves. NOVAK: Well, see now, in this this time in my life, I totally understand it. But at one time, he was a best friend when I first did a movie with him. But then when we did Pal Joey, it was like he suddenly thought he was the big man over everything and anything. I worked so hard on those dance moves, over and over, and this was all news to me. It was an opportunity for me to show what I could do. I worked so hard, and God knows Rita Hayworth did also. And then he comes onto the stage for the first time, after we've been working on these routines for weeks. To me, he was like a different person. That's how I looked at it then. DEADLINE: Maybe by then your former best friend felt he needed to protect his brand and had the clout to do it? And I realized that for him, it was also necessary to believe in what he was doing. When he became Joey, it was amazing. I thought, how could he be so different? In fact, he asked me to go out again with him. I didn't want to go out with him because I thought, well, he's a phony. But now, when I look at it in retrospect, and of course I've thought of this now for quite a while, I realize what he was doing. He was just learning his part, learning to be Joey, and he became Joey. And that I understand, totally, because I also had this fear of becoming too deeply involved in the characters. That's a lot of what he was going through. DEADLINE: We discussed your complicated relationship with Harry Cohn, who, like your directors Hitchcock and Otto Preminger, had reputations for being tyrannical. And even though you had a rep for standing your ground, you got along great with all of them. NOVAK: Well, because they respected you for being on time, for really working hard and learning your lines. Otto Preminger was so hard on so many people, but usually because they showed up a few minutes late. My God, he didn't forgive them for that. Or if they didn't know their lines, they'd ask the script girl, what was it I just said? He seemed surprised that I took it seriously. It wasn't, oh, come on, so I'm a little late. So all I had to do was be honest and not dishonest. But in his appreciation, we became great friends. But the other thing about Otto Preminger is, he realized at the same time how vulnerable I was. Some people were not as vulnerable and they could take it. But he knew I couldn't take it. If he was yelling at me, I would just start to cry, go to my dressing room. DEADLINE: You talk wistfully in the documentary about Marilyn Monroe, and how she was a cautionary tale. What is interesting is the way you describe your home life in Chicago before you came, it doesn't sound like there was a ton of love there. Then you become the biggest star in Hollywood. I always thought Marilyn Monroe was an unloved person who sought out love and adulation that could proved superficial and empty. I cannot imagine you would have been able to walk away from the business if you craved that adulation the way Marilyn Monroe did. And poor Marilyn, she had no roots. And then you suddenly realize that it wasn't genuine. But it's because she didn't have the things that I learned from my family, a sense of right and wrong and decency and all of that. She used herself a lot physically to appeal to men, but it was for the wrong reasons. But only because she never had anyone to teach her right from wrong and what was okay and to set limits. DEADLINE: You discussed having had several houses burn to the ground. But on the other hand, I rationalized it by saying, and this is true actually, that it was a catharsis, writing that book. I got quite far in the writing, doing it all myself with no one helping me, just pouring out all my feelings and reactions and my time in Hollywood. It was totally exhausting, but in the best way. But then when I lost it, as I say, in order to survive a loss that felt so tremendous, I took to calling it a catharsis. And that turned out to be true. I've never been a person who cared about how much money I made, it was most important to work on something good that was important to me. So money didn't come into it. DEADLINE: Makes it easier when you don't need the cash, even though the trauma of losing that memoir and many of your paintings, well that's something some in Hollywood are still dealing with after losing their homes in the LA wildfires. NOVAK: I feel so badly for all of them. DEADLINE: That made you not be bitter or beating yourself up for not putting those backup discs someplace safe, and you could focus on the value of writing a memoir for you and no one else? Even if it was just for me and no one else. I actually came to that thinking pretty fast because the loss was overwhelming. The other stuff like money, didn't matter. DEADLINE: Even though your rise was meteoric, actresses had it harder than they do today. But then we watched the appalling revelations that came out of the MeToo movement, and the abuses of actresses by Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men. It makes you wonder, how much have things really changed? If you were talking to a young actress who is poised to have a career, what would you say about guardrails that might keep her on the right track, and avoid looking for instant gratification like Marilyn Monroe did that puts one in danger of being used? NOVAK: Well, I think more than anything, and it covers all of these things is, be true to yourself. Find roles you want to play, for the right reasons. If they're the right reasons, you'll be able to identify with that character. And I mean, it's just so, so important to hold on to that respect for good over evil, and to really care about what you stand for. It may sound silly to them and they might say, what I stand for is I want that part. Just like my book, it was meant to burn up in the fire. I'd have kept going, but fate or God or whatever you want to call it, stepped in and brought another fire and I might have lost it all there. DEADLINE: You are able to compartmentalize adversity better than I would be… NOVAK: You know what the best thing was to come out of one of those fires? There was an island that got flooded, and my husband and I were going down the river in a kayak, and we saw this nest. We rescued these eggs that were in the nest. And my husband being a veterinarian, he had the equipment where we were able to get them hatched. I talked to those eggs, every day. So by the time they were hatched, I was definitely their mother. Now, they were at the stage of going out on dates and staying overnight, and so they were not there when the fire happened. Here's their house, burned down to the ground. And so I right away hopped in a little rowboat I had, and they jumped in and we just stood off in the distance, watching as I tried to help them understand that things happen in life and that how we react to them is what matters. And I remember Bob, my husband, being on the shore thinking, what the hell are you doing out there with these geese when we've just lost everything? But I knew they were like my kids, and they couldn't understand it and I had to explain it to them. But Bob didn't appreciate that, because what I also needed was to be with him, to help him understand that it happened for some kind of reason. NOVAK: It was a place we didn't build. It was like a lodge, old, and this had a lot to do with the old wiring. And so I said, we will be able to get a new house and make it just the way we want it. We both loved the property, there were three islands on it with our horse riding trails and everything was still possible, after we did it over with all this new stuff. It took a lot to convince him. One day, he said, you were right. We just loved the property because it gave us things for our horses and everything else. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Béla Tarr made Abigail's Party if might look something like this, an elevated cringe comedy that marks a return, of sorts, to the kind of portmanteau movie Jim Jarmusch made in the late '80s and early '90s. The theme is very simple — family — but there are other overlaps too, with jokes that recur, like various iterations of the British phrase “Bob's your uncle”, which clearly tickled Jarmusch somewhere on his travels. It's slight for sure, and true to his word in Cannes 2023 it does make his last film, Paterson, look like a Jean Claude Van Damme action film, but it's good to see that he's moved away from his not very productive period spent fruitlessly trying to re-energize stale horror tropes. 'Portobello' Trailer: First Look At Marco Bellocchio's HBO Max Riches-To-Rags Series - Venice Film Festival True to form, Father Mother Sister Brother brings together an extraordinarily eclectic cast; some of them familiar faces from the Jarmusch cinematic universe, but, trust me, you won't have seen them quite like this before. Split into three sections, interspersed with trippy light patterns and a plangent avant-garde guitar score by the director himself and frequent collaborator Annika Henderson, it looks at three family units in three time zones, moving slowly east from the nondescript nowheresvilles of north-east America, to Dublin then Paris. Linked by Dusty Springfield's slinky cover of “Spooky”, which has no apparent thematic relevance whatsoever, Jarmusch's triptych opens with “Father”, which stars Adam Driver and Mayam Bialik as Jeff and Emily, two straitlaced siblings traveling upstate to see their father (Tom Waits). As evidenced by their conversation, Father is something of a conundrum to the pair of them (“How does Daddy survive, exactly?”), and they don't seem especially close either. Inevitably, the meeting is a disaster, and Jarmusch keeps things dryly tantalizing, hinting at Father's bohemian past with references to books by Reich and Chomsky, a very funny checklist of every drug under the sun, and, most baffling of all to Emily, what appears to be a genuine Rolex on the old man's wrist. The second story, “Mother”, is completely unrelated, this time reversing the dynamic with the effect that Mother (Charlotte Rampling) is a well-to-do and possibly rather racy novelist, whose two misfit daughters are coming to visit. Timothea (Cate Blanchett) is the practical but nerdy type whose car breaks down along the way; Lilith (Vicky Krieps) is the pink-haired dropout type, who forces her girlfriend to drop her off round the corner so that she can pretend that she can afford an Uber. This one stars Indya Moore as Skye and Luka Sabbat as Billy, two siblings dealing with their parents' estate, but, disappointingly, there's no side to their conversation, as there has been previously. It has precedent in Jarmusch's low-key canon, like the intimate scenes with two Japanese tourists in Mystery Train, but it sticks out a little uncomfortably here, guiding the film to its oblique, see-yourself-out conclusion rather than providing a satisfying ending. Whenever films like this pop up, there's always a chorus of “BUT WHO'S IT FOR?”, a complaint that the director has likely been dealing with since his first brush with arthouse stardom over 40 years ago with Stranger Than Paradise. Indeed, compared to 2005's Broken Flowers, this is a wilfully obscure step back to his deadpan, experimental roots, a gentle, almost deliberately un-film that is best not viewed in too much proximity to the witching hour. Nothing seems to land, but somehow it lingers; enjoy it or not, Father Mother Sister Brother will worm its way into your brain like false memory syndrome, a fitfully funny, if never laugh-out-loud reminder that you can't choose your family.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services. Packed into the film‘s triptych of globe-spanning episodes about estranged adult children and their late-in-life parents coming together again (at least geographically speaking, when not emotionally) is a profound appeal: If we as children don't bother to ask our parents questions, meet them halfway, why should they bother with us? If you felt not loved by your parents enough as a child or rejected by them as an adult, maybe that's because they felt you didn't need them anymore, and so resumed living their own lives. What if familial damage is too late to repair? Jarmusch would argue it's not, though with his hushedly sad new movie, he's not about to coax his characters along the psychoanalytic dotted line from childhood resentment to coughed-up, adult-age catharsis. Writer/director Jarmusch has called “Father Mother Sister Brother,” which he wrote in three weeks, an “anti-action film,” but if you're looking closely enough or tuned in to its hangout-movie sensibility, it has more action than most bona fide action movies, even when much of the action here is offscreen, under-the-surface, unsaid. He cuts through the scrambling frequency of stunted emotions like a hyper-focused samurai, with a katana in bullet time, a reverb-guitar-driving musical score he wrote himself encouraging you to pause and smell the roses. Jarmusch, the slow-cinema beat poet who has long eschewed theatrical drama in favor of slices of life in which nothing much happens, yet everything also does, drains “Father Mother Sister Brother” of easy or any resolution. It's a meditation on, not a mining of, ordinary people who bring to their present some kind of past discontent that's never articulated. Like Adam Driver and Mayim Bialik in the section “Father” as siblings doing a wellness check on their hermit-crab father (a wonderfully gristly septuagenarian Tom Waits, who's been kicking with Jarmsuch for decades now). They resemble more a pair of child welfare agents or insurance salespeople in their chilly remove from their dad when they show up to his porch, having spent the car ride over equivocating about a prior incident at their mother's funeral. In that car ride, the brother and sister talk like nervous neighbors over a fence. The story resets, and the characters shuffle: Gathering across the pond in Dublin are Timothea (Cate Blanchett) and Lilith (Vicky Krieps) at their mother's (Charlotte Rampling) home for afternoon tea in “Mother.” Lilith, a hustling fashionista and influencer with teased-out pink hair, seems to have money troubles, unable to afford the Uber there or back despite a designer bag over her shoulder and in conspicuously consumptive, boho-chic digs. And in a Jarmusch movie, it isn't much. Finally, in the third segment, “Sister Brother,” twin siblings Skye (Indya Moore) and Billy (Luka Sabbat) meet in Paris to microdose psilocybin and sift through the remaining personal effects left behind by their parents, who died in a plane crash over the Azores. While this might be the least potent of the three stories only because it has the most traceable dramatic structure, the wistful chapter ends “Father Mother Sister Brother” on a note of guarded hope and humanity that reminds of Jarmusch's ripened optimism in cynicism-stirring times, a patient balladeer who believes life is worth living. That's despite the first story, “Father,” feeling like a less disillusioned twist on Raymond Carver that leaves the parent-child divide unresolved, Jeff (Driver) and Emily (Bialik) not wanting to stay a minute longer in their father's house, unready to let go of whatever their beef is. “What do we say we toast to family relations?” their spacing-out father says over a coffee (can you toast with coffee?). It's telling and tricky and pointed he's not simply saying “family”; it's easier, after all, to put quotation marks or some distance around any earnest feeling. Sometimes, we only stay linked to the people who birthed us and raised us because of the nagging, plugged-into-our-DNA directive of family relations. Jarmusch may not be explicitly referencing Carver, though both artists have made an unadorned style their identity. In “One More Thing,” an alcoholic preparing to run out on his family like he's readying for nuclear war, and for reasons not spelled out in Carver's compressed, real-time prose, wants to say “one more thing. But then he could not think what it could possibly be.” In other words, the characters in “Father Mother Sister Brother” brush up against revelation, but they haven't the emotional vocabulary or even the literal words to get there, and Jarmusch doesn't coax it out of them. Even Jarmusch's apparent use of rear-screen projection in several driving scenes feels cozier and more tactile than many actual locations I've seen in recent movies. That “Father Mother Sister Brother” is produced by fashion house Saint Laurent lends toward some thoughtfully chosen costume and set design, with the detail even of a more grandly ambitious (i.e., expensive and not independent) film. In nestling “Father Mother Sister Brother” along the shelf of past Jarmusch joints that also rove and ramble with a shuffling futility and a disregard for manufactured drama, this feels closest to “Coffee and Cigarettes” or “Night on Earth”: Vignettes with loosely connective tissue, here in this film a Rolex watch that appears in all three sections and characters using the British idiom “and Bob's your uncle” to the confusion of a few others. “But Tim's our uncle,” Jeff tells his father in one of the film's drollest retorts. And “Father Mother Sister Brother” is about as dry as a physical copy of short stories you've loved since you were a child. There are no protagonists or antagonists, just people moving through life, Jarmusch catching moments of them the way that David Lynch once caught ideas like fish moving down a stream. This is a movie Lynch would've admired, brittly funny and content to linger in doorways and thresholds for as long as it takes until somebody breaks the awkward silence. At the end of “Mother,” Rampling, Blanchett, and Krieps stand at the doorway, waiting for Krieps' Uber, but they have nothing to say to each other. Let's hope those idea-fish keep coming down the river. “Father Mother Sister Brother” premiered at the 2025 Venice Film Festival.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I was just caught off guard and had no answer for my grandsons," the rapper wrote. Snoop Dogg is speaking out after facing backlash for his recent remarks about LGBTQ+ representation in children's movies. Madison had criticized him for his reaction to a same-sex couple depicted in the 2022 animated film Lightyear. “I was just caught off guard and had no answer for my grandsons,” Snoop wrote. “All my gay friends [know] what's up they been calling me with love .” He added, “My bad for not knowing the answers for a 6 yr old … teach me how to learn I'm not perfect.” Snoop's comments came days after he appeared on the Aug. 20 episode of Dr. Sarah Fontenot's It's Giving podcast, where he recalled taking his grandson to see Lightyear. During the film, he discovered that one of the female characters was in a same-sex marriage and had children with her wife. “Why my grandson in the middle of the movie like, ‘Papa Snoop, how she have a baby with a woman? Like, y'all throwing me in the middle of s—t that I don't have an answer for,” Snoop said. We have to show that at this age? His remarks sparked swift backlash online, with many accusing him of being homophobic. “As we wrote early versions of what became LIGHTYEAR, a key character needed a partner, and it was so natural to write ‘she' instead of ‘he,'” Gunderson wrote. The scene also drew criticism from right-wing political figures in the United States, who accused Disney of promoting a “pro-LGBTQ+ agenda.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Snoop Dogg has apologized after receiving widespread pushback for his comments about the LGBTQ+ representation in Pixar's 2022 movie “Lightyear.” During an episode of the “It's Giving” podcast, posted on August 20, 2025, the 16-time Grammy winner and coach on “The Voice” complained that the kids' movie included a scene with a lesbian couple and their child, noting that he didn't know how to explain their relationship to his curious grandkids and that it made him “scared to go to the movies.” On August 31, 2025, Deadline first reported that Snoop has since apologized in writing, responding to an Instagram post in which Emmy- and Grammy-winner T.S. Madison told TMZ that “it is time to have these uncomfortable conversations” rather than refrain from reflecting different types of families and relationships in the media. “I was just caught off guard and had no answer for my grandsons,” Snoop wrote in the comments, adding, “all my gay friends no what's up they been calling me with love 💗 my bad for not knowing the answers for a 6 yr old 😳teach me how to learn I'm not perfect 🙌🏿🙏🏾🐾” Snoop's apology was in response to clips from a TMZ interview with Madison, a frequent judge on “RuPaul's Drag Race,” on a series of clips from her TMZ interview, in which she said parents need to be able to “explain to your children that other things exist in the world outside of what you have deemed normal in your own home.” Madison added, “We've always, as queer people, been pushed to the side and swept under (the rug), so it is time for us to have these uncomfortable conversations. Maybe not at (age) four – maybe Papa will ‘explain that to you in a year or so, just watch the movie. Everyone not against the gay and trans community. This is something newly publicly known to us. During his August 20 appearance on the “It's Giving” podcast, Snoop recalled one of his grandkids asking him about a scene in which two moms were shown holding their baby. Snoop said, “They're like, ‘She had a baby — with another woman.' I just came to watch the [expletive] movie. Noting that his grandson asked again how two women had a baby together, Snoop said, “It [expletive] me up. Y'all throwing me in the middle of [expletive] that I don't have an answer for… It threw me for a loop. I'm like, ‘What part of the movie was this?' We have to show that at this age? A spokesperson for the LGBT Foundation told Newsweek, “Seeing LGBTQ+ people on screen is powerful and helps everyone feel seen. Negative remarks from high-profile figures cause real harm by fueling stigma and undermining hard-won progress.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hunter Fieri (yes, the eldest son of Guy Fieri) has officially married professional pickleball player Tara Bernstein in Sonoma, California. According to an exclusive with People, their wedding wasn't just a union of two, it was a weekend-long celebration full of family, food, and plenty of personal touches. Held at the family's Hunt Ryde Ranch, the couple pulled off an event that felt part festival, part love story, and honestly, 100% them. People reports, the party started with a “Denim & Diamonds” welcome dinner, complete with Mexican dishes by Chef Lorena Garcia, a cooler guests could sign instead of a guest book, and video tributes projected under the stars. By the next day, the ranch turned into a wedding wonderland; complete with campsites, a ceremony set on an island beneath a willow tree, and even a petting zoo featuring donkeys adorably named Burrito and Taquito (yes, donkeys with Mexican food names). Tara wore a custom ballgown designed by Justin Alexander, Hunter's grandmother Mimi took on the role of flower girl at 81 years old, and the wedding party received engraved cowboy boots as keepsakes. Everywhere you looked, it was clear how much thought went into making guests feel part of the celebration. Naturally, no Fieri wedding would be complete without an epic menu. Hunter and Tara teamed up with chefs like Antonia Lofaso, Cesar Orozco, Aaron May, and Garcia to create a family-style Italian spread, per People. Guests shared platters of pasta, charred meats, and fresh salads, giving the night a cozy, communal vibe. Dessert came courtesy of Buddy Valastro, who designed a towering six-tier cake featuring nods to both food and pickleball. The drinks were just as thoughtful: Hunter had his signature “Fieri Sunrise” cocktail, while Tara's pick was a fresh honeydew mocktail inspired by the US Open. Hunter and Tara's romance has moved quickly but naturally. People says that they first met at the Super Bowl in 2023, and within nine months, Hunter proposed at the same ranch where they'd later exchange vows. For Tara, it wasn't about a dream wedding she'd pictured since childhood… it was about finding someone who instantly felt like home. And judging by the joy that radiated through their wedding, married life looks like it's going to be one long celebration.</p>

The 82nd Venice Film Festival has yielded at least one standout, unanimously liked by critics and audiences, turning it into the hottest ticket for an event that also welcomes public ticket-buyers: Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice,” which Neon already has for stateside release. The South Korean “Old Boy” and “The Handmaiden” filmmaker has never been nominated for an Oscar, but this exuberantly well-directed satire starring Lee Byung-hun as a literal paper-pusher pushed to the murderous brink by a depressed job market is a timely, invigorating catch for Venice. Man-soo (Lee) is laid off from his job, and sets about killing off the competition to make himself the only standing specialist in his field. Led by filmmaker Alexander Payne and including master, decorated directors like Romania's Cristian Mungiu and Iran's Mohammad Rasoulof, the jury will no question award “No Other Choice” a prize. IndieWire also earlier declared “No Other Choice” an Academy Awards contender; Neon, though, has a very busy international slate with Cannes winners “It Was Just an Accident,” “Sentimental Value,” “The Secret Agent,” and “Sirat,” which could all be in the running for the Best International Feature shortlist. But back to Venice: Netflix has premiered two out of its three festival titles so far, Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly” and Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein.” Jacob Elordi has earned strong critical notices for his physically transformative portrayal of Victor Frankenstein's monster; critics, meanwhile, like George Clooney's turn as a famous Hollywood actor at the end of his tether well enough in Baumbach's comedy. But critical reaction has been split on the latter, which is more sentimental and misty-eyed than Baumbach's past films. Del Toro, meanwhile, won the Golden Lion in 2017 for “The Shape of Water”; Venice is a hospitable environment to the beloved Mexican filmmaker, whose new film has its range of ardent fans and admirers even if some reviews are less keen on his latest, high-budget gothic vision. Swept aside due to its position as the first screening of the festival after Paolo Sorrentino's muted opener “La Grazia,” László Nemes' post-World-War-II, “Come and See”-esque coming-of-ager “Orphan” hasn't elicited much chatter. It's a skillfully shot and disturbing portrait of Budapest 1957 about a young boy meeting the surly man who claims to be his long-lost father. Nemes hasn't hit the zeitgeist since his 2015 perspectival Holocaust survival drama, “Son of Saul,” which won the Best International Feature Oscar. Yorgos Lanthimos' sci-fi satire “Bugonia,” starring Emma Stone as a CEO executive kidnapped by conspiracist Jesse Plemons because he thinks she's an alien, made a strong early impression on the festival. Olivier Assayas' “The Wizard of Kremlin,” with Paul Dano as a fictional kingmaker to Jude Law's Vladimir Putin, premiered on Sunday and has earned tepid reviews. Homegrown Italian filmmaker Gianfranco Rosi's black-and-white documentary “Below the Clouds,” a portrait of Neapolitan everyday-ers under Mount Vesuvius, could stand to earn some kind of filmmaking prize for its ruminative black-and-white cinematography and patient editing. There's still much to come, from “The Brutalist” Oscar nominee Mona Fastvold's historical musical drama “The Testament of Ann Lee” (which Brady Corbet co-wrote and produced, as Fastvold did 2024 Venice winner “The Brutalist”) to Benny Safdie's A24 solo directing outing “The Smashing Machine” and Kathryn Bigelow's Netflix thriller “A House of Dynamite.” Tonight, Jim Jarmusch's latest, “Father Mother Sister Brother” will premiere. But right now, the easiest mark if you're predicting a Venice award winner is, full stop, Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice.” Stay tuned for updates in this post as more Venice contenders shake out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Tonight, I have the pleasure of singing with someone who is a true example of hard work, perseverance, talent, and beauty," Shakira said. Belinda surprised Shakira fans who attended the Colombian superstar's eleventh concert on Saturday (Aug. 30) at Estadio GNP Seguros in Mexico City. The Mexican singer joined Shakira on stage to perform the iconic ballad “Día de Enero” together, creating one of the most emotional moments of Shakira's Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran international tour. “Tonight, I have the pleasure of singing with someone who is a true example of hard work, perseverance, talent, and beauty,” Shakira said while introducing Belinda to the 65,000 fans who packed the venue, according to promoter OCESA. The song, originally dedicated to Shakira's ex-partner Antonio de la Rúa, is from her 2005 album, Fijación Oral Vol. This special version of “Día de Enero” blended Belinda's soft and sweet vocals with Shakira's signature melancholic touch, making for a moving duet. Belinda and Shakira's friendship appears to have grown closer since they were spotted together at a party thrown by Venezuelan singer and content creator Lele Pons in Miami in 2024, a celebration of Shakira's track “Soltera” whose guests included Danna and Kenia OS. At the end of Saturday night's performance, an emotional Belinda knelt down as a sign of respect and gratitude toward Shakira. Thank you for this opportunity — I'll never forget it. Shakira will continue her tour in Mexico, where she is scheduled to complete 17 shows as part of the second leg of Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran. She is set to return to Estadio GNP Seguros on Sept. 18, where she will make history as the first artist ever to perform 12 concerts from the same tour at the iconic venue (formerly known as Foro Sol).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adapted by Will Tracy, a former editor of The Onion who later wrote on Succession and penned 2022's The Menu, from Jang Joon-hwan‘s 2003 South Korean film Save the Green Planet!, Bugonia is an absurdist comedy. It centers on two American oddball cousins (Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis), one of whom “does his own research” and the other of whom follows him deep down a rabbit hole, who team up to kidnap an American corporate titan (Stone) because they believe she is actually an alien intent to destroy the earth. 'H Is for Hawk' Review: Claire Foy and Her Bird Fly High in a Tender but Overlong Grief Drama At a time when social isolation, information silos and the deliberate propagation of misinformation in the real world are fueling widespread and dangerous conspiratorial beliefs and real acts of violence, a story like this, with characters like these, seems frighteningly plausible. Though elements of it evoke thoughts of The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, it also calls to mind dark social satires like 1975's Dog Day Afternoon and 1976's Network, the latter of which was name-checked by Stone, during a post-screening Q&A, as a film that seemed sensationalist when it was released, but 50 years later seems stunningly prescient. I think that it's very possible that members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will appreciate the intent of Bugonia — which Focus Features will release in U.S. theaters on Oct. 24 — and recognize it in a variety of categories, including best picture, best director and best adapted screenplay. The Academy, as it is currently composed, has far less of an aversion to “genre films” than the organization used to. See: Oscar recognition for 2017's The Shape of Water, 2019's Parasite, 2022's Everything Everywhere All at Once and, yes, Poor Things. But whatever happens in other categories, I think it's almost certain that Stone, a four-time Oscar nominee who won best actress for 2016's La La Land and Poor Things, and Plemons, a best supporting actor Oscar nominee for 2021's The Power of the Dog, will be nominated for lead acting awards in recognition of performances that required a tremendous level of commitment — and make a haunting impression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not easy to be a convincing humorist in pop music. By design, lyrics are always meant to be a little quirky but few pop stars have mastered the art of hamming it up quite like Sabrina Carpenter. On Man's Best Friend, Carpenter is in break-up mode the only way she could be: sad but still horny and altogether self-aware. Just a year out from her blockbuster breakthrough Short n' Sweet, the singer's seventh album was created with a tight crew who had been integral to her previous release: Jack Antonoff, Amy Allen and John Ryan. Her new songs are united in their grooviness as Carpenter's heartbreak and disappointment in her male options takes her on a thoroughly modern tour of what dating, embracing, and then flipping the script on the humiliation ritual that is being a woman who dates men. From the opening “Oh, boy” on “Manchild,” Carpenter spends the entire album dishing out tough love for her lovers, unrelenting in listing out her grievances. Carpenter has few peers these days when it comes to turning some of the most uncomfortable or even painful feelings when you're crying over an ex into giggle-worthy treats. The slow burning, sexy song has her wishing the best for her ex — so long as he stays in his house and never looks or touches another woman again. She drinks the pain away on “Go Go Juice,” running through the numbers on her phone over a two-steppin' beat that belongs in your local honky tonk.

It may have taken Carpenter six albums to finally find the right formula that works for her as a budding pop diva, but now it's clear there's no looking back.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About a month back, we reported on the advent of Showrunner, a new “streaming service”—currently housed, it feels worth noting, in the bowels of a Discord server—built entirely around generative AI content prompted up by users, and all apparently designed to look like the shittiest Rick And Morty clone you've ever seen. If you've seen stories on Showrunner's whole deal—or, and we'll get to this in a minute, personally subjected yourself to the horrors it's crapping out—you could be excused for thinking that the person behind it must be operating under some “extreme, even for a techbro” levels of optimistic artificial intelligence delusion. Saatchi believes that generative AI is not just about making things cheaper and more shittily than they could be made by hand, but in forging bold new frontiers in extremely awkward and unwatchable entertainment. Here's his actual take: “We think the Toy Story of AI [drink!] Most people feel that generative AI is a tool to make the same, but cheaper, and we're trying to say it's a new kind of medium. I feel like the industry is kind of cutting off that exploratory element with generative AI by just shoving it into movies.” (Ugly characters that gesticulate randomly; “performances” cast in awful impressions of celebrity cadences; stage directions being read like dialogue; hack jokebook jokes; etc.) Here's what all that sounds like in Saatchi-talk, as he waxes megalomaniacal about getting Dave Filoni to oversee what will definitely not be just a huge number of attempts at tricking the AI into pooping out a sex scene: “These models would have real characters and a world that could be explored through prompting, and you could also inadvertently trigger scenes within those worlds in a way that would make it feel as though you're uncovering something unknown.” Sincere credit to Verge writer Charles Pulliam-Moore for not taking any of this stuff at face value, and pushing back hard on many of Saatchi's assertions. “This could create something where creators can earn money when people are emotionally connected enough to their work that they themselves want to make something with it. Compare that to what creators earn just from people viewing their work online. Yes, there is a kind of ‘we're all employees of Disney' element, but from a moral point, I can't think of a better way to do it.” (Saatchi does not follow this up with what feels like it might be the next logical step—i.e., “So I just won't do it, then”—but, then, he's being paid a lot of money not to.) Because, as with most truly delusional AI things in 2025, Saatchi has already received large amounts of money for this technology, notably a big cash infusion from Amazon. Well, as we've alluded, we spent about 45 minutes today clicking around in the Showrunner Discord server to watch some of the videos people are making with it. All of these scenes, it's worth noting, featured the exact same plinky-plonk music, random arm movements, and no actual resolution or action, because the AI can only crap out meandering dialogue sequences, not actual movement or resolution. Human creativity, move over: “Computer-generated British Kanye West chili joke” is here to take your throne.
