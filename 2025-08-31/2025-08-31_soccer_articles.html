                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a summer of transfer rumors and a reported exit plan from AC Milan, U.S. men's national team midfielder Yunus Musa looks set to join Serie A side Atalanta on loan, according to Fabrizio Romano and several reports. Should the deal be completed in full, Milan would profit off Musah, after acquiring him from La Liga's Valencia CF in 2023 for $21 million. Prior to that, Musah had starred with Arsenal's academy in England. The move is set to be completed just before Monday's European transfer deadline, ending a dramatic summer for the midfielder who was recently left off head coach Mauricio Pochettino's roster for September friendlies against South Korea and Japan. With Milan, Musah made 82 appearances and recently started as a right wingback in Friday's 2–0 win over Lecce, where fellow American Christian Pulisic scored his first goal of the Serie A campaign. “The coaches were all disappointed that I didn't go but ultimately I needed to make that decision for myself because I needed to switch off after a tough season. Ultimately it was to take that period off then so that I could be in good shape to be able to carry on now the whole season and be able to give my best for club and the national team.” Meanwhile, his next chance to crack at the USMNT roster comes in October with friendlies against Ecuador and Australia.

However, those intentions were abruptly put on hold when he was refused a US visa, leaving him absolutely stunned. 2 lakh a month after taxes, had carefully planned his trip, Financial Express reported. Though his company could only authorize three weeks, he planned to remain in the US for four weeks. The applicant mentioned that he has a childhood friend with US citizenship in Seattle that he wanted to visit during his trip. However, his schedule was flexible depending on which FIFA match tickets he could get. The interviewer did not ask him about his job, income, and travel history, the details which are deemed essential for visa evaluation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA President Infantino has assured fans of getting access to the US This comes after it was reported that football fans from Africa “are a little bit jittery” about current events in the United States. FIFA President Gianni Infantino was told at a news conference in Kenya, which urged him to ensure African visitors to the tournament do not feel “outcast ... second-class citizens.” The FIFA leader was reminded he met yet again last week with US President Donald Trump, who now has a gold World Cup trophy sitting in a glass case on his desk in the White House. “We are going to play it in a country where some of us do not feel welcome,” said a reporter from South Africa, the home country of FIFA vice president Patrice Motsepe, who sat beside Infantino at a luxury hotel in Nairobi. Motsepe is the brother-in-law of South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa, who had a tense visit to the White House in May 2025 when Trump repeated his administration's baseless claims of white farmers being systematically killed in the country. Egypt, Morocco and South Africa are likely to qualify in October as current leaders of qualifying groups. Tickets for the 104 World Cup games go on sale September 10, 2025, amid long-standing concerns about fans getting visas to enter the US, which has travel bans and watch lists for dozens of countries. Motsepe, a billionaire businessman who has led Africa's football body since 2021, insisted discreet work with US authorities had secured commitments to make the World Cup run smoothly. “We are confident that we will fulfil whatever requirements they may have and there will be sufficient access to African fans in the World Cup next year,” Motsepe said. Infantino claimed fans came from 164 countries to the month-long Club World Cup hosted in 11 US cities in June and July “without, of course, any problems” with visas. Eight games are scheduled at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, including the US team's opener on June 12. “Be positive, you will see there will be a great, great celebration of the greatest FIFA World Cup ever,” Infantino said in Kenya.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kwesi Appiah with Ghana at 2014 World Cup  (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images) Kwesi Appiah's work in war-torn Sudan continues to earn global recognition, following an impressive run at the African Nations Championship with a fourth-place finish. The Falcons of Jediane are among just eight teams yet to lose a game in the 2026 World Cup qualifiers in Africa. Ahead of upcoming crucial games against Senegal and Togo in September, Appiah, who became the first Black African coach to lead a country (Ghana) to the FIFA World Cup in 2014, now has his focus on making history with Sudan. Both clubs have been competing in Mauritania's top flight to stay active and prepare for continental competitions. “The whole experience has been tough,” Appiah told RG. “With the insecurity and absence of a national league, it's difficult to select players. Sometimes, I also rely on Sudanese players based in Libya.” “The most important thing is being able to select players yourself because you, as coach, know the tactics you want to play,” he explained. “Football is not just about what happens on the pitch. Many players are affected by the war and financial struggles. “My job is to help them shift focus from those issues and concentrate on competition. The FA manages everything alone, which makes things very difficult financially,” he said. More than a decade ago, Appiah made history by guiding Ghana to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil - a rare feat in African football often dominated by foreign coaches. Appiah also weighed in on the African Footballer of the Year debate, tipping either Liverpool's Mohamed Salah or PSG's Achraf Hakimi to succeed Nigeria's Ademola Lookman. “Salah has been consistent with top performances in England,” Appiah noted. “For me, if either Salah or Hakimi wins, they both deserve it.” RG spoke to Yevhen Cheberko about the Columbus Crew's season, making his long-awaited international return for Ukraine, and more in an exclusive interview. Rangers beat out rivals to sign striker Bojan Miovski from Girona in a €3.5M deal plus add-ons, reuniting him with the Scottish Premiership Milan Iloski opens up on his move to Philadelphia Union, MLS growth, record-breaking run in San Diego, and hopes for international football.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are goals, and then there are the goals in a soccer player's life that they will never forget. KK Ream's 85th-minute strike to seal Utah Royals' 2-1 victory over Portland Thorns at a packed Providence Park on Friday night was one of the latter. This, after all, was a moment of history. The previous record belonged to Kansas City's Alex Pfeiffer, who was just 16 years, three months and 20 days old when she scored on March 16, 2024. Pfeffier herself had only recently dethroned Olivia Moultrie, Ream's opponent on Friday: Moultrie (whose goal in June 2022 came at the age of 16 years, nine months and 26 days) was only able to do so after mounting a legal challenge to the league's under-18 entry mechanism, which allowed teens to play in the NWSL. Ream's goal was historic and a beauty, too. Utah was holding a narrow 1-0 lead when Bianca St-Georges charged into the box and forced a save from Portland's 'keeper Mackenzie Arnold. “I saw Bianca with the ball, and she took a great hit, and I was running as fast as I could into the box, and it got deflected to me, and then I just put it in,” Ream said post-match. “I don't think she could see that it went in, so I kind of just ran up to her, and said, ‘KK, you scored! Friday's goal was monumental for Ream, but it was not the first time she has carved out her place in NWSL history. In May, she became the league's youngest starter at 15 years old. “She does it in training, every week,” said forward Paige Monaghan, who scored Utah's first goal earlier in the evening. “To see her doing it in the game and to secure a win for us, and then her making history, it was huge. Born in Herriman, Utah, Ream joined the Utah Royals FC AZ academy in 2019, playing up multiple age groups. While in Arizona, she also suited up for the boys' side, RSL Arizona of MLS Next, often sharing the field with her twin brother, Linkon. In 2022, she returned home and joined Utah Avalanche, where she tested herself against boys her age and girls several years older. She began training with the Royals' first team during preseason, and on December 11, the club signed her to a three-year under-18 contract — making her the youngest player in franchise history at just 15 years and 157 days old. I don't remember working that hard at her age; it's just so deserved,” said St-Georges. “It was really fun to celebrate, especially being on the field with her.” “It's so deserved,” added defender Kaleigh Riehl, who was next to Ream when she scored. “We see her work day in and day out, and it was honestly a crucial moment for the team. We really needed a goal there, and it was just so awesome that she was the one to get it. And at the time, I didn't know it was a record.” While a college degree remains valuable, players like Ream and Moultrie, Mak Whitham, Angel City FC's Kennedy Fuller and Casey Yu-jin Phair are opting to go pro early and proving themselves to be valuable assets to their clubs. I was really proud of her to score not only her first goal, but a game-winner, a beautiful one.” She has reported on the global game since 2013, for TRT Sport, USA Today Sports, VICE, Forbes, and most recently was a staff writer at Sportico.</p>
