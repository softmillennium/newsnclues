                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His motorcade arrived at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia around 10am. Before that, unfounded rumors started circulating online claiming that the President was sick or even died - with the hashtag '#whereistrump' going viral on Friday. The speculation began after several White House reporters noted the president had not been seen in public since a marathon cabinet meeting on Tuesday and had no events scheduled all weekend. And the unfounded rumors went into overdrive after Vice President JD Vance told USA Today he was ready to step in for Trump if 'If there's a terrible tragedy.' The rumors were also fanned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who asked people to pray for Trump as he claimed without evidence, that the president was in a 'health crisis,' and looked like he was about to 'collapse.' 'Trump is OK. Will play Golf this morning,' Ravid wrote on X shortly before images emerged of the president and his granddaughter. On Wednesday, he had a meeting with his son-in-law Jared Kushner, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Israeli official Ron Dermer to discuss a post-war plan for Gaza. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt revealed in July that the president was suffering from 'chronic venous insufficiency,' that was causing 'mild swelling' in his lower legs. The president's physician revealed in a memo that his condition was, 'a benign and common condition' in elderly people, but that there was no evidence of any serious arterial disease. People with the condition often are advised to lose weight, walk for exercise and elevate their legs periodically, and some may be advised to wear compression stockings. Severe cases over time can lead to complications including lower leg sores called ulcers. Blood clots are one cause, but was ruled out, Leavitt said. Despite the conspiracy theories surrounding his health, Trump's Truth Social account was active on Friday when he issued a statement about tariffs after a federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs Today a Highly Partisan Appeals Court incorrectly said that our Tariffs should be removed, but they know the United States of America will win in the end. If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country. It would make us financially weak, and we have to be strong.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These individuals relied more heavily on regions associated with subjective value and belief uncertainty. “Our motivation for this study came from a striking gap in the literature. While conspiracy theories have a profound impact on society—from shaping political engagement to influencing health decisions—we still know very little about how the brain processes such beliefs,” said study author Shuguang Zhao of the Research Center of Journalism and Social Development at Renmin University of China. “Previous research has focused on general belief processing, but the specific neural mechanisms that sustain conspiracy thinking remained unclear. During this global crisis, conspiracy theories about the virus—whether it was deliberately created, or that vaccines were part of hidden agendas—spread rapidly across digital platforms.” “Such crises tend to heighten uncertainty and fear, creating fertile ground for conspiracy narratives,” Zhao continued. “Observing how these beliefs flourished in real time underscored the importance of understanding not just what people believe, but how their brains evaluate and sustain these beliefs when confronted with threatening or ambiguous information.” “Personally, I was also motivated by this broader social context: as misinformation accelerates in times of crisis, uncovering the cognitive and neural basis of why some individuals are more vulnerable to conspiracy narratives is crucial for promoting critical reasoning and resilience against misinformation.” The research team recruited 388 Chinese-speaking participants who completed a set of online surveys designed to measure general conspiracy beliefs. Each item was rated on a seven-point scale, and the total scores were used to identify individuals with either high or low levels of conspiracy belief. The top and bottom ten percent of scorers were invited to participate in a brain imaging experiment. Before undergoing brain scanning, participants completed practice trials to ensure they understood the task. Inside the MRI scanner, participants were shown 72 statements formatted to resemble posts from Weibo, a popular Chinese social media platform. Each post was presented both visually and through audio recordings to control reading speed. After each statement, participants rated how much they believed the information using a seven-point scale ranging from “not at all” to “completely.” This method allows scientists to infer which brain regions are more active based on changes in blood flow. At the behavioral level, both high- and low-belief participants were more likely to believe factual statements than conspiratorial ones. These areas are thought to be involved in emotional value assignment and monitoring uncertainty during belief evaluation. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex helps assign meaning or value to information, especially when evaluating how well it aligns with prior beliefs. The hippocampus plays a central role in integrating new information with existing knowledge and storing episodic memories, while the precuneus is involved in recalling past experiences and imagining future events. The pattern suggests that people who reject conspiracy narratives may be more likely to evaluate claims by drawing on past knowledge and contextual memory. Importantly, the group differences in brain activity emerged only when participants evaluated conspiracy-related statements. There were no significant neural differences between high- and low-belief individuals when reading factual information, again pointing to a content-specific effect rather than a generalized cognitive style. “The most important takeaway is that conspiracy beliefs are not simply a matter of being more gullible or less intelligent,” Zhao said. “At the behavioral level, we found that high-belief individuals were more likely to endorse conspiracy-related statements, but they evaluated factual information just as accurately as low belief individuals. The sample size was relatively small, and all participants were native Chinese speakers recruited from a university setting. This raises questions about how well the findings would apply to other cultural contexts, particularly in societies with different media landscapes or conspiracy traditions. Additionally, the use of Weibo-style posts added ecological validity within China, but results may differ in other social media formats or in more interactive communication settings. “Our next step is to move beyond conspiracy beliefs and examine how people process misinformation more broadly, especially in the context of rapidly advancing AI,” Zhao explained. “As AI systems are increasingly capable of generating large volumes of content, including plausible but misleading explanations, it is crucial to understand how such information affects trust, reasoning, and decision-making.” The study, “Neural correlates of conspiracy beliefs during information evaluation,” was authored by Shuguang Zhao, Ting Wang, and Bingsen Xiong.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Edward never imagined he'd use his psychic abilities to help solve some of America's most chilling crimes. But when FBI agent Robert Hilland reached out in 1998 about one particularly frightening case involving convicted murderer John Smith, Edward couldn't ignore the call. The book recounts the case of Smith, who was convicted of killing his first wife in 2001, and other cases that Hilland and Edward worked together to solve, including the murder of Annie Le and Michael Vick's involvement in a dog-fighting ring. Edward and Hilland built an unexpected partnership, each utilizing their unique abilities to work on cases until Hilland's retirement in 2022. Edward tells Us that working with the law enforcement veteran helped him heal his own complicated relationship with his father, a New York City police officer who was skeptical of the supernatural. Edward recognizes that true crime is more popular than ever but says that Chasing Evil is unique due to its supernatural element and exploration of psychic phenomena. By signing up, I agree to the Terms and Privacy Policy and to receive emails from Us Weekly It's a hybrid of those two worlds,” he says, adding that his father would be “proud” of the book. Ultimately, Chasing Evil shows readers that justice does exist, according to Edward: “There are people that are out there doing something for the greater good.” Chasing Evil: Shocking Crimes, Supernatural Forces, and an FBI Agent's Search for Hope and Justice will be available in bookstores nationwide on Tuesday, September 2.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lisanne Froon, 22, and Kris Kremers, 21, arrived in Panama airport brimming with excitement. After months of planning, the two Dutch students set out to hike the famed El Pianista' trail, eager for discovery and adventure. Months later, fragments of their remains were found scattered along a remote river bank deep in the jungle. Investigators tried to reconstruct the girls' final days through strange photos found on their camera after they disappeared. But, without clear evidence, speculation flourished, and theories ranging from accidental misadventure to more sinister explanations - such as foul play, kidnapping, or even organ tracking quickly spread. According to some accounts, they had brunch with two Dutch men before setting off and brought along a dog from a nearby restaurant, IL Pianista, though details vary. The hike should have taken roughly three hours to complete but the pair had still not returned by nightfall. Further panic ensued among locals when efforts to contact Kremers' father Hans were unsuccessful and they missed an appointment with a local guide the following day. The girls' families arrived in Panama on April 6 as a major search operation got underway - with a $30,000 USD reward for anyone could find the women. Sniffer dogs scoured the rugged landscape for any sign of Froon and Kremers but found no trace. On June 14, a blue backpack belonging to Froon was found along the Culebra River near Alto Romero, well off the main El Pianista route by a local woman. Despite Panama's rainy season, the backpack appeared clean and dry, containing $88 in cash, sunglasses, both women's bras, their phones, and Froon's camera. Locals claimed it had not been there the day before, fueling suspicions. There are conflicting reports as to whether they were carefully placed on a rock or simply found in disarray remains disputed. The friends' phones revealed that around six hours into their hike someone tried to ring the emergency services 77 times. The first distress call attempt was made by Kremers' iPhone 4 at 16:39. Shortly after that, another attempt was made from Froon's Samsung Galaxy S III at 16:51. Between 5 and 11 April, Kremers' iPhone was turned on multiple times but the correct PIN code  was never entered again - hinting that she was not the one handling the phone. Investigators discovered 133 images taken as late as seven days after their disappearance, including 90 taken in pitch darkness during the pre-dawn hours of April 8, 2014. A few images reveal seemingly deliberate arrangements including red plastic on sticks, tissues, a small mirror on a rock, and one image, timestamped 1.49am, which shows the back of Kremers' head. Previous speculation suggested blood could be seen near her temple, though clearer versions did not confirm an injury. Puzzlingly, while parts of Froon's remains still retained some skin, Kremers' bones appeared 'bleached,' with high phosphorus levels that did not match local soil conditions. A Panamanian forensic anthropologist noted the absence of cuts or marks on the bones, adding another layer of intrigue. The minimal remains meant that a cause of death could not be determined, however, the most likely theories suggest the women either suffered an accident or got lost and died of exposure. Panamanian authorities initially classified the case as homicide, then abduction. By March 2015, however, it was formally closed with the conclusion that both women died in a hiking accident. Dutch forensic teams thought rugged terrain, 30- to 40-meter cliffs, and swift river currents could explain the condition of the remains. New and often polarizing theories have surfaced in recent years. Highlighting suspicious details and strange camera images, some investigators believe the women were victims of kidnapping or murder. They note that the late discovery of their remains - months after large-scale searches- could signal third-party involvement, as could possible tampering with the camera or the staging of belongings, Medium reports. Most researchers consider this scenario extremely unlikely, given the lack of supporting proof. Many experts still support he official accident explanation, suggesting the pair simply went off-trail, became disoriented, and succumbed to natural hazards. 'We don't know if anybody was involved - we cannot exclude that,' Jürgen Snoeren, co-author of Lost in The Jungle, previously told The Sun. 'We believe the most likely explanation is that they had an accident - but it's not 100 percent. In 2021, Dutch authors Marja West and Jürgen Snoeren published a book offering new perspectives on the mystery after trawling through police files. Their work noted unresolved inconsistencies that keep alternative theories alive. In September 2023, a documentary reexamining the women's final days and alleged investigative oversights threw the case back into the spotlight - sparking a fresh debate about how evidence was gathered, cataloged, and analyzed. Throughout these developments, the relatives of Kremers and Froon have stood by the official conclusion of a tragic accident, finding some comfort in closure even as the public's fascination persists.</p>
