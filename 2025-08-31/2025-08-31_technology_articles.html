                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scarlett Johansson, Anne Hathaway, and Selena Gomez were also reportedly impersonated. Many of these AI personas engaged in flirtatious or sexual conversations, prompting serious concern, Reuters reports. While many of the celebrity bots were user-generated, Reuters uncovered that a Meta employee had personally crafted at least three. Before being removed, these bots amassed more than 10 million user interactions, Reuters found. “Like others, we permit the generation of images containing public figures, but our policies are intended to prohibit nude, intimate or sexually suggestive imagery,” he said. The unauthorized use of celebrity likenesses raises legal concerns, especially under state right-of-publicity laws. Stanford law professor Mark Lemley noted the bots likely crossed the line into impermissible territory, as they weren't transformative enough to merit legal protection. The issue is part of a broader ethical dilemma around AI-generated content. SAG-AFTRA voiced concern about the real-world safety implications, especially when users form emotional attachments to seemingly real digital personas. In response to the uproar, Meta removed a batch of these bots shortly before Reuters made its findings public. Simultaneously, the company announced new safeguards aimed at protecting teenagers from inappropriate chatbot interactions. The company said that includes training its systems to avoid romance, self-harm, or suicide themes with minors, and temporarily limiting teens' access to certain AI characters. Senator Josh Hawley has launched an investigation, demanding internal documents and risk assessments regarding AI policies that allowed romantic conversations with children. One of the most chilling outcomes involved a 76-year-old man with cognitive decline who died after trying to meet “Big sis Billie,” a Meta AI chatbot modeled after Kendall Jenner. Believing she was real, the man traveled to New York, fell fatally near a train station, and later died of his injuries. Internal guidelines that once permitted such bots to simulate romance—even with minors—heightened scrutiny over Meta's approach. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

I don't totally disagree, although I do think some automakers will try to pass along the $7,500 federal tax credit through other price reductions for at least one quarter. Automakers with fresh EV models slated for late 2025 and 2026 may be better positioned than competitors. Meanwhile, there is another speed bump emerging in the EV industry in the United States as automakers transition over to Tesla's North American Charging Standard. Yeah, I'm talking about dongles, aka EV charging adapters. Senior climate reporter Tim De Chant, who is a longtime EV owner himself, explains how some folks may soon have a trunk or frunk load of charging adapters. The automaker began selling an adapter nearly a year ago to allow existing electric vehicles to use the North American Charging Standard plugs at Tesla Supercharger stalls. The additional adapters, which help GM customers access EV chargers with different charging rates and standards, is a win for flexibility, but at the cost of simplicity. It's entirely possible that two-EV households could own four different adapters. One important housekeeping note: TechCrunch Mobility will NOT land in your inboxes next week. It's your lucky day — we have two little birds to share. It's been six months since Peter Rawlinson abruptly stepped down from his CEO, CTO, and board positions at Lucid Motors. Since then, Rawlinson's CEO role has been filled on an interim basis by Marc Winterhoff, a longtime consultant at Roland Berger who came on as CFO of Lucid in 2023, as the company looks for a permanent replacement. While it's unclear whether Lucid is close to making a decision, a little bird recently told us the search net has been cast very wide, with the company even cold-calling some candidates. We heard from a few little birds, and the big takeaway is that Tesla is still committed to spending $500 million on a supercomputer there. The company already invested about $314 million of those funds last year, according to sources who said Tesla reported this figure to the state's economic development department. Could Buffalo be getting a rebrand to Cortex, Tesla's other supercomputing cluster? Here are a couple of items for you, though … Eclipse Ventures, Riot, and Impatient Ventures also participated.Joby Aviation completed its acquisition of Blade.Vox AI, an Amsterdam-based startup developing a conversational voice AI platform that's purpose-built for drive-throughs in quick-service restaurants, raised €7.5 million in seed funding. Aurora Innovation said it will integrate its self-driving trucking platform into McLeod Software‘s transportation management system. The upshot: Mutual customers would be able to manage autonomous shipments with McLeod's TMS software and that could help boost adoption. Kodiak Robotics hired Surajit Datta as chief financial officer. Remember that Kodiak will soon be a publicly traded company, which it will accomplish by merging with a special purpose acquisition company. Tesla could have avoided that $242.5 million Autopilot verdict, filings show. And speaking of data, a security researcher found over a thousand publicly exposed hobby servers run by Tesla vehicle owners that are spilling sensitive data about their vehicles, including their granular location histories. Just days before Labor Day, California lawmakers have reached an agreement with app-based companies Lyft and Uber that will give drivers a path to unionization. Uncaged Innovations, a biomaterials startup, is working with Hyundai's Cradle division to refine its plant-based artificial leather material for automotive use. It even smells like leather — or can be made with other signature scents. Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov posted on X a video of one of his company's robotaxis navigating through the giant dust storm — known as a haboob — in Phoenix. Also, Waymo now has more than 2,000 robotaxis in its commercial fleet, the company told me. Amplify your reach, spark real connections, and lead the innovation charge.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. “No, we are not going to have ray tracing when the game launches, and we don't have any plans in the near future for it either,” Studio Technical Director Christian Buhl of Ripple Effect, one of the studios behind BF6, told ComicBook.com. “That was because we wanted to focus on performance. So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we weren't going to do ray tracing and, again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else.” This decision means that gamers can easily play the game and get good performance, even when running older hardware. This precludes the Steam Deck and other Linux-based devices from running the game, so players avoiding Windows won't be able to play BF6. The Battlefield franchise is Call of Duty's biggest competitor, and it stands out by having a destructible environment. Since FPS shooters focus more on tactics and gameplay like this, we can consider ray tracing as a rather unnecessary eye-candy feature that will only make the title less accessible to gamers. This is similar to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which launched last year, and also did not have ray tracing enabled in the game. There is a workaround to force the feature if you have a good enough graphics card, but it might cause some issues.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Google's Pixel phones are chock-full of helpful, smart features, and they capture some of the best-looking photographs on a mobile device. It's why they're among our favorite Android smartphones. But like several of its peers, Google doesn't have many of its best features turned on by default. For example, Call Screening blocks unwanted phone calls on your behalf, and you need to turn it on yourself. I test smartphones for a living, and I'm constantly switching to a new device every week or two. To get the most out of your new Pixel, follow these steps, some of which may even help you turn off things you don't care for, like a few of the generative AI features on the Pixel 10. Note: Some features are also exclusive to select Pixel phones. No one wants endless robocalls and scams from telemarketers. You can choose Basic, Medium, or Maximum protection, and each mode ramps up the screening, with the latter screening unknown numbers. Within the Phone app's Settings menu, there are several other call features I recommend you turn on. Scam Detection is in beta, but it'll run in the background and will alert you on a call if it thinks you're being scammed. It doesn't run for calls from your contacts; calls aren't recorded, and all of this works locally on the device. Hold for Me is another excellent feature that lets you skip the annoying hold music—turn it on while on a call, and your phone will listen on your behalf and ring when the person you're speaking with returns and ends the hold. Once toggled on, it'll show a live transcription on your phone screen during the call, with buttons you can tap (i.e., Press 0 to talk to an agent). Call Notes, once toggled on, will ask if you want to activate it at the beginning of each call. It'll transcribe and summarize calls, so if you're particularly forgetful, you'll be able to see a summary of your calls (you can choose to make it automatically start for calls from non-contacts). Available on the latest Pixel 10 series at the moment, Voice Translate will translate phone calls in real time, and it'll even use generative artificial intelligence to approximate the voices of the people on the call, so that it feels like you're actually talking to each other and not a robot. You'll need to toggle this on in the middle of a call. When you don't answer, it'll ask callers to leave a message, which you'll be able to see transcribed in real time. It'll even generate insights or tasks based on the transcript, so if your wife called and reminded you to grab milk on the way home, it should show up as a recommendation to add to Google Keep. One of the best features that originally debuted in the Pixel 2, Now Playing listens for ambient music in your environment and will display the song information straight on your lock screen—no need to guess who the artist is or run a manual sound search. By default, the feature works exclusively on-device, but you can turn on Enhance Now Playing to have it automatically use Google Search to expand the detection capabilities and provide album artwork. It's really annoying when auto-rotate kicks on and changes your screen orientation when you didn't want it to. Sure, you can just turn off auto-rotate in the quick settings tile, or you can enable Face Detection. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Auto-rotate screen and toggle on Face Detection for the phone to use the selfie camera to understand when you've actually put your phone in landscape mode, or when you're just lying down and staring at the screen sideways. Similarly, if you're annoyed at how quickly the phone's display times out, you can extend the time manually, or use Adaptive timeout and Screen attention. In the Display & touch menu, tap Screen timeout to find these options. Adaptive timeout turns off your screen if you're not using the phone, and Screen attention won't turn off the screen as long as it detects you're looking at it. By default, it works OK, but when you tap it for the first time, you'll be asked to download a faster voice model, and you can head to Settings > System > Keyboard > On-screen keyboard > Gboard > Voice typing to make sure that Advanced features is toggled on. With this, the voice-typing assistant will automatically add punctuation, and will understand certain commands like “Next paragraph,” “delete,” “lol emoji,” and “send,” making the experience as hands-free as possible. Google has also incorporated some generative AI here, so you can say things like, “Rephrase it,” and the assistant will rewrite the message in different phrasing. There's a whole Personal Safety app that has features like checking in with friends and family once you've safely arrived home, but you should also make sure to do a test run of Google's Pixel Satellite SOS function before you end up in a remote area with zero cell service (this one is only available on the Pixel 9 and newer). It'll allow you to message emergency services using satellites when there's no Wi-Fi or cellular connection. I have a more detailed breakdown of how it works here. Car Crash Detection will sound an alarm and ask if you need help if the Pixel detects a crash. You should also turn on Crisis Alerts, which will notify you of natural disasters and public emergencies in your area. There are ways to keep your Pixel secure even if you left your phone behind in an Uber or even if someone snatched it out of your hands. But you'll have to enable these protective features first. Head to Settings > Security & privacy > Device unlock. Assuming you have a pin or pattern unlock on your phone (please use one), you can enable Theft protection. Within Theft protection is Identity Check—toggle it on. It uses the fingerprint or face scanner to verify that you're using the phone when trying to access certain sensitive data, like passkeys or opening the Find Hub app. You can also set Trusted Places here, so your phone will know it needs to be extra cautious when you're away from these trusted locations, like your home. And you should also toggle on Remote Lock, which allows you to remotely lock your phone if it's stolen or lost. It doesn't require a Google Account. (This only works if the device is online.) Google also renamed its device-tracking app to Find Hub earlier this year. This allows the network to find and locate your devices, even if they're offline. Location info from the Find Hub app is encrypted, and only you can see it. If you want the maximum protection Google offers, you can enable a relatively new mode called Advanced Protection. When you toggle on Device protection, it will automatically enable Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, and trigger Inactivity reboot, which will restart your phone if it stays locked for three days. Advanced Protection will also block 2G networks, which are less secure, block harmful web pages, warn you of non-HTTPS sites, and warn you of scams and suspicious links in Google Messages. We've got a full breakdown of how this function works here, if you're interested. You can create a Private Space on your Pixel with a fresh Google Account for sensitive apps and information (you can also use an existing account). You can hide it behind a custom lock that's separate from the one for your device, and install apps specifically for this space (even if you already have the same app installed). When the Private Space is locked, these apps will stop working, and you won't get notifications from them. Magic Cue is a new feature on the latest Pixel 10 phones. If you opt in, it'll process data from select apps, like Gmail, Calendar, Keep, and Contacts, and serve up that information in relevant situations, primarily in the Phone and Messages apps. For example, if a friend texts asking what time the dinner reservation is, Magic Cue will find it instantly and serve up the answer so you don't have to hunt for it. If you're calling your airline about your booking, Magic Cue will show the confirmation number and other flight details on the screen so you don't have to switch apps during the call. Instead of tapping the screen to see the time, you can enable Always-On Display to see a clock at any moment. Now, when the screen turns off, it'll still show the time, date, and weather, plus icons for apps with any notifications. (I prefer to just have a black screen.) It may eat up more battery life, but you paid for a high-quality display! Smooth display sits right below, but it's finally enabled by default, allowing your phone to hit a 120-Hz screen refresh rate. Head to Settings > Display & touch > Lock screen to customize how notifications appear (compact or full list), hide silent notifications, hide sensitive content, and add shortcuts to the left or right corner (like Flashlight or Wallet). You can customize how photos of your loved ones appear—within shapes, a fresh background color, with real-time weather animations, or a Cinematic look that adds depth. If you want to restart your Pixel or turn it off, you have to pull down the notification drawer and tap on the digital power button. Google defaults it to triggering its Gemini voice assistant. If you go this route but still want to access Gemini, you can just say, “Hey Google,” to set up voice commands, or use the Gemini widget on the home screen to activate it. To add a widget, press and hold anywhere on the home screen, tap Widgets, and scroll to Gemini. This greatly saves storage space, so if you're someone who takes a lot of video, it's the smart approach. Scroll to the bottom, tap on Video format, and choose AV1. Speaking of video, Google's Pro Pixel phones, since the Pixel 8 Pro, have been able to use a feature called Video Boost. This sends your footage to the cloud for processing, improving color, brightness, and stabilization, while reducing noise. It's a smart way to level up the video quality (the Pixel 10 Pro can even upscale it to 8K), even if it'd be nice if Google just improved native video capture. Another one for Pixel 10 users, Pro Res Zoom is available on the Pixel 10 Pro models, and Camera Coach is on all Pixel 10 phones (though there's a chance one of these could come to older Pixels). You can learn more about how these camera features work here, but Pro Res Zoom essentially stitches hundreds of frames together once you go past 30X to 100X digital zoom, and employs generative AI to fill in the details of the image. That results in spectacularly sharp zoomed-in photos, but it may leave a weird taste in your mouth because parts of it were AI-generated. Tap Model download and then the trash icon next to Pro Res Zoom. Camera Coach teaches you how to take better photos. It scans the scene, then runs you through several steps that can range from zooming in, switching to Portrait mode, or even shifting a few paces to the left. It's a helpful feature, but there's an odd “Get Inspired” button that will generate some photo ideas you can try. If you don't like that, or don't care for Camera Coach at all, just head to the camera settings and hit the toggle off for Camera Coach. Rich color in photos uses the Display P3 color format for more vibrant colors in your images, though it's not as widely supported as sRGB. You can tell it when exactly to turn on and off, at a specific time, or when your phone is charging. You can then customize which of your contacts are allowed to cut through the mode (or specific apps), while enabling features like Grayscale mode to remove all color from the screen. The latter will use your phone's microphone to detect coughing and snoring. Clear Calling: Trouble hearing people on the other end? Google has an easy solution called Clear Calling, which reduces background noise in your caller's environment, allowing you to hear them better. You can turn this on by heading to Settings > Sound & vibration > Clear Calling. Toggle on Notification history by heading to Settings > Notifications > Notification history, and you'll be able to view all the notifications that showed up on your device in the last 24 hours. Adaptive Vibration: Your Pixel knows if it's sitting in your back pocket, on a table, or in a bag. Adaptive vibration will adjust the strength of the vibration so that you can hear or feel it even if you're in a loud area. If you don't care for the default layout, swipe down twice on the notification drawer, tap the pen icon, and you can now move tiles around, hide them, or add new ones. Tell me exactly how much juice I have left! Take a look around here and turn on Adaptive charging if you want to prolong the health of your phone's battery (it's under Battery health). You can also choose to limit charging to 80 percent, which will improve the overall lifespan of the battery. Show Keyboard in App Drawer: Swipe up on the home screen, and it'll open the app drawer, but if you want to immediately search for an app or, well, anything, you'll have to tap on the top search bar to bring up the keyboard. Flip to Shhh: Flip your Pixel screen down on a table, and it'll automatically turn on Do Not Disturb. You can turn this on in Settings > System > Gestures > Flip to Shhh, and you can then configure the mode in Settings > Modes > Flip to Shhh. Live Translate: If you frequently receive messages from family members in a different language (and don't speak the language very well), you can toggle on Live Translate at Settings > System > Live Translate. This will detect other languages, like in the Messages app, and show you translations automatically. Get best-in-class reporting and exclusive subscriber content that's too important to ignore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How would you feel if just three customers made up nearly half of your sales? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Business publication Sherwood noted that nearly 53% of the reported revenue for the Green Team's Data Center division comes from just three unnamed customers, totaling about $21.9 billion in sales. This might not sound like a problem — after all, why complain if three different entities are handing you piles and piles of money — but concentrating the majority of your sales to just a handful of clients could cause a sudden, unexpected issue. For example, the company's entire second-quarter revenue is around $46 billion, which means that Customer A makes up more than 20% of its sales. Still, resting the future of your company (especially one so big) on a narrow base will likely keep some executives awake at night. The company did not name which institutions were its biggest clients, but we can take a guess based on the plans and announcements that several big tech companies have made. One of the first that comes to mind is Elon Musk and xAI. The billionaire has previously broken data center records, setting up 100,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs in a record 19 days last year — something that usually takes four years to finish, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. But more than that, Musk has dreams of running 50 million H100-equivalent GPUs in the next five years. Meta is also another big Nvidia customer that has recently been in the news, with Zuckerberg putting up data centers housed in tents and announcing plans for ‘several multi-GW clusters', some of which are reportedly as large as Manhattan. Even though Nvidia is facing issues with its China sales, first when President Donald Trump banned its H20 chip — resulting in a $5.5 billion write-off — and second, when Beijing instructed Chinese companies to stop buying the chips a few weeks after Trump reopened the H20 taps to China once again, these numbers could mean that the company is still relatively safe from ruin, even if it loses complete access to the East Asian country. So, Nvidia's sales to these three companies are probably the reason why Huang can spend his time shuttling between Beijing and Washington, with his company seemingly being used as a political tool by both sides of the ongoing trade war.

Immersion cooling is typically associated with large-scale server environments where conventional air-cooled setups are insufficient. Efforts have been made to commercialize the technology, but, of course, enthusiasts wanting to push their hardware will not wait for any revolution—they'll push through to power their own breakthrough. Such is the story of u/Tra5shL0rd on Reddit, who took to r/nvidia to showcase his crazy DIY immersion cooling apparatus, only with a further twist. Then he installed a submersible pump inside the tub to circulate the fluid, which was connected to an external pump that facilitated the exchange of hot ATF for cold. The second loop involved taking the aforementioned warm ATF and running it through a Dodge Journey transmission cooler, which acted essentially as a radiator to cool it down. This was attributed in large part thanks to the 2160MHz boost clock that the GTX 1060 was able to achieve, surrounded by ATF, up from 1886MHz stock speeds. Overall, a resounding success that netted 1st place in Firestrike global scores. Curiously, a 1080 Ti was also thrown into the mix with a similar teardown of the Strix variant, but these results were milder. The 1080 Ti was running at around 1960 MHz with air cooling, but it pushed to 2114 MHz when cooled with the ATF. TrashBench saw a roughly 7% increase in FPS, but because the 1080 Ti is already a power-hungry GPU with minimal headroom, this was not as impressive. All in all, it was a fun experiment, but it left a whole lot of mess. TrashBench even specifically advises against using ATF, as it stains everything and is a nightmare to clean, which is something you'll be busy with since transmission fluid will get into every nook and cranny of your hardware. The Reddit post ends with a tip of the hat to Dodge, who helped power this cooling system with their transmission cooler. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

The Insta360 X4 camera has been a top seller this summer, but picking it up now during the Back to School discounts at its all-time-low of $349 on Amazon, down from $499, is a smart decision. It's waterproof, too, so no sacrifices are made even when you're diving into pool play or filming in bad weather. This level of video quality and build makes it possible for you to trust it to get every second and with confidence. Where this camera stands out is in battery life: The X4 lasts for as long as 135 minutes, or a great deal more shooting time without the constant anxiety about running out of juice. In comparison to most action cameras that lag shortly beyond the hour mark, the X4's battery life makes a tangible difference for capturing sporting events or travel blogging. Another great feature is the invisible selfie stick effect: It enables you to film with the stick disappearing from the clip, and provides a seamless, professional look to your shots without adjusting in post. Simplicity in operation is another reason the Insta360 X4 is a favorite: The AI editing tools make creating polished videos easier whether you're new to video or an experienced creator. Stabilization technology keeps your footage smooth even when you're moving fast or navigating rough terrain so your videos look as professional as if they were shot by a pro. A solid selling point for those who love to share their experiences quickly is the camera's ability to pair with your phone or other devices for fast transfers and easy sharing on social media or with friends. If you've been thinking about stepping up your filming game, this deal from Amazon is definitely worth grabbing while supplies last. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On August 21, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), sent a scathing letter to a number of tech giants, including Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. Not only have Americans been censored and banned from platforms for expressing opinions and beliefs not shared by a small Silicon Valley elite, but the previous administration actively worked to encourage such censorship.” And it is precisely on the security front, and especially on the adoption of end-to-end encryption, that the FTC calls big tech companies to order: "Companies that promise that their service is secure or encrypted, but fail to use end-to-end encryption where appropriate, may deceive consumers who reasonably expect this level of privacy." Furthermore, "certain circumstances may require the use of end-to-end encryption, and failure to implement such measures may constitute an unfair practice." The weakening of encryption or other security measures to comply with laws or requests from a foreign government may therefore violate Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the document states. In a tweet on X, Ferguson wrote flatly that "if companies censor Americans or weaken privacy and communications security at the request of a foreign power, I will not hesitate to enforce the law." "In a global society like the one we live in, overlaps and interferences between different legal systems are natural.

A LEGO model of the Apple iMac G3 is up for consideration and fan voting on the LEGO Ideas website, where it is competing for a chance to become an officially licensed and commercially released LEGO model. The inside of the transparent shell houses a cathode ray tube and a circuit board, complete with heatsinks and wires, designed digitally using only real Lego elements. The model is complete with a brick-built keyboard and mouse. A space fleet's worth of transparent blue windshield elements is used to create the iMac's bright plastic backside, gorgeously recreating Steve Jobs' first major product launch after his return to Apple. Designs that receive 10,000 votes from site users are entered into official consideration rounds, where Lego's designers and lawyers determine which models best fit Lego's capabilities and brand. Over 150 designs meet this benchmark each year, with Lego holding three voting periods annually, and only six models are selected for production each year. Close to half of the Lego Ideas sets published so far are based on licensed IP, and with Terai's iMac G3 design only using already-existing Lego elements, it has a fair chance of getting far in voting. Unfortunately, even if it can reach 10,000 total votes and obtain the approval of Lego's legal team, Apple would still need to be willing to play ball with the idea, which historically would be a long shot. Those interested in seeing a Lego iMac G3 on their desk one day should turn to the Lego Ideas website and vote for the model here.
