Under Cervara, Medvedev topped the ATP rankings and reached six Grand Slam finals, winning one at the 2021 US Open to prevent Novak Djokovic from clinching the Calendar Year Grand Slam. Medvedev's last match with Cervara came at the 2025 US Open, where he suffered a third straight Grand Slam first-round defeat. In four major appearances in 2025, Medvedev won just one match, and suffered three consecutive first-round losses.At the US Open, he took a second straight Grand Slam defeat to Benjamin Bonzi, who also defeated him two months ago at the Wimbledon Championships. It was during their match on Louis Armstrong Stadium that Medvedev incurred a $42,500 fine for unsportsmanlike conduct for berating umpire Greg Allensworth and delaying play for over six minutes as Bonzi served for the match. Medvedev ultimately lost in five sets and will drop further down the rankings after starting the year at No. At the US Open, he took a second straight Grand Slam defeat to Benjamin Bonzi, who also defeated him two months ago at the Wimbledon Championships.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 30-year-old will face his biggest test yet on Sunday when he meets  former champion Carlos Alcaraz in the pair's fourth Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Ahead of the clash, ATPTour.com looks at five things to know about Rinderknech. Frenchman's New York breakthrough Rinderknech had never been beyond the third round in his previous 19 major appearances but he has broken new ground this week in New York to reach the fourth round for the first time. 82 player in the PIF ATP Rankings has defeated Roberto Carballes Baena, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina and Benjamin Bonzi and will now face Alcaraz on Arthur Ashe Stadium on Sunday afternoon. College roots in Texas While many future pros were travelling on the junior circuit, Rinderknech was charting a different course, 8,000 kilometres from home. I was probably only ranked about fifth, sixth or seventh at my age in France, so I didn't have much help. It was just a great experience and I kept improving.” Business background Rinderknech is already thinking about life away from tennis. He was mentored by Denise Melone, Managing Director at global communications agency Havas, gaining valuable insight into the business world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Alexander Bublik has dominated on serve throughout the US Open and he used his delivery to great effect in the early hours of Sunday morning to reach the fourth round at Flushing Meadows for the first time. On-court reporter Pam Shriver told Bublik his serve "is incredible" and the Kazakhstani had a quick reply. "Yes, it is," Bublik told the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd. He had a couple of set points and then I was serving for the match. I was like, 'Okay, let's hope not today'. I have [my] next match against Jannik, so probably that will be the match I will drop a couple of serves." Bublik has faced 12 break points in the tournament, but held firm. Sinner will take a 4-2 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series into their showdown, but Bublik has won two of their past three meetings, including a victory in Halle this year. In five-set format I haven't done it yet," Bublik said. "But I'll try to use my chances." The 28-year-old hit 22 aces against Paul and won 83 per cent of his first-serve points. He also used his drop shot to great effect against the American to keep him off balance throughout.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The young American is going where no great player has gone before.ByPeter BodoPublished Aug 31, 2025 copy_link None of those Grand Slam champions—in fact, not many pros, period—have done what Coco Gauff is trying to do here at the US Open.And you wonder why she's been so emotional, so overwrought that in her second-round match with Donna Vekic she was unable to suppress tears on one changeover, and visibly trembled during another?Gauff is going where no great player has gone before. 28 seed Magdalena Frech in a scant hour and 13 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium, 6-3, 6-1. And you wonder why she's been so emotional, so overwrought that in her second-round match with Donna Vekic she was unable to suppress tears on one changeover, and visibly trembled during another?Gauff is going where no great player has gone before. 28 seed Magdalena Frech in a scant hour and 13 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium, 6-3, 6-1. Gauff is going where no great player has gone before. 28 seed Magdalena Frech in a scant hour and 13 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium, 6-3, 6-1. On Saturday at the US Open, Gauff showed signs that her bold gamble may be paying off. 28 seed Magdalena Frech in a scant hour and 13 minutes on Arthur Ashe Stadium, 6-3, 6-1. Frech, a 27-year-old from Poland, is short on power but has an elegant game full of classic, grooved shots, along with really quick feet. She engaged Gauff in numerous rallies of 20 shots or more, with both women firing away at each other's forehands—a challenge Gauff might have shied away from in the past, but met head on.Gaff got the best of most of those rallies. For the match: French made 17 forced errors to Gauff's nine, and nearly twice as many unforced ones (29-18).But the salient detail in the stats was that Gauff lobbed in only four double faults. After that match, Gauff knew that something had to give.In a lucky stroke, serve and biomechanical specialist Gavin Macmillen, who had worked wonders previously for Aryna Sabalenka, suddenly became available shortly before this tournament. Defying convention—most players make changes in even far less consequential areas under cover of night—Gauff hired McMillen.

Coco Gauff on hiring a serve coach right before the US Open Gauff is such a superb athlete that she can compensate for or overcome any number of flaws, but perhaps not against elite opponents.The assignment for McMillen, a “sport performance specialist” in biomechanics, involved a variety of areas (including the forehand, which already looked much better). To that end, he has changed Gauff's service motion, a delicate mission at the best of times, never mind in the pressure cooker of a major.“I just felt like I didn't want to waste any more time,” Gauff explained after her first win, over Ajla Tomljanovic, a harrowing, three-set slog in which she hit 10 double faults (which already was something of an improvement).“It's definitely tough going through the match and battling that internal battle, especially since this is the first tournament (with McMillan).

On "Tennis Channel Live at the US Open," Martina Navratilova was shocked Gauff decided to make the drastic change in New York. McMillan immediately set about making changes to Gauff's ball toss, her shoulder alignment, body rotation and launch point. He wanted her to focus less on serve speed than developing new muscle memory, a task Gauff has compared to “learning a new language.”The stress that had been building up in Gauff due to her serving woes, and the apprehension she felt taking a step so drastic, perhaps appearing desperate to many, caught up with her in the second round. She hit only eight double faults, though—two fewer than her opponent.

Surviving that challenge, Gauff struggled to control her relief. She also felt immense gratitude for a crowd that had done it's best to get her across the finish line. When Gauff addressed them, she said, “It's been a rough couple of weeks, but I'm just happy to be back on this court. You guys give me so much joy and the reason. .”Tears began to trickle and glisten on Gauff's cheeks, and she stepped away from the microphone to regain her composure. So I'm doing this for myself, but I'm also doing it for you and no matter how tough it gets inside, you [we] can do it.”In her ensuing press conference, Gauff addressed the turbulence she felt in the first set:“I think it was just nerves and just pressure, honestly, and I'm someone that usually can thrive on that. There's been a lot on me this tournament, more than usual, which I expected coming in. It was a challenging moment for me on the court.” Tears began to trickle and glisten on Gauff's cheeks, and she stepped away from the microphone to regain her composure. So I'm doing this for myself, but I'm also doing it for you and no matter how tough it gets inside, you [we] can do it.”In her ensuing press conference, Gauff addressed the turbulence she felt in the first set:“I think it was just nerves and just pressure, honestly, and I'm someone that usually can thrive on that. There's been a lot on me this tournament, more than usual, which I expected coming in.

There's been a lot on me this tournament, more than usual, which I expected coming in. It was a challenging moment for me on the court.” A different sort of challenge awaits in the fourth round, where Gauff will face a resurgent Naomi Osaka, another former US Open champion—and one with whom Gauff has had an interesting history.In 2019, Osaka crushed 15-year-old Gauff in the third round on the same court that will host their next match. Gauff cried after that rout, but Osaka went over and comforted her with a hug. She also invited Gauff to join her in the winner's on-court interview, telling the youngster that speaking to the crowd was a better option than “crying in the shower.”Gauff doesn't believe she will feel any special pressure when she plays Osaka, whom she leads 3-2 in their series. Any emotions associated with that famous meeting in 2019 have long passed their use-by date. If anything, facing another major champion comes as a relief, no matter the state of Gauff's in-transition game. Gauff cried after that rout, but Osaka went over and comforted her with a hug.

If anything, facing another major champion comes as a relief, no matter the state of Gauff's in-transition game. She believes that a player of Osaka's caliber, against whom Gauff will not be a prohibitive favorite, will put her under far less pressure than having to duel with another underdog. The difference is especially germane because of Gauff's situation, although Osaka is also justified in rolling the dice, feel free to hit without inhibition. “Regardless, I hope I get more Grand Slam finals and when those nerves come, I'll recall this feeling and know that it probably can't get much worse than this.”She spoke those last words with a smile, a stark contrast to the tears she shed not so long ago. “Regardless, I hope I get more Grand Slam finals and when those nerves come, I'll recall this feeling and know that it probably can't get much worse than this.”She spoke those last words with a smile, a stark contrast to the tears she shed not so long ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before the US Open, it had been a difficult season for Felix Auger-Aliassime at the majors. But the 25th seed showed he is alive and well at Flushing Meadows Saturday evening when he upset third seed Alexander Zverev 4-6, 7-6(7), 6-4, 6-4 for a place in the fourth round. The tournament's still going, but this means a lot to me. A lot of hard work, many years.” Auger-Aliassime attacked at will inside Louis Armstrong Stadium, winning 24 of his 27 net points to eliminate the German in three hours and 48 minutes. Zverev walked on court with a 6-2 lead in their Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry and held set point at 6/5 in the second-set tie-break for a two-sets-to-none advantage, but was unable to convert. “It was a nervous start the first few games and after it was pretty crazy, pretty flawless. But still Sascha was serving unbelievable, so it was tough to get a break,” Auger-Aliassime said. “I got a bit lucky in the tie-break that it went my way, but with the way I played in the third and fourth, I still think whatever happened in the second, I would give myself a chance. I was seeing it big today and it's good when you feel like that on the court, for sure.” Auger-Aliassime won the pair's only previous clash at a major at Wimbledon 2021 and by defeating Zverev in New York earned his first victory at the level against a Top-5 opponent (previously 0-6.) The 25-year-old will next take on 15th seed Andrey Rublev, who survived a difficult five-setter against Coleman Wong 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. Rublev will take a 7-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his showdown with Auger-Aliassime for a place in the quarter-finals. "I think I would be a fool not to [use his win for confidence," Auger-Aliassime said. Even though I looked not tired, it was tough on the legs, a lot of sprints, a lot of forehands. But these guys — Sascha, Andrey — these are all top players and they've been at the top of the game for many years, but I'm trying to be battling with them in those matches for sure." In other action, Alex de Minaur advanced to the fourth round in New York for the fifth time after Daniel Altmaier was forced to retire. De Minaur led the German 6-7(7), 6-3, 6-4, 2-0 when play was stopped. The Australian will next play Swiss qualifier Leandro Riedi, who also advanced via retirement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An in-depth look at everything that's gone down so far at the US Open, from Taylor Townsend's inspired run to Coco Gauff's Simone Biles shoutout to Venus Williams' unlikely pairing with Leylah Fernandez ... and so much more. “New York City tends to bring out just a lot of drama.” -- Jessica Pegula NEW YORK -- The first week of the US Open has delivered a mix of tense matches, comeback stories and off-court intrigue. Pegula's offhand remark, made after her win over Victoria Azarenka on Friday, neatly captured the week's mood -- unpredictable, charged, and at times, bigger than tennis itself. For those who have been following along -- and, particularly, those who haven't (you know who you are) -- we present Courtside Changeover, a look at the week that was and a sneak peek of what's coming up. It didn't take long for the New York crowd to fall in love with Alexandra Eala, who came back from 5-1 down in the third set to force a tiebreak against 14th seed Clara Tauson in the first round of the US Open. As that was happening, there was some more high drama over on Court 10, as Moyuka Uchijima edged Olga Danilovic 7-6 (2), 4-6, 7-6 (9). American Madison Keys battled relentlessly but couldn't overcome her many errors (more on that below) in a devastating first-round loss to Renata Zarazua (much more on her, too). Those hoping for a deep run from Victoria Mboko were also disappointed, as the Montreal champion bowed out to two-time Slam champ Barbora Krejcikova 6-3, 6-2 in the first round. Not the result many expected, but there's no doubt the 19-year-old Canadian has many memorable Queens runs in her future. We won't bore you with all the names, but we'll list just a few: Lin-Manuel Miranda, John Mulaney and Olivia Munn, James Corden, Sabrina Ionescu, Jeff Goldblum, Michael Imperioli, Queen Latifah, Connie Britton ... you get the picture. But perhaps our favorite "star" moment was Gauff shouting out Simone Biles for providing some much-needed inspiration from the seats during her second-round win over Donna Vekic. We're gonna give doubles some much-deserved love here. This point is just nuts, for so many reasons. OK, we don't want to get too hyperbolic here, but this photo of Jasmine Paolini is objectively a once-in-a-lifetime snap. And now you know who to dress up as for Halloween. Tough to choose, but we'll go with this one from Venus Williams: "I always tell people, I'm not good at doubles. Here's another great one from her new partner, Leylah Fernandez, upon finding out that Venus wanted to play with her: "I was like a kid on Christmas day, just jumping around. Yeah, it was a rough match for Keys, who smashed 46 winners but committed 89 unforced errors in her 3-hour and 10-minute loss to Zarazua. The 6-7 (10), 7-6 (3), 7-5 defeat was especially surprising because of how strong she's been in tight matches this year. Coming into this one, Keys led the Hologic WTA Tour with 15 three-set victories and 10 comeback wins. Some more insane numbers from that match: Zarazua won 131 points to Keys' 125. Zarazua lost her next match to Diane Parry, dropping the third-set tiebreak 10-7. Sometimes we forget how young Gauff is -- here's your reminder that she's still very young, and has accomplished an incredible amount before her 22nd birthday. With her three victories in New York this week, the World No. Since 2000, only newly inducted Hall of Famer Maria Sharapova won more Grand Slam singles matches (85) before turning 22. Coco turns 22 in March, so she has a bit more time to run up that tally with continued success in this tournament and a strong run in Australia next year. Amazingly, if she were to close out this tournament and win the Australian Open in January, she'd tie Sharapova with 85 on the nose. 4 Caroline Garcia played her final match, a three-set loss to Kamilla Rakhimova. What a monumental week it was for Townsend. Frustrated that Townsend didn't apologize after winning a point with the help of a net cord, the former French Open champion confronted her after the match in a rather uncomfortable scene. Townsend admirably took the high road, but strongly defended herself and her actions. Earlier this summer, in Cincinnati, the former US Open finalist talked about what a dream it would be to play the seven-time Grand Slam singles champion. They didn't end up squaring off in Ohio, but less than a month later they were on the same side of the net, as a team, in front of more than 14,000 rabid fans in Louis Armstrong Stadium. It was a party in Armstrong, as the unlikely American-Canadian pairing came back from 5-2 down in the first to upset sixth-seeded Lyudmyla Kichenok and Ellen Perez, 7-6 (4), 6-3. They followed it up with a straight-sets win over Eri Hozumi and Ulrikke Eikeri, and are into the third round. We're thankful that Venus stuck around to play doubles, and watching these two together is a treat. We've got some unbelievable matchups over the next two days. On Sunday, fourth-seeded Pegula squares off against countrywoman Ann Li, defending champion Sabalenka meets 95th-ranked Cristina Bucsa, two-time Slam champion Barbora Krejcikova plays the red-hot Townsend and ninth-seeded Elena Rybakina takes on former Wimbledon champ Marketa Vondrousova. Labor Day's slate features the ultimate popcorn match -- Naomi Osaka vs. Gauff -- as well as Ekaterina Alexandrova vs. six-time Slam champion Swiatek, 11th-seeded Karolina Muchova vs. 27th-seeded Marta Kostyuk and Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova vs.  Beatriz Haddad Maia. An in-depth look at everything that's gone down so far at the US Open, from Taylor Townsend's inspired run to Coco Gauff's Simone Biles shoutout to Venus Williams' unlikely pairing with Leylah Fernandez ... and so much more.</p>
