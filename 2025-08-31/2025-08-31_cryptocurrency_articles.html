                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>- Collaboration with Chainlink expands data to 100+ blockchains, enhancing transparency while 70% PYTH token price surge reflects institutional/retail confidence post-announcement. - Technical upgrades like Entropy V2 and xStocks RFQ system drive DeFi-TradFi integration, with Q1 2025 TTV hitting $149.1B (376.6% YoY growth) despite quarterly dip. - Analysts project $0.30 price target as 24.1M PYTH whale accumulation and exchange outflows mirror Solana's bullish patterns, aligning with Trump-era crypto-friendly policies. The Pyth Network (PYTH) has emerged as a standout in the blockchain space, driven by a confluence of strategic institutional validation and robust technical momentum. At the heart of its ascent is a historic partnership with the U.S. Department of Commerce to publish GDP, PCE Price Index, and other macroeconomic data on-chain via blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana [1]. By using Pyth's pull oracle model, the Department of Commerce ensures cryptographic immutability and real-time accessibility of economic data, enabling smart contracts to replace traditional paper-based agreements [3]. This partnership has already spurred a 70% surge in PYTH's token price within 24 hours of the announcement, signaling institutional and retail confidence in the network's credibility [4]. Together, they are distributing U.S. economic data across 100+ blockchains, creating a decentralized infrastructure that enhances transparency and accountability in public information systems [5]. This dual-validation approach—backed by both government and industry leaders—positions Pyth as a critical node in the blockchain-driven data ecosystem. The launch of Entropy V2 in July 2025 introduced customizable gas limits and error handling, streamlining on-chain randomness for developers [6]. Meanwhile, the xStocks RFQ system minimizes slippage for tokenized equities by sourcing direct price quotes from market makers, a feature that bridges traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) [7]. Analysts project PYTH's price could reach $0.30 as institutional adoption accelerates, with key resistance levels at $0.2653 and $0.3665 [10]. By making economic data tamper-proof and accessible, Pyth addresses long-standing concerns about the trustworthiness of traditional statistics [11]. For investors, this represents a unique opportunity to capitalize on a network that is not only solving real-world problems but also aligning with macroeconomic tailwinds. Whale accumulation of 24.1 million PYTH and a 77.2 million PYTH outflow from exchanges further reinforce a bullish on-chain narrative, mirroring patterns seen in high-growth assets like Solana [12]. For investors seeking exposure to the next phase of blockchain innovation, Pyth offers a compelling case of strategic alignment, technical superiority, and market momentum.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major players are predicting a 100x appreciation, and the catalyst? But with opportunities come challenges, so let's dive into what's driving this growth and what institutional investors can do to stay ahead. Big names like JPMorgan and BlackRock are piling into Ethereum, hinting that decentralized finance (DeFi) is becoming less of a fringe concept and more of a mainstream financial tool. They could also be the driving force behind innovations like decentralized payroll tools and crypto payment platforms, setting Ethereum up as a major player in the finance world. Of course, this growth won't come without its hurdles. Regulatory bodies are likely to keep a close eye on how Ethereum is being used, and compliance will remain a hot topic. The legal status of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies has always been murky and that's a huge turn-off for institutional investors who need a clear path forward. Compliance isn't optional; it's essential if they want to avoid a regulatory headache. We're talking about daily price movements that can exceed Bitcoin's by around 10%. To balance the volatility, many institutions opt for a mix of Bitcoin and Ethereum in their portfolios, taking advantage of both assets' unique traits. They can hedge their bets while keeping an eye on Ethereum's potential, especially as it gains traction in institutional circles. So how should institutional investors approach this complex world of Ethereum? Here are a few strategies to keep in mind: Diversification: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Consider spreading your investments into stablecoins and other crypto assets to cushion against Ethereum's volatility. It allows for quick capital deployment when the right opportunity shows up. Risk Management: Build solid financial forecasting models and conduct regular risk assessments to manage exposure and avoid budget shortfalls from sudden price changes. Compliance Focus: Being ready for regulatory changes isn't just smart; it's necessary. Building trust through compliance will save a lot of headaches down the road. Partnerships and Innovation: Investing in blockchain infrastructure projects or partnering with them can address long-term challenges and help set institutions apart in a crowded market. As Ethereum grows, it's going to change the financial landscape in some significant ways. With the right strategies and a focus on compliance, institutional investors can not only survive but thrive in this ever-evolving market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin predicts massive institutional adoption as Wall Street and treasury companies ramp up ETH holdings. Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO Joseph Lubin just gave ETH bulls something to chew on. In a post on X, he applauded Fundstrat's Tom Lee on his vision for the future of finance and the expanding role of Ethereum in traditional institutions. As a blockchain pioneer, Joseph Lubin is best known as a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder and CEO of Consensys, the largest web3 software studio. Drawing on deep roots in finance as a former Goldman Sachs VP, Lubin has been instrumental in developing Ethereum as the preeminent platform for decentralized finance and smart contracts since 2014. Responding to Tom Lee's bullish outlook, Lubin predicts a seismic shift in global finance: Wall Street giants will soon run validators, operate L2s and L3s, and write smart contracts to move their business infrastructure onto Ethereum rails. Since June 2025, treasury companies, including Bitmine Immersion and Sharplink Gaming, have added 2.6% of all ETH in circulation to their reserves. When combined with inflows to new ETH ETFs, institutional buyers account for nearly 5% of Ethereum's supply so far this year. Sharplink and Bitmine now hold over $6 billion in ETH, setting industry benchmarks for corporate adoption. And with the approval of multiple Ethereum ETFs, asset managers like BlackRock and VanEck have invested billions into ETH for their clients, marking a tipping point in its adoption as a primary digital asset for institutional treasuries. VanEck's CEO recently dubbed Ethereum “Wall Street's token,” and Lubin argues that the transformative potential of Ethereum derives from “decentralized trust,” a quality Wall Street sorely needs. As legacy institutions migrate from fragmented, siloed infrastructure to unified decentralized rails, staking ETH becomes both a technical and economic imperative: “Nobody on the planet can currently fathom how large and fast a rigorously decentralized economy, saturated with hybrid human-machine intelligence, operating on decentralized Ethereum Trustware, can grow.” In his view, not only will L2s and L3s drive more usage of the Ethereum base layer, but “ETH will likely 100x from here” and eventually “flippen the Bitcoin/BTC monetary base.” Ethereum's surging momentum doesn't come without bumps in the road. September is historically Ethereum's toughest month, averaging a -6.42% return since 2016. The combination of a meteoric summer rally (up 76% year-to-date, nearly 25% in August) and seasonal trends may see a pullback in the month ahead, especially as macro sentiment, monetary policy, and profit-taking could weigh on prices. Net ETH inflows from institutions, the steady climb in corporate treasury holdings, rising yields from staking (~3% APY), and ongoing upgrades all point to a stronger long-term outlook, as Lubin states: As an industry OG, she's not phased by market volatility and frequently scrimps on Starbucks to BTFD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cardano Price has been under pressure, reflecting cautious optimism among traders seeking early-stage crypto investments with real-world uses. While ADA is still being referred to in passing, utility-based ventures like Remittix are gaining prominence due to building presale momentum and upcoming infrastructure releases. Cardano Price is currently at $0.8332, having risen by 1.49% within the last 24 hours. Projects like Remittix at $0.1000 per token are starting to outrank legacy coins in use case value and early adoption. Remittix (RTX) is quickly becoming amongst the top DeFi projects that bridge crypto and traditional finance. By resolving real-world $19 trillion payment headaches, Remittix allows people to send cryptocurrencies directly into bank accounts in 30+ countries within minutes. There are also recent developments with the listing announcement of two centralized exchanges. Such upcoming listings will enhance liquidity, access across the world, and position RTX in head-to-head competition with native cryptocurrencies as a viable substitute. Remittix beta wallet will arrive in Q3 2025 with a mobile-first focus and live FX conversion. The $250,000 Remittix Giveaway is also aggressively interacting with the community, further solidifying RTX as a utility-driven project and not one of speculative hype. With a deflationary token model and practical uses in the real world, Remittix is poised to become one of the most attractive early-stage crypto investments. Unlike most other altcoins, its development relies on infrastructure, usability, and global applications, which gives it the charm that investors looking for something more than meme-fueled hype are craving.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's daily transaction fees have dropped over 80% since April 2024, raising concerns about long-term network security. Daily transaction fees on the Bitcoin network have collapsed by more than 80% since April, according to a report from Galaxy Digital. As of August 2025, nearly 15% of blocks are “free,” meaning they're being mined with minimal or no transaction fees, just one satoshi per virtual byte or less. Bitcoin's incentive structure relies on miners being compensated for their work through block rewards and transaction fees. “As block rewards shrink, more weight falls on transaction fees,” Pierre Samaties, chief business officer at the Dfinity Foundation, told Cointelegraph. “If usage does not grow, that base thins, and the guarantees weaken. Sustained throughput is essential for the system to defend itself.” Bitcoin's onchain activity has slowed significantly since the decline of non-monetary trends like Ordinals and Runes. Galaxy's report notes that OP_RETURN transactions, used heavily during the 2024 Ordinals boom, now account for just 20% of daily volume, down from over 60% at their peak. Furthermore, the rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which now hold over 1.3 million BTC, has pushed more BTC volume offchain, limiting movement that would otherwise generate fees. Galaxy noted that nearly 50% of recent blocks haven't been full, and mempool activity remains sluggish. Against this backdrop, a new hope is emerging in the form of BTCfi, Bitcoin-native DeFi. Unlike DeFi on Ethereum or Solana, which uses smart contracts on those chains, BTCfi uses Bitcoin as the base asset while building financial applications like lending, trading and yield generation on layers or protocols that interact directly with the Bitcoin network. “Movement drives computation, computation consumes block space, and space carries cost.” In other words, if BTCfi grows, so does onchain activity and fee revenue. However, he sees it evolving into something more foundational: a financial primitive. Julian Mezger, chief marketing officer of Liquidium, also said that infrastructure improvements are setting the stage for change. “We're now seeing the foundations for true Bitcoin-native DeFi being laid.” Magazine: Bitcoin is ‘funny internet money' during a crisis: Tezos co-founder Cointelegraph is committed to providing independent, high-quality journalism across the crypto, blockchain, AI, fintech, and iGaming industries.</p>

While it's unclear whether Beckham Jr. received his salary as a lump sum (or in increments) or if he sold some of his Bitcoin, that money could be worth more than $1.2 million as of Aug. 29, 2025, excluding taxes. In recent weeks, Bitcoin has notched record-highs as institutional investors—like Strategy (formerly known as Microstrategy)—have bolstered their Bitcoin holdings and retail investors have flocked to spot ETFs. In July, the House announced a "Crypto Week" as it mulled over legislation that would regulate cryptocurrency. And Trump signed one of those pieces of legislation, the GENIUS Act, which creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins. It's important to note that it hasn't been smooth sailing for cryptocurrency over the last couple of years. In 2022, "crypto winter" chilled the market for Bitcoin: the price fell more than 70%, dropping from a high of more than $69,000 in November 2021 to a low of less than $19,000 in 2022. Beckham Jr. isn't the only athlete to have his salary converted into Bitcoin. Sean Culkin, former tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, reportedly converted his salary in April 2021. And Russell Okung also received half his salary in Bitcoin the year prior. In December 2020, Okung, a former Carolina Panthers offensive tackle, received half of his $13 million NFL salary as Bitcoin, which he did via a Bitcoin startup known as Zap. Assuming he held onto the full amount today, excluding any taxes that were taken out, that salary would be worth more than $36 million (as of Aug. 29, 2025). Beckham Jr. is just one of many NFL players who have turned all or a portion of their salary into Bitcoin. Beckham Jr.'s decision to turn his 2021 salary could have him potentially netting more than $450,000, excluding taxes. But that's assuming he's had diamond hands, holding onto Bitcoin even when prices plunged in 2022. "Odell Beckham Jr. is Taking his Rams Salary in Bitcoin." "Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Signs GENIUS Act into Law." "This ‘Crypto Winter' is Unlike Any Downturn in the History of Digital Currencies. "Panthers' Russell Okung Becomes First NFL Player to Be Paid in Bitcoin."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world's second-largest cryptocurrency carries a live market cap near $536 billion, but according to ConsenSys CEO and Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, that figure could be only the beginning. He argued that ETH could eventually surpass Bitcoin's monetary base, a prediction often referred to as the long-debated “flippening.” I am 100% aligned with almost all of what Tom @fundstrat says here.Yes, Wall Street will stake because they currently pay for their infrastructure and Ethereum will replace much of the many siloed stacks they operate on (e.g. JPMorgam probably operates on several siloed stacks… https://t.co/bW93kkX1gW Lubin believes Ethereum will become the backbone of financial markets as banks integrate staking, validator nodes, and Layer 2 scaling solutions to replace their outdated infrastructure. Large institutions such as JPMorgan, which still operate multiple siloed systems from past acquisitions, could save billions by shifting to Ethereum-based rails. By running validators, writing smart contracts, and adopting DeFi processes, banks will gradually move onto Ethereum rails. In his view, this isn't a niche experiment—it's the next evolution of finance. Ethereum price prediction is showing strength after bouncing from trendline support near $4,265. On the four-hour chart, ETH continues to respect an ascending trendline, building a bullish structure of higher lows. The RSI has climbed back to 51 after last week's dip, showing a return of steady buying pressure. The MACD is narrowing its negative spread, signaling a potential bullish crossover. Recent candlesticks near support resemble spinning tops, patterns that often mark turning points when confirmed by volume. A breakout above $4,665 could target $5,100 in the short run, with medium-term scenarios pointing to far higher valuations if Lubin's thesis plays out. Its goal is to expand the Bitcoin ecosystem by enabling lightning-fast, low-cost smart contracts, decentralized apps, and even meme coin creation. By combining Bitcoin's unmatched security with Solana's high-performance framework, the project opens the door to entirely new use cases, including seamless BTC bridging and scalable dApp development. The presale has already crossed $13 million, leaving only a limited allocation still available.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Hayes, the BitMEX co-founder now serving as co-founder and chief investment officer of crypto-focused venture capital firm Maelstrom, says Hyperliquid's HYPE token could soar more than 100-fold. At Maelstrom, he invests in early-stage infrastructure projects. In his latest blog post, Hayes argued Hyperliquid's token could rise 126 times, a claim backed by a valuation model produced by Maelstrom. Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange built on its own blockchain. Unlike Coinbase or Binance, which are companies running private servers, Hyperliquid lives fully on-chain. Traders use it mainly for perpetual futures — contracts that let them bet on crypto prices without an expiry date. Its native token, HYPE, acts as both a governance tool and an economic stake. Holders can vote on upgrades, stake tokens for rewards and benefit from the way trading fees link to the token's value. He says when governments print too much money, currencies lose value and ordinary savers are forced to speculate just to maintain their standard of living. Those who don't already own houses or stocks see their savings eroded. For many, especially in emerging markets, the easiest way to save today is with stablecoins such as USDT and USDC — digital dollars that sit natively on blockchains. Once you're holding stablecoins, Hayes argues, the most obvious place to put them to work is crypto itself, since that's the system where those tokens function most easily. Hayes says it already dominates decentralized perpetual futures trading, controlling around two-thirds of the market and is starting to grow against centralized giants like Binance. He believes that Hyperliquid's small team, led by founder Jeff Yan, ships features faster than rivals with hundreds of employees. He calls Hyperliquid a “decentralized Binance.” Like Binance, it relies on stablecoins instead of banks for deposits. Hyperliquid's HIP-3 upgrade also lets outside developers create entirely new markets that plug directly into its order book, turning it into a permissionless trading hub. Maelstrom's model starts with a bold forecast: by 2028, the total value of stablecoins could reach $10 trillion. On that exchange, daily trading volume has often equaled about 26.4% of the total stablecoin supply. On $2.6 trillion in daily activity, that works out to roughly $258 billion in annual revenues once you roll it up across the year. Finally, stack that against HYPE's current fully diluted valuation of around $41 billion. Divide the two, and you get Hayes's headline number: a potential 126x upside. Hayes closes out his thesis with a bold prediction. Long live the King,” he wrote, arguing Hyperliquid could surpass Binance as the world's largest exchange and that Jeff Yan could one day rival CZ's wealth. The model depends on big assumptions: a $10 trillion stablecoin market, Hyperliquid holding a Binance-level share, fees holding at 0.03% and discount rates staying low.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Its recent presale success and innovative features suggest it may offer long-term value, making it a top contender for those seeking the best crypto to buy now. A strong ecosystem, cultural weight and perfect timing is usually what helps these tokens gain adoption. Layer Brett enters the space with that same awareness. However, rather than leaning only on hype, it is grounding its identity in sustainability and long-term value. Instead, it is creating a community where involvement matters. Holders can stake its native tokens and enjoy up to 1,340% APY, turning Layer Brett into more than just a speculative trade. That structure makes Layer Brett potentially the best crypto to buy now. It rewards patience and belief without requiring constant trading. Beyond staking, gamified features give users reasons to keep engaging, helping sustain activity even after the hype fades. As always, the official Ethereum price is attracting institutional money and attention. Over the last 30 days, ETH has gained more than 14%. Bitcoin, on the other hand, according to price charts, has slipped with a negative return of 7.6%. Just this week, ETH hit a record price of $4,945 on August 24. This move has placed it firmly at the center of market discussions. ETH traders now see it setting the pace while others struggle to keep up. With this price movement, ETH's performance shows how quickly leadership can change in crypto space and highlights the growing confidence investors have in the Ethereum network. DOGE's support zone stretches as low as $0.15 and a failure to keep the current uptrend alive could send the price back there. For now, DOGE buyers have managed to defend higher levels. DOGE has avoided sliding to the reload zone with bulls holding firm above $0.20 despite heavy selling pressure. Moreover, earlier support was seen closer to $0.22, but DOGE sellers have chipped away at that level. If the  Dogecoin price falls back that far, it would be an opportunity for accumulation before another possible rally. Although ETH and DOGE equally deserve the title of the best crypto to buy now, their growth pales in comparison to LBRETT's remarkable price rally.
