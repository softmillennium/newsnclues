                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People wait for loved ones from Guatemala deported from the United States outside La Aurora International Airport, in Guatemala City, Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025. HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) — After the U.S. government loaded children onto planes overnight to be sent back to their native Guatemala, a federal judge temporarily blocked the flights — with the youngsters still inside — as their attorneys said authorities were violating U.S. laws and sending vulnerable kids into potential peril. The extraordinary drama played out over predawn hours on a U.S. holiday weekend and vaulted from tarmacs in Texas to a courtroom in Washington. For now, hundreds of Guatemalan children who arrived unaccompanied will stay while the legal fight plays out over coming weeks. Relatives of unaccompanied minors deported from the United States await updates outside La Aurora International Airport, in Guatemala City, Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025. People board a plane in Harlingen, Texas Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025, as four charter buses are pulled into the side of the airport to unload dozens of passengers. “I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” said Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, who noted her ruling applies broadly to Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. without parents or guardians. Minutes after she concluded a hastily scheduled hearing Sunday afternoon, five charter buses pulled up to a plane parked at the border-area airport in Harlingen, Texas. Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers — perhaps 50 — toward the plane in a part of the airport restricted to government planes, including deportation flights. The passengers were wearing colored clothing that is used in government-run shelters for migrant children. One girl said her parents, in Guatemala, got a strange phone call a few weeks ago saying the U.S. was deporting her, said one of the attorneys, Efrén C. Olivares of the National Immigration Law Center. Other children — identified only by their initials — said in court documents that they had been neglected, abandoned, physically threatened or abused in their home country. In a lawsuit in Arizona, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project said one of its clients is a 12-year-old asylum-seeker who has chronic kidney disease, needs dialysis to stay alive and will need a kidney transplant. Two other plaintiffs, a 10-year-old boy and his 3-year-old sister, don't have family in Guatemala and don't want to return, according to the group. Gilberto López said he drove through the night from his remote town after his 17-year-old nephew called at midnight, saying that he was being deported from Texas. Gilberto Lopez, a relative of an unaccompanied minor deported from the United States, awaits updates outside La Aurora International Airport, in Guatemala City, Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025. The boy left Guatemala two years ago, at age 15, to work in the U.S. and was detained about a month ago, López said. Migrant children who arrive in the U.S. without their parents or guardians are routinely handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. They often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a relative — living in the country. An attorney with the National Center for Youth Law said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children — particularly Guatemalans — in facilities of the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Then, on Friday, advocates began getting word that their young clients' immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said. Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that officials had drafted a list of children to return to Guatemala. A relative of an unaccompanied minor deported from the United States reviews the list of those deported outside La Aurora International Airport, in Guatemala City, Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025. Government lawyer Drew Ensign told the Washington judge that one plane might have taken off but then returned. The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday. The rapid-fire developments resembled a March weekend showdown over the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Advocates implored a federal judge to halt deportations they believed were imminent, while the Trump administration was mum about its plans. The Guatemalan government has said it's ready to take them in. It is another step in the Trump administration's sweeping immigration enforcement efforts, which include plans to send a surge of officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, ramping up deportations and ending protections for people who have had permission to live and work in the United States.</p>

Ghislaine Maxwell told the Department of Justice in an interview in a Florida prison that there is no client list in the Jeffrey Epstein case. House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requesting the Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) regarding Jeffrey Epstein and his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Comer sent the letter on Sunday, saying his committee is "reviewing the possible mismanagement" of the federal government's investigation of Epstein and Maxwell, including Epstein's death. "It is essential that Treasury produce to the Committee certain SARs to assist the Committee's oversight of the federal government's enforcement of sex trafficking laws generally and specifically its handling of the investigation and prosecution of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell," the letter states. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were both indicted on federal sex trafficking charges stemming from Epstein's years of abuse of underage girls. Fox News Digital reached out to the Treasury Department for comment on the letter but did not immediately hear back. Earlier this year, Comer established the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets, which requested that the Department of Justice release all Epstein-related records. House Oversight Committee investigators are probing the government's handling of Epstein's case. (New York State Sex Offender Registry via AP, File) Mueller was set to appear before the House Oversight panel on Tuesday as part of the probe, though a source familiar with the investigation told Fox News Digital that lawmakers "learned that Mr. Mueller has health issues that preclude him from being able to testify." Mueller would have been the second witness to appear in-person before the committee after former Attorney General Bill Barr did so last month.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Members of the Louisiana National Guard patrol Union Station, Saturday, Aug. 30, 2025, in Washington. But the 63-year old retired handyman and U.S. Navy veteran does praise Trump for one thing. “Crime is a big problem,” he went on. McWilliams' views reflect the thinking of a lot of Democrats, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It finds that while most disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue, a large majority, 68%, see crime as a “major problem” in large cities. That's despite the fact that statistics show crime, overall, is down across the nation, with some cities reporting 30-year lows. They must thread the needle between criticizing Trump's policies, which are deeply unpopular among their base, while at the same time not dismissing widespread concerns about safety, which are amplified in many news sources and in online forums like Facebook and the popular Nextdoor app. That could create a vulnerability for the party heading into next year's midterm elections. While Trump remains unpopular overall, the new poll finds his approach to crime has earned him high marks compared to other issues like the economy and immigration. The vast majority of Americans, 81%, also see crime as a “major problem” in large cities. The issue is complex, though, even for those who are concerned. In interviews, participants who oppose Trump's unprecedented takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police department and threats to expand his efforts to other cities expressed alarm, calling his actions anti-American and part of what they see as an effort to distract the public from issues the White House would prefer they ignore. They believe resources would be better spent investing in community policing, mental health services and passing meaningful laws to get guns off city streets. But many also bemoaned the state of public safety in the country, even if they said they felt safe in their own neighborhoods and acknowledged that violent crime is down after a pandemic-era spike. Several noted that they or their neighbors had been the victims of serious crimes and complained about what they felt was a lackluster police response. Brian Cornelia, 62, a retired foreman and lifelong Democrat who lives in Michigan, near Marquette, is displeased with the performance of both parties. “Now with Trump what he's doing, that's nuts too.” He said that crime is “not at all” an issue where he lives and “down all over,” but nonetheless appreciates that Trump is doing something. Either way, he said Trump had backed Democrats into a corner. Even those who give Trump credit question his tactics. About 8 in 10 Democrats say it's “completely” or “somewhat” unacceptable for the president to seize control of local police departments, as he's done in Washington. And about 6 in 10 say it's unacceptable for the federal government to use the U.S. military and National Guard to assist local police. “I don't approve of national troops having authority over fellow Americans,” said McWilliams, the Navy veteran. McWilliams, who lives in White Hall, Pennsylvania, said crime “is practically non-existent” in his neighborhood, where he doesn't even lock his door. “I'm glad he does want to fight crime because – well, nobody else is doing it, certainly not our mayors and governors and police department,” he said, accusing them of being “too politically correct” to pursue controversial tactics like “stop and frisk,” which he believes works. “I think he's just terrible,” said Carolyn Perry, 79, a lifelong Democrat and retired nurse who lives in Philadelphia and sees Trump's actions as an excuse to target Democratic cities that voted against him. “I think this National Guard thing he's doing is ridiculous,” she said. Democrat Star Kaye, 59, who lives in Downey, California, near Los Angeles, agreed, slamming Trump for using the military against residents — something she said the Revolutionary War was fought, in part, against. “Of course living in a big city, I understand concerns about crime,” she said. “But I don't think an authoritarian playbook is the right way to fix them.”′ If the president really wanted to tackle the issue, she argued, he would be investing in local police departments instead of diverting resources to immigration enforcement. She sees the crackdown as part of a broader effort to bolster Republicans' chances in next year's midterm elections. Gallup polling from April found that only about one-third of Democrats said they worried “a great deal” about crime and violence and were more likely to be concerned about the economy, Social Security, the environment, hunger and homelessness. Crime has also traditionally been a stronger issue for Republicans, including in the 2024 election. Democrats acknowledged the gap last week at a national party gathering in Minneapolis. In a presentation to Democratic National Committee members, party strategists noted Republicans spent about three times as much on crime-related ads as Democrats in recent presidential election years. They urged Democrats not to mimic the “tough-on-crime” rhetoric Republicans have embraced for decades, but instead position themselves as being “serious about safety, not empty scare tactics.” “DON'T TAKE TRUMP'S CRIME BAIT—INSTEAD, LEAN INTO SOLUTIONS TO PREVENT CRIME, RESPOND TO CRISIS, AND STOP VIOLENCE,” they urged in a slide presentation. Some Democratic politicians have been trying to do just that. He defended Democrats' approach and said local efforts to tackle crime have been working. The AP-NORC poll of 1,182 adults was conducted Aug. 21-25, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in China on Sunday for a summit and celebrations for the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender. The group was established by China and Russia in 2001 with a focus on security in Central Asia and the wider region. Russian President Vladimir Putin, center left, Chinese President Xi Jinping, center, and his wife Peng Liyuan, center right, pose for a photo with other leaders during a ceremony to welcome Heads of States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China , on Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025. Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping greet each other at a ceremony to welcome Heads of States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025. Russian President Vladimir Putin arrives to attend a ceremony to welcome Heads of States of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China , on Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025. TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of eight other nations are set to meet in northern China for the latest summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in a possible challenge to often incoherent approaches by the United States to trade and regional conflicts. Some call it the scariest grouping you have never heard of. The full membership includes Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Others including India, China and Russia have a more nebulous relationship, either because of Washington's wobbly stance on Russia's war with Ukraine or because of chaos surrounding U.S. tariffs that have upended key trading relationships with countries such as China and India. Since its 2001 founding, the SCO primarily has been dominated by China, the regional economic superpower, with Russia seeking to use the group to maintain its influence over former Central Asian Soviet republics Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan. While Russia's economic influence has declined steadily, especially under increasingly severe Western sanctions, both Russia and China have used the alliance as a framework for regional military cooperation, albeitlimited to joint drills and firing competitions. Belarus, Iran, Pakistan and India joined later in an apparent attempt to share in the SCO's budding influence, though the value of their membership is debatable. Iran and Belarus have faced international condemnation over sanctions and human rights violations, while Pakistan is highly dependent on China for military hardware. Since the Russia-Ukraine war began, India has become a major buyer of Russian oil, increasing tensions with Washington. Modi also remarked on “steady progress” in improving relations with China after meeting its top diplomat in August and noted “respect for each other's interests and sensitiveness.'' India's SCO entry potentially challenges Russian and Chinese domination over the association. Despite their trade ties, India is unlikely to offer meaningful support for Russia's war in Ukraine or China's claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea. India has also long sought a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council but has received only tepid back from China and Russia, possibly to prevent their influence with the West from being diluted. Yet expectations have not been high for India to sign. Beijing has given few hints of what solid progress it expects from the summit, which is in keeping with the secretive nature of its diplomacy and politics. The leaders of about a dozen other countries are joining the summit as SCO dialogue partners or guests, including Egypt, Nepal and several Southeast Asian nations. Xinhua spoke of the organization being guided by the “Shanghai Spirit, which features mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development.” Xinhua noted documents would be signed including a notice of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, which the ruling Communist Party will mark with a military parade in central Beijing on Sept. 3. “For China's leadership, there is a lot of emphasis on maintaining existing relations in the international arena even though the SCO has not been effective in dealing with the major challenges of today,” Yang said. The summit comes just days before a massive military parade through Beijing marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender at the end of WWII attended by Xi and other leaders, including a rare showing by North Korea's Kim Jong Un, Yang said. Yet the questions remain, ”to what end and how?” For Xi, “presiding over the gathering in Tianjin should net him some favorable publicity and possibly further his image as leader of a new global world order,” Dreyer said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff, right, of the United States, wipes away tears while talking to Naomi Osaka, of Japan, after Osaka defeated Gauff in the third round of the U.S. Open tennis tournament Saturday, Aug. 31, 2019, in New York. NEW YORK (AP) — So much has happened for Naomi Osaka — in tennis, away from tennis — since she first played Coco Gauff at the U.S. Open back in 2019. Over that time, Osaka has won two Grand Slam trophies to raise her career total to four, helped spark a global conversation about mental health by revealing she felt anxiety and depression, taken a series of breaks from the tour and become a mother. The Gauff vs. Osaka matchup in the fourth round at Flushing Meadows on Monday serves as both a reminder — to them, to others — of that night six years ago, as well as all that's transpired since. “Just to be at this point of my life and to be playing her again,” Osaka said, “is, honestly, for me ... kind of special.” Osaka won in straight sets in Arthur Ashe Stadium, but what was most memorable was what happened after the last point. Gauff was crying, and Osaka walked over to console her and suggest that she address the crowd — highly unusual for the loser of a match. Osaka recalls recognizing how much talent and poise Gauff possessed for such a young player. “I thought she just handled herself really well,” said Osaka, who is seeded 23rd at Flushing Meadows and recently began working with Iga Swiatek's former coach, Tomasz Wiktorowski, “and I knew she was going to be back there.” At the next Grand Slam tournament, she pulled out before her second-round match and explained the off-court struggles she had been dealing with, then took the first of a handful of mental health breaks. She was off the tour for part of that stretch while on maternity leave. On Saturday, she spoke about “the journey getting back here.” “I just feel happy,” said Osaka, 27, “because I feel like all of my hard work is amounting to something.” 3 in New York while working with a biomechanics expert to retool her problematic serve. I support her from afar in all the things that she's done on and off the court,” Gauff said. “It would be a cool kind of deja vu-type of situation,” she said, guessing that this rematch will be in Ashe, too, “but hopefully it will be a different result.” Howard Fendrich has been the AP's tennis writer since 2002.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Israeli security cabinet convened on Sunday to review plans for seizing control of Gaza City, as the government faces mounting international pressure and unprecedented domestic opposition, even from Israel's own security leaders. The review is merely a formal update for the full security cabinet, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz already approved the IDF's plans earlier this month. But it comes as Israel faces a crucial few weeks at home and abroad. Alongside the planned military escalation, Netanyahu and the cabinet – made up of senior officials including Katz and far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir - are expected to discuss a diplomatic offensive in response to the anticipated wave of recognition for Palestinian statehood at next month's UN General Assembly. Annexing any part of the occupied West Bank by applying Israeli sovereignty would violate multiple UN Security Council resolutions and spark an enormous diplomatic backlash. But it's exactly what Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners are demanding. The Israeli military carried out intense strikes in and around Gaza City in recent days as it prepares to take over and occupy the city itself. An additional 24 people were killed in Gaza City since Sunday morning, figures showed. Hamas continues to have a presence in Gaza despite nearly two years of fighting and  one of the latest Israel attacks killed Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida, Katz said. “Soon, as the campaign in Gaza intensifies, many more of his partners in crime - the murderers and rapists of Hamas - will join him there,” he added. Earlier this month Hamas accepted the Qatari and Egyptian mediators most recent offer for a 60-day temporary ceasefire, during which 10 of the living hostages would be returned in exchange for a mass release of Palestinian prisoners. The offer is based on a similar proposal presented by the US special envoy Steve Witkoff in July, originally crafted in coordination with Israel. New video reveals third strike in deadly ‘double-tap' attack on Gaza hospital However, Netanyahu, in coordination with the White House, has recently shifted strategy. After months of insisting on negotiating only phased and partial frameworks, he now says he is willing to discuss only a comprehensive deal that would release all of the hostages and end the war on Israeli terms and conditions. As a result, Israel still hasn't responded to Hamas's acceptance of the Qatari-Egyptian proposal on August 18. According to two senior Israeli officials, Netanyahu does not intend to raise the negotiations in Sunday's cabinet meeting as well, though the issue may come up during the presentation on Gaza City.</p>

National Border Council Vice President Art del Cueto joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the manhunt for an illegal immigrant accused of attempting to run over an ICE agent as President Donald Trump continues his historic border crackdown. A lawsuit brought by Attorney General Pam Bondi against Kentucky's public education apparatus over in-state tuition for illegal immigrants resulted in an agreement to end the practice, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman told Fox News Digital in a Thursday interview. Coleman said the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education (KCPE) agreed to change state policy two months after the Justice Department first took the commonwealth to court over a provision in state law 13 KAR 2:045. The suit alleged Kentucky's policy violated 18 USC 1623, which states that "notwithstanding any other provision of law, an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a state for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit … without regard to whether the citizen or national is such a resident." A sign on U.S. 460 leaving Virginia greets drivers near Mouthcard, Kentucky, in 2017. Coleman noted that governors do, however, have a role in appointing members to the council. "Under current federal law, any illegal immigrant is barred from eligibility for postsecondary education benefits, like in-state tuition, unless the same benefits are offered to every U.S. citizen," Coleman said. Bondi noted in a statement obtained by Coleman's office that "no state can be allowed to treat Americans like second-class citizens in their own country by offering financial benefits to illegal aliens." "Nonsensical is not a term that I didn't expect to use as often as I have the last year," he said of the case. "It's a term from a Harry Potter book or a Roald Dahl book, but nonsensical is spot on and what we're dealing with here," Coleman said of what he called putting illegal immigrants and noncitizens before Americans. Coleman said the original policy incentivized noncitizens to come to Kentucky over other states that may not offer them the same leg up. "There is a joint motion for what is known as a consent judgment," he said, adding that he has not formally put out any statement on the case as of yet in due respect to the judge who has to sign the consent agreement. In Fox News Digital's prior reporting, a spokesperson for Beshear noted the governor has no authority over KCPE, but Coleman appeared not entirely convinced of the dynamic. Beshear "won't hesitate to take credit for any positive policy that comes out of KCPE," he said. "He appointed most members of the KCPE and in real world you're responsible for those that you appoint to these roles, that you have influence on those you appoint to these role, but yet of course who wants to walk away from that because of the nonsensical nature of this." Coleman, who was a former U.S. attorney before becoming the commonwealth's top lawman, said it should not have taken Bondi and the Trump administration to put an end to in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in the Bluegrass State. "They should be stewards of these institutions," he said. "What they do is important and we have great universities in this commonwealth. They need to be focusing on incentivizing. The best and the brightest to come to this commonwealth, not incentivizing those that are out of status, that are violating our laws." He also said he hopes Bondi will continue pursuing others of the more than a dozen states with similar policies. "I'm fully on board with common sense returning and whether it is protecting girls from men playing in their sports to enforcing federal law in the immigration context," he said. "I'm for our universities supporting our best and brightest and not perpetuating this incentive for those that are out of status to fill seats in the classrooms." "That is not only unlawful, it comes back to the notion of just head-scratching and nonsensical." Fox News Digital reached out to Beshear's office, the Justice Department and a representative for KCPE for comment. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

Latvian tennis star Jelena Ostapenko apologized on social media for what she told American tennis player Taylor Townsend during an emotional outburst after a U.S. Open loss. Ostapenko told Townsend she had "no education" as she pointed her finger at her opponent following an early-tournament loss to the American. She wrote on social media that English is not her native language, "so when I said education, I was speaking only about what I believe (is) tennis etiquette, but I understand how the words I used could have offended many people beyond the tennis court." Jelena Ostapenko argues with Taylor Townsend following their match at the U.S. Open on Aug. 27, 2025, in New York City. Townsend reacted to the apology after she won her doubles match on Saturday. At the end of the day, I think that it's a learning lesson for her.... It's great that she went to social media and apologized. But I really hope that, from this, she can take that like, hey, you can't control people and it's better just to focus on yourself." Townsend said she hadn't personally heard from Ostapenko. Townsend, who is Black, was asked by a reporter if Ostapenko's comments at the net had racial undertones. "I didn't take it in that way, but also, you know, that has been a stigma in our community of being ‘not educated' and all of the things, when it's the furthest thing from the truth," Townsend replied. "So, whether it had racial undertones or not, that's something she can speak on. The only thing that I'm worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament."

Ostapenko said immediately after the match she was upset Townsend didn't apologize after being helped by a net cord during a point. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Unleash Prosperity Executive Dir, Tim Doescher and NTU Executive VP Brandon Arnold discuss the effects of a tariff loophole being closed, Labor Day gas prices, and how universities can prepare students for an AI-driven job market. Labor Day vacationers across the East Coast are facing "fecal contamination" warnings at their beaches this holiday weekend. Water quality warnings have struck coastal areas from Maine to Florida this week, with advisories saying high levels of bacteria could cause nausea or rashes. There have been closures this week at some of the country's most popular beach destinations, including Keyes Memorial Beach in the Cape Cod village of Hyannis in Barnstable, Massachusetts, and Benjamin's Beach on Long Island in Bay Shore, New York. A report from Environment America assessed beach safety by examining whether fecal bacteria levels exceeded standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that trigger an alert to avoid the water. Fecal bacteria at those levels can cause illness in 32 out of every 1,000 swimmers. Beaches across the East Coast are showing higher levels of "fecal contamination" this Labor Day weekend. John Rumpler, clean water director and senior attorney with Environment America, said aging sewer systems are to blame for much of the contamination. "We need to make the investment to make sure that literally our own human waste doesn't wind up in the places where we are swimming." Nevertheless, many people plan to enjoy the ocean anyway this weekend. Despite a two-day warning of elevated fecal indicator bacteria last month at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, beachgoer Yaromyr Oryshkevych was not concerned. "I really don't expect to be in any kind of danger of fecal contamination," Oryshkevych, a retired dentist, told the Associated Press. He said he didn't think Rehoboth was close enough to notable pollution to be concerned, and he expected the ocean's natural currents to take care of any problems with contamination in the area. In North Carolina, five beaches were under advisories in late August because of elevated levels of fecal bacteria. The beaches are open, but swimmers are advised that going in the water could be risky, said Erin Bryan-Millush, environmental program supervisor with the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality. Many beachgoers plan to enjoy coastal waters regardless of contamination advisories. Bryan-Millush said heavy rain from storms like the recent Hurricane Erin exacerbated the issue in parts of the East Coast, noting that "storm drains carry everything" out onto coastal beaches. "It could be really bad for someone who is immune compromised," Bryan-Millush said. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

In this photo released by Xinhua News Agency, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, front right, arrives for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China Saturday, Aug. 30, 2025. TIANJIN, China (AP) — Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged on Sunday to resolve their border differences and bolster cooperation ahead of the opening of a regional summit in Tianjin. Modi is on his first visit to China since relations between the two countries deteriorated after Chinese and Indian soldiers engaged in deadly border clashes in 2020. Modi is visiting as part of India's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, a regional political, economic and security group founded by China. Modi said in his opening remarks that relations with China have moved in “a meaningful direction,” adding that “there is a peaceful environment at the borders after disengagement.” He also noted “the importance of peace and tranquillity on the border areas for continued development of bilateral relations,” according to a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs. Xi said he hoped the Tianjin meeting will “further elevate” and “promote the sustained, healthy and stable development of bilateral relations,” according to state broadcaster CCTV. “As long as they remain committed to the overarching goal of being partners, not rivals, and providing development opportunities, not threats, China-India relations will flourish and move forward steadily,” Xi said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who arrived in Tianjin on Sunday, is due to meet with both leaders in the coming days. Earlier in August, China's top diplomat Wang Yi flew to New Delhi, as the two sides announced their rapprochement. Wang's visit coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to impose 50% tariffs on India over its purchase of Russian oil, but New Delhi's process of rebuilding ties with Beijing had been in the works for months. Modi made that message clear Sunday, saying that “India and China both pursue strategic autonomy, and their relations should not be seen through a third country lens,” according to India's foreign ministry. AP video journalist Rishi Lekhi in New Delhi contributed to this report.</p>

Former U.S. Secret Service agent and campus security expert Bobby McDonald shares essential tips to help students protect themselves as they return to campus. College campuses across the country descended into chaos this week as false reports of active shooters sparked mass panic, lockdowns and major police responses – only to be revealed as coordinated hoaxes. On Monday alone, at least six universities reported active shooter alerts. All turned out to be false alarms, but not before causing widespread disruption and fear. They disrupt the educational process and communities into upheaval," Ken Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, told Fox News Digital. Law enforcement officers respond to reports of a shooting on the University of Arkansas campus on Monday, Aug. 25, 2025, in Fayetteville, Ark. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) confirmed to Fox News Digital that it's seeing a nationwide increase in swatting incidents and is working closely with local agencies to investigate the coordinated threats. "The FBI is seeing an increase in swatting events across the country, and we take potential hoax threats very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk," a spokesperson for the FBI said. The bureau warned that these hoaxes not only waste law enforcement time and resources but also endanger lives. Swatting refers to the act of falsely reporting an emergency, often involving an active shooter, to prompt a massive law enforcement response. "The FBI is seeing an increase in swatting events across the country, and we take potential hoax threats very seriously because it puts innocent people at risk," a spokesperson said. "Every call has to be treated as real. There is no other option," retired FBI Special Agent Jason Pack explained to Fox News Digital. "Swatting is a crime that endangers entire communities. Treating it with the full weight of law enforcement from local patrol officers to the FBI working across borders is the only way to prevent one of these hoaxes from ending in tragedy." Even after threats are deemed false, emotional aftershocks and misinformation continue to disrupt campuses, drain resources and test school resilience. "We're in the state of the greatest ambiguity, uncertainty, and anxiety around school safety than I've ever seen in my career," Trump said. People shelter behind a wall on the Villanova University campus in Villanova, Pennsylvania, on Thursday, where an active shooter was reported. Even when threats are quickly proven false, Trump said the effects linger with "an enduring psychological impact." "Even when incidents are found to not be credible… the anxiety, the upheaval, the concerns go on for days, weeks and months," Trump said in reference to students, staff and parents. The trend isn't confined to one city or state – it's spread across campuses nationwide, from large universities to smaller colleges. Here are 10 campuses that faced terrifying false alarms: School officials at the University of Texas at San Antonio provided an update after being the victim of two swatting incidents. (UTSA - The University of Texas at San Antonio Facebook) "UTSA Police responded to both reports and, out of an abundance of caution, issued alerts to the campus community. Students were temporarily evacuated from on-campus housing Tuesday night while the university investigated reports of a "credible active threat." "Upon investigation, both incidents were determined to be unfounded. Police will continue to maintain an enhanced presence on campus. Out of precaution, the school added that there will be an "enhanced presence" of law enforcement on campus for the time being. An active shooter was reported Thursday at Villanova University. The alert system ordered students to shelter in place, barricade doors and await further instructions. Social media quickly filled with images of frightened students scrambling to safety. The shelter-in-place order was lifted around 6 p.m. after law enforcement found no credible threat. Peter Donohue called the situation a "cruel hoax," adding that while there were no injuries or evidence of firearms, the psychological toll was severe. "Today's events have shaken our entire community," he wrote in a campus-wide statement. Authorities say the initial call to 911 described a man with an AR-15-style weapon, complete with background noises mimicking gunfire. A separate call claimed someone had been shot. Police responded swiftly, but it became clear the threat wasn't real. "I'm profoundly grateful no one was hurt, and thankful to all members of law enforcement who ran toward reports of danger to keep Pennsylvanians safe." Officials with the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga say an investigation is underway following an active shooter hoax. At the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga, classes were canceled after a false report of a shooter sent the campus into lockdown. The school's police department released a statement about the incident, calling it "a criminal act, intended to be disruptive and cause chaos." No injuries were reported despite a 911 call claiming otherwise and police are continuing to investigate. "While this incident did not pose a true emergency, it is essential that students, employees, affiliates, and guests treat such situations as genuine threats to life until public safety officials confirm otherwise," police said. The University of Arkansas on Monday reported an active shooter situation. The University of Arkansas also called off classes on Monday after officials confirmed that reports of an "active threat" could not be substantiated. Students were first alerted to a possible active shooter near Mullins Library shortly before 12:30 p.m. via the university's RazALERT emergency system. Police received over 300 calls from landlines and more than 30 emergency 911 calls, all reporting an active shooter in seven separate campus buildings. Some callers claimed to have seen a shooter or heard gunfire. "It's looking as if this was another swatting or hoax call," Matt Mills, University of Arkansas Police Department assistant chief, said. First day of classes interrupted by Hale Library hoax. Another Midwest university fell victim to a swatting incident on Monday, striking on the first day of classes for students. Kansas State University school officials confirmed they were the target of a "swatting attack" that was intended to disrupt classes. Officials said Riley County Dispatch received a call on their administrative line of a message claiming that there was "active violence at Hale Library." "Officers immediately responded and determined the call was a hoax and there was no threat or danger," a statement from the school read. "Officers responded promptly this morning after receiving several calls and found no credible threat," the department wrote in a news release. Campus police added that they would continue to monitor the situation and "take all threats seriously." "The calls appear to be similar to several anonymous and false ‘swatting calls' at universities across the country, triggering a response from law enforcement." "Shooter" turned out to be a man with an umbrella. On Sunday evening, the University of South Carolina lifted a campus-wide alert and declared an "all clear" following earlier warnings about a possible active shooter. Officials confirmed that there was no current threat. Earlier that night, the university had instructed students and faculty on the Columbia campus to shelter in place after receiving a report of an active shooter near the Thomas Cooper Library. ET, advising individuals to stay away from the area and either evacuate or barricade themselves if needed. Later, authorities stated they had found no signs of a shooter. "Police are searching affected buildings," read a message from the school's alert system. However, Scott Prill, deputy chief of police at the university, clarified that the individual was actually carrying an umbrella. Students walk through the University of Colorado Boulder campus during a winter storm on March 13, 2021. The university said a shelter-in-place order was issued across the main campus after someone falsely claimed to hear gunshots near Norlin Library from Sewall Hall. Police thoroughly searched the affected buildings, finding no threat, injuries or suspects. The incident is being investigated as a hoax. The University of New Hampshire also reported they were victim to swatting calls on the first day of school on Monday. "At approximately 6:30 p.m., the UNH Police Department responded to a report of shots fired in the library on campus," UNH police said in a Facebook post Monday night. "Officers arrived immediately and conducted a thorough search. The call was confirmed to be a hoax." North Arizona University was one of several schools that was the victim of a swatting hoax on Monday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It also reflects their hesitation about contesting Trump's actions relating to immigration and crime. But the tendency of Democratic congressional leaders like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries to dismiss Trump's moves threatening democracy as a “distraction” from other issues has created the most significant fissure between the party's grassroots and its Washington leadership. That one word now divides the principal competing theories of how Democrats should respond to Trump's militant second term. Some believe that Trump's 2024 victory demonstrated the necessity of remaining “laser-focused” on average families' economic struggles, while others are just as certain that soft-pedaling Trump's moves to shatter democratic safeguards — especially his domestic deployment of the military — is a moral as well as an electoral failure. “I think it misses completely where Democrats are at.” If party leaders maintain that course, in 2026 Democratic candidates “would have turnout problems that would make the turnout problems of ‘24 look like child's play,” Lake said. “They don't understand that it is the central ballgame, the central point — that we are under a fascist dictatorship for billionaires. Democrats in this camp see the special election victory last week of an Iowa Democratic state Senate candidate who ran on a message of affordability in a deep red-district as evidence they're right. They clearly see time spent focusing on those moves as a distraction from their own desire to center the 2026 campaigns on the argument that Trump's agenda has favored the rich at the expense of average families, couched in language that Chris Matthews could have written for Tip O'Neill to use against Ronald Reagan. In June, Schumer called Trump's dispatch of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles “a dangerous authoritarian overreach that threatens the very fabric of our democracy.” When Trump sent the Guard into Washington and seized control of the city's police department, Jeffries described it as “nothing more than an illegitimate power grab.” After the deployment to Washington, Schumer told one podcast host that Trump's action were a distraction, “plain and simple.” Trump, with his troop deployments, is trying “to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he's deeply unpopular,” Jeffries told CNN's Dana Bash on “State of the Union.” He added,  “The one big ugly bill is deeply unpopular.” This approach has deeply frustrated those Democrats who believe that it shows these leaders consider Trump's assaults on democratic institutions less important than whatever they say he's diverting attention from. “You're dismissing (Trump's troop deployments), and you are dismissing all of the people who are horrified by it, and all of the people who are living under this level of oppression,” said Lake. Democrats have been compulsively picking at that scab since the 2024 election, when many across the party felt that Vice President Kamala Harris failed to articulate a convincing economic message and relied too much on warnings about democracy. To a striking extent, this divide does not track the party's familiar tensions between progressive and centrist elements. “If you have one thing to say, hammer Trump on the economy,” Tulchin said. “Ultimately it's going to be the most effective thing we do through next November.” But he agrees that Democrats should emphasize the economy rather than Trump's authoritarian actions. “He wants us locked in a fight over this instead.” Anat Shenker-Osorio, a leading progressive message consultant, believes this argument is flawed on many levels. Gavin Newsom, has generally argued for moving the party in a more centrist direction. “In our party we have so many armchair generals who love to spout the conventional wisdom about ‘only fighting on our terrain,'” Clegg said. You don't always get to pick your ground. Democratic congressional leaders may be especially hesitant about opposing Trump's National Guard deployments because of their links to immigration and crime, two of his strongest issues in polls. Brad Todd, a Republican strategist and CNN commentator, says Democratic congressional leaders are correct to resist a full-scale confrontation over Trump's domestic troop deployments. “I think they rightly understand that fighting Trump on crime and immigration is picking ground he's going to beat you on,” Todd said. Still, several recent polls have found that more Americans oppose than support Trump's DC deployment (though another also found most say it's acceptable for the National Guard to “assist” local police). And Clegg noted that support for Trump's handling of internal immigration enforcement — as opposed to securing the border — has dropped since Newsom and others confronted the president over his Los Angeles offensive. Newsom has emphasized that Trump is not floating troop deployments into red-state cities with higher crime and murder rates than Washington. “If the president is sincere about the issue of crime and violence, there's no question in my mind that he'll likely be sending the troops into Louisiana and Mississippi to address the just unconscionable wave of violence that continues to plague those states,” Newsom said at a news conference on Thursday. Pritzker has been unsparing in denouncing Trump as a “wannabe dictator,” as he put in a fiery news conference last week decrying the president's threats to deploy the National Guard to Chicago. Surrounded by local business, religious and civic leaders, Pritzker struck a conspicuously more urgent tone than the party's Congressional leadership. “If it sounds to you like I am alarmist, that is because I am ringing an alarm,” Pritzker insisted, before describing the prospect of troops on Chicago streets as “unprecedented, unwarranted, illegal, unconstitutional, un-American.” Newsom has attracted even more attention among Democrats by resisting Trump actions he's portrayed as a threat to democracy through over three dozen lawsuits; speeches; mocking social media posts; and his ballot initiative to offset the Texas Republican gerrymander. Tellingly, on the day Trump sent the National Guard into Washington, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi posted on social media that the president was acting “to distract” from his policy “blunders.” Newsom posted: “This is what dictators do.” In a recent interview with podcaster Molly Jong-Fast, Newsom implicitly criticized the instinct of other Democratic leaders to pivot back to economic issues whenever possible. “I know a lot of good people (say), ‘Just play nice … and people will pay attention to your 10-point plan on affordability,'” he told her. Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg says that while there is an electoral logic to the congressional determination to center economic issues, Newsom is much more accurately reflecting the mounting frustration and anxiety of party activists. “They feel the Democratic Party is not taking on Trump effectively and they don't understand what anyone is doing,” she said. So, when people like Newsom do what he's done, he represents kind of what Democratic voters are looking for in the party.” Voters' lukewarm response to Harris' democracy messages last year, Greenberg added, is no guarantee they would not react to a more forceful message now that Trump has fulfilled or exceeded many of her warnings. Neither side in this Democratic debate sees the choice as absolute. Tulchin agrees that showing concern about Trump's moves to consolidate power will be essential to turning out the party's growing base of college-educated voters — who respond much more powerfully than swing working-class voters to messages about democracy, he said. Conversely, Lake, Shenker-Osorio, Greenberg and Clegg all agree the party must present a sharp populist critique of Trump's economic priorities. Yet the difference in emphasis between these two approaches is real, and not unique to Democrats. These same tensions have divided other parties around the world facing opponents maneuvering to entrench strongman rule, said Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth University political scientist who studies democratic backsliding. Looking at the experience of other countries, Nyhan said, “the science isn't clear” on whether it is more effective for parties opposing quasi-authoritarian opponents to stress their anti-democratic actions or to focus on conventional political concerns like affordability. Polls showing that more voters are worried about material issues than democracy can become a self-perpetuating cycle, he said. Democrats are looking for ways to drive down Trump's approval rating, she said, but this far from the next election they should be trying instead to sharpen public concern about his assault on democratic institutions — just as the GOP in recent years elevated the salience of issues around transgender rights, classroom teaching of race and gender, and undocumented immigrants.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said he will be issuing an executive order requiring voter ID for “every single vote.” Trump teased the order in a Truth Social post on Saturday night, in which he repeated his call for eliminating voting machines as well as mail-in voting with few exceptions. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!! Also, No Mail-In Voting, Except For Those That Are Very Ill, And The Far Away Military. It is unclear when the order will be issued, but the president hinted at an order getting rid of mail-in voting and voting machines earlier this month. Then, Trump did not specifically mention voter ID would be included. According to Ballotpedia, 36 states currently require voters to show identification before casting a ballot, though the type of ID can vary. For example, 25 of those states require photo ID, while the other 11 do not. The 14 remaining states, as well as Washington, D.C., do not require voters to show any form of identification before voting.</p>
