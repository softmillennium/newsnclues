                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For decades, police, medical examiners, and coroners have used the term used to cover up killings in police custody. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. After Maryland's former head medical examiner testified in 2021 that Derek Chauvin was not responsible for George Floyd's death, concerns arose that his pro-law enforcement bias may have affected his office's decisions during his seventeen-year tenure. The resulting independent audit released in May 2025 revealed Mr. Black is not alone — almost forty additional in-custody deaths that had been deemed accidental or undetermined should have been categorized as homicides. And he had a mental disability — severe bipolar disorder  — which, also, made him more likely to experience police violence. But officers at the scene of his death claimed he exhibited “superhuman strength” to justify their use of extreme violence against him. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. “Superhuman strength” is an apparent reference to the now debunked “excited delirium.” For too long, excited delirium has been a tool in the back pockets of police, medical examiners, and coroners used to cover up killings in police custody, leaving families without answers — or justice. That's because this is not just a Maryland problem. Excited delirium was cited by police and other officials in the widely known police-perpetrated killings of George Floyd and Elijah McClain. But it is a pseudoscientific concept that no national medical organization recognizes, and which the Maryland Medical Examiner is no longer permitted to use. It's nevertheless still a part of policing across the country (including in Maryland where excited delirium remains part of law enforcement training materials). Sometimes linking excited delirium to drug use or mental illness, proponents of its validity have for years argued that it causes an array of amorphous “symptoms,” including extreme violence and aggression; superhuman strength; imperviousness to pain; unresponsiveness to police; hallucinations, paranoia, or fear; and notably, sometimes sudden death. Miami coroner Charles Wetli and psychiatrist David Fishbain created the concept of excited delirium in 1985 to explain the deaths of seven recreational drug users, five of whom died in police custody. In the 1980s, Wetli attempted to explain the deaths of thirty-two Black women found dead in Miami with excited delirium. But the medical evidence never supported his claims. They have successfully convinced law enforcement agencies, medical examiners, and coroners (who often have no medical training and are sometimes just the local prosecutor or sheriff) across the country that excited delirium is real. Excited delirium is not merely a discredited pseudoscience that law enforcement continues to accept. Its vague symptoms give officers the latitude to “diagnose” any number of people with excited delirium. It is then used to justify using more violence against people in distress and serves as a cause of death if they die afterwards. And, these “symptoms” mirror stereotypes of Black people (especially Black men) and persons with disabilities, putting them even more at risk of police violence. Since its invention, excited delirium's prevalence in the law enforcement community has never waned. During a time of psychiatric crisis, six deputies repeatedly stun gunned Ms. McKenna — who was naked and already handcuffed — causing cardiac arrest. The deputies later claimed Ms. McKenna exhibited “super-human” or “demonic” strength, but video of the incident does not support those fantastical claims. Excited delirium allows law enforcement's use of extreme force to go unchecked and unexamined. As a post hoc explanation, it serves to justify uses of extreme violence against and — and even the killing of — people in crisis, especially people with disabilities, and particularly those of color. A few jurisdictions have banned use of the term excited delirium — and New York is currently considering a bill that would prohibit public officials from referencing the syndrome in trainings, policies, procedures, death certificates, and autopsy reports. But simply banning the term does not remove excited delirium's influence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This comes as Israel has stepped up its offensive on Gaza City, limiting the deliveries of food and basic supplies in the north of the Palestinian territory. Food experts warned earlier this month that the city was in famine and that half a million people across the strip were facing catastrophic levels of hunger. The Global Sumud Flotilla is carrying food, water and medicine. Activists on board demanded safe passage to deliver the much-needed aid and the opening of a humanitarian sea corridor, according to a statement. The almost 23-month war has killed more than 63,000 people, with at least 332 Palestinians dying of malnutrition, including 124 children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Thousands of supporters flocked to the Barcelona pier, some of them wearing kaffiyehs and chanting “Free Palestine!” and “Boycott Israel!” to send off a wide variety of boats, flying Palestinian flags, from rundown old luxury yachts to tiny wooden sailboats and industrial-looking vessels. One of them, the Sirus, is more than 100 years old. The fleet could reach Gaza around Sept. 14 or 15, he added. The story here is how people are being deliberately deprived of the very basic means to survive,” said Swedish activist Greta Thunberg at a news conference. She is one of the most recognizable figures on the expedition, formed by hundreds of activists, politicians such as the former mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, and journalists. It is not the first time Thunberg has attempted to reach Gaza waters this year. She was deported by Israel in June when the ship she was traveling on with 11 other people, the Madleen, was stopped by the Israeli military. Seized Gaza aid ship docks in Israel with Greta Thunberg aboard “It has been very clear that Israel has been continuously violating international law by either attacking, unlawfully intercepting the boats in international waters, and continuously preventing the humanitarian aid from coming in,” said Thunberg in an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday. The Conscience first tried in May, but was attacked by drones after setting sail from Malta. The girl, Fatima, died four days ago, he said. “What sort of world have we slid into where children are making their own funeral arrangements?” Cunningham told reporters. An Israeli official said Saturday that the country will soon halt or slow humanitarian aid into parts of northern Gaza, as it expands its military offensive against Hamas, a day after the city was declared a combat zone. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when an attack by Hamas militants inside Israel claimed the lives of 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 people hostage.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>He was awake, reading in his cabin bunk. The cook “didn't even finish his sentence. I literally put my flight suit over my pajamas, which I didn't take off for several days after that,” recalled Ballard, senior scientist emeritus in applied ocean physics and engineering at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. They recounted the unusual chain of events that led to that stunning sighting — and how the adventure didn't stop there. “As I came in, we had a picture of the boiler on the wall, and we looked,” Ballard said. “We realized it was definitely (from the) Titanic, and all bedlam grew loose.” The “unsinkable” ship went down on its maiden voyage in a gilded age with American's wealthiest on board, a tale of human folly, class prejudice and technological failure. Its discovery in 1985 only intensified the Titanic's pull on the public imagination; it unleashed a 1997 blockbuster movie that remains one of the highest grossing in film history, several documentaries and museum exhibits, and for those with deep pockets, high-stakes trips to see its final resting place about 13,000 feet (3,900 meters) below the ocean's surface, one of which, in 2023, resulted in fresh tragedy. For ocean explorers such as Ballard and his colleagues, finding the Titanic was like climbing Mount Everest for the first time. The prototype technology that made it possible has since transformed deep-sea exploration and science, vastly expanding scientists' knowledge of the ocean. A 1977 expedition failed when a 3,000-foot drilling pipe to which sonar and cameras were attached snapped in two, according to Ballard's 2021 memoir, “Into the Deep.” The experience, along with the need for live imagery, convinced Ballard that remotely operated underwater vehicles that could stream video back to the exploration vessel were a better way forward, but he struggled to find funding for his vision. “What people didn't know at the time, at least a lot of the people, was that the Titanic (search) was cover for a top-secret military operation I was doing as a naval intelligence officer,” Ballard said. Despite years of planning, Ballard wasn't optimistic that he would find the Titanic for two reasons: The time allotted for the search was short and a French team, led by engineer Jean-Louis Michel of the French oceanographic institution IFREMER with whom Ballard had been cooperating, was using a new, sophisticated ship-mounted sonar system to locate the ship's final resting place. “The agreement was that the French would find it,” Ballard said, “(and) once they found it, I'd have plenty of time, a week would be sufficient, to film it.” Heavier objects sank straight to the seafloor, but lighter debris went down at a slower rate, and ocean currents carried them farther away. He realized that the Titanic, which fell to a similar depth as the Scorpion sub, would have a similar, if not larger,  debris field and that looking for this stream of detritus would be easier than finding the hull and other heavy parts of the vessel. But also “the big thing that led to our success was Ballard's strategy. He wasn't trying to find the ship, he was trying to find the debris field, which is a much bigger target, and one that's particularly well-suited to finding with your eyeballs.” The team returned a year later with more advanced, color cameras to record every inch of the wreckage, including the ship's swimming pool, grand staircase and bow, generating iconic images still familiar today. Ballard also became the first person to visit the wreck that year via Alvin, a crewed submersible that he had previously piloted, which took more than two hours to reach the seafloor. Once there, he spotted poignant artifacts, including a child's doll, uncorked champagne bottles and silverware. Trails of rust covered the Titanic, created by bacteria that feasted on the metal, creating long, reddish spikes — a phenomenon Ballard named “rusticles,” a word that subsequently entered the Oxford English Dictionary. Ballard recalled that some areas, covered in a protective pink paint when the ship was built, looked pristine. To preserve the “very hallowed ground,” Ballard said he advocated using a similar approach — protective paint perhaps applied by underwater robots — to prevent the wreckage from eroding further. The Titanic's final resting place was far from Ballard's only discovery in a long, distinguished career as a scientist and explorer. Ballard went on to discover several other storied wrecks: the Nazi warship Bismark, the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown and PT-109, a Navy vessel commanded by President John F. Kennedy in his mid-20s during World War II. But his golden touch faltered in 2019 when an expedition to locate Amelia Earhart's downed plane turned up empty. While human-operated submersibles still have a role to play, he said that the future of ocean exploration is remote and robotic, and he ultimately envisions that uncrewed ships will ply the world's oceans. To date, about 27% of the seafloor has been mapped. “We're now getting to where we can launch multiple AUVs, autonomous (underwater) vehicles, sort of a pack of dogs that you can send out. At 83, Ballard is still actively exploring the ocean. There, he began mapping vessels and planes lost during five major World War II naval battles between August and December 1942. “I love it when kids tell me to stop discovering things, so there's something left for them to find,” Ballard said. But he said he's confident plenty of unknowns remain about the ocean for the next generation of explorers. Sign up for CNN's Wonder Theory science newsletter.

Scientists are pointing out a possible cause for the collapses: higher sea levels caused by global warming. With a population of about 5.6 million, Alexandria is the second largest city in Egypt. In late July, debris from building collapses was seen scattered throughout a residential area near the seashore. Naglaa Abdelnabi, 36, and her family members were doing household chores under a canvas tarp being used as a roof in the ruins of a collapsed apartment in the Al-Raml district. Her family had lived in the apartment for 25 years. She came back from an outing one day to find the building had disappeared. On the opposite side of Alexandria Port, a leaning eight-story condominium looked as if it was relying on a neighboring high-rise building to stand. Cracks began forming in the pillars and walls a few months ago, and residents, fearing the building may come down, have no choice but to consider moving. About 1,000 buildings collapsed or partly collapsed in Egypt from 2014 to 2020, killing more than 480 people, according to data compiled by Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism. An average of two building collapses occurred each year along Alexandria's seashores from 2001 to 2009, according to a report by a study group that included U.S. university researchers carried in a science journal in February this year. The number has been rising rapidly since around 2011, reaching 22 collapses each year from 2010 to 2021. A combination of factors such as aging buildings and maintenance issues was once considered to be the cause of Egypt's building collapses. However, a new assumption has surfaced: Alexandria's conspicuously high number might be due to higher sea levels. The report published in February explains that Alexandria's seashores have eroded about 3.6 meters on average annually over the past 20 years. It points out that encroaching sea water alongside changes in underground water levels have caused the ground to sink and buildings to collapse. It has constructed coastal levees and scheduled demolitions for about 7,500 buildings in Alexandria that are at risk of collapsing, among other measures. Additionally, Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who inspected some sites in mid-July, announced a plan to build 55,000 alternate housing units. The WMO urged that swift countermeasures are needed to cope with global warming, warning that higher sea levels have damaged ecosystems and infrastructures in coastal areas. Other countries, including Tunisia, Italy and the United States, have also confirmed that buildings have been damaged mainly due to shore erosion.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Funds were appropriated for border wall construction in the Rio Grande Valley during the first Trump administration. Now, the administration is eyeing this biodiverse area in Starr County for its next stage of border fortification. Fish and Wildlife Service pieced together property to protect biodiversity and create a wildlife corridor along the Rio Grande. Endangered ocelots are being reintroduced in the scrub thorn landscape of Starr County. Other notable species in the area include green jays and the chachalaca, a tropical bird known for its distinctive call. Both Democratic and Republican administrations have used these waivers. Conservation advocates said that there is no national security justification for building a wall through the national wildlife refuge. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for further comment. In addition to environmental laws, the Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act, the National Trails System Act and the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act will be waived. Many landowners have fought back, significantly slowing down construction. Texas is also building its own border wall but has made little progress. The Department of Homeland Security under President Joe Biden invoked waivers to continue construction in Starr County in 2023. Noem authorized the waivers in the Federal Register, stating that the Rio Grande Valley is “an area of high illegal entry.” The order states that between fiscal years 2021 and 2025, over 1.5 million undocumented immigrants were apprehended in Custom and Border Protection's Rio Grande Valley sector. The number of migrant apprehensions has plummeted since Trump took office. CBP reported fewer than 1,000 monthly migrant encounters in the Rio Grande Valley sector in June and July this year. The sector spans more than 34,000 square miles. “There is no possible way that someone could argue that there is an emergency at the border that necessitates waiving our nation's most important environmental laws,” CBD's Jordahl said. Scott Nicol, an artist and activist in the Rio Grande Valley, said that the Trump administration is targeting federal lands for border wall construction because it's “easier” than seizing private property. “If you're tasked with doing this tremendously environmentally destructive project, the waivers make it easy,” Nicol said. “The big thing slowing them down is they can't waive property rights so they have to go through condemnation.” Nicol said he has spent significant time in the parts of the wildlife refuge targeted for the wall and has rarely seen border crossers or Border Patrol agents. He said that border wall construction is a “spectacle” and that there is no “particular tactical reason” to target the national wildlife refuge. Mexican agencies have previously objected to border wall plans under the treaty terms. Nicol was dubious that U.S. federal agencies would adequately integrate flood risks into their construction plans. “The IBWC fully supports President Trump's and DHS actions to secure the border for all Americans,” said spokesperson Frank Fisher. “IBWC and DHS have an excellent cooperative relationship that allows the IBWC to carry out all its responsibilities.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weight loss drugs can reduce by half the risk of heart patients being hospitalised or dying early, according to the largest study of its kind. The class of drugs, known as GLP-1 agonists, have been found to offer “dramatic benefits” to heart patients, significantly cutting their risk of falling seriously ill or dying prematurely from any cause. The discovery, revealed at the world's largest heart conference in Madrid, means they could be given to millions of heart patients to help them stay out of hospital and live longer. Weight loss drugs mimic the glucagon-like peptide (GLP) 1 hormone, which makes people feel full, and were initially developed to treat diabetes. In recent years evidence has emerged suggesting they could prove to be lifesaving across a range of conditions beyond obesity. In the study, US researchers from Mass General Brigham, a nonprofit network of doctors and hospitals headquartered in Boston, analysed real-world data from more than 90,000 heart failure patients who were obese and had type 2 diabetes. The results showed that those taking semaglutide were 42% less likely to end up in hospital or die prematurely, compared with a proxy for placebo. Previous studies have suggested weight-loss drugs may improve heart failure symptoms, but their effect on important outcomes such as hospitalisation and death has never been evaluated in large populations until now. “Our findings show that in the future, GLP-1 targeting medications could provide a much-needed treatment option for patients with heart failure.” The findings add to evidence that weight loss drugs may help tackle or prevent heart conditions. The University College London study also found semaglutide brought about cardiovascular benefits, regardless of someone's starting weight or the amount of weight that they had lost. “What this shows is that there is a benefit in using one of these two agents, semaglutide or tirzepatide, to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or all-cause mortality,” he said. Aguiar, a cardiology consultant at Hospital Santa Cruz in Carnaxide, Portugal, said more evidence would be required before doctors could recommend rolling out weight loss drugs to heart patients specifically to cut their risk of adverse health outcomes, but the study results were “good news”. Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, a consultant cardiologist and clinical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: “These data add to the growing body of evidence supporting a role for weight loss drugs for patients living with both heart failure and obesity, to reduce hospital admissions and death.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin, China, on Sunday. The 10-member group includes Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.Sergei Bobylev/The Associated Press Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of eight other nations are set to meet in northern China for the latest summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in a possible challenge to often incoherent approaches by the United States to trade and regional conflicts. Some call it the scariest grouping you have never heard of. The full membership includes Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Others including India, China and Russia have a more nebulous relationship, either because of Washington's wobbly stance on Russia's war with Ukraine or because of chaos surrounding U.S. tariffs that have upended key trading relationships with countries such as China and India. Canada needs new playbook for relations with China amid Trump chaos: report While Russia's economic influence has declined steadily, especially under increasingly severe Western sanctions, both Russia and China have used the alliance as a framework for regional military cooperation, albeit limited to joint drills and firing competitions. Belarus, Iran, Pakistan and India joined later in an apparent attempt to share in the SCO's budding influence, though the value of their membership is debatable. Since the Russia-Ukraine war began, India has become a major buyer of Russian oil, increasing tensions with Washington. Modi also remarked on “steady progress” in improving relations with China after meeting its top diplomat in August and noted “respect for each other's interests and sensitiveness.'' India's SCO entry potentially challenges Russian and Chinese domination over the association. Despite their trade ties, India is unlikely to offer meaningful support for Russia's war in Ukraine or China's claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea. India has also long sought a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council but has received only tepid back from China and Russia, possibly to prevent their influence with the West from being diluted. Opinion: Trump is putting the screws to India over Russian oil imports, creating an opportunity for Canadian energy Beijing has given few hints of what solid progress it expects from the summit, which is in keeping with the secretive nature of its diplomacy and politics. The leaders of about a dozen other countries are joining the summit as SCO dialogue partners or guests, including Egypt, Nepal and several Southeast Asian nations. Xinhua spoke of the organization being guided by the “Shanghai Spirit, which features mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, consultation, respect for diverse civilizations and pursuit of common development.” For Xi, “presiding over the gathering in Tianjin should net him some favorable publicity and possibly further his image as leader of a new global world order,” Dreyer said.

As a reminder (see post at 09.05), the Russian leader will take part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin today and tomorrow. 🇷🇺🇨🇳 Presidents Vladimir Putin & Xi Jinping 🤝Russia's President Vladimir Putin takes part in a welcoming ceremony held for the participants in the 2025 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in Tianjin, China.The official events of the Summit to take place on September 1. pic.twitter.com/PjYWUK26b1 Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in the Chinese city of Tianjin for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) security summit, which is aimed at countering western influence in global affairs. Xi is expected to hold talks with Putin later on in the week. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country's forces are planning new strikes deep into Russia after he met with his top general, Oleksandr Syrsky. Zelenskyy said Moscow's forces are suffering heavy losses around Pokrovsk, the strategically important logistics hub in eastern Ukraine that Russia wants to seize control of. Senior White House officials have accused some European leaders of prolonging Russia's war in Ukraine by convincing Zelenskyy to hold out for a better deal with Moscow, Axios reported. Ukraine's armed forces said on Sunday that Russian forces failed to gain full control of any major Ukrainian city over the summer as it hit back at Moscow's claims of a successful summer offensive. A Ukrainian former parliamentary speaker was shot dead in Lviv on Saturday, authorities said, as European foreign ministers met to discuss increasing pressure on Moscow to end its war against Ukraine. Andriy Parubiy, a member of parliament who served as parliamentary speaker from 2016 to 2019 and a key figure in Ukraine's 2013 pro-European Maidan revolution, was shot dead, prosecutors said. Speaking at a press conference after the meeting, the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said that Russia was “clearly not preparing for peace”. But it's clear that Russia is not preparing for peace. It is the opposite: they are preparing for more war,” she said. Russian President Vladimir Putin has met with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in Tianjin, China. As a reminder (see post at 09.05), the Russian leader will take part in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin today and tomorrow. 🇷🇺🇨🇳 Presidents Vladimir Putin & Xi Jinping 🤝Russia's President Vladimir Putin takes part in a welcoming ceremony held for the participants in the 2025 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit in Tianjin, China.The official events of the Summit to take place on September 1. pic.twitter.com/PjYWUK26b1 Following a meeting with Ukraine's top general, Oleksandr Syrsky, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that his country's forces are planning new strikes deep into Russia. We will continue our active operations in exactly the way needed for Ukraine's defence. “The majority of these losses were sustained precisely in the Donetsk region, while failing to achieve any of their strategic objectives,” he wrote. Zelenskyy recently warned that Russia was massing a force of 100,000 troops near the mining town which Moscow has been trying to capture for more than two years. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media reporters that the “European party of war” was continuing to hinder US and Russian efforts on Ukraine. “We are ready to resolve the problem by political and diplomatic means,” Peskov said. “But so far we do not see reciprocity from Kyiv in this. European powers say that they do not believe Putin wants peace in Ukraine. Putin has repeatedly said he is ready to discuss peace but that Russia will not give up any of the land that it has taken in Ukraine. The Ukrainian military said that it had struck Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran overnight. Russian authorities in Krasnodar said falling drone debris damaged one of the refinery's units. Russia has downed 112 Ukrainian drones in the past 24 hours and hit port infrastructure in Ukraine used for military purposes, Interfax news agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying on Sunday. At an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Friday, the US warned Russia to move toward some sort of peace settlement and meet with Ukraine or face possible sanctions. The meeting was called after a major Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine overnight from Wednesday to Thursday that killed more than 20 people. He said Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy must agree to meet, and reiterated Donald Trump's warning that the US could impose sanctions on Russia if the war continues. Despite months of diplomatic efforts, Putin has repeatedly ignored Trump's calls to end the fighting. The “America First” Trump administration has not taken any tangible steps to pressure Russia into stopping its attacks, but has paused intelligence sharing and military aid to Kyiv at various points. Senior White House officials have accused some European leaders of prolonging Russia's war in Ukraine by convincing Volodymyr Zelenskyy to hold out for a better deal with Moscow, Axios is reporting. “The Europeans don't get to prolong this war and backdoor unreasonable expectations, while also expecting America to bear the cost,” a senior White House official told Axios. But they will be hopelessly snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.” Donald Trump has indicated he wants a bilateral meeting between Vladimir Putin and Zelenskyy, but while the Ukrainian leader has shown his readiness, the Kremlin has held back and intensified attacks on Ukraine despite international diplomatic efforts to bring the war to an end. The deadly assaults have renewed calls to use Russia's frozen assets in Europe as leverage over Putin. A Russian drone attack overnight damaged four power facilities near the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa, leaving more than 29,000 customers without electricity this morning, the region's governor and power firm DTEK said. One person was reported to have been injured in the attack. Four DTEK energy facilities were attacked during the night attack. Russian drones also targeted Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region this morning, damaging energy infrastructure and leaving 30,000 households without electricity, the local governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said. The Guardian's Russian affairs reporter, Pjotr Sauer, has written a piece about Putin's trip and what it may mean for the war in Ukraine. China has emerged as an economic lifeline for Russia during the war in Ukraine, and Kyiv has been increasingly outspoken about what it says is China's direct aiding of Moscow's war effort. The talks are also likely to touch on deepening military cooperation between Beijing and Moscow, a development that has alarmed western governments. The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus – with 16 more countries affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”. Putin, who is wanted for war crimes by the international criminal court, arrived in Tianjin on Sunday to a red carpet welcome and warm greetings from top-ranking city officials. During his trip, which is expected to stretch to close to a week, the Russian president will hold talks with Chinese president Xi Jinping, his close ally, and watch Beijing's Victory Day military parade marking 80 years since Japan's defeat in the second world war, where Putin is due to be the star guest alongside North Korea's Kim Jong-un and leaders of Iran and Cuba. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defence pact last year, and North Korea confirmed this April that it had deployed soldiers to the frontline in Ukraine to fight alongside Russian troops. Putin has turned to Beijing for trade and political support since his full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched in February 2022. China and Russia declared a “no limits” partnership when Putin visited Beijing just days before he sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia's war on Ukraine. We have not yet been able to independently verify any of these claims. Ukraine acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that Russia's army had entered the Dnipropetrovsk region, a central administrative area previously spared from intense fighting. Russian forces have slowly gained ground in costly battles for largely devastated areas in eastern and southern Ukraine, normally with few inhabitants or intact buildings left. Russia launched a sweeping attack across Ukraine overnight on Saturday, with one person killed and 24 injured, including three children, when a five-storey residential building was hit in Zaporizhzhia, according to officials. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is calling for “tougher” western sanctions on Russia as he says Vladimir Putin's attacks shows he is not at all interested in trying to pursue peace.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin on Aug. 31 to attend a major regional security summit, Chinese and Russian state media reported. The four-day visit, a rare trip abroad for Putin, underscores Beijing and Moscow's efforts to counter Western influence in global affairs. Footage from Russia's TASS news agency showed Putin stepping onto a red carpet and being welcomed on the tarmac by senior city officials. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV described China-Russia relations as at their "best in history," calling them "the most stable, mature and strategically significant among major countries." China has become a crucial economic lifeline for Russia during its war against Ukraine, while Kyiv has grown more vocal in accusing Beijing of directly supporting Moscow's war effort. Chinese President Xi Jinping will host about 20 world leaders at the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The SCO, founded in 2001 by six Eurasian nations, has since expanded to 10 permanent members along with 16 observer and dialogue partners. Ahead of the trip, Putin told China's Xinhua news agency that Moscow and Beijing oppose "discriminatory" sanctions in global trade. Russia's economy remains under heavy strain from Western restrictions and the costs of its war in Ukraine, with economists warning of a looming recession. Beijing has billed the event as a show of solidarity among the "Global South," seeking to highlight cooperation between developing and lower-income nations. Olena Goncharova is the Head of North America desk at The Kyiv Independent, where she has previously worked as a development manager and Canadian correspondent. She first joined the Kyiv Post, Ukraine's oldest English-language newspaper, as a staff writer in January 2012 and became the newspaper's Canadian correspondent in June 2018. As an EU member, Hungary has veto power over further progress. It is reported that part of a Russian Shahed drone shot down previously detonated under the ship. "The only 100% verified result achieved by Russia since the beginning of 2025 is its own losses — over 291,000 soldiers killed and wounded," Ukraine's General Staff said on Aug. 31. U.S.-Ukraine peace talks, Russia's massive missile strike on Kyiv that killed 25 civilians, and Moscow's first reported occupation of villages in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Also, Ukraine's escalating drone attacks on Russian oil refineries. VOA was established during World War 2 in an effort to counter Nazi propaganda. Chinese state broadcaster CCTV described China-Russia relations as at their "best in history," calling them "the most stable, mature and strategically significant among major countries." Kyrylo Budanov said that upcoming joint exercises, set to begin in two weeks, will pose challenges for both Ukraine and European countries, particularly through what he described as "cognitive influence."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization's (SCO) summit will kick off in China's northern city of Tianjin on Sunday. Apart from the leaders of SCO member states and some other nations, the summit will also involve the heads of ten international organizations, including United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Secretary General Sergey Lebedev, and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Secretary General Kao Kim Hourn. Russian Ambassador to China Igor Morgulov pointed out that the SCO did not press anyone to choose sides, nor did it seek to impose its opinions on others; and its activities weren't directed against third countries. According to the Russian envoy, the organization's attractiveness is based on its pursuit of the principles of equality, consensus, mutual trust, balanced interests, mutual benefit, and respect for cultural diversity, as well as on member states' determination to avoid hostile actions against each other. Morgulov highlighted Moscow's readiness to work together with Beijing to strengthen the organization's authority across the world. According to the event's program, Chinese President Xi Jinping will chair a meeting of the SCO Council of Heads of State and an SCO Plus meeting, where he will deliver addresses. In addition, he will speak about new measures aimed at supporting high-quality development and deepening comprehensive cooperation within the SCO, and will also propose additional methods to ensure meaningful cooperation in order to maintain the international order established after World War II and improve the system of global governance. A number of bilateral events are going to take place on the sidelines of the summit. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that the summit's participants would adopt a number of documents on strengthening defense, economic, cultural and humanitarian cooperation. They will also consider initiatives aimed at supporting a multilateral trading system, countering extremist ideas, and boosting cooperation in transport, the energy sector, digitalization efforts, green development, artificial intelligence and scientific innovations. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Bin emphasized that the SCO's mechanism of cooperation had improved in the years since its foundation, and cooperation between its members had proved highly productive in a number of fields. Liu noted that the SCO had turned into an important power in terms of building a new type of international relations based on the principles of equality and justice. The organization's popularity is rising among an increasing number of countries who may become its new members or partners to "make a positive contribution to the multipolar world order." Chinese Vice Minister of Commerce Ling Ji stated that the SCO was demonstrating "a high level of sustainability and viability in terms of regional and economic cooperation," pursuing the principles of equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, openness and tolerance. He noted that in 2024, trade between China and SCO members had grown by 2.7%, reaching an all-time high of $512.4 billion. The official stressed that China also sought to deepen cooperation with the SCO nations through bilateral agreements. The six founding members were Russia, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</p>
