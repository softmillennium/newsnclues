                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beta blockers—drugs commonly prescribed for a range of cardiac conditions, including heart attacks—provide no clinical benefit for patients who have had an uncomplicated myocardial infarction with preserved heart function. This is a breakthrough discovery from the “REBOOT Trial” with senior investigator Valentin Fuster, MD, PhD, President of Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital and General Director of Spain's Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC). The study results, which could overturn a standard treatment paradigm, were presented on Saturday, August 30, during a “Hot Line” session at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Madrid, and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.Additionally, a REBOOT substudy, published on August 30 in the European Heart Journal, shows that women treated with beta blockers had a higher risk of death, heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure compared to women not receiving the drug. It joins other previous landmark trials led by CNIC and Mount Sinai—such as SECURE with the polypill and DapaTAVI, with SLT2 inhibition associated to TAVI—that have already transformed some global approaches to cardiovascular disease,” says Dr. Fuster. “REBOOT will change clinical practice worldwide,” says Principal Investigator Borja Ibáñez, MD, CNIC's Scientific Director, who presented the results. “Currently, more than 80 percent of patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction are discharged on beta blockers. Although generally considered safe, beta blockers can cause side effects such as fatigue, bradycardia (low heart rate), and sexual dysfunction. For more than 40 years, beta blockers have been prescribed as a standard treatment after a heart attack, but their benefit in the context of modern treatments was unproven. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in rates of death, recurrent heart attack, or hospitalization for heart failure. A REBOOT subgroup analysis found that women treated with beta blockers experienced more adverse events. The elevated risk when treated with beta-blockers was restricted to women with a complete normal cardiac function after a heart attack (left ventricular ejection fraction of 50 percent or higher). “After a heart attack, patients are typically prescribed multiple medications, which can make adherence difficult,” explains Dr. Ibáñez. “Beta blockers were added to standard treatment early on because they significantly reduced mortality at the time. Their benefits were linked to reduced cardiac oxygen demand and arrhythmia prevention. Today, occluded coronary arteries are reopened rapidly and systematically, drastically lowering the risk of serious complications such as arrhythmias. While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments.” “The trial was designed to optimize heart attack care based on solid scientific evidence and without commercial interests. “A Bad Day at Sea”: Researchers Reveal How Rogue Waves Really Form Scientists Develop 4-in-1 Drug for Weight Loss With Fewer Side Effects Covid Could Be Quietly Aging Your Arteries by Five Years Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Our understanding of the universe may be completely wrong. In 1687, English physicist Isaac Newton published his famous Law of Universal Gravitation. Thankfully, Albert Einstein came around in the early 20th century to help patch things up a bit with his Theory of General Relativity. But space is a big place, and even Einsteins sometimes meet their limit. One of the most well-known of these limits is a black hole's center, or singularity, where Einstein's famous theory appears to break down completely. Now, a study from scientists at South Korea's Sejong University suggests that another limit to Newton and Einstein's conception of gravity can be found in the orbital motions of long-period, widely separated, binary stars—also known simply as “wide binaries.” The results of this study were published this month in The Astrophysical Journal. After analyzing 26,500 wide binaries within 650 lightyears captured by the European Space Agency's Gaia space observatory, co-author Kyu-Hyun Chae discovered something strange—when these celestial objects achieved extremely low orbital accelerations around 0.1 nanometers per second squared, the observed accelerations were nearly 30 to 40 percent higher than Newton-Einstein models would predict. However, if these accelerations were above 10 nanometers per second squared, they followed the Newton-Einstein theory as predicted. Something weird is happening specifically at these ultra-low accelerations. Because scientists don't know anything about this hypothetical form of matter and energy that supposedly makes up a majority of the universe, it's possible that dark matter is influencing this strange gravitational interaction. However, Chae argues that Modified Newtonian Dynamics, or MOND—first proposed by Israeli scientist Mordehai Milgrom in 1983—could explain (among other galactic anomalies) these low acceleration deviations. The most surprising element is that a MOND-influenced theory of gravity—also co-authored by Milgrom—explains this unexpected 1.4 times acceleration boost. Chae's study appears to be a big +1 in the pro column for Modified Newtonian Dynamics, but the theory is still just that—a theory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI Spots Hidden Signs of Consciousness in Comatose Patients before Doctors Do A machine-learning algorithm spotted signs of “covert consciousness” in coma patients—in some cases, days before doctors could do so This experience of “covert consciousness” is a reality for many people who have sustained traumatic brain injuries. In a new study published in Communications Medicine, researchers found that they could detect signs of consciousness in comatose patients by using artificial intelligence to analyze facial movements that were too small to be noticed by clinicians. Covert consciousness was first detected in 2006, when researchers asked an unresponsive woman and healthy volunteers to imagine doing specific tasks while in a brain scanner. Just last year researchers using similar brain imaging methods found that one in four behaviorally unresponsive patients was covertly conscious. Such tests aren't routinely performed on people in an unresponsive state because this type of neuroimaging is time-consuming and its operation requires specialized skills. Instead, doctors typically rely on more subjective visual examinations to gauge a person's level of consciousness, testing whether they open their eyes, respond to commands or startle at a loud noise. “We were trying to find a way to quantify how conscious these patients are” using simple and readily available technology, says Sima Mofakham, a computational neuroscientist at Stony Brook University and senior author of the new study. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. Mofakham and her team recorded videos of 37 patients with recent brain injuries who outwardly appeared to be in a coma. The results suggest that, in some cases, people are conscious days before doctors notice. Patients with larger and more frequent facial movements also had better clinical outcomes, indicating that the technology may help predict prognoses. This ability to detect consciousness earlier is clinically meaningful, says Jan Claassen, a neurologist at Columbia University, who wasn't involved in the new research. “Every day is potentially important” for those difficult decisions, Claassen says. Separate research shows that starting rehab earlier is associated with greater improvements in physical function. Consciousness recovery after a brain injury is often gradual and unpredictable. “When somebody recovers consciousness, it's almost like a flickering light bulb,” Claassen says. But it's possible that some patients whose conditions have remained more static and who are currently presumed unconscious in long-term care facilities might also show signs of awareness that could be detected, whether with more advanced neuroimaging techniques or the simpler SeeMe technology. “We have to do the experiments and see,” Mofakham says. Next, Mofakham plans to examine whether patients can answer yes-or-no questions using specific facial movements. “This study opens a way to communicate with these patients.” Andrew Chapman is a Truckee, Calif.–based freelance science writer who covers life sciences and the environment.

For example, typical dinosaur fossils are bones turned to stone and preserved from the passage of time located, if we're particularly lucky, in large collections that can be reassembled to represent the beast they used to prop up in their entirety. Some are just impressions of small creatures or animals left in rocks, but most have something in common—it's just the hard stuff left behind. With the exception of those found in environments particularly adept at preservation, the soft tissues degrade over time and all we're left with is stony bone. “It's always interesting to see what's inside a sample using 3D imaging,” Katherine Dobson, one of the co-authors of a study centered on this remarkable find, said in a press release, “but in this incredible tiny larva, natural fossilization has achieved almost perfect preservation.” That “almost perfect preservation” made the specimen an absolute gold mine for evolutionary biologists. That detail also allowed scientists to draw evolutionary connections between the critters of the ancient past and those scuttling around today. Now that scientists have seen it, they can see that it evolved into the “nub” of arthropod heads that has allowed them to thrive in such a wide variety of environments—from the depths of the ocean to every single continent on Earth (yes, including Antarctica). “When I used to daydream about the one fossil I'd most like to discover,” Martin Smith, the lead researcher on the study, said in a press release, “I'd always be thinking of an arthropod larva, because developmental data are just so central to understanding their evolution. I already knew that this simple worm-like fossil was something special, but when I saw the amazing structures preserved under its skin, my jaw just dropped—how could these intricate features have avoided decay and still be here to see half a billion years later?” Right now, the scientists are happily counting themselves lucky that the creature was preserved at all, giving us a unique window into what life looked like in our distant past.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Unlike most nearby planet-forming disks, where water vapor dominates the inner regions, this disk is surprisingly rich in carbon dioxide," says Jenny Frediani, PhD student at the Department of Astronomy, Stockholm University. However, in this case, the JWST/MIRI spectrum shows a puzzlingly strong carbon dioxide signature instead. "This challenges current models of disk chemistry and evolution since the high carbon dioxide levels relative to water cannot be easily explained by standard disk evolution processes," Jenny Frediani explains. Arjan Bik, researcher at the Department of Astronomy, Stockholm University, adds, "Such a high abundance of carbon dioxide in the planet-forming zone is unexpected. These isotopologues could offer vital clues to long-standing questions about the unusual isotopic fingerprints found in meteorites and comets -- relics of our own Solar System's formation. This CO2-rich disk was found in the massive star-forming region NGC 6357, located approximately 1.7 kiloparsecs (about 53 quadrillion kilometers) away. Maria-Claudia Ramirez-Tannus from the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg and lead of the XUE collaboration says that it is an exciting discovery: "It reveals how extreme radiation environments -- common in massive star-forming regions -- can alter the building blocks of planets. Since most stars and likely most planets form in such regions, understanding these effects is essential for grasping the diversity of planetary atmospheres and their habitability potential." Thanks to JWST's MIRI instrument, astronomers can now observe distant, dust-enshrouded disks with unprecedented detail at infrared wavelengths -- providing critical insights into the physical and chemical conditions that govern planet formation. By comparing these intense environments with quieter, more isolated regions, researchers are uncovering the environmental diversity that shapes emerging planetary systems. Astronomers at Stockholm University and Chalmers have helped develop the MIRI instrument which is a camera and a spectrograph that observes mid- to long-wavelength infrared radiation from 5 microns to 28 microns. “A Bad Day at Sea”: Researchers Reveal How Rogue Waves Really Form Scientists Develop 4-in-1 Drug for Weight Loss With Fewer Side Effects Covid Could Be Quietly Aging Your Arteries by Five Years Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Great Salt Lake's levels continue to sag, yet another strange phenomenon has surfaced, offering Utah scientists more opportunities to plumb the vast saline lake's secrets. After several years of scratching their heads, University of Utah geoscientists, deploying a network of piezometers and aerial electromagnetic surveys, are now finding out what's going on under the lakebed that is creating these reed-choked oases. Bill Johnson, a professor in the Department of Geology & Geophysics, suspects the circular mounds have formed at spots where a subsurface plumbing system delivers fresh groundwater under pressure into the lake and its surrounding wetlands. But where that happened, we don't know," said Johnson during a recent visit to one of the mounds, a research site known as Round Spot 9. Or was it transmitted directly to the lake?" On this day, Johnson and graduate student Ebenezer Adomako-Mensah were checking piezometers they had installed there last year to record underground water pressures at various depths and locations around the island. "It'll give you a spectrum, basically, of magnetic fields, and we'll use that data to create a 3D image of what's under the Earth," said Jeff Sanderson, a crew leader with Expert Geophysics. As low lake levels persist, the lakebed will increasingly serve as a source of wind-blown dust affecting Utah's population centers. Ongoing research by U atmospheric scientists suggests that the disturbed lakebed crusts that keep sediments in place can be regenerated when they are submerged. One goal of Johnson's research is to determine whether the groundwater can be tapped to restore broken lakebed crusts, thereby reducing dust pollution. Armed with new data, Johnson secured preliminary funding from the Utah Department of Natural Resources to investigate to characterize this underground water resource. For Johnson, the groundwater mystery began several years ago when he was traveling Great Salt Lake's North Arm by airboat and observed something strange. "I always wondered what the heck that was, because it seemed like groundwater was coming to the system at a huge rate," he said. Previously, it was believed that direct groundwater discharge accounts for just 3% of the lake's water budget, but recently gathered data using chemical mass balance methods indicate it may be as much as 12% and new insights are emerging. For starters, Johnson's team has found that fresh water at depth in several spots far offshore. Johnson's team has located freshwater almost everywhere they looked in tight sediments 30 feet below the surface. The new geophysical data indicate these sediments are up to 10,000 feet deep. "We don't know if it's freshwater that deep, but it is certainly going to be fresh a long way down, and it could be fresh all the way down," Johnson said. "The last thing I want to do is get this hyped as a water resource, but it's very clear, and it's under pressure. And in my mind, it could help mitigate any dust generation on the exposed playa." On Round Spot 9 in Farmington Bay, Johnson's team has installed three sets of four piezometers at various distances from the edge of the 250-foot-diameter island. Accompanied by grad students like Adomako-Mensah, Johnson has regularly visited the site this year by mountain bike or airboat to recover data that is already telling an interesting story. It really wants to come up," Johnson said. "And that's true also in the perimeter, but it's freshwater at depth there. Johnson believes there are hundreds of these groundwater-fed oases scattered across Great Salt Lake's exposed playa, suggesting the presence of a vast underground reservoir connected to the surface by a plumbing system that is only now getting close study, thanks in part to the lake's decline. With his colleagues' help, the geologist hopes to discover where the water came from, when it fell as snow and most critically, how much is there. "The last thing we wanted to do is for this to be characterized as a water resource we should be tapping," he said. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

About 118,600 people, on average, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) alone were displaced between 2004 and 2023, according to researchers reporting their findings in Nature.

When there are heavy rains, water accumulates on roads and rooftops. When the drainage systems are inadequate, the water finds its way into unprotected ground, carving deep holes that can stretch for hundreds of metres. Vanmaercke and his colleagues used satellite images taken between 2021 and 2023 to identify 2,922 urban gullies in 26 of 47 cities, covering a cumulative distance of nearly 740 kilometres. In 99% of cases, the gullies had expanded by at least 10 square metres between 2004 and 2023. The average gully was 253 metres long and 31 metres across at its widest point, and nearly all of them were linked to the road network. “The water cannot infiltrate, and it concentrates along these roads which basically become big canals that turn into rivers,” says Vanmaercke. This enabled them to estimate that an average of 118,600 people were displaced because of gullies over the period — with displacement rates more than doubling after 2020. Two days later, several of her children were killed while sheltering at a relative's house, when an expanding gully collapsed overnight. As African cities expand, the threat of expanding gullies is likely to increase. The continent's population is expected to nearly triple by 2050, and rainfall intensities in tropical Africa could increase by up to 15% in the coming decades. People tried to prevent the gully from expanding using sand, cement and sticks. The authors note in their study that preventing gullies from forming is more effective and affordable than is stabilizing them after they form, which can cost upwards of US$1 million per gully. “The trick would be to have interventions that are well thought of and installed in time. But there's such a huge lack of money and resources that usually when something is done, it's either inadequate or too late,” says Vanmaercke. Ana Mijic, a hydrologist at Imperial College London, says that governments and private-sector organizations need to step up their investments in interventions such as sufficient drainage systems. But high costs and maintenance of long-term solutions act as barriers. Gina Ziervogel, a geographer at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, says that governments should prioritize sustainable infrastructure. “We need to understand the role of the environment and resources in cities — soil and water particularly — and so engaging experts from those fields is really important.” She adds that involving the affected communities in planning interventions “would go a long way to understanding their insights, both on the experience of living with this and on potential solutions.” This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on August, 27 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"These mysterious objects are candidate galaxies in the early universe, meaning they could be very early galaxies," said Haojing Yan, an astronomy professor in Mizzou's College of Arts and Science and co-author on the study. "If even a few of these objects turn out to be what we think they are, our discovery could challenge current ideas about how galaxies formed in the early universe -- the period when the first stars and galaxies began to take shape." "As the light from these early galaxies travels through space, it stretches into longer wavelengths -- shifting from visible light into infrared," Yan said. "This stretching is called redshift, and it helps us figure out how far away these galaxies are. "It detects high-redshift galaxies by looking for objects that appear in redder wavelengths but vanish in bluer ones -- a sign that their light has traveled across vast distances and time," said Bangzheng "Tom" Sun, a Ph.D. student working with Yan and the lead author of the study. As redshift increases, this signature shifts to redder wavelengths." "Ideally this would be done using spectroscopy, a technique that spreads light across different wavelengths to identify signatures that would allow an accurate redshift determination," he said. But when full spectroscopic data is unavailable, researchers can use a technique called spectral energy distribution fitting. This method gave Sun and Yan a baseline to estimate the redshifts of their galaxy candidates -- along with other properties such as age and mass. In the past, scientists often thought these extremely bright objects weren't early galaxies, but something else that mimicked them. However, based on their findings, Sun and Yan believe these objects deserve a closer look -- and shouldn't be so quickly ruled out. "Even if only a few of these objects are confirmed to be in the early universe, they will force us to modify the existing theories of galaxy formation," Yan said. Scientists use this technique to reveal a galaxy's unique fingerprint, which can tell them how old the galaxy is, how it formed and what it's made of. "One of our objects is already confirmed by spectroscopy to be an early galaxy," Sun said. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These include a long-studied self-destruction process that cleans up dead and damaged cells as well as a more recently identified phenomenon that helps older cells revert to what appears to be a younger state to help grow back healthy tissue. Now, a new study in mice led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Baylor College of Medicine reveals a previously unknown cellular purging process that may help injured cells revert to a stem cell-like state more rapidly. The investigators dubbed this newly discovered response cathartocytosis, taking from Greek root words that mean cellular cleansing. Published online in the journal Cell Reports, the study used a mouse model of stomach injury to provide new insights into how cells heal, or fail to heal, in response to damage, such as from an infection or inflammatory disease. Brown likened the process to a "vomiting" or jettisoning of waste that essentially adds a shortcut, helping the cell declutter and focus on regrowing healthy tissues faster than it would be able to if it could only perform a gradual, controlled degradation of waste. As with many shortcuts, this one has potential downsides: According to the investigators, cathartocytosis is fast but messy, which may help shed light on how injury responses can go wrong, especially in the setting of chronic injury. For example, ongoing cathartocytosis in response to an infection is a sign of chronic inflammation and recurring cell damage that is a breeding ground for cancer. In fact, the festering mess of ejected cellular waste that results from all that cathartocytosis may also be a way to identify or track cancer, according to the researchers. The researchers identified cathartocytosis within an important regenerative injury response called paligenosis, which was first described in 2018 by the current study's senior author, Jason C. Mills, MD, PhD. Now at the Baylor College of Medicine, Mills began this work while he was a faculty member in the Division of Gastroenterology at WashU Medicine and Brown was a postdoctoral researcher in his lab. In paligenosis, injured cells shift away from their normal roles and undergo a reprogramming process to an immature state, behaving like rapidly dividing stem cells, as happens during development. Originally, the researchers assumed the decluttering of cellular machinery in preparation for this reprogramming happens entirely inside cellular compartments called lysosomes, where waste is digested in a slow and contained process. They initially dismissed this as unimportant, but the more external waste they saw in their early studies, the more Brown began to suspect that something deliberate was going on. In other words, the vomiting process was not just an accidental spill here and there but a newly identified, standard way cells behaved in response to injury. While the newly discovered cathartocytosis process may help injured cells proceed through paligenosis and regenerate healthy tissue more rapidly, the tradeoff comes in the form of additional waste products that could fuel inflammatory states, making chronic injuries harder to resolve and correlating with increased risk of cancer development. "In these gastric cells, paligenosis -- reversion to a stem cell state for healing -- is a risky process, especially now that we've identified the potentially inflammatory downsizing of cathartocytosis within it," Mills said. The findings also could point to new treatment strategies for stomach cancer and perhaps other GI cancers. Brown and WashU Medicine collaborator Koushik K. Das, MD, an associate professor of medicine, have developed an antibody that binds to parts of the cellular waste ejected during cathartocytosis, providing a way to detect when this process may be happening, especially in large quantities. In this way, cathartocytosis might be used as a marker of precancerous states that could allow for early detection and treatment. "If we have a better understanding of this process, we could develop ways to help encourage the healing response and perhaps, in the context of chronic injury, block the damaged cells undergoing chronic cathartocytosis from contributing to cancer formation," Brown said. “A Bad Day at Sea”: Researchers Reveal How Rogue Waves Really Form Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.
