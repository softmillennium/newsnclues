                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro said Sunday that "it will be the end of the United States" if the president's sweeping tariffs are ultimately blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court. Navarro's comments echoed Trump's own rhetoric as the president sharply criticized last week's 7-4 appeals court decision, which ruled that most of Trump's tariffs are illegal, placing a central tenet of the administration's economic agenda on shaky ground. "This was weaponized partisan injustice at its worst," Navarro said on Fox's "Sunday Morning Futures." "If we lose the case, President Trump is right. Navarro also said that he feels "very optimistic" about the administration's arguments to the Supreme Court. We feel very optimistic," Navarro said. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held Friday that Trump overstepped his presidential authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs against virtually every country in the world. "If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country," Trump wrote on his Truth Social after the ruling. He added that "with the help of the United States Supreme Court, we will use [tariffs] to the benefit of our Nation, and Make America Rich, Strong, and Powerful Again!" Without court action, Trump's tariffs were set to affect roughly 69% of U.S. goods imports, according to the Tax Foundation, but if blocked, the duties would impact just roughly 16%. Parts of Trump's agenda remain safe from Friday's court decision. Most notably, his sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum remain unaffected by the appeals court's ruling.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>So "when he died, all of the lifelong dreams I had with him died, too," says the now 46-year-old psychotherapist and author. Morin didn't think she'd get married again. But a few years later, she started dating her now husband, Steve Hasty. The two had met online in high school and reconnected when she needed a date to a wedding. They ended up getting married when she was 30. Plus, Hasty dared Morin to dream big and reinvent herself. Throughout her 20s, Morin had a pretty typical life. She started freelance writing about marriage, travel and technology to ensure she made enough to cover her mortgage alone. And that's what she thought her life would look like going forward. So she started asking herself, "What might that look like?" Was it something she wanted to do? Could she dive into writing full-time if they made the move? In 2012, an article Morin wrote went viral, which led to a bestselling book, "13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do." With more writing opportunities coming her way and Hasty's support, she decided to take the plunge into full-time writing and speaking, and the two moved onto their sailboat. But it also introduced her to a life she never imagined for herself and "just opened up new possibilities," she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo Nvidia's latest earnings again highlighted its extraordinary success and undeniable market power: $46.7 billion in revenue, up 56 percent from a year earlier, and net income of $26.4 billion. But one omission stood out — no revenue from its China-specific H20 chip. America's most valuable semiconductor firm is struggling to maintain footing in China just as one of China's own champions, Cambricon Technologies, is surging. Despite heavy losses tied to U.S. export restrictions, the company has thrived and is now racing to meet extraordinary demand for its new Blackwell Ultra platform for U.S. and allied data centers. There is no doubt that it can lead the global AI era without taking on the baggage that comes from its infatuation with China. Rather than staying focused on its future outside of China, these moves reinforce the perception that Nvidia, despite repeated warnings and the clear trajectory of China's industrial policy drive toward techno-indigenization, simply cannot give up its China dream. Already, China's regulators are pressing companies like Alibaba, DeepSeek, and ByteDance to justify why they continue to seek out Nvidia products instead of using domestic chips from rapidly emerging Chinese champions. Buying foreign hardware openly is becoming a political liability. In the span of just two years, its shares have multiplied roughly tenfold, turning the company into a market darling and another visible symbol of Beijing's drive for technological self-reliance. Investors are not merely chasing profits — they are also betting on that political playbook winning out yet again. Cambricon's swing into profitability this year has only amplified the frenzy, with its next-generation Siyuan 690 processor — still under development — being touted by analysts as potentially closing in on Nvidia's H100 performance and likely outclassing the restricted H20 chips once meant to anchor Nvidia's position in China. The excitement around Cambricon has less to do with technical benchmarks than with a narrative about nationalistic pride and domestic momentum. Chinese developers such as DeepSeek are already signaling that their latest models will be optimized for "home-grown chips soon to be released." That creates an ecosystem where Cambricon is not just tolerated but embraced, its products now used to amplify the story of national progress. And because Cambricon has been on the U.S. Commerce Department's Entity List since 2022, every uptick in its stock price and every hint of technological parity is seen inside China as defiance of Washington — a breakout moment celebrated much the same way DeepSeek was earlier this year. Every time U.S. officials boast of keeping "the best stuff" out of China, the nationalist case for Cambricon and other local champions grows stronger. It only strengthens the playbook and highlights the contrast between a foreign supplier treated with suspicion and a local firm celebrated as the embodiment of resistance and resilience. That point was underscored on Nvidia's latest earnings call. Executives admitted that no H20 sales went to China in Q2, and that they are assuming none in Q3 because of "geopolitical issues." Neither Nvidia's CFO nor CEO spelled out those issues, but the signal is obvious: China's rejection is political, not necessarily technical. At the April Politburo study session, he made clear that indigenization of AI hardware and software is now a national priority. No matter how much Chinese developers may want the "best chips," the party and security apparatus will decide what they can buy — and the private sector will comply. If Nvidia needed any reminder of how politics can drive market decisions in Beijing, it should look at Washington's own role in accelerating that outcome. His ill-chosen words turned what might have been a quiet and gradual market adaptation into a nationalist cause supreme. Instead of buying H20s under the radar, Chinese firms now face political pressure to reject them altogether and buy local. This convergence of market momentum, political endorsement, and national pride is no accident. The plan pairs adoption benchmarks with massive investment in domestic chipmaking, high-bandwidth memory, and national computing clusters. Cambricon has become the visible proof-point that China thinks it needs to show it can build an ecosystem independent of U.S. technology, thereby mooting the impact of being blacklisted in Washington. For investors, it is fair to say that Nvidia will remain the gold standard in performance for the foreseeable future, but in China, perfection and performance benchmarks are not the only things that matter. What matters most to the political and security establishment, if not the private sector, is having "good enough" homegrown technology that frees Beijing from dependence on foreign suppliers and anchors its project of techno-indigenization. Even if Cambricon's Siyuan chips never rival Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra, they may be sufficient to carry China's AI development forward — and sufficient is all the party needs. That makes Nvidia's effort to appease both Beijing and Washington a situation in which the chip giant is serving two masters and satisfying neither.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norway said on Sunday it had chosen Britain as its strategic partner for the acquisition of new frigates in its biggest-ever military investment, in a deal worth some 10 billion pounds ($13.51 billion) to boost the Nordic country's maritime defense. Germany, France, Britain and the United States had offered rival frigate designs in competition. "The frigates are an essential part of our defense because they are key to defend our sovereignty," Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a press conference. Norway is NATO's monitor for the vast 2 million square kilometres (772,000 square miles) area of the North Atlantic used by the Russian northern fleet's nuclear submarines. A key mission for the frigates will be to monitor Russian submarines, whose base is on the Kola Peninsula, an area in the Arctic bordering Norway. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed the deal, which he said was worth 10 billion pounds. The deal will eventually see a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine warfare frigates – eight British and at least five Norwegian – operate jointly in northern Europe, he added. British officials, seeking economies of scale for their own navy and to boost Scotland's shipyard industry, had heavily promoted the BAE Systems' frigates, known as the T-26 City-class. Norway shares a border with Russia and is ramping up defense spending in light of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and U.S. President Donald Trump's demand that NATO allies must bolster their own military strength. Norway, a nation of 5.6 million people, currently operates four frigates. It previously said it could order five frigates, with an option for an additional one. "This will be the biggest purchase to date. And we are now entering final contract negotiations," Gahr Stoere said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. From tax hikes on pricey second homes in Rhode Island and Montana to Cape Cod's proposed transfer tax on homes over $2 million and the L.A. mansion tax, state and local governments see a revenue gold mine in the pricey properties of the wealthy. "It's a smack in the face to people who just spend money here," said Donna Krueger-Simmons, sales agent with Mott & Chace Sotheby's International in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. The tax hikes are being driven by tighter state budgets and populist anger over housing costs. States are looking to offset budget cuts expected from the new tax and spending bill in Washington. The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them. The measure imposes a new surcharge on second homes valued at more than $1 million. That charge is on top of existing property taxes and will add up to big increases for luxury homes in Newport, Watch Hill and other well-heeled, summer communities in the state. Swift's house, for instance, is assessed at around $28 million, according to local real estate records. Her current property taxes are estimated at around $201,000 a year. The new charges will add another $136,442 to her annual taxes, bringing her yearly total to $337,442 – even though locals say she rarely visits. Wealthy second-homeowners pay hefty property taxes but don't use many local services, since their primary residences are in New York; Boston; Palm Beach, Florida; or other locales. Their kids typically don't attend the local schools, and they're infrequent users of the police, fire, water and other municipal services since most stay for only 10 to 12 weeks out of the year. "These are people who just come here for the summer, spend their money and pay their fair share of taxes," said Krueger-Simmons. "You're just hurting the people who support small business," said Lori Joyal, of the Lila Delman Compass office in Watch Hill. Rhode Island is also hiking its conveyance tax on luxury real estate starting in October. The tax on real estate sales will be an additional $3.75 for each $500 paid above $800,000 for a real estate purchase. While the tax hike alone isn't expected to lead to any significant wealth flight, Joyal said potential buyers in Rhode Island are already looking at coastal towns in Connecticut as alternatives. The influx of Californians and other affluent newcomers who poured into the state during Covid has led to soaring home prices and growing resentment over gentrification. Meanwhile, the state's low income tax rate and lack of a sales tax has left it little room for revenue increases to handle the necessary increase in services. In May, the state passed a two-tier property tax plan, lowering rates for full-time residents and raising taxes on second homes and short-term rentals. For primary residences and long-term rentals valued at or below the state's median home price, the tax rate will be 0.76%. Homes worth more than that will face a tiered-rate system of up to 1.9% on any value over four times the median price. The Montana Department of Revenue expects the changes, which will start next year, will hike second-home taxes by an average of 68%. Brokers say some buyers are waiting to see the tax bills next year before making any decisions about whether to buy or sell. "I've heard about some buyers who have put on the brakes to wait for the dust to settle and see what happens," said Valerie Johnson, with PureWest Christie's International Real Estate in Bozeman, Montana. Johnson said that while the tax was touted by legislators as hitting wealthy second-home owners, it will also hit longtime locals who own investment homes and rent them out for income. "These are small businesses for many people," she said. Manish Bhatt, a senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, said tax hikes aimed at wealthy second-home owners may be popular politically, but they rarely make for successful or efficient tax policy. Real property tax reform should be broad based, rather than focused on taxpayers who are singled out just because they don't live in a community full-time, he said. "There is a grab to find revenue right now," he said. "But taxing second-home owners could have the opposite impact – dissuading people from owning a second home or continue to own in those communities." While the new taxes alone might not drive out the wealthy, "we do know that taxes are important to businesses and individuals and could cause people to make a decision to buy in another nearby state," Bhatt said. When Los Angeles passed its so-called "mansion tax" in 2022, proponents touted revenue projections of between $600 million to $1.1 billion a year. The tax, imposed on real estate sales over $5 million, has only raised $785 million after more than two years, according to the Los Angeles Housing Department. Higher interest rates that hurt the housing market have played a role, experts say. Yet Michael Manville, professor of urban planning at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, said wealthy buyers and sellers also reduced transactions in response to the tax. "The lower revenue is a reason to be concerned because it suggests that the tax might actually be reducing transactions, which in turn can reduce housing production and property tax revenue," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Altman needed someone to manage the finances. It was 2018, and OpenAI was still a nonprofit research outfit with 40 employees, no consumer product and no clear revenue model. Altman asked Brad Lightcap, who he'd worked with at startup accelerator Y Combinator, to help him with the search. So Lightcap decided to do it himself, stepping into a temporary role as the first business hire inside what was still unmistakably a lab. "We had no idea we were going to make a chatbot that a lot of people were going to talk to," Altman said at a dinner with reporters earlier this month in San Francisco that Lightcap also attended. His task is to turn OpenAI from a consumer phenomenon, known for creating ChatGPT and sparking the generative AI boom, into a force in the enterprise. As it enters new markets, Lightcap doesn't have to worry about building a brand. But selling into the enterprise requires bodies. In the past 18 months, Lightcap has built OpenAI's go-to-market team from around 50 people to more than 700, which includes sales reps and staffers focused on customer success, developer relations and strategic partnerships. Businesses could suddenly see that OpenAI's large language models were capable of reliably handling workflow tasks. "We saw significant demand coming out of that launch." Moderna began using ChatGPT Enterprise to accelerate drug discovery and summarize vast amounts of research data. Uber built a custom tool that let engineering teams tap OpenAI's models for customer support, driver experience and internal productivity. Morgan Stanley first embedded GPT-4 into workflows on its wealth management team and later extended the integration into investment banking and trading. "I see our responsibility as both building the tools and being, in some ways, the most knowledgeable people in the world on how to deploy them," Lightcap said. OpenAI's rollout doesn't rely on traditional sales reps. Instead, its go-to-market strategy leans heavily on engineers who work directly with enterprise partners to ensure the models solve real business problems. While playing a central role in global development for one of Silicon Valley's fastest-growing businesses, Lightcap also has to manage a sensitive relationship with OpenAI's closest partner and emerging rival, Microsoft. Microsoft is the lead investor in OpenAI, having poured roughly $13 billion into the company, and its primary cloud provider. OpenAI's models are tightly integrated into Microsoft products like Copilot, and the software giant has used its close ties with OpenAI to offer early access to tools before they're available on other clouds. For companies already running on Azure, Microsoft's pitch is the seamless integration that comes with adding OpenAI's models to the existing stack. It's not the only market where they're going head-to-head. In Microsoft's annual filing last year, the company formally listed OpenAI as a competitor in search and news advertising. The disclosure landed days after OpenAI unveiled a prototype called SearchGPT, underscoring how quickly the two companies' interests were overlapping. And this week, Microsoft said it's started publicly testing a homegrown AI model called MAI-1-preview that could lead to enhancements to its Copilot assistant for consumers. "The opportunity space is so gigantic that in some sense, it's impossible not to bump into everyone else," he said. Microsoft didn't respond to a request for comment. Other points of tension include OpenAI's work with different cloud providers and the governance system that will shape OpenAI's next stage of growth as it raises $40 billion and restructures into a commercial entity. As OpenAI expands into new regions, it's tailoring its approach to reflect local demand, preferences and use cases. Brazil, now OpenAI's fastest-growing market in Latin America, has more than 50 million monthly ChatGPT users sending about 140 million messages every day. India, with its surging developer base, has become the company's second-biggest user community worldwide. And Australia, home to some of the earliest users of OpenAI's application programming interface (API), is emerging as a hub for enterprise adoption across the Asia-Pacific region. The Sao Paulo office will double as a training center for educators, nonprofits, and small businesses, and as a community hub for Brazil's burgeoning developer base. "There's real energy around AI across Brazil," Lightcap said. OpenAI is hiring locally to tap into active developer ecosystems. And in Japan, where the company has already launched a joint venture with SoftBank to roll out enterprise tools nationwide, the Tokyo team is structured to focus on custom use cases like automation, robotics and AI-driven productivity. "And so it really becomes this two-way learning process." It's not a world Lightcap could have imagined seven years ago, when the fledgling lab he joined was operating out of a three-story wood-frame building in San Francisco's Mission District. At the dinner in San Francisco in August, Lightcap was seated across the table from his boss. He nodded as Altman described what life was like back then and the short workdays out of the limelight. "We really did have a nice life," Altman said. WATCH: Sam Altman says OpenAI pushed a 'much warmer' tone for GPT-5 Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Concerns about an artificial intelligence (AI) bubble and macroeconomic uncertainties are affecting the stock market. Investors can look beyond short-term fluctuations, however, and focus on buying stocks that can deliver attractive returns over the long term. With their thorough research and in-depth analysis, top Wall Street analysts can help identify stocks with solid fundamentals and lucrative growth potential. Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. Cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is this week's first stock pick. The company recently reported better-than-expected results for its fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. PANW also issued upbeat guidance for its fiscal first quarter and coming full year. Following the results, RBC Capital analyst Matthew Hedberg reiterated a buy rating on Palo Alto with a 12-month price forecast of $232. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on PANW stock with a price target of $197. The 5-star analyst highlighted that Palo Alto ended fiscal 2025 on a strong note, with results and outlook surpassing estimates across the board. Hedberg noted management's commentary about momentum being driven by strength in Palo Alto's XSIAM offering, AI demand driving software firewall needs and growth in Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) solutions. Hedberg also cheered the company's Fiscal 2028 target to generate more than 40% in free cash flow margins for the combined Palo Alto/CyberArk company. Overall, Hedberg finds the stock's risk/reward attractive at current prices, especially as he sees PANW as an AI beneficiary and believes that it is insulated from broader risk around AI disruption in other software categories. 94 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. This week's next pick, database software maker MongoDB (MDB), rallied after reporting better-than-expected results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026 and giving a solid forecast. Impressed by the results, Stifel analyst Brad Reback reaffirmed a buy rating on MongoDB and raised his  price target to $325 from $275, saying the company posted one of its strongest quarters ever. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has assigned a price target of $241 and an "outperform" rating on MDB stock. Reback highlighted that MongoDB's Q2 FY26 revenue exceeded the consensus by about 7%, with upside coming from outperformance in both its cloud database service Atlas and Enterprise Advanced (EA)/non-Atlas businesses. The analyst added that revenue upside and continued focus on operational efficiencies helped deliver Q2 FY26 operating profit margin of 14.7%, surpassing expectations by more than 4 percentage points. The top-ranked analyst was mainly impressed by the growth in MongoDB's Atlas offering, driven by a healthy increase in consumption across its installed base, impressive new customer additions of 2,800 and emerging AI workload gains. Overall, Reback believes that "Atlas is positioned to sustain 25%+ revenue growth," fueled by stabilizing consumption, enhanced sales execution and a growing set of core and emerging product drivers. 760 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Finally, we look at International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF), a company that provides flavors, scents and ingredients for industries including food, beverage and personal care. Feinseth discussed IFF's progress in its strategic initiatives, bolstered by a focus on innovation in high-margin products and efforts to optimize its product portfolio and balance sheet. Additionally, Feinseth believes that IFF is well-positioned to capitalize on secular, health-focused growth trends in food and nutrition, thanks to its "robust pipeline of functional ingredients, expertise in sensory science and biotechnology, and deep relationships with global brands." The analyst noted that through its strategic initiatives, IFF is creating significant shareholder value. Feinseth mentioned that IFF paid $102 million in dividends in Q2 2025 and announced a new $500 million share repurchase authorization. 205 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While inflation rates have cooled in recent years, U.S. Open attendees may still be experiencing the aftertaste as they sip on the tennis championship's iconic beverage. The so-called Honey Deuce carries an eye-popping price tag of $23. It's adorned with honeydew melon chunks that resemble tennis balls and is served in a souvenir glass. Despite the high cost, the U.S. Open sold more than 550,000 of the cocktail last year, bringing in almost $13 million in revenue, according to NBC New York. As tennis fans descend on New York for the two-week-long event, CNBC calculated how the Honey Deuce's price change has fared compared with broader inflation. Honey Deuce enthusiasts are shelling out around 53% more than they did in 2015, when the beverage cost $15, according to Sportico's price tracker. That's higher than broader inflation as tracked in the consumer price index, or CPI. The CPI, which monitors a broad basket of goods and services, has increased about 36% between August 2015 and July 2025, the last month with data available. In other words, if the Honey Deuce rose in tandem with overall inflation, it would cost approximately $20.33 today. The Honey Deuce's price has also risen at a faster clip than other alcoholic beverages bought outside of homes in U.S. cities. That average cost is up nearly 34% between August 2015 and July 2025, meaning it has seen slightly lower inflation than the overall CPI basket has. Americans have been particularly focused on prices coming off the period of runaway inflation seen during the Covid-19cpandemic. Higher price tags have soured economic sentiment in recent years. Yet, consumers have also displayed an inclination to spend on experiences such as travel, concerts and sporting events. That has created a phenomenon known as "funflation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka's fourth-round U.S. Open showdown will serve as a welcome trip down memory lane for the two fan favorites, as they face off in a match made for prime time on Monday. Organizers could not have scripted it better for American fans, with a must-watch meeting between two charismatic former champions on the U.S. Labor Day holiday, six years after their memorable first meeting at Flushing Meadows. The then-defending champion and world number one made easy work of Gauff 6-3 6-0, but quickly comforted the young American as she dissolved into tears by her bench and urged her to come address the crowd. Osaka spent much of her own post-match interview watching the crowd cheer wildly for her opponent, a display of stunning good sportsmanship that endures for tennis fans today. I guess I put way too much pressure on myself," said Gauff, who tamed early tournament nerves to get past Poland's Magdalena Frech 6-3 6-1 and into her fourth consecutive round of 16. "It would be a cool kind of deja vu type of situation (playing again), but hopefully it will be a different result." Recalling the encounter, Osaka said on Saturday that it would be special to play Gauff again at Flushing Meadows. "I remember just knowing that she was going to be a really great tennis player," said the 23rd seed Osaka, who plays for Japan but spent much of her childhood nearby on Long Island and is counted among New York's adopted daughters. Their careers diverged from there: Osaka would go on to win her third and fourth majors at the 2020 U.S. Open and 2021 Australian Open — but has been unable to win another tournament since, struggling with her form. She became a champion for mental health with her candid disclosures around anxiety and depression and has been on the upswing this season, reaching the Montreal final after battling her way back after giving birth in 2023. "I have to give myself a lot of grace on that." A women's finals record of 3.4 million viewers tuned into ESPN to watch Gauff lift the 2023 U.S. Open trophy, 1.1 million more than the audience that watched Novak Djokovic claim his 24th major title a day later, a reflection of how beloved she is. Gauff arrived in New York as the third seed after picking up her second major at Roland Garros earlier this year — while Osaka repeatedly said she was happy just to be seeded at all. "It's been a real pleasure to see how she's kind of navigated herself and been a role model to a lot of young people, even though she's a young person herself," said Osaka, who beat the 15th seed Daria Kasatkina 6-0 4-6 6-3 in the third round. The seven-time major winner Venus Williams, often cited as an inspiration for both players, said their rematch was good for the sport.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business Insider has verified Ramli's past and current job income. For my first two years as a content creator, I saw it as a fun side hustle to do while in university. But when I went full-time with content creation after graduating from my university in 2024, I realized it was only the "dream" life on paper. Sure, I was making a solid salary and got to work on my own terms, but I was insecure, anxious, and sacrificing my morals for a paycheck. I'm still not sure if it was the right decision. I was studying English literature in the pursuit of becoming a writer or editor. In a typical week, I'd attend four to eight brand events, do one to two days of content shooting, and do some video editing nearly every day. I received all sorts of free products, worked with brands I loved as a child, and met some of the most amazing people. However, several months after cutting ties with my biggest brand sponsor due to opposing beliefs, I lost almost half of my income. After that, I was making about RM10,000 to 12,000, or between $2,300 and $2,800, each month. I started reflecting deeper on my content and realized it had grown into something completely different than the hobby it started as. Almost all of my videos had become ads. I also started realizing that by representing beauty companies, I was inadvertently contributing to the message to young girls that they aren't beautiful enough. I figured I could always go back to content creation, but it may be difficult to enter corporate later on and try to explain my several-year career gap and lack of professional experience. So, I decided to look for marketing jobs. It has similar aspects to content, which would allow me to continue some of the parts of creation that I love. I relied more on my degree in English language and literature and work experience while in university to sell myself. There were some weeks when I rotted in bed for two days because I was wiped out from a huge event the night before. I'm now enjoying the routine of getting dressed in a cute outfit and heading to the office to work with a great team. I think about everything I had — the events, products, and freedom — and feel crazy for giving it up. I miss it at times, but I have to remind myself that we always have a fonder view when looking back on things. I have to remind myself how hollow and unsatisfying being a content creator was. I've realized now that a lot of things I did as a content creator were not what I wanted, but what society programs us to believe are enviable to other people. I'm now focusing on what makes me feel good. If you are making a career pivot and would like to share your story, please email the editor, Manseen Logan, at mlogan@businessinsider.com.</p>
