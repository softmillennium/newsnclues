                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the Disney–YouTube TV carriage fight drags on, Disney Entertainment Co-Chairs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman joined with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro to thank employees for “staying focused” during the disruption. “Another sports-packed weekend” headlined by college football on Saturday is likely to be dark for YouTube TV's 10 million subscribers, the execs wrote in an internal memo. Laura Karpman Hid An Alan Silvestri Homage In Music For 'Captain America: Brave New World' - Sound & Screen Film While carriage disputes are nothing news, and Disney has had high-profile ones with DirecTV and Charter in recent years, the YouTube TV situation is unique. While carriage fees are a primary source of friction, the Big Tech DNA of YouTube and the $3 trillion valuation of its corporate parent, Google, have altered the usual dynamics. A YouTube TV spokesperson told Deadline the negotiations are continuing and the distributor remains hopeful about reaching a deal. Team,We promised to keep you updated on our negotiations with Google's YouTube TV following their decision last week to pull our channels from their service, and we are writing today with the latest. We know you've seen a swirl of information about the impasse, so we wanted to share some of the facts:We began these negotiations by offering YouTube TV a deal that would cost less overall than the terms of our recently expired license. We've offered innovative, bespoke programming packages—tailored to sports fans, entertainment fans, kids and families—that would provide tremendous flexibility for YouTube TV and greater choice and value for its customers.We've offered fair terms that are in-line with the more than 500 other distributors that have renewed their agreements since last summer, including the top distributors, who are far larger than YouTube TV.Despite all this, YouTube TV continues to insist on receiving preferential terms that are below market and has made few concessions. Rather than compete on a level playing field, Google's YouTube TV has approached these negotiations as if it were the only player in the game. It goes without saying that the reason so many consumers value our programming above others is because we invest in the best talent, creators and content in the world, and we cannot allow anyone to undercut our ability to do so.We know how difficult this situation is for the YouTube TV customers we serve, and for all of you who provide the sports programming, entertainment, news and live events that our fans know and love. Thank you for the incredible work you do each and every day and for staying focused on maintaining such a high bar throughout this difficult situation.We will continue to work diligently to find common ground with YouTube TV and will keep you informed as we have more news to share.With Gratitude,Alan, Dana & Jimmy Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. It benefits Disney for this to drag out because they own Hulu TV which is the closest equivalent streaming TV service out there. Get strapped in because this is going to keep happening because Disney owns ESPN and this surrounds a rate increase that will cover free access to the ESPN DTC app which without it being with a provider that has access to it is 29.99 a month. Dish Network, Xfinity, Cox, DirecTV*Regular Satellite Service*, Sling TV, Time Warner Cable etc are all going to end up with this issue. Disney has allowed ESPN to go ALL IN on this new app and it will backfire as people will seek out other avenues to watch programming or not at all! Sue, I hate to tell you this, but YouTube TV accounts for a very tiny percentage of YouTube's revenue generation. I missed a few big SEC football games last weekend, and there are a couple this Saturday I'd like to watch. But I'm going to be fine missing them again. Gotta look long term, and on this fight, I'm with YTTV because I'm sick of the increasing prices. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brett Goldstein is expanding his TV series presence to another major streamer. Goldstein, star, writer and executive producer on Apple TV+'s Ted Lasso and co-creator, executive producer and recurring cast member of Apple TV+'s Shrinking, has a new comedy project, Escorted, which has received an eight-episode straight-to-series order by Prime Video. Goldstein is the star, writer and executive producer of the half-hour, single-camera series, which comes from Warner Bros. Television where he is under an overall deal. A divorced dad in Manhattan (Goldstein) accidentally becomes a male escort in the romantic comedy about second chances, the mayhem of co-parenting, and whether real intimacy can ever be bought. Amazon Stock Pops As Q3 Tops Forecasts: AWS Strong, $1.8 Billion In Severance Costs, Shout-Out To 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' More Amazon MGM Studios TV Creative Executives Impacted By Layoffs - Update Goldstein will serve as co-showrunner alongside fellow Shrinking executive producer Brian Gallivan. Warner Bros. Television is the lead studio, co-producing with Amazon MGM Studios. Escorted was taken out by WBTV over the summer, landing at Amazon, which stepped up in a competitive situation. Known for his signature Ted Lasso role as the gruff but lovable football player-turned-coach Roy Kent, which earned him an Emmy Award, Goldstein has veered into romantic fare lately with the films All Of You and the upcoming Office Romance, both of which he co-wrote and played the male lead in. His first stand-up special, Brett Goldstein: The Second Best Night of Your Life, which was executive produced by Mandel, was released by HBO Max earlier this year. He is repped by WME, Mosaic, B-Side, LARK, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller. Like Goldstein, Gallivan is an actor, writer and comedian who also has a recurring role on Shrinking in addition to writing/executive producing. He also co-stars opposite Goldstein in Office Romance.

And I always wondered as a kid, ‘Why did he do that? While as a kid the story became how del Toro started articulating his feelings about his Catholicism, as an adult, he built a room in his house dedicated to Shelley, a life-size silicon recreation of the author at her desk. His Los Angeles “living room” is dedicated to the various movie incarnations of Victor Frankenstein's monster through the years, including eight statues.

One of the defining characteristics of del Toro's career has been his movie monsters, the pinnacle of which was his desire to make the most “beautiful” version of Victor Frankenstein's creation imaginable, so much so that his decades-long collaboration with creature designer Mike Hill was a dress rehearsal. He wouldn't look like an ICU victim,” said Del Toro on how he envisioned the skin of the cobbled together monster. “That I've been rehearsing, if you watch my movies, the pale vampire on ‘Blade II,' the pale vampire on ‘Cronos,' is the same look I was trying to rehearse for ‘Frankenstein. But when it came time on set for Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Oscar Isaac) to finally assemble del Toro's dream of the perfect monster (Jacob Elordi), it was the filmmaker who felt unexpectedly transformed. “Something happened when Victor was doing the anatomy assembly. Oscar and I were really linked, and I looked at him, he looked at me, and without saying anything, we felt something had changed,” said del Toro, who after having time to process the moment, has concluded, “I had dreamt of that scene so long, and all of a sudden we're shooting it and I felt like something left — it was something to do with monsters, something to do with my filming language. Something changed and I think it's never felt like that ever.” He is deep in the process of making a stop motion animated version of Kazuo Ishiguro's fantasy novel “The Buried Giant,” which does feature some creatures, but said his curiosity for the first time lies away from the movie monsters that have defined his career. The polished, precise, colorful, grand, sweeping soundstage craft he has been perfecting for decades — much like Elordi's monster — seems to have also culminated on “Frankenstein.” In particular, del Toro talked about how he had been sharpening his mastery of camera movement with his last four films, growing to the point he was shooting almost exclusively on a technocrane, as he learned how to dial into the exact emotional rhythm and feeling of a moment with how his camera moved through space. On the podcast, del Toro talked about wanting to make his version of a grounded, gritty '70s film, with films by Sidney Lumet, Don Siegel, Alan Pakula, and what he calls the “ugly Paris trilogy” of Roman Polanski (“The Tenant,” “Frantic”), calling his name. Del Toro, 61, admitted age does have something to do with wanting to mix it up for the first time — inspired by his friend, the sci-fi body horror master David Cronenberg's 2005 shift to more grounded thrillers, “A History of Violence” and “Eastern Promises.” And he did ‘A History of Violence' — it's a departure, but it's not,” said del Toro, referring to the fact Cronenberg's POV as filmmaker is still recognizable in his later films.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taylor Swift didn't receive any nominations for the forthcoming 2026 Grammy Awards because her latest album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” doesn't qualify. With Swift releasing her twelfth studio album on Oct. 3, her new music debuted well after the eligibility window closed. She also didn't drop any new singles, music videos or other records during the timeframe that would allow her to qualify. (Her previous album, “The Tortured Poets Department,” came out in April 2024.) Swifties were abuzz after nominations dropped for the music industry's big night, which will take place on Feb. 1, 2026. “Taylor Swift doesn't have any Grammy nominations??? “Does taylor swift new album (shall not be named) qualify for this years grammys or next? cause i see no noms and im jumping in excitement,” a hater tweeted. OH TAYLOR 😭,” a third social media user added. By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. While Swift's newest album didn't make the cut, Justin Bieber, Sabrina Carpenter, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Chappell Roan and other pop stars are in the running. Last year, Swift's “TTPD” album earned her six nominations — but she left the ceremony without any new trophies. A year prior, however, she won two awards in the coveted categories for album of the year and best pop vocal album for her “Midnights” album, which she released on Oct. 21 2022. She received the honor for 2010's “Fearless,” 2016's “1989,” 2021's “Folklore” and, as previously mentioned, 2024's “Midnights.” It's unclear if Swift will be in attendance at this year's awards without any nominations, though it's very possible she could show up as a presenter or performer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lee Tamahori, the New Zealand-born director whose debut feature, the bleak Maori drama Once Were Warriors, led to a major Hollywood career, has died. Tamahori's family on Friday said he died at home after a battle with Parkinson's disease. Robert Emms on Starring in 'The Choral,' Opposite Ralph Fiennes, and His 'Andor' Experience 'Decorado' Director on His Animated Dystopia Reflecting Our "Ultracapitalist World" Tamahori broke out internationally with Once Were Warriors (1994), which debuted at Cannes and offered an unflinching look at gangs, sex and domestic violence. “I find people are pretty quiet after seeing this film,” he said. He next became an assistant director and guided commercials and TV series during the 1980s with his production banner, Flying Fish, then directed a short film, Thunderbox (1989). In a 2022 interview on the Paramount lot, Tamahori revealed that he first got interested in movies in New Zealand by skipping school to go to the local cinema, with action movies and American westerns his preference. His other film credits included Mulholland Falls (1996), Along Came a Spider (2001) and The Devil's Double (2011), plus episodes of The Sopranos and Billions. He returned to his Maori roots with The Patriarch (2016) and then The Convert (2023), a 19th century-set historical drama starring Guy Pearce as an English minister who travels to New Zealand to preach at a British settlement, only to get caught up in the violence between warring Maori tribes.

Points for creativity: Netflix partnered with mental wellness app Calm to create an immersive audio experience inspired by its Oscar-aspiring “Train Dreams.” The collaboration, launching today, represents Netflix's first venture on the Calm platform and a potential blueprint for how specialty films can cut through the noise by targeting audiences when they're asleep. The 20-minute “Sleep Story x Soundscape” hybrid transforms Clint Bentley's drama into a meditative audio journey, featuring narrator Will Patton alongside the film's original score and sound design. Adapted from Denis Johnson's Pulitzer-nominated novella about a railroad laborer in the early 20th century American West, “Train Dreams” explores themes of solitude, loss, and resilience — the kind of contemplative territory where Calm's 100 million users already spend their time. Related Stories ‘In Your Dreams' Review: Kid Siblings Try to Sleep Off Their Parents' Relationship Problems in a Forgettably Generic Adventure from Netflix Animation How ‘In Your Dreams' Pushes CG Animation Style to Differentiate Fantasy and Reality The Calm team worked with the film's sound designer, Lee Salevan, and composer Bryce Dessner, utilizing the film's sound stems and score cues overlaid with sections of dialogue from Bentley and Greg Kwedar's script. The odds are stacked against independent and specialty films capturing audience attention. Calm previously collaborated with superhero franchises like “Venom: The Last Dance” (voiced by Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock and Venom), but this is the first film partnership to create one of its Sleep Stories. The film stars Joel Edgerton, Felicity Jones, and William H. Macy, with Patton's narration carrying over to the Calm experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millie Bobby Brown and David Harbour shut down rumors of bullying and harassment on the Stranger Things set by posing together and praising each other at the final season premiere event on Thursday. “I've obviously had a really special bond with David because we have a father-daughter relationship, and we do every scene together,” Brown told Entertainment Tonight on the red carpet. “You really get to see that in Season Five.” Harbour told ET of Brown, “I adore her, and I've been proud to watch all of them grow up and become great artists. I doubt it will be the last time we'll see each other in this world or work together.” Brown's specific accusations against Harbour were not revealed, but no sexual impropriety was reportedly alleged. “Obviously, you understand I can't get into personal on-set matters, but I will say we've been doing this for 10 years with this cast, and at this point they're family and we deeply care about them,” Ross Duffer told the Hollywood Reporter. “So, you know, nothing matters more than just having a set where everyone feels safe and happy.” “I've read a bunch of stories, and they range from wildly inaccurate to … there's so much noise around it. You have to create a respectful workplace where everyone feels comfortable and safe, and so we did everything to build that environment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Andy Richter underwent a procedure to ensure that he can continue performing on “Dancing With the Stars.” Richter shared a graphic photo of the fluid that was removed from his knee and fans were understandably concerned. “Trigger warning: knee juice,” he wrote on the first slide. “The second photo is my wife's reaction to it, a.k.a. @theemmaslater said it looked like the juice she just drank, I love her too,” he added. The second image showed a text exchange with his wife. Richter shared the knee juice pic and his wife responded, “Ohh, that's nice!! During a September 2025 interview on the “Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend” podcast, Richter shared his reservations about joining “DWTS,” given that he has knee and hip issues. “I have to do this … It is pretty fun,” he said. I got problem knees, all kinds of stuff going on as a side note, too.” He added, “Also, too, what's even better is … this was April, I said yes. Then in July, they figured out what all the leg pain and stuff had been going on is because I need a hip replacement. Richter escaped elimination during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame night on November 4, advancing to to the quarterfinals. Fans flooded the comments section with messages of concern and support. “Love that your wife is so funny.” Thank you for bringing joy every week!” one fan commented. “Helps keep your joints cushioned and lubricated. They're stealing it from you to make gummy bears, the government doesn't want you to know that.” Richter answered one fan who needed to know if the fluid smelled.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Hello, peace stealer,” Rosalía sings, almost coyly, pointing to her target from the first line. There seem to be two real possibilities for who “La Perla” might be about — but most fans think it's Rauw Alejandro, the Puerto Rican heartthrob and reggaeton star, whom Rosalía dated from 2021 through 2023. Together, they released a collaborative project titled RR inspired by their love, and Rosalía even got a tattoo of his first name under her left breast. Shortly after the breakup, Alejandro released a song titled “Hayami Hana” on which he insisted that infidelity was never the reason for their split, and poured out compliments for Rosalía. And then there was the 2023 Latin Grammys a few months later, where he took the stage — in Rosalía's home country of Spain, no less — to perform a cover of Laura Pausini's heartbreak song “Se Fue,” which compares the end of a relationship to a powerful storm that ruined him. Kendrick Lamar, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga Lead 2026 Grammy Nominees Journey Announce Final Frontier North American Farewell Tour But back to Rosalía's “La Perla:: “After a powerful verse from Yahritza y Su Esencia‘s Yahritza about this mystery man's need for a psychiatrist, Rosalía joins with a sing-songy, spoken line where she describes how her narcissistic ex would see being called an icon as a “reductionist narrative.” She then sings, “Loyalty and faithfulness/Are a language he'll never understand/His masterpiece, his collection of bras.” Aside from Rauw Alejandro's bra-catching skills at concerts, the reggaetonero even has a song with Daddy Yankee titled “Panties y Brasieres” on his album Saturno. The two of them sparked dating rumors after being spotted together in the year following her breakup with Alejandro. White wore a rose brooch at the Critics' Choice Awards in January 2024, which many fans took as a nod to the singer. However, they seemed to split later in the year as Allen retreated from public view to play Bruce Springsteen in the biopic Deliver Me From Nowhere.

The couple were photographed leaving Zero Bond, one of Swift's favorite members-only social clubs, on Thursday.

What are you doing over the week?” Jason, 38, asked Travis, sarcastically urging him to “tell us about your personal life.” “No, no chance,” he replied, denying Jason — and their eager listeners — of any details about what he'd be doing in his free time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Comcast's European pay-TV business Sky is in talks to acquire U.K. TV giant ITV's media and entertainment (M&E) unit. In a statement early Friday morning London time, ITV said it was in “preliminary discussions regarding a possible sale of its M&E business to Sky for an enterprise value of £1.6 billion,” which translates to $2.1 billion. TXT's Yeonjun Isn't Concerned With Meeting Your Expectations on His Debut EP, 'No Labels' Pauline Collins, Star of 'Shirley Valentine' on Stage and Screen, Dies at 85 Not part of a deal would be production powerhouse ITV Studios, which produces such shows as Love Island, Britain's Got Talent and the Harlan Coben Netflix hit series Fool Me Once, among many others. ITV Studios has been the topic of much deal chatter in recent years, with the likes of Banijay, All3Media parent RedBird IMI and others being cited as potential buyers. While confirming overnight reports of deal talks, ITV on Friday also emphasized that a transaction for its M&E division with Comcast's Sky may ultimately not come together. “There can be no certainty as to the terms upon which any potential sale may be agreed or whether any transaction will take place,” its statement highlighted. Comcast's potential play for parts of ITV comes at a time when it also seems to be exploring a potential bid for parts of Warner Bros. Overnight reports said that Comcast has hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to evaluate a possible deal for the David Zaslav-led Hollywood conglomerate's studio and streaming businesses, following WBD's recent decision to explore various deal options.

Late last week—and just as the Netflix show was beginning the big push leading into the protracted release of its fifth and final season—British tabloid The Daily Mail reported on an investigation that reportedly came out of the Stranger Things set lately. Specifically, The Mail had a report that star Millie Bobby Brown had lodged a complaint of bullying against her frequent co-star on the series, David Harbour, supposedly with “pages” of complaints about his behavior. In the days since The Mail‘s report became public, nobody at either the show, or Netflix high command, has addressed the allegations—until tonight, when, per THR, the series' showrunners and other executives fielded questions about it during the show's big season premiere event in Los Angeles

Surrounded by the show's cast (including Brown and Harbour, who were photographed and videoed smiling together), Ross Duffer was mostly oblique when asked about the story, which states that Brown filed her complaint against Harbour before filming on the fifth season began, and was ultimately accompanied by a personal representative while filming the season. (All reports about the investigation have been definitive in noting that none of the allegations made against Harbour were sexual in nature.) Per Duffer: “Obviously, you understand I can't get into personal on-set matters, but I will say we've been doing this for 10 years with this cast, and at this point they're family and we deeply care about them. So, you know, nothing matters more than just having a set where everyone feels safe and happy.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Demi Moore is honoring her ex-husband, Bruce Willis, in a heartfelt way that moved fans and friends alike. Moore was joined by Willis' wife, Emma Heming Willis, who has become a strong advocate for dementia awareness and caregiving since his diagnosis. The night drew an outpouring of love and support for the “Die Hard” star, with celebrity guests including Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Whoopi Goldberg, and Michael J. Moore and Heming Willis, who have worked together to support Bruce's health journey, shared the evening in solidarity. Their blended family has long been admired for its mutual respect and harmony. During a recent appearance on The Oprah Podcast, Moore opened up about Heming Willis' strength in caring for Bruce. “I have so much compassion for Emma in this, being a young woman,” Moore said. “There's no way that anybody could have anticipated where this was going to go. And I really think she's done a masterful job. She has been so dedicated to forging the right path. Moore continued, “It's hard to see somebody who was so vibrant and strong and so direct shift into this other part of themselves. But my particular perspective is, one, I really always say it's so important just to meet them where they're at. Willis, 69, was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in early 2023 after retiring from acting due to aphasia the year before. Through it all, both Demi Moore and Heming Willis have remained steadfast in celebrating Bruce's legacy, his strength, and the deep love that continues to surround him. Their united front has served as a powerful reminder of family, compassion, and enduring devotion. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There has been much talk, in recent months, of how Netflix interacts, or doesn't, with movie theaters. But the fact that the streamer/studio will put a movie into theaters, at least for minute, now feels like it could be a sticking point in some conversations all on its own, leading certain directors—like Weapons and Barbarians guy Zach Cregger—to ask, “Well, why doesn't my movie get the star treatment, too?” Which, we have to assume, is especially galling in so far as Netflix came to Cregger to make the film, which he originally penned for Amblin a few years back; Cregger was reportedly wooed by Netflix Films chairman Daniel Lin while he was busy working up his new Resident Evil film for Sony, offers that apparently included Lin “dangling” a theatrical release for the movie to lure Cregger in. (We'll note here that The Wrap does quote a few other sources who say this is all being overblown, and that The Flood is, at the very least, still in talks, and possibly even in “active development.”) The “Who gets a movie screen?” question has become one of those Hollywood culture queries that continues to have massive box office repercussions, for the pretty simple reason that movie executives are generally a little pragmatic, if not outright ambivalent, about it, while the directors in their employ really give a shit. We would have assumed that Cregger, who's got a ton of critical heat on him right now, and managed to turn a $40 million budget on Weapons into an extremely unlikely box office hit, would be getting similar “Hey, just make him happy” treatment—but, apparently, not so much.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leonardo DiCaprio starred in the One Battle After Another movie, but Katy Perry lived that title to the fullest in her “Bandaids” music video, which arrived on Thursday night (Nov. 6). “If I had to do it all over again. I would still do it all over again,” she sings. The accompanying visual finds KP nearly meeting her demise on multiple instances as she faces near-death experiences while life continues to throw hurdles at her, but the pop star doesn't stop trudging on. She lives out every kid's nightmare of having their shoelace stuck in an escalator while walking through the Puente Hills Mall and then the hits keep coming. Perry proceeds to get electrocuted at a car charging station, has her coffee date interrupted by an explosion, a faulty GPS nearly leads to a car accident and then she gets stuck in the third rail while facing an oncoming train. Even after hopping out of the train tracks, KP ends up in a muddy sinkhole. At this point, she's had enough and can't catch a break. As she lights one up in an attempt to process her terrible day, a relatable situation for many smokers. She launched the eras-spanning Lifetimes Tour in Mexico City in April, which grossed over $80 million when accounting for the U.S., Canada and Australia legs. Perry's currently wrapping up the European leg with shows in France and Spain, before heading to China later this month. The trek will finish with a show in Abu Dhabi on Dec. 7.
