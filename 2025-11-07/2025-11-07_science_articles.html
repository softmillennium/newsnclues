                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The vast “megacity,” spanning more than 1,040 square feet —nearly half the size of a tennis court—is home to about 111,000 spiders of the species Tegenaria domestica and Prinerigone vagans, according to a study by a separate group of researchers. This is the first documented case of either of these two species constructing webs together, the study's authors reported recently in Subterranean Biology. A caver looks at the massive colonial spider web. Sulfur caves are among the most extreme habitats on Earth. They are completely dark and filled with hydrogen sulfide gas, which is toxic to most life-forms. Inside, species' survival depends on chemical reactions powered by microbes that oxidize sulfur.

Those flies themselves depend on sulfur-oxidizing microbes as their primary food source. They think that this genetic isolation, combined with a stable and abundant food supply, may have driven these species—which have never been reported to form colonies—to evolve colonial behavior. The new finding “shows that nature still holds many surprises for us,” says study co-author Urák István of the Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania in Romania.

These types of article were never officially on arXiv's list of ‘accepted content types', but they had previously been allowed at moderator discretion, said a blog post announcing the move on 31 October. arXiv management says the move was made necessary by a surge in low-quality papers, including many that appear to be written using generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools. “I think this is a wise move by arXiv,” says Richard Sever, chief science and strategy officer of the non-profit organisation openRxiv in New York City, which runs the biomedical-sciences preprint servers bioRxiv and medRxiv. He adds both of those platforms have had a ‘no narrative reviews' policy from the outset. Before going live on the site, around 20% of submissions are flagged to one of 240 volunteer moderators, says arXiv executive director Ramin Zabih, a computer scientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

According to CERN—the beating heart of nuclear research on planet Earth—“matter and antimatter particles are always produced as a pair and, if they come in contact, annihilate one another, leaving behind pure energy.” But, as you and I are evidence of, that's not what happened. The problem is, neutrinos are far from willing participants in this search for answers, given how difficult they are to observe. Neutrinos are nearly massless and they interact with almost nothing—in fact, every second, 100 trillion of them pass through your body, but only a handful will interact with you during your entire lifetime (not that you'll notice). Simply put, neutrinos are as close to invisible as you can possibly get without being fully impossible to directly detect. To better understand neutrinos, two large-scale experiments—T2K in Japan and NOvA in the U.S.—have joined forces to combine their data and perform an in-depth analysis of how these particles could have enabled matter to exist in the universe. Joint analyses allow us to use complementary features of these designs.” In the study, scientists focused on a concept known as “neutrino mass ordering.” As the authors note, neutrinos exist in three mass states (ν1, ν2, and ν3), and each flavor of neutrino (electron, muon, or tau) is a mixture of those states. If the “normal” mass ordering holds, muon neutrinos are more likely to become electron neutrinos, and their antimatter counterparts are less likely. But, of course, the opposite is true when inverted. The idea is that if the inverted pattern holds, then it's possible for matter-antimatter pairs to violate charge-pair (CP) symmetry. Unfortunately, this particular combination of data doesn't show a particular preference for either mass ordering, so the mystery still remains.

Several thousand scientists from 113 countries say that the job pressures of being a researcher are rising.Credit: L. E. Baskow/Las Vegas Review-Journal/Tribune News Service via Getty About 68% of respondents said the pressure to publish their research is greater than it was two to three years ago and only 45% agreed that they have sufficient time for research (see ‘Researchers are feeling the pressure'). Suemoto says this imbalance of high demands and restricted resources often forces researchers to do more with less, which could affect the quality and innovation of research. 'As a result, some researchers are surprised that the proportion of people who have enough time to do their work is so high. “I am amazed that 45% of scientists feel they have enough time for research. “China has made it much more attractive for Chinese scientists to stay, whilst the government in the US has been unprecedently hostile towards scientists, especially on topics where the government has a diverging opinion and with regard to diversity and inclusion,” says van Loon. “So, I am not surprised by the statistics around desire to move country.” The relatively high proportion of respondents in the United States considering a move reflects data from a Nature poll in March, which showed that 75% of 1,600 US scientists were considering a move overseas after the election of President Donald Trump, with many saying they were looking for jobs in Europe and Canada.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why Headaches Remain One of Medicine's Most Misunderstood Disorders Migraine and cluster headaches affect millions—yet research remains surprisingly thin. By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Jeffery DelViscio Headaches are incredibly common, but they've gotten surprisingly little attention from scientists. Here to walk us through what we know—and don't know—about headache science is Tom Zeller Jr. He's a former New York Times reporter and editor and the current editor in chief of Undark. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today. Tom Zeller Jr.: Oh, it's great to be here. Feltman: So I would love to start with a little bit about what inspired you to write a book about headaches. Zeller: Sure, well, you probably could guess that I have headaches myself. And not just the ordinary sort of headaches that we all get, but I have something called cluster headache, which is one of the three primary headache disorders—I mean, there are other primary headache disorders, but these are the three main ones: tension-type headache being the most common, migraine being probably the most familiar and most debilitating—and predominantly among women. So, you know, it's an issue that I've sort of grappled with for most of my adult life. It's not something that I ever wrote about as a journalist, or thought that I ever would. But when I started thinking about a book I realized that I'd kind of been researching this topic for most of my life for other reasons, and so it seemed like a natural fit. Feltman: And what is the research landscape like when it comes to these, you know, three major headache types? I mean, in the book I focus mostly on migraine because if there is any research being done, it tends to be on that. And to some extent I think it's fair to assume that what we learn about migraine will shed light on other headache disorders, too, because there's sure to be some underlying biology that they all share. But in general the surprising thing to me that I discovered was how little we actually know about what's actually going on inside, like what bits of anatomy are being pulled into the choreography of a migraine attack, what bits of anatomy are more important than others. I mean, the research suggests—there are a lot of good imaging studies that show certain parts of the brain lighting up. There are more recent studies that indicate that certain neurochemicals are in abundant supply in the blood when someone is undergoing an attack. And we also know that the blood vessels may or may not play a role in all of this. Zeller: I think there's a lot going on. I think one of the most obvious things is that migraine mostly affects women, and I don't think I'm saying anything that you don't already know: that women's health in general has gotten short shrift over the decades. Zeller: And I think that that, in a lot of ways, it bled into decision-making at institutions like the [National Institutes of Health], which is the biggest funder of basic science in the U.S. I also think that there's something sort of cultural about the word “headache.” I mean, we use this word as a metaphor for a mere annoyance: You know, “Doing your taxes is a headache.” “Sitting in traffic is a headache.” And it's unfortunate that we often have the same word to describe real neurobiological disorders. And I think a third leg of it is the fact that we all get this thing called headache. So we all sort of think that we know what a headache is, and yet there is this sort of subset of people who have headaches, in a disorder sense ... And yet we use the same word to describe it. Feltman: Yeah, no, I think there's a real sort of definition problem. And then in the midst of having long COVID my migraines got more frequent and worse, and the increase in degree made me be like, “Oh, no, this is what people are talking about [laughs] when they say they have a migraine,” which is just—it was so funny to me. Zeller: Do you get the whole suite of symptoms? Like, you get the aura and all that, too, or just? Feltman: It's really interesting, during the period where they got very bad and frequent I did have, like, the aura, the blurred vision, so that was really what made it like, “Oh, this kind of weird, bad feeling I sometimes get that comes with a headache ...” Feltman: “Is a migraine.” And now it's much less common that I have this sort of whole suite, but yeah, they're wild, and it—you know, I have a friend who gets migraines that honestly present as kind of, like, strokelike ... Zeller: It's also interesting to me that, you know, for a lot of years, I mean, it was considered somewhat of a psychosomatic condition, or it was considered a vascular condition and just, “If we address the blood vessel tone, we might address this thing,” when, in fact, there's all these clear indicators that it's a neurological event. Some people—I mean, obviously, there's a lot of nausea involved. And yet it just was sort of overlooked for so many years. Feltman: And for listeners who don't know and maybe, like me a few years ago, are sort of blissfully ignorant of what it is we actually mean when we say migraine, could you tell us about those three big headache types and how they differ? So I think most people will experience a tension-type headache. The thinking, I think, is that a large part of them are much more involved in sort of muscle tone and maybe even posture, and it tends to be sort of all around the head rather than on one side, which suggests that maybe it's not strictly an—a neurological disorder in the same way that migraine is. I've had scientists tell me that they think a lot of tension-type headaches might actually be [a] migraine, so it's hard to draw these lines, but that would be the big category. And in most cases, not all—it can be incredibly debilitating—but in most cases tension-type headaches can be addressed with over-the-counter analgesics and maybe some lifestyle changes. Again, I don't want to, to belittle it because some people are really sort of bedeviled by these things, too. But the next sort of most common primary headache is migraine. It affects women by an order of [about] three to one. We can trace migraine's history back to the, you know, Egyptian papyri where we see it written about. Not everyone experiences the other neurological symptoms that we just talked about, but definitely the pain, and it's almost always one-sided. And it's broken down by chronic or episodic. If you get less—it's sort of arbitrary, but that's how they break it down. But it can be really upending for people who have this, and whole seasons of their lives can be disrupted. People experiencing a migraine typically retreat to a dark room, put a pillow over their head and ride it out for however many hours, or sometimes days, that it might last. It's incredibly painful and much more, I think, sort of attenuated than, then migraine. The severity of it is such that I couldn't even think of lying down; I mean, you, you sort of have to run around the room because it's almost like—the intensity is, like, akin to having your hand on a hot burner but not being able to take it off. That pain will last—it'll come on in seconds and then last—almost like a stroke—and last for about an hour or two if you don't have an intervention and then go away. It tends to come multiple times a day, and you'll have those attacks for one, two, maybe three months out of the year, and then they [makes vanishing noise] disappear. They just completely vanish, and you might not get them again for many months or even years in between. So unlike migraine, which I think people who have it sort of deal with it all the time, clusters come in clusters, and they come and go in ways that we don't understand and also are kind of fascinating if you can back up enough to look at it. But those are the three main categories, yeah. Feltman: And what surprised you the most in terms of things you learned while researching for the book? Zeller: Well, I think the first thing that surprised me the most was just how little we know and it's as understudied as it is. One thing that we didn't talk about is that, for as common as headache disorders are, med students get very little education in headache science at all. I talked to med students for the book who said, “You know, it came up in med school for about a half an hour once,” and that was sort of all, despite there being [roughly] 50 million people in the United States alone with these things. I would say almost all of them were told as they were coming through school, “Don't focus your life on that. It's not a very sexy thing to study. You should go into, like, movement disorders or Alzheimer's.” So I was just sort of shocked that there's this ambient sort of bias against headache science even within the sciences. I imagine that was a little disheartening for you, too. I think the main thing is that there are people who are devoting their lives to studying these things, and, you know, I actually thought that anyone who was doing it probably had these disorders themselves, but that's not necessarily true. There are a lot of scientists around the world who are just really fascinated by this as a neurological disorder, who reckoned that if we could figure this out, it would really sort of, like, change people's lives. You probably have heard of the CGRP medications that came out. That came at the end of, like, 30 years of pretty intense and swashbuckling science that discovered these neurotransmitters. We talked about, like, neurochemicals sort of being elevated in the blood of people who are experiencing migraine—CGRP is one of those neurotransmitters, and we figured that out only in the 1990s. And then, you know, it took about 30 years to figure out, “What would happen if we produced a drug that blocked this neurotransmitter?” And in fact, in some large portion of trial patients it worked; it seemed to have a really great effect. Now, when you sort of distribute those effects now on the market and look at it in aggregate, it's probably a lot like other medications in that it helps about half the people experience about half the number of headaches that they usually get, which, you know, that was another surprising thing to me in the book is to learn that, you know, 50 percent is, like, a home run when it comes to drug development [laughs]. If you're helping half the people, which for any particular person taking it is a roll of the dice, but as far as drug development goes it's a home run. So the fact that those drugs are now on the market, and I spoke to a lot of people who are genuinely helped—and sometimes in a very, like, transformative way. Like, they spent decades just miserable and suddenly are sort of waking up into a life that's pain-free. It doesn't work for everyone, but I'm aware and know of lots of studies that are now looking at other neurotransmitters and other potential targets for new drugs.

(2025)Cite this article Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in the tumor microenvironment predicts resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). While TGF-β inhibition enhances ICB efficacy in murine cancer models, clinical trials have yet to demonstrate benefit, underscoring the need to better understand its immunoregulatory roles across disease contexts. Using mouse models of advanced colorectal cancer and patient-derived data, we demonstrate that TGF-β impairs antitumor immunity at multiple levels in liver metastases. It acts directly on T cells to block recruitment of peripheral memory CD8+ T cells, thereby limiting the effectiveness of ICB. Concurrently, TGF-β instructs tumor-associated macrophages to suppress clonal expansion of newly arrived T cells by inducing SPP1 expression. This extracellular matrix protein promotes collagen deposition and accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts, ultimately driving ICB resistance. Our findings reveal how TGF-β coordinates immunosuppressive mechanisms across innate and adaptive immune compartments to promote metastasis, offering new avenues to improve immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.

(2025)Cite this article The next generation of mRNA vaccines must address several limitations, including enhancing vaccine potency and reducing toxicity. Here we develop a class of degradable, cyclic amino ionizable lipids via sequential combinatorial chemistry and rational design. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) formulated with the top-performing ionizable lipid, AMG1541, elicited similar protective neutralization antibody titres against an H3 influenza antigen when compared with the FDA-approved ionizable lipid SM-102 at a 100-fold lower dose, with enhanced clearance in vivo. AMG1541 mRNA LNPs substantially reduced expression in the liver following intramuscular injection, mitigating the associated toxicity. We also observed improved mRNA delivery to antigen-presenting cells at the injection site and the draining lymph node, leading to stronger germinal centre reactions. Structure–activity relationship studies suggest that cyclic headgroups and β-amino alcohols facilitate interactions with the mRNA backbone and enhance endosomal escape. The formulations developed here significantly enhance the potency of mRNA vaccines, and our structural insights may guide the development of next-generation vaccine delivery systems.

Nature Catalysis (2025)Cite this article Substituted cyclohexanes are ubiquitous motifs in bioactive molecules. Thermodynamically disfavoured substituted cyclohexane scaffolds can significantly enhance both the biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties of potential drugs. However, achieving stereoselective cross-coupling for the synthesis of these structures with precise kinetic control remains a challenge. Here we present a modular reductive cross-coupling reaction that enables the stereoselective synthesis of thermodynamically disfavoured substituted cyclohexanes, employing simple alkenes as coupling partners. Mechanistically, the exceptional stereochemistry of this reaction is governed by a Heck-type migratory insertion step. The utility of this method is also demonstrated through the concise synthesis of bioactive molecules.

Surface passivation in perovskite solar cells can enhance device efficiency, yet incomplete interfacial functionality poses challenges to long-term reliability. Here we present a strategic interfacial engineering approach using sodium heptafluorobutyrate to fully functionalize the perovskite surface. Sodium heptafluorobutyrate acts as an ion shield that tunes the perovskite surface work function and increases the defect formation energy, resulting in an improved interface with the electron transport layer that minimizes recombination and boosts electron extraction under operation. We find that a sodium-heptafluorobutyrate-functionalized perovskite surface promotes a uniform, compact C60 layer that effectively blocks ion diffusion and stabilizes the device stack. This approach allows p–i–n perovskite solar cells to achieve a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.02% (certified 26.96% with a maximum-power-point-tracking PCE of 26.61%). Devices with an active area of 1 cm2 deliver a PCE of 25.95%. Perovskite solar cells retain 100% of their initial efficiency following 1,200 h of continuous 1-sun illumination at the maximum power point. Devices also demonstrate exceptional thermal stability, retaining 92% of the initial PCE when ageing at 85 °C for 1,800 h and 94% after 200 thermal cycles between –40 °C and +85 °C. Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs)1,2 due to their strong light absorption and appreciably high carrier mobility, and their low cost makes them particularly attractive3,4. Inverted (p–i–n) PSCs have achieved almost 27% PCE, competitive with silicon-based solar cells5,6. Such device architectures possess inherently better compatibility with flexible substrates and low-temperature processing, which could facilitate scale-up and the manufacture of tandem cells7,8,9. To drive forward the industrialization of perovskite photovoltaics, however, device reliability is a critical issue that is increasingly receiving attention10. The surface of perovskite films often exhibit a high abundance of defects, primarily due to the formation of volatile compounds during the fabrication process, leaving behind defects11,12. These defects, in turn, lead to notable non-radiative recombination losses13,14,15. When illuminated or operated at elevated temperatures, the weaker bonds within the perovskite readily dissociate, generating vacancies and interstitial defects that migrate towards the metal contacts, posing a significant challenge to device stability16,17. Typically, the suppression of ion migration relies on passivating undercoordinated sites within the perovskite lattice. Nonetheless, the ultimate barrier to prevent ion migration within a device often lies at the ESC interface. Fullerene-type materials such as carbon 60 (C60) are commonly used as the ESC, which tend to aggregate when operated at elevated temperatures18. Consequently, not only charge transport is hampered but also the ability of the ESC to block reactions between the metal electrode and the underlying perovskite layer is undermined, thereby compromising device durability16. Therefore, achieving an optimal interface contact requires (1) the passivation of surface defects and stabilization of surface structure in the perovskite, (2) favourable interface charge transport and (3) a compact and stable ESC that blocks ion mobility. By creating a superior upper interface, the operational stability of PSCs should be prolonged. To address these issues, we consider sodium heptafluorobutyrate (SHF), combining the perfluorous tail and carboxylate head, offering dual functionality as a candidate. SHF has the potential to form a robust hydrophobic barrier, simultaneously providing the effective passivation of surface defects. Using SHF, we present an advanced perovskite surface-to-ESC integrated interfacial engineering strategy. SHF increases the defect formation energy of the perovskite surface, stabilizing undercoordinated Pb(II) and eliminating the non-photoactive phase. Due to suitable dipole characteristics, SHF induces carrier redistribution and tunes the perovskite surface work function (WF) to enhance the open-circuit voltage. During ESC deposition, SHF causes C60 to stack in densely packed layers, which suppresses ion diffusion within the device. The resulting PSCs exhibit a record PCE of 27.02% (certified PCE being 26.96% with a stabilized PCE of 26.61%). Additionally, 1-cm2 devices show a PCE of up to 25.95%. In particular, the SHF-treated device retains its initial PCE (0% efficiency loss) after 1,200 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 1-sun illumination (International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability ISOS-L-1) and demonstrated over 92% retention when aged at ~85 °C (ISOS-D-2) over 1,800 h. The device cycled between −40 °C and 85 °C showed a retention of 94% of its initial PCE after 200 cycles (ISOS-T-3). To improve the surface electronic properties of perovskites in a targeted manner, we studied their defect characteristics through first-principles DFT calculations (Fig. We compared the defect formation energy (VPb and VI) on two types of perovskite surface termination (PbI and formamidinium iodide (FAI)), with the structure models shown in Supplementary Figs. The computation revealed that the formation energy of a Pb vacancy is smaller than that of an I vacancy for the PbI-terminated surface, with both being less than that for an FAI-terminated surface (Fig. This suggests that defects are more easily formed on a pure PbI-terminated surface compared with a pure FAI-terminated surface, corresponding to lower surface stability. In particular, to aid crystal growth and defect passivation, a lead(II) iodide (PbI2)-rich stoichiometry is often used in perovskite fabrication, which also generates a PbI-terminated surface19,20, probably undermining the operational stability of PSCs. a, Constructed SHF adsorption model on the perovskite structure. b, Defect formation energy of the perovskite surface with and without SHF adsorption. c, Planar Δρ for the PbI2-terminated surface of single SHF-adsorbed perovskite. d,e, KPFM maps of perovskites without (d) and with (e) SHF. f,g, Integrated GIWAXS patterns on (001) peaks of perovskites without (f) and with (g) SHF for incident angles from 0.05° to 1.0°. The SHF layer introduces a vacuum-level shift and enhances the electric field across C60, consistent with an increased built-in potential. WFb, bulk work function; WFs, surface work function; EF is the Fermi level energy; EC and EV are the conduction and valence band edges, respectively, and Evac is the vacuum energy level. SHF was used to functionalize the perovskite surface via a post-treatment strategy (Fig. DFT calculations show that in the surface adsorption system, the formation energy of vacancies on the PbI surface significantly increases (Fig. 1b), indicating that SHF plays a crucial role in enhancing the surface stability. Mulliken charge population calculations indicate that surface adsorption per SHF will result in 0.22 electron transfer to SHF (Fig. 1c), amplified on the SHF-stacking surface (Supplementary Figs. On interacting with the perovskite surface, Na+ introduces localized positive charges, whereas the COO− group generates localized negative charges. Due to their electrostatic interaction and the large size of perfluorocarboxylate anions, Na+ ions potentially remain at the perovskite surface beside the COO− groups21. This combination would establish an interfacial dipole pointing from SHF towards the perovskite. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) confirms that SHF alters the surface WF of the perovskite, validating the dipole effect. Figure 1d,e shows the potential distribution patterns of control and SHF-treated perovskite films. The average contact potential difference value increases from 0.43 to 0.68 eV after treating the perovskite with SHF (Supplementary Fig. This increase is consistent with the electrostatic potential and WF estimated from DFT (Supplementary Figs. We further reveal that the appropriate SHF coverage is a key factor in tuning the surface WF (Supplementary Fig. 1h,i and Supplementary Fig. To clarify the impact of SHF-induced dipoles under device-relevant conditions, we carried out drift-diffusion simulations on full device stacks (Fig. This originates from reduced energetic offsets at the perovskite–C60 interface, consistent with a larger built-in potential. The enhanced interfacial field is expected to promote charge extraction and increase the device's open-circuit voltage (VOC). To validate the role of molecular dipoles, control experiments were performed using sodium acetate (NaOAc; CH3COONa) under identical processing conditions. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 14, NaOAc treatment led to a minor change in the surface potential, in contrast to the pronounced shift observed with SHF. To understand the molecular origin of the observed dipole difference, we performed DFT calculations on SHF and NaOAc. The structures were optimized using the wB97XD functional and Def2TZVP basis set. The calculated dipole moment of SHF is 8.97 D, significantly larger than that of NaOAc (5.91 D; Supplementary Fig. The interaction between SHF and perovskite was further supported by Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectra and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra25,26 (Supplementary Figs. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to characterize the surface crystal structure of the perovskite films. At low incidence angles (<1.0°; Fig. 1f), a sharp peak at q ≈ 9.4 nm−1 is observed in the untreated film, indexed as the hexagonal polytype 4H (ref. In particular, SHF treatment eliminates the 4H phase (Fig. Additionally, a shift in the diffraction peak of the (001) crystal plane for the SHF-treated perovskite is observed, originating from the film surface (Fig. The shift decreases as the diffraction angle increases, indicative of a surface-specific interaction between SHF and the perovskite28 (Supplementary Fig. According to the Bragg equation, q = 4πsinθ/λ = 2π/d, where d is the Bragg spacing in scattering, a diffraction peak position shifting to higher angles corresponds to a contraction of the lattice29. This helps stabilize the perovskite surface structure due to the improved Goldschmidt tolerance factor30. Note that the interaction of SHF with the perovskite surface is further supported by X-ray diffraction (Supplementary Fig. We monitored the perovskite film morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The improved perovskite surface due to SHF treatment was confirmed by SEM and AFM images (Fig. 21 and 22), which facilitated a better interface contact with the ESC. Subsequently, the structural and optoelectronic properties of ESC as a function of the thickness of the C60 layer was studied31,32. The reduced slope variation indicates that the individual secondary electron cut-offs at different kinetic energies tend to align more consistently. This is attributed to the enhanced perovskite surface uniformity, which promoted more favourable C60 deposition. The valence band scans of the C60 layers indicate their contribution to the total spectrum (Supplementary Fig. The reduced interfacial energy barrier (Supplementary Figs. 24 and 25) would enhance the PSC performance, as we show below using drift-diffusion simulations. a, SEM image of SHF-treated perovskite films. b,c, Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy spectra of the cut-off region for C60 with different deposition thicknesses on the perovskite films without (b) and with (c) SHF treatment. d,e, AFM images of perovskite/C60 (d) and perovskite/SHF/C60 (10-nm C60 deposited; e). f,g, AFM images of perovskite/SHF (f) and perovskite/SHF/C60 (g) samples (the AFM scans were taken from different areas (f) with one-half of the sample covered during deposition and 2-nm C60 deposited only on the other half (g)). The stacking properties of the deposited C60 layer were progressively probed using AFM. At a 10 × 10 μm2 scale, 10-nm C60 deposited on the control film surface exhibited noticeable voids (Fig. By contrast, C60 on the SHF-treated perovskite surface formed a densely packed layer (Fig. This difference suggests that the SHF layer mediates C60 growth and provides a favourable interfacial contact between the perovskite and ESC. The SHF probably reduces the surface energy and allows C60 to form a more uniform layer. By contrast, when non-polar molecules such as C60 are deposited directly onto hydrophilic surfaces like perovskites, they tend to aggregate to minimize unfavourable surface interaction energy33,34. As the thickness decreases into 2-nm C60, the differences between control and treated surfaces became more apparent, probably due to the direct effect of the initially deposited thin C60 layer contacting with the underlying perovskite surface (Supplementary Fig. To gain deeper insights, the growth of a 2-nm C60 layer on SHF-treated perovskite surface was monitored at a 1 × 1 μm2 scale, with the perovskite film partially covered as a control (Fig. We observed that C60 tends to grow in island-like forms consisting of particle aggregates, showing an uneven structure (Fig. Interestingly, these islands are not isolated, but well interconnected, forming a cohesive layer. To provide insights into the changes in electronic states, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed, where an enhanced PL intensity indicates the decreased defect-induced non-radiative recombination9 (Fig. Additionally, we observed an improvement of over two times in the PL quantum yield after SHF treatment (Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating that SHF effectively enhanced passivation. After contacting the C60 layer, the SHF-treated stack (perovskite/SHF/C60) retained a higher PL quantum yield (nearly three times) compared with the control (perovskite/C60), demonstrating reduced interfacial losses and improved optoelectronic quality. a, Steady-state PL spectra for the untreated and SHF-treated perovskite films. b, trSPV charge dynamics at the perovskite–ESC interfaces. c, Schematic describing the charge separation mechanisms. d, PCE distribution of control and SHF-treated PSCs, collected from 20 independent devices per condition (n = 20). e,f, J–V curves of untreated and SHF-treated PSCs with working areas of 0.0982 cm2 (e) and 1 cm2 (f). To evaluate the charge transport properties in PSCs, transient surface photovoltage (trSPV) measurements were conducted, exciting the sample with a 5-ns laser pulse with a photon energy of 1.8 eV and fluences of 0.010 μJ cm−2, inducing a charge carrier density equivalent to 1 sun (refs. The trSPV signal amplitude is proportional to the concentration of electrons extracted to the ESC, expressed as SPV(t) ≈ ΔnESC(t), where t denotes time37. The untreated perovskite sample without an ESC exhibits a positive trSPV signal due to hole accumulation near the perovskite surface, which can potentially limit electron extraction (Fig. By contrast, the SHF layer in the treated perovskite induces a negative trSPV signal, highlighting a qualitative change in the charge separation behaviour, with electrons dominating near the ESC side (Fig. The effect of SHF on the indium tin oxide (ITO)/perovskite/C60 and ITO/perovskite/C60/bathocuproine (BCP) samples was further investigated (Fig. SHF treatment considerably increases the amplitude and rise speed, with the peak amplitude for perovskite/SHF/C60/BCP being about twice as large as the untreated sample. This increase demonstrates a substantial improvement in electron extraction. The rise in amplitude, particularly in the post-extraction region (1–100 μs), indicates that SHF helps to align the energy-level alignment and passivate the perovskite surface. Additionally, similar trSPV results were observed for the perovskite–ESC interface on quartz, with an even more pronounced boost in rise speed and amplitude due to SHF treatment (Supplementary Figs. Dark current and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further indicate better interfacial contact following SHF treatment, leading to superior charge transport (Supplementary Figs. PSCs were fabricated with a configuration comprising transparent conducting oxide substrate/self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) (4-(7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazol-7-yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (CbzNaph)/perovskite/C60/BCP/silver (Ag; Supplementary Fig. 3d) shows an overall higher PCE distribution for SHF-treated PSCs compared with control (untreated) PSCs. Statistics for VOC, short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) are presented in Supplementary Fig. 34, confirming the concentrated parameter distributions in PSCs, highlighting the effectiveness of SHF treatment on performance and reproducibility38. The champion control device exhibits a PCE of 24.81%, with a VOC of 1.161 eV and FF of 82.09% (Fig. In comparison, the SHF-treated PSCs show a champion PCE of 27.02%, along with an increased VOC of 1.197 eV and FF of 86.17% (Supplementary Fig. 35 and Supplementary Table 1), as well as reduced photocurrent–voltage (J–V) hysteresis39 (Supplementary Fig. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Supplementary Fig. Devices treated with NaOAc exhibited moderate performance improvements compared with the control but remained significantly inferior to SHF-treated devices (Supplementary Fig. The laboratory-tested champion device was evaluated at the Fujian Metrology Institute, an accredited independent PV calibration laboratory, for independent validation. The device achieved a certified PCE of 26.96% under an aperture area of 7.82 mm2, with a certified MPPT efficiency of 26.61% (Supplementary Figs. a, MPPT of encapsulated control and SHF-treated devices under simulated 1-sun illumination (ISOS-L-1I) in air (initial PCEs of 23.7% and 25.2%, respectively). b, Thermal stability of control and SHF-treated devices aged at 85 °C (ISOS-D-2I). Initial average PCEs of 24.1% and 25.9% (n = 3 independent devices per condition; error bars represent standard deviation). c, Thermal cycling stability of encapsulated devices aged between −40 °C and 85 °C (ISOS-T-3) (initial PCEs of 24.5% and 26.4%). d,e, ToF-SIMS ion species depth profiles of Ag− (Ag), \({{\rm{C}}}_{60}^{-}\) (C60), \({{\rm{PbI}}}_{2}^{-}\) (perovskite), I− (perovskite), \({{\rm{PO}}}_{2}^{-}\) (SAM), \({{\rm{InO}}}_{2}^{-}\) (ITO), \({{\rm{AgI}}}_{2}^{-}\) (AgI) and F− (SHF) of control (d) and SHF-treated (e) devices after thermal ageing. f,g, Ion diffusion schematics within control (f) and SHF-treated (g) devices. To gain further insights into the influence of SHF treatment on photovoltaic performance, the devices were simulated using Driftfusion42 (Supplementary Table 3). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 41, the simulation's parameters increased the steady-state VOC, FF and PCE by amounts comparable with those observed experimentally. In the control device, which has a smaller built-in potential, the direction of the electric field in the perovskite bulk reverses at a lower applied voltage. This has a negative impact on VOC and FF due to hole accumulation at the perovskite–C60 interface43 (Supplementary Fig. Conversely, when SHF is present, the resulting interfacial dipole improves the energetic alignment between the perovskite and C60, increasing the device's built-in potential. Consequently, there is less hole accumulation at the perovskite–C60 interface at a given applied voltage, resulting in higher VOC and FF (Supplementary Fig. To assess the effect of Fermi-level variation, we simulated energy band profiles by adjusting the Fermi levels of the perovskite and C60 layers (Supplementary Figs. The SHF-treated device demonstrated stable power output without PCE degradation after 1,200 h of continuous operation (Fig. In comparison, the control device decayed to ~60% of its initial value within only 800 h. The thermal stability of the devices was also assessed at 85 °C according to the ISOS-D-2I protocol (Fig. 4b), with the SHF-optimized device retaining 92% of its initial PCE after 1,800 h, whereas the control device degraded to approximately 52% of its initial PCE over the same period. Following the ISOS-T-3 protocol, devices were cycled between −40 °C and 85 °C. The SHF-treated device retained 94% of its initial PCE after 200 cycles, significantly outperforming the control device, which retained only 57% of its PCE (Fig. As expected, the fluorous chain in SHF provides a hydrophobic barrier (Supplementary Fig. 45), and hence, the stability of unencapsulated devices in a humid atmosphere was investigated (Supplementary Fig. To understand the mechanism behind the enhanced stability, the elemental distribution of aged devices was determined by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). 47a, in the control device, a substantial diffusion of I− ions towards the Ag electrode is observed, where they react to form AgI, with Ag+ ions concurrently diffusing into the perovskite layer. For the SHF-treated device, ion migration is considerably suppressed, with the amount of AgI detected being around two orders of magnitude lower than that in the control device (Fig. Since ion migration leads to perovskite decomposition45,46, their differences could be related to device stability. Indeed, the diffusion of I− ions through ESC to Ag electrode, where it reacts to form AgI, further accelerates the degradation process (Fig. Additionally, SHF inherently possesses high thermal stability, with an initial decomposition temperature reaching up to 260 °C (Supplementary Fig. Comparison with ToF-SIMS data from the pre-aged sample demonstrates that SHF maintains its stability over time, confirming its sustained effectiveness during device operation (Supplementary Fig. We report efficient and stable PSCs by anchoring a perfluorinated ionic barrier between the perovskite and ESC, which delivers PCEs of up to 27.02% and a certified PCE of 26.96% (certified MPPT PCE of 26.61%). SHF treatment increases the defect formation energy, eliminates non-photoactive phases and tunes the perovskite surface WF, effectively reducing the interfacial energetic offset between the perovskite and C60. The favourable surface structure provided by SHF also facilitates the growth of C60 layers, resulting in a denser ESC, which inhibits mobile ion shuttling within the device. Under accelerated ageing test conditions, the devices exhibit enhanced operational stability. These findings pave the way to the next generation of high-efficiency and high-stability perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. FAI (99.99%, trace elements basis), methylammonium iodide (99.99%, trace elements basis) and methylammonium chloride (99.99%, trace elements basis) were purchased from Dyenamo. PbI2 (99.99%, trace metals basis) was purchased from TCI. Self-assembly molecules of CbzNaph (>99%) were purchased from Luminescence Technology. Caesium iodide (99.999%, AB 109298) was purchased from abcr Gute Chemie and used without further purification. Phenethylammonium bromide was obtained from Greatcell Solar Materials. C60 (≥99.99%, OE) was provided by CreaPhys. BCP (99.8%) was acquired from Ossila. Ag shots (2–3 mm, 99.999%) were bought from Alfa Aesar. SHF (C4F7NaO2) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 (99.9 at.% D), N,N-dimethylformamide-d7 (≥99.5 at.% D), isopropyl alcohol, absolute ethanol and anhydrous chlorobenzene were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. The patterned ITO, fluorine-doped tin oxide and quartz as substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in this order for 15 min. The substrates were further exposed to ultraviolet–ozone for 30 min. The self-assembly molecule CbzNaph (0.3 mg ml−1) was dissolved in absolute ethanol and used as a hole-selective contact. The SAM solution was spin coated on the substrate at 3,000 rpm in a two-step process with 3-s acceleration and then kept for 30 s. Then, the substrate–SAM was transferred onto a hotplate and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min in a N2-filled glovebox. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1.55 M of Cs0.05FA0.9MA0.05PbI3 with 3% excess PbI2 in dimethylformamide/dimethyl sulfoxide with a volume ratio of 4:1. Then, 10 mg ml−1 of methylammonium chloride was added to the precursor solution to improve the film morphology. The mixture was stirred overnight and then filtered through a 0.22-µm polytetrafluoroethylene membrane before use. The precursor solution was spin coated at 1,000 rpm for 10 s, followed by 5,000 rpm for 40 s. In the last 5 s during the spin-coating procedure, 200 μl of chlorobenzene as the antisolvent was dropped onto the substrate. The precast films were then annealed at 100 °C for 30 min to obtain perovskite films. For initial surface passivation, 1 mg ml−1 of phenethylammonium bromide was subsequently used, dissolved in isopropyl alcohol/dimethyl sulfoxide (195:5, v/v), which was spin coated on the prepared perovskite films at 5,000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The fabricated perovskite encompassing two- and three-dimensional structures was used as a control. SHF was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (in varying concentrations of 1, 3 and 5 mM) and spin coated onto the film surface, under 3,000 rpm for 30 s at a ramp of 1,000 rpm s−1 and then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min. The samples were then transferred into a thermal evaporator, where 23-nm C60, 7-nm BCP and 100-nm Ag layers were thermally deposited in a sequential manner, where C60 and BCP were evaporated by temperature control and the Ag electrode was evaporated by power control. The evaporation was carried out under a vacuum pressure of around 1.0 × 10−6 mbar at an initial deposition rate of 0.1 nm s−1. For stability tests, 20 nm of SnO2 was deposited as a barrier layer by thermal atomic layer deposition. The device area was determined by a shadow mask during metal evaporation. The active areas of the laboratory-test solar cells are 0.0982 cm2 and 1 cm2, and the aperture area for certification is 0.0782 cm2. X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded using a PANalytical X'Pert Pro X-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5419 Å). Field-emission SEM images were obtained on a SEM SUPRA 40 electron microscope. Fourier transform infrared spectra were recorded on a JASCO 4100 spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was conducted on a Shimadzu AXIS SUPRA+ instrument. Water contact angles of the perovskite films were measured using a JC000DI optical contact-measuring system. Solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were acquired on Bruker Topspin v. 2.1 (AV400) and v. 3.0 (AV500). PL was measured on a laboratory-built PL setup, installed with a reflectance probe and a fibre-optic spectrometer from Ocean Insight, using LabVIEW software. AFM was performed on an NX10 system, Park Systems (XE-70). The AFM was kept in a glovebox with a N2 atmosphere. KPFM measurements were performed on Bruker MultiMode with NanoScope 9.1, Gwyddion, following the lift-mode amplitude-modulated KPFM in a N2 atmosphere in the dark using the following settings: f0 = 300 kHz, k = 40 N m−1 and L = 125 mm (Bruker RTESP-300). Kelvin probe was carried out for WF analysis using a Kelvin probe setup with a vibrating gold mesh driven by a piezoelectric 26 crystal (Kelvin probe S and CPD controller from Besocke Delta Phi). Photoemission spectra were recorded using a hemispherical electron analyser (SPECS Phoibos 100) in an ultrahigh-vacuum system equipped with a monochromated He I (hν = 21.218 eV) source for ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and a standard Mg Kα (hν = 1,253.6 eV; anode power, 30 W) X-ray source for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The base pressure of the analysis chamber was maintained at 1 × 10−9 mbar. All spectra were recorded at room temperature and under normal emission to the sample. For measuring the secondary electron cut-off, a sample bias of −10 V was used to overcome the analyser WF. A Solux MR16 4700K white halogen lamp (intensity equivalent to 150 mW cm−2) was used to examine any light-induced energy-level changes at the interfaces. The J–V data were recorded under 1-sun-equivalent illumination using a wavelabs SINUS-70 LED class AAA solar simulator in a N2-filled glovebox. The light intensity was calibrated with a filtered KG3 silicon reference cell from the Fraunhofer-Institut für Solare Energiesysteme ISE. J–V scans were performed with a Keithley 2400 source measure unit, controlled by a measurement program written in LabVIEW. The stabilized power outputs under the maximum power points were tracked under illumination, and the PSCs were biased at the voltage at the maximum power point. Thermal cycling tests were conducted with a 10-min dwell and a ramp rate of 100 °C h−1. The EQE spectra were measured for PSCs, where fluorine-doped tin oxide was used in the devices. The EQE was obtained on an Oriel Instruments QEPVSI-b system integrated with a Newport 300-W xenon arc lamp, which was controlled using TracQ-Basic software. The system was equipped with a chopper and monochromatic light of Newport Cornerstone 260 for filtering the white light. The EQE setup was calibrated through a standard silicon photodetector before measurements.
