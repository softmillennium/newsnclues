                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Luisa Stefani cold-called Timea Babos for a one-off pairing in Linz, neither imagined it would spark a title-chasing season -- and bring the three-time champion back where she once ruled. This week the question was posed to a number of people in and around the game -- and many came up empty. But, after losing in the WTA Finals twice in the past three years, she has only a single title, with Barbora Krejcikova three years ago in Guadalajara. Other prominent vote-getters: Iga Swiatek (2023) and last year's singles winner, Coco Gauff, are proud owners of one title at the year-end championships. This is Elise Mertens' seventh trip to the WTA Finals (with her fifth doubles partner), but she, too, has only one title, captured three years ago in Fort Worth with Veronika Kudermetova. Indeed, Hungary's Timea Babos won three straight titles from 2017-19, twice with Kristina Mladenovic and once with Andrea Sestini Hlavackova. Going back to 2015, she qualified five consecutive times. “Of course I knew that,” Babos said. After an absence of six years, at the age of 32, she's back at the year-end championships. “Doubles is about partnerships,” Babos said, “and I needed a very good partner. But I needed Luisa to be here again.” After an absence of six years, at the age of 32, Babos is back at the year-end championships -- with a chance to make it four year-end titles. The origin story for Babos and Stefani, like so many others in doubles, has a distinctly random vibe. She began the season with Nicole Melichar-Martinez, and the pair went 5-3 in their first three tournaments. “I had a tough end of the 2024 season [knee surgery], so I was looking to get more matches and get my rhythm back. I went to play Linz [Austria] with Ingrid [Martins], a good friend of mine, also from Brazil, but the cut was so high, we didn't get in. “I saw Timmy was on the list as well, playing with a singles player [Lulu Sun], so I called her. I was like, `Hey, Timmy, this is Luisa. Like I'm here, the cut is really strong. Do you want to play together so we can both get in?' Babos was at home in Hungary, about a two-hour drive from Linz. When they entered the WTA 500 tournament, Babos was ranked No. Babos moved up 36 spots in the rankings, and a partnership was born. They went on to win three more titles, at the WTA 500 Strasbourg and Tokyo as well as Sao Paulo, where Stefani was born. They reached the final in Ningbo, locking down their berths in Riyadh, and the Tokyo win punctuated their regular season. “It was very tough but fun and good at the same time.” Added Stefani, “I like her competitive spirit, her passion -- the way she brings it on the court and backs herself up. “… Basically,” Babos interjected, “I'm nuts a bit.” The last one was handed to her by Martina Navratilova, whose name -- thanks to a record 13 WTA Finals doubles titles -- is on the trophy. Honesty, both players insisted, was the key to their burgeoning relationship. “In the beginning, when we didn't know each other you're trying to be too nice, go around certain things,” Babos said. She stays on the forehand side, which obviously I need. Her skills on the net are very unique. When Luisa Stefani cold-called Timea Babos for a one-off pairing in Linz, neither imagined it would spark a title-chasing season -- and bring the three-time champion back where she once ruled.</p>

"I'm going to go out there and show the world that as good as she is, she's got some weaknesses. Kyrgios, who has played only six tour-level matches in the last three years because of wrist and knee injuries, said he'd be hitting toward a smaller side of the court—almost 10 percent smaller than what Sabalenka will be aiming at—giving him less room to hit winners.Both players are set to feature earlier in an exhibition in New York on Dec. 8 but not against each other: Sabalenka will play Naomi Osaka and Kyrgios will face Tommy Paul.Read More: Carlos Alcaraz adds $1 million Australian Open ‘one point' challenge to packed scheduleKyrgios said he'd be giving Sabalenka full respect. "Obviously you've got one potentially, I think, one of the greatest of all time women's players and she's not even almost close to scratching the surface of what she can achieve," he told AAP. "I think she wins multiple more Grand Slams. "She's honestly been talking a little bit more about this match than I have, but I'm ready to take the challenge. I'm going to go out there and, in all honesty, it's a lot of pressure for me too."

Having said all that, and acknowledging Sabalenka would have most of the crowd on her side, Kyrgios did refer to a career CV which places him in a rare group of players to have beaten all of the so-called Big Four: Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Andy Murray. He was only the second player to win his first meeting with Nadal (2014 Wimbledon), Federer (2015 Madrid) and Djokovic (2017 Acapulco)"Look, I'm very confident," he said. 652 because of his long time on the sidelines, the 30-year-old Australian was confident he'd be fit enough to play well in a month. 652 because of his long time on the sidelines, the 30-year-old Australian was confident he'd be fit enough to play well in a month. 652 because of his long time on the sidelines, the 30-year-old Australian was confident he'd be fit enough to play well in a month. 652 because of his long time on the sidelines, the 30-year-old Australian was confident he'd be fit enough to play well in a month.</p>

The two last squared off representing their respective countries in the Billie Jean King Cup in September—but it's been more than two years since their last WTA Tour meeting. The year-end No.1 has been untouchable in Riyadh, cruising through group play. She lost her opener to Rybakina and needed to claw back from a set down against Madison Keys before duplicating the feat in a win-or-go-home thriller against Iga Swiatek to make the semifinals in her first Finals.The two are getting used to seeing the other in pressure-packed showdowns, having faced off in each of the last three Grand Slams. Sabalenka scored bookend wins at Roland Garros and the US Open final, with an Anisimova victory in the Wimbledon semis sandwiched in between.Their rivalry has been a running story through the season—and it won't be complete without one more blockbuster sequel.

From then on, the 38-year-old didn't look back and secured 7-6 (1), 6-4 victory in one hour and 43 minutes with a powerful forehand winner down the line.“Kalispéra,” Djokovic greeted the spectators in Greek at the start of his on-court interview before reacting to his latest encounter.“It was a very physical battle. I was a bit surprised with how good he played. I think we went toe to toe, most of the match,” said Djokovic, who won 88 percent of his first-service points to become the first active player on the ATP Tour to record 200 indoor wins.“Just a few points decided the winner tonight and he deserves a round of applause for his performance.
