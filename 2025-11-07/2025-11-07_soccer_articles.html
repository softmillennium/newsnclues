                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Born in Berwyn, Illinois, to Mexican parents, Gutiérrez grew up within the U.S. soccer system and even featured for the U.S. youth national teams. Gutiérrez made his senior national team debut for the USMNT in January 2025 during an international friendly camp and earned his first two caps in matches against Venezuela and Costa Rica. Gutiérrez enjoyed a breakout 2025 campaign for the Fire, playing 35 matches across all competitions and logging 2,381 minutes. He talled nine goals and six assists in 29 league appearances. His performances made him one of the most productive and creative midfielders in the league, showcasing his vision, technical skill, and versatility in attack. Since making his professional debut as a teenager, Gutiérrez has appeared in 164 matches for the Fire, contributing 21 goals and 25 assists in more than 10,000 minutes of play. His consistency and growth have positioned him as a rising figure among MLS-based dual nationals now catching Mexico's attention. Gutiérrez's decision mirrors that of Obed Vargas, the Seattle Sounders midfielder born in Alaska who recently committed to playing for Mexico. As the Mexican Football Federation continues to expand its scouting network across the United States, players like Gutiérrez represent the new wave of binational talent strengthening El Tri's pool ahead of future international tournaments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea legend Frank Lampard was visibly taken aback when a journalist praised him for the work he is doing at Premier League-chasing Coventry City. When former Manchester City man Lampard was sworn in at Coventry nearly a year ago, he had a point to prove. Not only because his last managerial stint as Chelsea's caretaker manager was a disaster but his predecessor, Mark Robins, was a very popular figure at Coventry Building Society Arena, having earned them two promotions from League Two, guided them to EFL Trophy success, and led them to an FA Cup semi-final and a Championship play-off final. Now that they are top of the Championship under Lampard, talkSPORT reporter and Coventry fan Anil Kandola took the time to express his gratitude to the ex-Chelsea midfielder. Kandola told Lampard - who nearly led Derby County to the Premier League in 2019, only to lose in the final to Aston Villa - that the impact he has had on Coventry is like nothing he has ever seen before. So obviously you won't know, but I'm actually from Coventry, so I can see probably a lot more than you do in terms of the impact it has in the pubs and the bars everywhere across this city. The impact you've had on this team Frank is something I've never seen before. Mark Robins, he was so loved before you came in here, and there was a real hesitation, not just from you, your perspective, but just in general, can they really ignite that passion and the love for the game? Coventry are top of the Championship with 31 points after 14 games. They hold a four-point lead over second-placed Stoke City and have lost just once this season. Lampard has got Sky Blues fans dreaming of returning to the Premier League for the first time since 2001, and it seems he believes as well. I know we've got some results and we're in a better position now, and I realise that fans are happy with that. So when you say that and it feels as big as that, then I really appreciate it and I'll keep trying to keep you happy and try to do the right thing." Coventry, who made it to the Championship play-offs last season before losing to eventual winners Sunderland in the semi-finals, face, arguably, their biggest test of the season when they travel to second-placed Stoke on Saturday in a top-of-the-table clash. If they did that, it would be a remarkable turnaround from being in League Two just seven years ago. However, there is still a very long way to go.</p>

Nuno Mendes will miss Portugal's final two World Cup qualifiers, national coach Roberto Martinez said Friday but his Paris Saint-Germain teammate Joao Neves is expected to return.

"There's no player who can replace Nuno Mendes. He's probably the best in the world right now," Spaniard Martinez told a press conference.

Full-back Mendes is suffering from a sprained left knee and will be out for "the next few weeks", PSG said on Wednesday.

Martinez called up Carlos Forbs for the first time after the Club Brugge winger tormented Barcelona in the Champions League, scoring twice and setting up another goal in the 3-3 draw in midweek.

Joao Neves is back after recovering from injury while captain Cristiano Ronaldo will look to add to his team-leading five goals in the qualifying campaign.

Ronaldo continues to be "an example for the group with his more than 200 caps", said Martinez.

Portugal will play in Ireland on November 13 and then host Armenia on November 16 in Porto.

A victory in Dublin would secure qualification for the Portuguese, who are top of Group F, to next year's World Cup in North America.

Squad:

Goalkeepers: Diogo Costa (Porto), Jose Sa (Wolves/ENG), Rui Silva (Sporting Lisbon)

Defenders: Diogo Dalot (Manchester United/ENG), Nelson Semedo (Fenerbahce/TUR), Joao Cancelo (Al Hilal/KSA), Matheus Nunes (Manchester City/ENG), Ruben Dias (Manchester City/ENG), Goncalo Inacio (Sporting Lisbon), Antonio Silva (Benfica), Renato Veiga (Villarreal/ESP)

Midfielders: Joao Palhinha (Tottenham/ENG), Ruben Neves (Al-Hilal/KSA), Joao Neves (PSG/FRA), Vitinha (PSG/FRA), Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United/ENG), Bernardo Silva (Manchester City/ENG)

Forwards: Pedro Goncalves (Sporting Lisbon), Joao Felix (Al Nassr/KSA), Francisco Trincao (Sporting Lisbon), Francisco Conceicao (Juventus/ITA), Rafael Leao (AC Milan/ITA), Pedro Neto (Chelsea/ENG), Carlos Forbs (Club Brugge/BEL), Goncalo Ramos (PSG/FRA), Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr/KSA)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even though he hasn't played much for his club team, Gio Reyna has been called into USMNT camp. He has played only 132 minutes for Borussia Moenchengladbach this Bundesliga season. Yet, he has been called into the U.S. men's national team's camp for a pair of November friendlies. A series of injuries have stifled Reyna from showing off his skills on a regular basis in recent years. But here he is, ready to play for the USA against Paraguay in Chester, Pa. on Nov. 15 and then against Uruguay in Tampa on Nov. 18. USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino explained why he decided to call in Reyna, who turns 23 on Nov. 13. During a Thursday Zoom press conference, Pochettino said that Reyna “has enormous talent and it's true that it's not playing too much, but I think it's a good opportunity in November, because after March we are not going to be together again. It should be noted that Pochettino has gone against his philosophy of rewarding players who are playing well for their club teams. “There's no doubt that he's a special player. That is why we need to be open, and to provide” him with a chance that “can be a boost of motivation, for him to be with us.” If any player to be called into a national team to need motivation play for such squad, that player faces more serious problems. Pochettino said he wanted to give Reyna “the belief that he can compete for a place in the World Cup.” It definitely sounded contradictory to Pochettino's philosophy of playing well for one's club to earn a national team invite. “I think we need to understand that sometimes, some players struggle to play, but can be important for us.” Front Row Soccer editor Michael Lewis has covered 13 World Cups (eight men, five women), seven Olympics and 28 MLS Cups.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Don't ask Carolyn Tisch Blodgett where to eat in New York. Instead, the Gotham FC governor and lead owner mostly eats stadium food. “I really never go out to dinner,” she tells The Athletic. “I mostly just eat stadium food because stadiums are so much a part of my life and my identity.” Tisch Blodgett, her three children and her extended family enjoy the concessions that the Sports Illustrated Stadium hospitality section offers, a tradition that started almost 30 years ago. As a kid, Tisch Blodgett spent Sundays at New York Giants' NFL games with her grandfather, Bob Tisch, the co-founder of Loews Corporation, who became co-owner in 1991. Her weekend started on Saturday, when she baked a Giant-themed cake. On Sunday mornings, she would wake up early, get dressed to the nines (Mr Tisch expected everyone to dress professionally; he said they all represented the team), and haul her cakes to the family's box at MetLife Stadium. “I was always with my grandfather and he saw a lot of himself in me,” she says. “I was passionate about football, but I really was more passionate about what football did to a community, how a team would bring people together through thick and thin.” Her love for the sport and the community even prompted her to attend Yale in New Haven, Conn., so she could drive home on weekends and be with her family during the NFL season. When her grandfather was in the hospital because of a brain tumor, she'd ask her mother, Laurie Tisch, to buy the New York Times and read the sports pages to him, knowing that it would light him up. “She always had a great interest in sports,” Laurie Tisch told The Athletic. It was the origin story of a hospitality-obsessed operator who grew up understanding game day as a ritual, responsibility, and business. Before launching Next 3 in 2020, she spent over a decade working in marketing for some of the top companies in the world, most recently serving as the head of global marketing at Peloton. Forbes valued the club at $110 million in 2025. “Sports are part of my identity,” she says. I want to build that in Gotham.” When the family closed the deal, the confetti had barely been swept off after Gotham's worst-to-first title run at Snapdragon Stadium in San Diego when they hoisted their first NWSL Championship trophy. There should have been a massive celebration for the underdog champions, but no flights had even been booked for the team to return home. “There was very little infrastructure at the club,” Tisch Blodgett explained. Year two has been an experiment on steroids to build a world-class club. One of the first things she worked to do when she came on board was to build trust. She asked for the phone numbers of every player and called each one. “This is how I'll lead,” she told them. She now meets regularly with the leadership council and has upgraded medical support and mental health resources. “This team deserves to play in front of 25,000 fans and to have every single person you know screaming their name,” she says. One of Tisch Blodgett's main goals is to ensure her team plays in front of sellout crowds as a standard, not an occasion. This past regular season, Gotham averaged 8,892 fans, a 41 percent improvement from 2023. Gotham was one of the four NWSL teams that had seen a rise in attendance this season. Last season, Gotham broke a club record during their playoff quarterfinal game, with 15,540 people attending — small but steady steps towards opening the second ring of Sports Illustrated more often. Still, Gotham plays across the river from New York City, in Harrison, NJ, and Sunday travel is painful. It would be much easier if there were. We need to keep experimenting and see what works,” she says. The club has built a matchday atmosphere that works just as well for parents wrangling toddlers as it does for groups of friends looking for a full-day outing. From pregame fan fests — complete with face painting for kids and a pride game drag brunch— to lively halftime activations and an open invitation to “spend your afternoon” at the stadium. That's not because the club sells more advertising space on jerseys; it's because the assets connect a brand to a mission and then prove it with data. Dove came on to be part of the “Keep Her in the Game” campaign, Gotham's youth initiative aimed at the cliff where girls drop out of sports — especially around age 14. Additionally, Gruns, LaCroix, Align, Tylenol, RWJBarnabas Health, Flamingo and Lendistry came as sponsors since 2023. “We're trying to become the first global women's sports brand,” Tisch Blodgett says. That's why she put together a team in the front office, led by former NWSL midfielder, now general manager, Yael Averbuch West. But sustainability has to come,” she says. That's why she spends so much time on league work. The mantra at Gotham is “always building, never finished,” she says. Players joke that, once in a while, “finished” might be nice. Before the NWSL, women's professional soccer in the U.S. lived through a series of ambitious experiments and abrupt endings. Despite its promise, the league folded two years later. A second chapter arrived in 2007 with Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), which carried the torch until financial instability and internal disputes brought it down by 2012. As the league grew, so did its valuations and ambitions. Tisch Blodgett has grand plans for Gotham, but those do not involve building their own stadium, which has been the latest trend in the NWSL. Kansas City has a new home in CPKC Stadium, and 2026 expansion teams Denver Summit and Boston Legacy are following suit. At the last regular-season home game, Tisch Blodgett spoke about how the new naming sponsor (Sports Illustrated) helped fans feel more at home on game day than before, when it was called Red Bull Arena, which Gotham shares with MLS' New York Red Bull franchise. “Facilities are part of it,” she says. “But before we dream about 25,000 seats, we have to make sure the top deck is always open because demand warrants it. There are steps between here and a ribbon cutting.” Game day for Tisch Blodgett is a ritual. She wears one of “many, many” blue suits in Gotham teal that are not Giants blue, and still laughs about her vegetarian childhood order at the stadium: a hot-dog bun with ketchup and sauerkraut. No, that is not a food group. The family piece is genuine, not a marketing ploy. The cousins' text thread lights up on game days. Nine-year-old Carolyn looked around Giants Stadium and saw a knitted community in every home game, rain or shine. Forty-year-old Carolyn looks around Sports Illustrated and sees the same thing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Super Eagles of Nigeria squad The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has rejected the decision by the Federation of International Football Associations (FIFA) to appoint South African referee Tom Agbongila for their World Cup play-off match against Gabon. In the list of officials for the game scheduled for November 13, 2025, FIFA announced that the 33-year-old Agbongila will be assisted by Angola's Santos Doz (Assistant Referee 1) and fellow South African Thusi Granville (Assistant Referee 2). The referee assessor is Adjovi Hugues-Alain from Benin Republic, while Prince Kai of Sierra Leone will serve as Match Commissioner. Messi replies Cristiano Ronaldo over controversial World Cup comment However, an official who spoke to Nigerian media outlet The Guardian on condition of anonymity stated that the NFF believes the referee selection is a deliberate attempt to sabotage Nigeria's World Cup qualification hopes. “It is as if someone at FIFA is plotting to ensure Nigeria does not qualify for the World Cup. FIFA allowed South Africa to play all but their matches against Nigeria and Benin Republic on home soil, giving them an undue advantage over us. “Now, they want to complete the job by appointing South Africans for a match as important as our World Cup play-off against Gabon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tuchel picks his latest England squad, Barton found guilty at Liverpool Crown Court, Edwards edging towards Wolves job, Osmajic handed nine-match ban, Premier League news and more … Bournemouth's Alex Scott received his first call-up to the senior squad, while Ollie Watkins and Morgan Gibbs-White were among the notable absentees. Thomas Tuchel also told reporters he would be open to extending his contract as England head coach beyond next summer's World Cup. A jury at Liverpool Crown Court has found Joey Barton guilty of sending six “grossly offensive” X posts aimed at the broadcaster Jeremy Vine and former footballers-turned-pundits Eni Aluko and Lucy Ward. Barton is due to be sentenced on 8 December. Morgan Rogers has joined his Aston Villa teammates Matty Cash and John McGinn in signing a new and improved deal with the club. The Middlesbrough manager Rob Edwards was absent from training this morning and is believed to be in talks with Wolves about taking their vacant head coach's position, despite Boro rejecting an approach for his services from the Premier League strugglers. Gary O'Neil, who pulled out of advanced talks regarding a return to Wolves earlier this week, is reported to be in discussion with Southampton over replacing Will Still as their head coach. Thomas Frank says Tottenham are doing everything they can to support Destiny Udogie after a “terrible situation” in which he was allegedly threatened with a gun in north London two months ago. Big interview: Coventry's manager on rejuvenating the Championship leaders, coaching highs and lows, and why the ‘golden generation' debate is overplayed. Joey Barton, the former footballer, has been found guilty of six counts of sending “grossly offensive” social media posts aimed at the television pundits and former footballers Lucy Ward and Eni Aluko, and the broadcaster Jeremy Vine. A jury at Liverpool crown court found Barton, 43, had “crossed the line between free speech and a crime” with six posts he made on X, formerly Twitter. He was cleared of six other counts that he sent a grossly offensive electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety between January and March 2024. Preston North End: The Championship club have issued a statement condemning the nine-match ban and £21,000 fine handed down to their striker Milutin Osmajić by the Football Association after allegations that the Monetengran had racially abused Burnley's Hannibal Mejbri during a league fixture in February were found proven. Burnley's manager, Scott Parker, fully supported Mejbri and left him out of a subsequent FA Cup tie between the two teams a fortnight later to protect him from any fallout. Parker also supported his players' collective decision not to shake hands with Osmajic before the fifth round game, a call supported by the FA investigation. “We are extremely disappointed at the decision made by an independent regulatory commission to sanction Milutin Osmajić and impose a nine-match suspension, following an incident which took place in a league fixture against Burnley on 15th February 2025,” said Preston's statement. “We note that the outcome was determined on the ‘Balance of Probabilities' rather than one that is ‘Beyond Reasonable Doubt'. We also note that the FA determined that this decision offers no moral judgement, was not premeditated nor any comment about his general character. “Milutin has always pleaded his innocence of the charge and continues to do so. We continue to be fully supportive of our player. Osmajić, who last year served an eight-match ban for biting Blackburn's Owen Beck, will begin his ban immediately and must also under go a mandatory education course. Aston Villa: Big boost for the club: Morgan Rogers has agreed a new long-term contract with Aston Villa. The England international, who was already contracted until 2030, is expected to extend his stay for a further 12 months while also bringing him in line with the highest-paid Villa players. This week Villa captain John McGinn joined Matty Cash in committing his future to the club. Brentford: Keith Andrews side welcome a Newcastle side whose Premier League form has been up and down like a yo-yo to the Getech Community Stadium on Sunday and in the build-up to what could be an intriguing match, the Dubliner has been talking about the non-return of Yoane Wissa, the former Bees striker who spat the dummy and demanded a move to Newqcastle during the summer but has yet to play under Eddie Howe because he's sidelined with a knee injury. “Wissa is a very good player, so I am not too displeased that he is not going to be available because it's the nature of competing against teams,” he said. I think the nature of that deal in particular - there was a lot made around certain aspects of it. Brighton: Fabian Hurzeler's side travel to Selhurst Park for a Premier League needle match between two clubs whose fans can't stand each other despite most people who live outside their bubble having no real idea why. “I understood from the first second,” he said. Brighton will travel to London without James Milner, Brajan Gruda and Jack Hinshelwood, who are all injured. Joel Veltman is available for selection after recovering from a calf-injury, while Kaoru Mitoma is rated at no better than 50-50 as he continues his revoery from an ankle issue. Southampton: Already one of the hardest working men in football journalism, Ben Fisher has been busier than several hives full of bees today. Not content with bringing us the latest updates on Wolves' hitching their skirts in the direction of Boro coach Rob Edwards, Ben has news of Gary O'Neil, who turned down a return to Molineux earlier this week and now looks like he might be off to the south coast instead. Southampton have sounded out Gary O'Neil for their managerial vacancy and the former Wolves head coach is thought to have held preliminary talks about succeeding Will Still at St Mary's, he writes. Still was sacked after two league wins in 13 matches with Saints hovering above the relegation zone. He faced a supporter backlash and is also thought to have had reservations about the club's working structure. O'Neil, who was sacked last December, is still being paid by Wolves under the terms of his severance package. Wolves's Supporters' Trust said O'Neil's return would evidence “a clear lack of strategic direction” by the Molineux club. Wolves have switched focus to Middlesbrough's Rob Edwards, whose future is shrouded in doubt before Boro's home meeting with Birmingham on Saturday. Wolves: Rob Edwards did not take Middlesbrough training this morning, leaving his future in serious doubt amid continued interest from Wolves. Boro swiftly rejected an official approach from the Premier League club for their head coach on Thursday but 24 hours later uncertainty remains in regards to the situation. Fulham: A former Everton manager who worked for the club between May 2018 and December 2019, Marco Silva takes Fulham to play their first match at hill dickenson Stadium tomorrow afternoon. Asked how it felt to be returning to face his former club, the Portuguese said he was looking forward to a pleasant afternoon catching up with familiar faces in an unfamiliar stadium. And what I expect is always the same that I got the other times before, to have some good conversation before and after the match with people that I know very, very well, and people that welcome us always very well in that football club. They are pleased with the place where they are playing right now and it's going to be the first time, first experience for us in that stadium. “But you can feel it, you can see it, that it's been very, very good for them in that aspect, and we are going to embrace the challenge of playing there against a good side. Everton go into tomrrow's game having won just one of their past seven matches in the top flight, while Fulham arrive on the back of an emphatic victory over Wolves that ended a run of four consecutive league defeats. Tottenham Hotspur: Thomas Frank says Tottenham are doing everything they can to support Destiny Udogie after a “terrible situation” in which he was allegedly threatened with a gun in north London. A 31-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of firearms with intent, blackmail and driving without a licence following the incident. He has been bailed while inquiries continue, the force said. “It is a terrible situation to have been in and I can't speak too much about it as it's a legal case, as we know, but the club and we have done everything we can to support him,” he said. “We'll do that and he's clearly doing well on the pitch, which is good and we'll keep supporting him.” On 6 September at 11.14pm, police were called following reports a man in his 20s had been threatened with a gun in Cockfosters Parade, Barnet. “Officers spoke to the victim and during the course of their investigation, it was also a reported another man in his 20s had also allegedly been blackmailed and threatened by the same individual,” said a police statement. A 31-year-old man was arrested on Monday, 8 September on suspicion of possession of firearms with intent, blackmail and driving without a licence. Sunderland: Regis Le Bris has reported no fresh injury concerns ahead of tomorrow's match against Arsenal at the Stadium of Light but told reporters that centre-back Omar Alderete will miss the game due to concussion protocols after suffering a concussion during Sunderland's win over Wolves a fortnight ago. Reports from Paraguay suggest Alderete will also miss out on his nation's upcoming friendlies against the USA and Mexico, even if Regis seems oblivious to the speculation. “Probably he will get some minutes with his national team progressively and get ready for Sunderland against Fulham,” said the Frenchman. Manchester City: Pep Guardiola has said Rodri is unlikely to be risked in Sunday's Premier League clash with Liverpool. The Ballon d'Or-winning midfielder missed the midweek Champions League defeat of Borussia Dortmund after suffering another injury setback after starting just six games this season and the Spain international is still working his way back to full fitness following the knee surgery that ruled him out of most of the last campaign. You have to find the moment when you feel strong, you feel fit and can sustain the actions of the games that are so demanding, sustain it proper. We are still playing without the Ballon d'Or winner, a massively important player for us. We are desperate to have him back but Nico [Gonzalez] right now is becoming a really important player.” Rodri had missed four games with a hamstrong problem before returning as a late substitute in the victory over Bournemouth last Sunday. City's first game after the international break is against Newcastle at St James' Park on 22 November and Rodri has not been picked for the Spain squad to face Georgia and Turkey in the interim. Aston Villa: Ollie Watkins has just one goal to his name in 15 appearances for Aston Villa so far this season, a poor run of form that appears to have cost him his place in the England squad announced by Thomas Tuchel this morning. It is a subject that was raised with Unai Emery ahead of Villa's match against Bournemouth on Sunday and Emery said he was unconcerned by his striker's lack of goals. He has to focus with us again recover his good form, get confident. From when I have arrived here, you've shown me your capacity to be resilient in all the moments we need to get fighting like you are and now I know you are going to recover and get your performance through being consistent and through fighting as you did and through focusing with us'.” Speaking of his decision to drop Watkins from the England squad for the looming international break, Thomas Tuchel said: “We understood and could observe it when we watch Ollie that he is playing through discomfort, so it didn't make sense to bring him into camp. Newcastle United: Eddie Howe will mark his fourth anniversary as Newcastle United manager tomorrow and could celebrate the occasion with his 100th win in charge of the club. Newcastle travel to play Brentford on Sunday but if they are to win at the Gtech Community Stadium, they may have to do so without Anthony Gordon, who was forced off at half-time in Newcastle's win over Athletic Club on Wednesday night. “We don't think it's a serious injury,” said Howe. There's every chance he might miss out on Sunday but we'll give him every opportunity to be fit.” William Osula will also miss out on Sunday's match with an ankle injury which Howe says could rule the striker out for “a matter of weeks, not any longer.” On the subject of Yoane Wissa, who Newcastle signed from Brentford during the summer but have yet to see in action because he was injured on international duty before he made his debut for his new club, Howe had this to say: “Yoane is working well. The knee is feeling good and there's no problems with that. It's more a case of looking at his fitness, sharpness, all the things he's going to need to put together. “He's in a good place to kick on and push his body. Thomas Tuchel is open to extending his stay as England manager beyond next summer's World Cup, contrary to expectations that he would move on and vacate his position regardless of how England fared in the tournament. Tuchel's deal with the Football Association takes the former Chelsea boss through to the end of next year's World Cup, which England have qualified for with two games to spare. “I open up the possibility,” Tuchel he told BBC Radio 5 Live. [The job is] not more fun than I thought. “I didn't know exactly what was coming. Yes, still, but it is very exciting so far to be close to this group of players and to shape this group of players, and of course, lead the group into a World Cup, so the best is yet to come. “I was the one pleading for a short-term contract,” he said. “I was the one to say ‘let's streamline it, let's make it straightforward and let's make this contract until the World Cup', so I don't lose focus and we all don't lose focus and we get used to each other. It's not the time for reflection, even if you try to talk me into this, because the third camp in a short notice is coming and this is where the focus is.” Tuchel is over halfway through his contract as he and his players prepares to complete the formalities of their World Cup qualification fixtures with a Wembley clash against Serbia and a trip to Albania in the upcoming international break. Tottenham Hotspur: Considering Spurs have won five and drawn two of their last seven games against tomorrow's visitors, it's probably fair to say the “Lads, it's Tottenham” era is well and truly over for Manchester United. The sides meet in north London tomorrow afternoon and Thomas Frank has let it be known that his winger Mohammed Kudus is only “touch and go for tomorrow” after missing his team's midweek win over Copenhagen in the Champions League. Lucas Bergvall will also miss out with a concussion, while Atchie Gray, Yves Bissouma, Radu Dragusin, Ben Davies, Dominic Solanke, James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski are also numbered among his team's long- and short-term lame and halt. Speaking of Solanke, who has been absent since August after undergoing surgery on an ankle injury, Frank had this to say: “I think the international break will be the big decider and we have two weeks to push him for the next steps. After is what we're aiming for and you always want to get it right.” Manchester City: Of course, the part of their job that all football managers enjoy the most is undertaking their obligations to deal with journalists before and after games and as he approaches his 1,000th game in charge, Pep jokes that he is no exception. Manchester City: Eighteen years after he managed Barcelona B for the first time in a match against Premia in the Spanish fourth tier, Pep Guardiola will take charge of his 1,000th game for different sides –Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Manchester City – when his current club host Liverpool on Sunday. “If I could chose one rival for his personal milestone that I want to share with many, many people - that would be the best,” he said. “I have been a long time in this country. Of course, Barcelona and the impact it had on my life as a ball boy, football player and manager. But Liverpool, especially with Jurgen [Klopp], have been the biggest rival in this country and it could not be better. One week ago it was Liverpool ‘disaster, disaster' and now they win two and it's ‘are they back to their best?' Always in a season there are ups and down.” Bournemouth: Andoni Iraola has been speaking ahead of Bournemouth's trip to Aston Villa on Sunday and naturally talk turned to Alex Scott's call-up to the England squad by Thomas Tuchel. Everyone was really excited for him this morning. Everyone around the club was happy as even if it's an individual call, we feel it collectively and there is a recognition of playing for Bournemouth. “I think Alex, in the two seasons with us, has had three knee injuries. He arrived strong, did a good pre-season and won his place in the team. I think this period without any issue has been very good for him.” Premier League: A reminder of this weekend's top flight fixtures … Adam Wharton may have been recalled to the England squad but he's not a certain starter for Crystal Palace this weekend. However, Palace boss Oliver Glasner said he's not guaranteed to get the nod for the home showdown with Brighton on Sunday after watching Wharton in action against Alkmaar. He's still feeling his chest is not completely free. It was good for him to play 30 minutes. It was important for him to raise his heart frequency and get a little bit of intensity. If it's enough to start against Brighton, I don't know at the moment. Glasner also had this to say about his squad. At the moment it looks like all players who were involved (on Thursday) will be available. While we await further news on Rob Edwards, Wolves interim coach James Collins has been speaking to the press. And Collins has provided a bit of clarity for this weekend at least, confirming that he'll be in the away dugout. My focus is on the team and our week's work. We had to make sure that we prepared properly for the game this weekend, it's a Premier League game that can be won. They've been unbelievably receptive to what we've done with them. Collins, Wolves' youth-team boss, has also praised the departed Vitor Pereira, who was sacked after a terrible start to the season which yielded just two points. I can't speak highly enough of them; they were brilliant people and good coaches. Sometimes in football, it is dictated by results and in the end, if you keep losing, you lose your job. Most Erling Haaland stats make the eyes go pop. Here's another from Opta: Haaland has netted 98 goals in 107 Premier League appearances – if he scores a brace in this game he will become the fastest player to 100 goals in Premier League history, with Alan Shearer the current quickest to 100 in 124 games. And yet, his record against Sunday's opponents, Liverpool, is underwhelming. He's faced them eight times and only emerged on the winning side once. And in those matches he's managed a paltry (for him) three goals. I was at Anfield for the first, the equaliser in a mad game when RB Salzburg fought back from 3-0 down before Mo Salah struck to give the relieved hosts a 4-3 win. Haaland was a sub that day in October 2019. Haaland has only scored one Premier League goal against the Reds so will he improve that record this weekend? Krishnamoorthy v has emailed having cast his eye over the fixtures. “This weekend schedule is a silent tribute to Shakespeare. Ahead of Chelsea v Wolves, Blues boss Enzo Maresca has been talking about the idea of facing a team without a manager. Although perhaps his comments will become moribund if Rob Edwards is making his way to the Black Country as we speak. Maresca said in his press conference: “It's difficult for this reason, it is also difficult because we play Wednesday night - the players were off yesterday, we have a small session today and a game tomorrow. So the game plan is also different, but we need to adapt.” “We don't have an update at the moment,” said Maresca. We are tying to minimise minutes for him. It's time for me to depart the Guardian liveblog bunker, at least until tomorrow. David Tindall will keep you abreast of association football affairs for the next hour or so. Rob Edwards didn't take Middlesbrough training this morning amid sustained interest from Wolves. Boro rejected an approach for Edwards from the Premier League club on Thursday afternoon but 24 hours on his future is in serious doubt. Edwards is understood to be in discussions with the Boro hierarchy regarding what happens next. This morning Boro cancelled his pre-match press conference, scheduled for 1.30pm, to preview Saturday's game against Birmingham. He scored after a minute in the victory at Anfield and added two more against Brighton the following weekend. If we were seven points clear at this stage nobody would be saying we had won the league already. We just need to focus on ourselves, win our games and then let's see what other teams are doing. I think everybody could see against Real Madrid all of us running, fighting, being there for each other, covering each other's back. The most important thing is to keep going like this. I just try to do my best on the pitch. If it seems like I am a leader, then I'll keep doing that on the pitch, not outside the pitch. Granit Xhaka was never the most popular figure at Arsenal. The old tweets of New York's newly elected mayor and lifelong Gooner, Zohran Mamdani, surfaced this week after his victory. Xhaka proved his critics wrong that day, scoring a sensational free kick in a 3-1 win, and has done the same since leaving Arsenal. Xhaka has been a revelation at Bayer Leverkusen – where he won the Bundesliga title undefeated – and now Sunderland, where he is adored by fans for perfectly complementing the youth of Régis Le Bris' surging side. The league leaders will go to the Stadium of Light wary of their former captain, who will surely be out to prove a point. Arsenal face Chelsea in the WSL, a cracking way to start any football-based weekend. Suzanne Wrack has been chatting to Arsenal – and now England - left-back Taylor Hinds. This is the type of team that I want to be in. There's a little part of me that's always going to love Liverpool. So many of my friends are still up there, scousers are just one of a kind too, and I definitely miss that side of it, the people, but I'm also loving it here and I'm really thriving and happy. Plenty of people thought Ruben Amorim would receive a freshly printed P45 in October. Wayne Rooney was gently criticial of the extent to which Enzo Maresca rotates his Chelsea side after they draw with Qarabag in the Champions League. We are in an era where anyone can say what they want. Since I joined the club, it's my view to rotate players. When you don't win I can understand no one is agreeing. Football is a bit different compared to years ago in terms of physicality and intensity. It's impossible to play with the same players 65 games in one season. You cannot say: ‘why, years ago, was it possible?' If you want to see the season like a marathon, when you are in February and March, the last sprint, you have to think in a different way. Anthony Gordon, who is in the England squad, is waiting for the results of a scan on a hip injury and may miss Newcastle's game at Brentford on Sunday. Romeo Lavia will miss tomorrow's game against Wolves; Pedro Neto is also doubtful. Hearts are nine points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership, though Celtic have a game in hand. On this day in 1990… Aston Villa, 2-0 up from the first leg of their Uefa Cup tie against Internazionale, have their dreams crushed in the San Siro. Mikel Arteta has been saying some nice things about Granit Xhaka, who will face his old Arsenal teammates tomorrow. I am laughing because I just visualised Granit and it makes me laugh because he was such a character, a huge personality, very funny, super professional,” Arteta added. It wasn't an easy decision (to let him leave) because I knew the impact he could still have. But then when you have one of those leaders, you need to have him in the right frame of mind, feeling committed. Nuno Espirito Santo has been talking about Freddie Potts, who made such an impressive full debut for West Ham in their win over Newcastle last week. He was balanced and almost all his actions were accurate. Freddie has played many games in Championship and League One, that is what made him. We are here to help all the players improve. Freddie is one of those that has got so much talent, so we are looking forward to seeing what he can do. Arne Slot on the return of Alexander Isak I know that I said three weeks ago that his pre-season has ended so now it's time for us to see where he is. But I have to come back to those words, because if you are three weeks only with the rehab, that doesn't bring you back to the levels he was three weeks ago. So, again I have to say, give him some time. Sir Alex Ferguson has paid tribute to Pep Guardiola, who will manage his 1,000th game on Sunday. Your deep love and passion for the game has always been so evident and you should be very proud of the indelible impact you continue to have across the global game. Reaching 1,000 matches and achieving such longevity in football is a landmark that can never be underestimated and, to continue to deliver league, Champions League and domestic cup titles in three of Europe's most competitive leagues is outstanding. Wolves' search for their next head coach has taken another twist: Middlesbrough's Rob Edwards will no longer be conducting his pre-match press conference. Wolves had an official approach for Edwards rejected on Thursday with Boro determined to keep the man who has led them to third in the Championship after taking over in the summer on a three-year contract. Wolves are longstanding admirers of Edwards, who has a fondness for the club, having previously played and coached at Molineux. He also had a spell in caretaker charge in 2016, shortly after the Wolves owner, Fosun, assumed control of the club. in both men's and women's senior England squads!” writes Alex from Guernsey. Incidentally they are step-siblings, which is not widely known.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Taking place in Canada, the United States, and Mexico next year, the FIFA World Cup will run from June 11 to July 19. Canada was one of the few World Cup countries that didn't unveil a new uniform in 2022, but that doesn't appear to be the case this time around. FootyHeadlines leaked images of what appears to be Canada's new kit on Wednesday. The leaked photos show a red Canada jersey designed by Nike, with shades that form a large maple leaf across the front. These are different from what we've seen Canada wear as of late. Their current home kit, which was first unveiled in 2024, featured a two-tone red design. Here's a look at the red uniform Canada wore in 2022: While the leaked Canada jerseys have yet to be confirmed, on Wednesday Adidas unveiled home kits for 22 countries: Algeria, Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Northern Ireland, Peru, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, and Wales. Canada is not only looking to win a match at the FIFA World Cup for the first time, but it's also hoping to make it out of their group.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Christian Polanco and Alexis Guerreros of The Cooligans spoke with the Charlotte FC defender following his call-up to the U.S. Men's National Team - including getting the chance to once again play alongside Gio Reyna. Excited to have you on the show. But I, I basically just a couple of minutes before we started recording, the US MNT roster, uh, just dropped. US Soccer knew you were gonna be on our show and said, Yo, we need to, we need to drop this roster right now. We talk about you a lot. We talk about all of this. We, uh, I think seeing the same, seeing the name Gio Rena was shocking. Excited quite a bit, but it's exciting to see him back on the team. Early reactions of just seeing a, a player like Geo that obviously is, uh, uh, sort of, uh, has a little bit of controversy around him, but to, to, to welcome him back to the squad, how do you, what were your first reactions? Yeah, I mean, listen, there's, there's a few guys who are, who are back in camp after missing, uh, missing a good number of them. So, um, listen, it's always nice to, to catch up with guys and, and see them back in and, and, you know, see how their, you know, how their lives are off the field, how, how they're doing on the field, and Um, yeah, just catching up and, and understanding where they're at in, you know, in, in their season and, and in their, um, you know, in their personal lives. Now, look, when, when it comes to the national team, we've had this argument on this show. Christian, not a big fan of experimenting with all these different players, he wants to see the best 11, get a lot of game time before the World Cup. Me, I'm like, hey, go crazy. Let's see who else we got out there. Maybe we could fill up the squad. You're back there on a backline. Does it make it easier for you if it was the Same 10 around you all the time, or do you not care? Yeah, I mean, I'm of the mind that that you work with what, what you have, right? Like, what do you want to see out of, uh, the rest of your guys? Um, all these games are, are World Cup level opponents and Um, games that we want to be performing well in, uh, you know, you're not always gonna get the result you want, but if, as long as the performances and the ideas and, and the, you know, that everybody's understanding and grasping what, what is being asked of, of the group, then, um, you know, we're, we're gonna be moving in the right direction. Uh, we want to win as many games as possible, you know, that these are competitive games, uh, whether, whether they're labeled as friendlies or not, and so we have to treat them as such. We, we have to treat them as competitive, and, and those are going to be the, the tune-up games going into, into 2026 World Cup.</p>
