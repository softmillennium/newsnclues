                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's in November when the dread of a long winter starts to creep in, a sinking fear of what pains must be endured. The Black Swamp Players, with their newest production “The Thin Place,” reminds us that it's far from too late to enjoy a ghost story. For some, the real scary season may just be beginning. “The Thin Place” is a 2019 play written by Lucas Hnath. Heith A. Diehl serves as this production's director, his ninth time doing so at the Black Swamp Players. The show will run for two weekends on Nov. 7-9 and Nov. 14-16. The audience is first greeted by Hilda (Brandie Culbreath), whose relationship with her late grandmother garnered her an interest in the paranormal. She attends séances led by a charmingly British psychic, Linda (Rachel Hetrick). During a sitting, Linda makes contact with Hilda's family beyond the veil. Ordinarily timid and embarrassed to discuss matters of the occult, Hilda comes alive now that she's found a fellow believer. Hilda needs to know badly – what happened at that séance? How did Linda channel her grandmother in that candlelit room? After enough questioning, Linda confesses that what she does has little to do with spirits. She's less of a medium and more of a charismatic performer who can intuit what people “need to hear” in order to make peace with their dead loved ones. Her talent is in the art of cold reading: a set of techniques used by those in her trade to trick people into believing the practitioner is a psychic. Her dissonance is made manifest onstage and grips the theater. “The Thin Place” instills dread through its portrayal of doubt. It's common enough to make an audience uncomfortable by pitting ideologies against each other. What makes this play an experience worth having is the induced fear that what's seen with our very eyes may not be real. Of special note are Culbreath's performance, which is especially captivating, and Diehl's lighting direction. One of the joys of theater, be it campfire stories or a staged play, is that it asks an audience to suspend disbelief. To engage with the implausible sometimes makes things less ridiculous than they seemed initially.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adam Zadworny: There are many lessons to be learned. In Poland, there is a special institution called the Maritime Chamber - a quasi-court, described by some lawyers as an inquisitorial tribunal. I mention this because the Maritime Chambers - in Szczecin and Gdynia - are the authorities empowered to draw conclusions from such tragedies. Whenever information is withheld - especially by the state and its institutions, which from the outset did not disclose the ferry's technical condition - it creates fertile ground for conspiracy theories. In the name of higher goals - Polish national interest, or more specifically, protecting the Polish flag and the state-owned shipping company, Polish Ocean Lines, which owned the Heweliusz - information about years of neglect, accidents, and serious malfunctions (26 in total) was omitted. No other ship in Poland had so many documented incidents. According to the ministry committee, the only culprit was Hurricane Junior - a force of nature that, as we know, cannot be held accountable in court. Later rulings from the Maritime Chambers varied significantly. From the very beginning, journalists had to deal with chaos - especially informational. It was difficult even to establish how many people died. Three years had passed since the political transformation, yet there were still no agreements with neighboring countries for coordinating maritime rescue operations. Moreover, the crew did not expect a hurricane. There was a delay, they were rushing, and the trucks on the lower deck were not properly secured. Sailors called it a “floating coffin.” One captain admitted the ship “wears a person out nervously,” referring to steering and stability issues. Experts pointed out that the Heweliusz was meant to be a twin of the Mikołaj Kopernik ferry built three years earlier, but it was one deck taller. Captains explained that this caused stability problems. During stronger winter winds, the ferry rolled heavily. It also had other technical problems, its Achilles' heel being the improperly used anti-rolling system. Three days before the planned voyage, the Heweliusz struck a quay in Ystad, Sweden, damaging its stern ramp, which remained leaky. On 13 January 1993, a three-person repair team worked late into the evening but could not fix the leak. The ferry left two and a half hours later than planned. The crew was rushing also because a VIP - a female director from the shipping company's office - was on board, scheduled for a morning meeting with Swedish partners. A 1993 article in Germany's Der Spiegel suggested many passengers on board were of Romani origin. Your report disproves this, showing no evidence supported that claim. I spoke with border guards who confirmed that stowaways hid in train cars at the Świnoujście port, boarding ferries transporting trains to Scandinavia. Swedish media covered this extensively in 1992, before the Heweliusz disaster. After the sinking, German journalists speculated that more people were on board than officially reported. The ship capsized for around 40 minutes - any hidden passengers would have tried to save themselves, and their bodies would have been found. It is one of the remarkable stories connected to this tragedy. It's certainly a different story and scale - the Polish ferry was much smaller - but there are analogies. On the Polish ferry, passengers had no thermal survival suits, leaving them exposed to hypothermia. Edward Kurpiel, the Heweliusz purser, told the Maritime Chamber in Szczecin - interviewed by international media - that when asked about passengers' chances of survival, he answered in one word: “none.” Disasters can still happen, but today the number of victims would likely be far lower. I truly believe emergency services could save most of the passengers. We are now in the European Union, with agreements and better communication tools. Recalling Poland thirty years ago, I think of Lech Wałęsa's New Year speech. Two weeks before the Heweliusz disaster, he said the country was “on a journey to a better world.” One political commentator added that this journey was over a stormy sea of transformation. I think these words capture the spirit of that story. Although the series is inspired by true events, its storytelling differs from the report: it includes invented scenes and dialogues, and characters are composites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aditya Suhas Jambhale's Baramulla is a hauntingly atmospheric blend of supernatural horror, psychological tension, and political commentary set against the snow-clad backdrop of Kashmir. Starring the ever-versatile Manav Kaul as Deputy Superintendent of Police Ridwaan Sayyed, the film explores a town plagued by the mysterious disappearances of children—an investigation that gradually pulls the protagonist and his family into an ever-tightening web of terror. Now streaming on Netflix, Baramulla stands out for its masterful cinematography, layered writing, and an underlying sense of dread that lingers long after the credits roll. From its opening sequence, the film establishes a chilling tone that is both gripping and unsettling. This visual language keeps viewers on edge, never letting them relax into the comfort of familiarity. While terrorism and political unrest form the film's undercurrent, Baramulla never loses sight of its core mystery: the missing children. Manav Kaul's Ridwaan is a man of logic and order, thrown into a situation that defies both. Manav Kaul delivers a performance that is quietly powerful and emotionally layered. His portrayal of Ridwaan is restrained, almost stoic, yet in his eyes one can see a deep anguish. Her calm presence contrasts beautifully with the chaos that envelops their world, giving the film a tender domestic tension amidst its supernatural dread. The strained relationship between Ridwaan and his daughter Noorie is one of the film's most compelling arcs. Haunted by an incident from the past, Ridwaan struggles to connect with her—a subplot that adds emotional depth to his character. When Noorie becomes a target of the same mysterious force, his personal and professional worlds collide, forcing him to confront not only the external evil but also his own guilt and detachment. Credit must be given to the film's writing team—Aditya Dhar, Aditya Suhas Jambhale, and Monal Thaakar—for crafting a screenplay that balances multiple subplots without losing narrative cohesion. Despite juggling themes of folklore, politics, and horror, the script never feels disjointed. Beyond its eerie atmosphere, Baramulla also grapples with historical trauma. It addresses the 1991 exodus of Kashmiri Pandits—an event that displaced thousands and remains one of the most painful chapters in India's recent history. Some viewers might find these political undertones difficult to ignore, but they lend Baramulla a sense of urgency and authenticity. Together, they create an immersive sensory experience that draws you into the psychological landscape of fear and loss. Ultimately, Baramulla is more than a horror film—it is a reflection on grief, displacement, and the unseen forces that fracture both families and nations. Jambhale's direction, combined with Kaul's nuanced performance and a deftly written script, makes this a rare supernatural thriller that manages to be both emotionally resonant and politically charged. It's chilling, beautifully made, and thought-provoking—a film that dares to look into the abyss and asks what happens when the ghosts of the past refuse to stay buried.
