                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum's speed and transaction costs have been a pain in the side of investors for years. An upcoming upgrade intends to at least partially solve for some of these core issues. In the meantime, worries around market share gains or losses have some investors on the sidelines willing to wait it out. However, on a one week-basis (from 4 p.m. last Friday), this token is actually down 5%. Now, one could look at those numbers and surmise that Ethereum has actually been an outperformer over the past week, an argument I'd hold is likely true. But let's dive into this weekly volatility, and see what investors are making about Ethereum's long-term growth prospects, judging by this price action right now. One of the more intriguing theses I've seen float around over the past week depicts a world in which Ethereum may give up market share to other blockchains. This thesis is based on the idea that other blockchains are simply faster and more efficient. Ethereum's long transaction times, and at times high gas fees and transaction costs, have led to market share gains among up-and-coming proof-of-stake platforms out there. Ethereum has sought to fix this trend by implementing its latest upgrade, named Fusaka, which will allow for more compressed data to be stored on Ethereum blocks, improving transaction speed and costs over time. Of course, we'll have to see if this upgrade provides the all-encompassing fix investors are hoping for, and if the sort of real-world asset tokenization and other projects that could come as a result of this upgrade flourish. But in the midst of uncertainty, investors appear to be selling first and asking questions later. My take is that if sentiment improves, these trends could reverse (potentially in a violent way), but time will be the judge. The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn't one of them. Now, it's worth noting Stock Advisor's total average return is 1,034% — a market-crushing outperformance compared to 191% for the S&P 500. Don't miss the latest top 10 list, available with Stock Advisor, and join an investing community built by individual investors for individual investors.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now MoonBull Leads as the Next Big Crypto Coin for Massive Gains at $0.00008388 Have you ever asked yourself what would have happened if you had invested in Ethereum (ETH) when it was just a few cents? Ethereum started as a bold experiment, launching in 2014 with tokens sold at around $0.31 each. Back then, few could imagine that the same coin would later soar above $4,800, turning early believers into millionaires. Today, that same spirit of early adoption and unstoppable growth seems to be echoing in MoonBull ($MOBU), a next big crypto coin making serious waves. With the MoonBull presale live, momentum is building fast, and it feels like history might be repeating itself. MoonBull is emerging as the next big crypto coin, capturing attention with its innovative approach and strong growth potential. Deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, its ERC-20 structure ensures maximum security, liquidity, and interoperability, enabling instant connectivity with leading wallets, DEX platforms, and DeFi dashboards. MoonBull's ecosystem runs on Ethereum's validator network, ensuring transparent, verified execution of contracts for every reflection, burn, and staking reward. The project isn't just running on Ethereum, it's positioned to thrive within it, leveraging the ecosystem's scalability and global developer reach. MoonBull brings community power to the next level with a referral system that actually pays. Backed by an 11% referral allocation ($8.05 billion $MOBU), this feature transforms word-of-mouth excitement into tangible community rewards. MoonBull is poised to be the next big crypto coin in 2025. Every once in a while, a presale emerges that captures the raw excitement of early crypto days, and that's exactly what's happening with MoonBull. The MoonBull presale is live, and it's exploding with momentum. Currently in Stage 6, the token price is $0.00008388, with over $550K raised and 1,900+ holders onboard. That's a jaw-dropping 7,244% ROI from Stage 6 to listing, and early joiners already enjoy 235.52% returns. MoonBull's early presale phase gives investors the perfect setup to catch lightning in a bottle again. It wasn't just a token; it was the foundation for smart contracts, decentralized finance, and a brand-new era of blockchain utility. Fast forward a few years, and the same coin that once cost less than a candy bar skyrocketed past $4,000, minting countless early investors into crypto legends. Imagine investing $600 in Ethereum's ICO; it would now be worth millions. Those who hesitated back then are still haunted by the “what if” of that moment. Now, a new opportunity is rising, one that crypto watchers say mirrors the energy and excitement of Ethereum's early days, and that's MoonBull ($MOBU). Crypto investors crave stories of redemption, and MoonBull is writing a new one. Analysts have begun to highlight MoonBull leads as the next big crypto coin across discussions and communities, as its utility, tokenomics, and viral structure check all the right boxes. Ethereum created millionaires, and now MoonBull's structured growth, transparent presale stages, and unmatched referral ecosystem could be paving the same path for a new generation of believers. MoonBull presale is live, and it's not waiting for anyone. The message is simple: those who missed Ethereum's early ICO might never get that exact opportunity again, but MoonBull offers something equally thrilling. The next 1000x crypto to buy now is expected to come from a live presale project with solid fundamentals and high ROI potential, much like MoonBull, which is showing explosive early-stage momentum. The best crypto presale performance currently belongs to MoonBull ($MOBU), a project that combines Ethereum-based security with strong tokenomics and real community rewards traits that define the next big breakout coin. The top crypto to buy today is MoonBull ($MOBU), which merges innovation, scalability, and community-driven growth. Experts predict that the next crypto to hit $1 in 2025 will be MoonBull ($MOBU), a low-priced token in its presale phase, backed by utility and momentum that mirrors MoonBull's current trajectory. The best crypto for long-term growth in 2025 will likely be MoonBull ($MOBU), an Ethereum-based project that blends scalability with engagement rewards, giving it both credibility and global reach. ICO: Initial Coin Offering, a fundraising event for early-stage cryptocurrencies. ROI: Return on Investment, measuring profit relative to the initial amount invested. Tokenomics: The structure governing a cryptocurrency's supply, distribution, and rewards. Ethereum's ICO is remembered as one of crypto's greatest opportunities, a moment that turned mere visionaries into millionaires. Today, MoonBull leads as the next big crypto coin, reviving that same early excitement with its live presale, powerful ROI structure, and Ethereum-based foundation. The presale is already gaining unstoppable momentum, and investors who act now could be securing their ticket to the next great crypto story. History rarely repeats itself, but sometimes it rhymes, and MoonBull might just be the verse that turns dreams into reality.

The bank held 3.2 million shares worth $302.6 million as of the end the second quarter.The bank earlier this week put out a bullish note on bitcoin, suggesting the price could reach $170,000 within 12 months from the current $102,000.

Correction (Nov 7, 2025, 19:10 UTC): An earlier version of this story suggested the bank owned IBIT for its own account.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, platforms like 099.vip are at the forefront of this shift, with 099.vip announcing a significant upgrade to its cryptocurrency casino, signaling a maturing market that promises enhanced privacy, security, and user experience. This development underscores a broader trend where blockchain technology and digital currencies are not just integrating into, but actively redefining, the online gambling industry. This matters immensely for the crypto ecosystem as it not only drives increased adoption and utility for various digital assets but also pushes the boundaries of decentralized finance (DeFi) and provably fair gaming, setting new standards for transparency and trust in a traditionally opaque sector. This is coupled with significantly lower transaction fees, particularly for international transfers, and faster payouts compared to traditional banking systems. For operators, these advantages translate into reduced operational costs, less reliance on intermediaries, and often lower licensing fees, leading to higher profit margins. The industry's growth also stimulates demand for specialized talent in blockchain development and security. Cryptocurrency casinos are rapidly carving out a substantial market share within the global online gaming industry. Companies like Stake.com have emerged as dominant players, holding over half the market share among major crypto casinos and processing billions in monthly deposit volumes. Traditional gaming companies, while initially hesitant, are now under increasing pressure to adapt. Many are exploring or actively integrating cryptocurrency payment options into their existing platforms, often developing hybrid models that accept both fiat and digital currencies. This shift requires significant investment in technology and a re-evaluation of regulatory compliance. The influence of crypto casinos is raising player expectations for speed, privacy, and control, compelling even established operators to innovate. Bitcoin (BTC) remains the most popular cryptocurrency for gambling, though its dominance is gradually being challenged. Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Tether (USDT), and Dogecoin (DOGE) also consistently rank among the top choices. Furthermore, the emergence of casino-specific tokens, such as Rollbit's RLB and Shuffle's SHFL, is creating new market segments. These tokens are designed to enhance player engagement, offer staking rewards, and provide exclusive perks, adding a layer of utility and investment opportunity within the crypto gambling ecosystem. On social media platforms like Reddit, there's a growing acceptance and normalization of crypto gambling, particularly among tech-savvy users who laud the anonymity, faster transactions, and global accessibility. However, a significant undercurrent of concern persists, especially regarding responsible gambling and advertising ethics. While this boosts visibility, it also sparks "intense debate and scrutiny" over the ethics of promoting high-risk activities, especially when influencers are perceived to be gambling with casino-provided funds. Within the broader Web3 ecosystem, crypto casinos are acting as a "real-time lab" for decentralized technologies. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols are being integrated to enhance transparency through smart contracts, ensuring provably fair gaming with verifiable outcomes and lower house edges. This allows funds to remain in players' wallets until a bet is placed, mitigating risks associated with centralized control. Stablecoins are also gaining traction as a means to mitigate the volatility inherent in other cryptocurrencies. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are also finding their place, functioning as in-game tokens, exclusive rewards, or elements in loyalty programs, enriching the user experience and blurring the lines between gaming and digital collectibles. However, the integration of NFTs faces challenges related to regulatory clarity, AML/KYC compliance, and transaction fees. A recent YouTube policy update, effective November 17, 2025, has raised concerns among Web3 and NFT gaming creators, potentially classifying content promoting digital goods with real value as gambling violations, which could impact content discoverability. Ultimately, while crypto casinos drive innovation in Web3, they also contribute to the "gamblification of finance," where crypto platforms monetize user risk, blurring the lines between investing, speculating, and gambling, and raising concerns about consumer protection. In the short term (1-2 years), we can expect crypto casinos to continue driving increased crypto adoption and liquidity, acting as a critical gateway for new users into the digital asset space. This will sustain demand for major cryptocurrencies and further diversify the usage of altcoins. Technological refinement will be key, with ongoing advancements in Layer 2 scaling solutions, AI-driven personalization, and robust "provably fair" gaming protocols. The emergence of hybrid casino models, accepting both fiat and crypto, will also intensify competition. Looking further ahead (3-5+ years), crypto casinos are poised for mainstream integration, potentially capturing 35-40% of the global online gambling market by 2030. This will likely diminish the distinction between "crypto casinos" and traditional online gambling. Deeper integration with DeFi primitives will enable innovative models like decentralized betting pools and sophisticated tokenomics. The convergence with Web3 technologies could lead to immersive virtual reality (VR) casinos and metaverse-based gambling experiences. Market consolidation is also a likely trend, with major traditional gambling operators acquiring successful crypto-native platforms. Technological breakthroughs in advanced provably fair mechanisms, scalability, AI, and mainstream metaverse/VR development will be crucial. The entry of traditional gaming giants fully embracing crypto operations would signal a major shift towards mainstream acceptance. For projects, strategic considerations include prioritizing regulatory compliance, investing heavily in technology, enhancing user experience, fostering trust through transparency, developing sustainable tokenomics, and forging strategic partnerships. Investors, on the other hand, must conduct thorough due diligence, assess regulatory risks, diversify investments, focus on strong fundamentals, monitor market trends, and implement robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss limits and taking strategic profits. A "Niche but Steadily Growing" scenario holds medium likelihood, where regulatory fragmentation persists. A "Regulatory Crackdown & Stagnation" scenario is low-to-medium likelihood, potentially triggered by high-profile fraud or market instability. Finally, a "Technological Disruption" scenario, with medium likelihood, could see entirely new paradigms of online gambling emerge from unforeseen advancements in blockchain, AI, or other emerging technologies. The long-term significance of crypto casinos extends beyond just gambling; they serve as a real-world testbed for decentralized technologies, demonstrating the practical application of smart contracts, stablecoins, and Layer 2 solutions. As regulatory frameworks slowly catch up, and as traditional gaming companies increasingly integrate crypto options, the lines between conventional and decentralized online gaming will continue to blur. For crypto investors and enthusiasts, the key takeaways are to recognize the immense growth potential of this sector, but also to remain vigilant about regulatory developments and market volatility.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump lays out his case for why Bitcoin isn't just surviving, but destined to outlast everything. Standing before a room full of crypto founders, miners, and retail investors, he traced his own journey from skeptic to believer — one that began, he said, just four or five years ago. He talked about Bitcoin's (BTC) energy consumption, about inflation and hard assets, and what he sees as a broken financial system that keeps ordinary people locked out.

Earn rewards worth up to 5,000 USDT on your first deposit On a stretch of Texas desert, a massive warehouse hums with electricity, 600 yards long, packed with thousands of computers mining Bitcoin. “I was a guy who didn't understand this world until four or five years ago,” he admitted. “If Bitcoin went down — congratulations, the Pentagon's gone,” he said. And if anyone thinks quantum computing could break it, Trump is unconvinced. “You don't think that a quantum computer would have already taken out Bank of America? You don't think your Amazon account would already be gone?” he asked. “Bitcoin would actually be the last in a series of entities to fall.” Ironically, Eric Trump admitted to the panel that he wasn't this ‘locked-in' into Bitcoin a few years ago, and neither were his friends. He recalled a friend in private wealth management who once dismissed crypto as “funny money.” Eighteen months later, the same banker called back to say he was now recommending clients put “2 to 5%” of their portfolios into Bitcoin. “We're winning this race right now,” he told the crowd. “I think Biden did the greatest disservice to America of any president in history with his inflationary policies,” he said. Those policies, he argued, only reward people “with hard assets”—owners of homes, steel, or Bitcoin—while crushing “the young guy, the young girl who just came out of school and is trying to build up the American dream.” “Bitcoin is the solution to so much of it,” he declared. For Trump, crypto represents a new path to financial self-reliance. A way for people without famous last names or hundreds of millions in collateral to access credit and opportunity. “Good luck… unless you've got a last name like ours,” he quipped. That imbalance, he argued, is what cryptocurrency can fix. “There's no person in the world that wants to see this industry beat the big banks more than I do,” he said. “We're really on the front end of it,” he said. “I believe in it with every ounce of my soul.” A chance, as he put it, “to live the American dream.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you combine AI and blockchain, you get something entirely new: software or AI agents that act on our behalf, not just process a payment. According to Boston Consulting Group (BCG), global payments revenue is expected to reach $2.4 trillion by 2029, with agentic AI, digital currencies and real-time payments shaping the change. Bankr, Olas Pearl, and the fast-rising TON chat wallet ecosystem are all doing fascinating things in this space. Each one changes the game for online payments. I loved my conversation with Danielle Brown-Wolf, who leads growth at Bankr. She explained the simple goal of Bankr: to reach people where they already spend their time and solve one of the biggest pain points in crypto: accessibility. Bankr is a conversational, onchain AI agent that lives at bankr.bot and is also accessible on X and Telegram. It turns your social handle into a wallet login, powered by Privy, and executes real transactions directly from chat. You can send a message like “Buy $100 of ETH” and the agent will process the transaction, bridge across chains if needed, and record everything transparently on the blockchain. Every interaction is verifiable and happens in real time. This approach removes friction for everyday users who might not be familiar with decentralized wallets or seed phrases. Bankr lives where the audience already is.Deployer, the founder, of Bankr, told me that "AI agents will provide more financial opportunities to more people because they handle the complex part for you. Bankr is already doing this, analyzing the market and teaching people how to trade all through simple conversation." I watched Bankr run technical analysis, place limit orders, settle a sports wager on Polymarket, and list an NFT on OpenSea, all from social feeds and a private terminal. A friend replies, “Bankr, place 50 on the Eagles.” The action happens right there in public, and others can copy it with one reply. Groups that never thought of themselves as crypto users are suddenly moving money together because the wallet feels like chat, not finance. Users can back up with email or sign in through Telegram or Farcaster if their X handle is suspended. Links to Basecan give instant proof of what happened. The agent refused in public and explained why. Danielle Brown Wolf, Head of Growth at Bankr, calls this “the PayPal moment for crypto.”  In our conversation, she said “Bankr brings real payments into everyday conversations. When you can send or invest money as easily as you tweet, that's when digital finance finally becomes mainstream.” The analogy fits. Bankr is doing the same with a social handle and an intelligent agent that can understand intent and act. It's software that lives where the customer already is. Their latest launch, Pearl v1, introduces a simple idea. Every action the agent takes is recorded onchain, creating a complete and transparent history. Because the agents live on a decentralized network rather than a single company's cloud, they continue to function even if part of the system goes offline. In simple terms, it's a place where anyone can build and own AI-powered agents that work for them directly, without relying on centralized platforms. Commerce is full of small but repetitive tasks that humans still perform by hand, like invoice matching, subscription updates, split payments, rewards, and fee management. In chatting with David Minarsch, Cofounder of Valory, he told me that they “see a future where every individual can deploy their own on-chain AI agent. The goal isn't to replace people; it's to empower them with digital teammates that they fully own.” Pearl gives developers a way to create specialized agents that execute those jobs from start to finish with verifiable results. It looks like an app store, but the apps are workers that move value according to clear rules you set. As the catalog grows, many of these agents will go beyond trading. They'll handle payments, reconcile wallets, and streamline everyday financial tasks that still rely on email or manual approvals today. It pairs a massive user base with chat-native money. Wallets live under the same keyboard people already use to message friends, brands, and creators. The next step is easy to imagine: intelligent agents that become the front door to payments inside those chats. Think about a customer support bot that issues refunds after verifying an order, or a creator's bot that sells a digital good and automatically splits revenue among collaborators. It all happens inside the conversation, with payments recorded on the blockchain and receipts visible to both sides. TON's biggest advantage is scale, and Goodies shows why that matters. Goodies is a Telegram mini app built on TON that blends collectibles, brands, and payments in one place. When I tried it, I watched sticker packs from Kung Fu Panda, Pudgy Penguins, and Lamborghini sell out in seconds. There's already a thriving secondary market for these stickers, where people buy and trade them directly inside Telegram. “Embedding brand Intellectural Property (IP) into daily habitual (GM) and conversational moments through memes and GIFs has been a strategy that we caught early on with Pudgy Penguins. This was just after their amazing launch with Kung Fu Panda and Pudgy Penguins. He told me in that conversation that “our goal is to build the world's first chat native economy. Every brand sticker, every collectible on TON, is proof that digital commerce can be instant, emotional, and transparent. When someone sends a sticker, they're not just sharing an emoji but they're sharing ownership and culture.” Each drop combines pop culture with blockchain in a way that feels natural and mainstream. Just an experience that turns digital art into instant commerce. This is what digital payments look like when AI, culture, and blockchain work together. The company has been quietly reinventing itself for the new digital era, experimenting with stablecoins, AI-driven fraud detection, and blockchain infrastructure to stay relevant in a world moving toward decentralized finance. Its launch of PayPal USD (PYUSD) marked one of the first times a major payments provider issued its own fully backed stablecoin, signaling that even legacy platforms see the shift coming. PayPal is also expanding into new areas of cross-border payments, merchant automation, and crypto accessibility, working to stay the default for both traditional users and the next generation of digital wallets. What I saw at their Developer Days was also an impressive vision of where AI Agents are heading. Their vision shows even established leaders are thinking about autonomy, personalization, and intelligence inside payments. All three of these companies share the same pattern. They turn plain language into secure actions. They keep ownership and transparency with the user. They hide the crypto complexity but preserve trust and control. Bankr shows how conversational wallets can turn social feeds into payment hubs. Pearl shows how agent stores can automate financial workflows.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A high-profile project launched by fintech giant Stripe and crypto VC firm Paradigm has just made its first venture bet. As part of the arrangement, the Stripe-backed project will work with Commonware to develop methods to process blockchain payments more quickly, Paradigm general partner and CTO Georgios Konstantopoulos said in a blog post. O'Grady also declined to disclose the valuation for his firm following the Tempo-led raise, but said it was a “significant increase” over the valuation in Commonware's seed round, which Pitchbook reports as $63 million. “Usage and distribution is way more important than money as a startup,” he told Fortune. Tempo's investment into Commonware isn't its first splashy move since Stripe and Paradigm officially unveiled the project in September. Tempo has also increased its headcount from around five employees in August to now between 40 and 50, according to a person familiar with the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private business information. It's rare for a startup to make an acquisition, a big hire, and significant investment so early on since it launched, but Tempo has the backing of some of the biggest names in tech and crypto. Stripe is a payments goliath that's worth more than $100 billion. Paradigm is one of the top venture capital firms in crypto. The Stripe-linked startup also has a hefty war chest. It's raised $500 million at a $5 billion valuation from some of the top VCs in Silicon Valley, including Thrive Capital, Greenoaks, Sequoia, and Ribbit Capital, Fortune first reported. “We think that they're going to do just as good of a job, or better, showing off what Commonware can do than what we can do,” said O'Grady, the founder of Commonware, in reference to Tempo. Founded in 2024, Commonware has only seven employees (including O'Grady) and four customers, but it's already profitable, he said. It makes money through helping companies deploy as well as interface with its open-source software, and each customer on average generates more than $1 million in annual revenue.

To obtain the best experience, we recommend you use a more up to date browser (or turn off compatibility mode in Internet Explorer). Blockchain technology is revolutionizing industries by fundamentally transforming data management and storage practices. Traditional banking systems, however, continue to face challenges such as dependency on intermediaries, lack of transparency, vulnerability to fraud, and restricted accessibility. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative blockchain framework built on the Ethereum platform to enhance security and efficiency in banking. The proposed system eliminates intermediaries by using Ethereum-based smart contracts to enable secure, automated peer-to-peer (P2P) deposits, withdrawals, and transfers while incorporating a user-friendly interface with MetaMask and custom wallets for accessibility. Our experimental evaluation demonstrated significant improvements in transaction speed, transparency, and operational efficiency compared to traditional systems, with near real-time processing and automated verification. Performance benchmarking showed competitive latency and throughput, while gas cost analysis highlighted trade-offs in transaction expenses compared to conventional banking. These findings suggest that our blockchain framework has strong potential to address long-standing inefficiencies in the financial sector. While challenges remain, including scalability and regulatory considerations, this work offers a concrete and impactful step toward the practical adoption of blockchain in mainstream banking. Among these, Blockchain technology stands out for its potential to revolutionize how we conduct Banking and Mobile payments1. This paper explores blockchain integration into these critical financial processes, proposing a blockchain-based approach for achieving greater efficiency and security. Traditional Banking systems, while well-established, often need to be improved. Transparency can be limited, with users often needing more clear visibility into transaction details and fees. Costs associated with cross-border payments can be high, further burdened by complex regulations and exchange rates. Mobile payments, on the other hand, offer undeniable convenience. However, concerns regarding data security and fraud prevention persist. Specifically, centralized data storage creates single points of failure, making systems vulnerable to large-scale data breaches, insider threats, and denial-of-service attacks. Centralized control of user data creates potential vulnerabilities, and disputes can be cumbersome to resolve within traditional mobile payment frameworks2,3,4. Blockchain technology, with its core principles of decentralization, immutability, and cryptography, offers a compelling solution to address these challenges. It fosters a distributed ledger system, eliminating the need for centralized control and intermediaries. This translates to faster transaction processing, with data securely stored across a network of computers, making it tamper-proof and auditable by all participants. Additionally, blockchain significantly reduces the reliance on traditional third-party verification, streamlining processes and potentially reducing costs associated with cross-border transactions. This paper embarks on a comprehensive exploration of blockchain technology, delving into its core functionalities and specific applications within the banking and mobile payment domains2,1. We will dissect how blockchain can streamline transaction processing by removing intermediaries and enabling expedited settlements. We will explore how its inherent cryptographic security safeguards user data and financial information, mitigating fraud risks. Furthermore, we will examine how blockchain fosters transparency by providing a shared, immutable record of all transactions,accessible to authorized participants. The potential benefits extend far beyond technological advancements. We will analyze how a blockchain-based approach empowers financial institutions to streamline operations, reduce costs, and offer innovative financial products. For end-users, the advantages translate to faster, more secure, and potentially lower-cost transactions and greater control over their financial data.3,4 By meticulously examining the opportunities and challenges associated with blockchain integration, this paper aims to contribute significantly to the ongoing discourse on the future of secure and efficient banking and mobile payments. We will not only illuminate the transformative potential of this technology but also provide a critical analysis of the hurdles that need to be overcome for widespread adoption. These hurdles include regulatory uncertainty, scalability limitations regarding transaction throughput, interoperability challenges with existing legacy financial systems, user education requirements, and the complexities of private key management. Ultimately, this paper seeks to pave the way for a future where blockchain technology becomes the cornerstone of a secure, efficient, and inclusive financial ecosystem. Account creation via metamask or custom wallet Users can create an account either through Metamask, a well-known cryptocurrency wallet, or a custom wallet designed for specific needs. Metamask simplifies interaction with Ethereum-based decentralized applications, while a custom wallet offers more tailored control and flexibility. Deposit ether into the smart contract After account creation, users can deposit Ether (ETH) into a designated smart contract. Transfer ether from one user account to another The platform also supports Ether transfers between user accounts. This system ensures security and transparency, leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain technology to execute transactions without intermediaries. Other features could also be easily included in the system, but we will demonstrate our system with the three basic functions required for a transaction. Blockchain technology is a secure, immutable, and distributed ledger system that addresses common issues in traditional transaction systems, including data security, transaction speed, and confidentiality5. Ashish Kumar Jha et al.2 discuss the integration of blockchain with platforms like banks and e-commerce sites to facilitate swift and secure transactions. While they highlight the benefits, their work lacks detailed implementation strategies, a gap our paper aims to address by providing a concrete system architecture and functional prototype. A blockchain network consists of user nodes for clients and verification nodes managed by banks, as noted by6. This distributed setup enables verification nodes to validate transactions, confirm accounts, and generate blocks containing multiple transactions. Clients use user nodes to access account histories and initiate transactions. However, managing the complexity of multiple node types and ensuring their seamless interoperability in a large-scale banking environment presents significant challenges not fully explored in their conceptual model. Additionally, Hamburger et al1 illustrates how a single database can simplify the KYC (Know Your Customer) process across banks through blockchain technology, thereby expediting transaction timelines for users sending money worldwide. This approach is promising for reducing administrative overhead, but it necessitates extensive collaboration with regulatory bodies and may encounter legal hurdles related to data privacy and cross-border data sharing. Blockchain also secures banking transactions without the need for tokens, effectively addressing challenges like node, media, and communication failures, developed by Seymour et al.10. Banks would manage all transactions directly, generating new blocks linked to the blockchain. A potential limitation of this method is the performance implications and scalability issues that might arise from block generation without the incentivization of miners, which could impact network throughput. Yi-Wei Chang et al.11 developed a decentralized e-marketplace platform that documents each transaction step on the blockchain, providing electronic proof in case of disputes. While innovative, the generalizability of their framework to diverse mobile payment systems remains uncertain, and its implementation may require extensive changes to existing marketplace infrastructures. Furthermore, research on blockchain frameworks has resulted in a proposed electronic voting system that tackles existing system shortcomings12. Despite its potential for enhanced integrity, voter privacy and overall system integrity may still be concerns that require robust cryptographic solutions beyond basic blockchain implementation. It is also worth noting that various consensus algorithms beyond Ethereum's Proof of Stake, such as Proof of Authority (PoA) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), offer different trade-offs in terms of decentralization, scalability, and energy consumption, which could be explored for specific banking applications. Summary of Related Works on Blockchain Technology is presented in Table  1 Table  2 highlights key issues in current banking systems, including centralization leading to inefficiency, high transaction fees and latency causing financial losses, and data vulnerability, which raises concerns about theft and falsification. Centralization in traditional banking creates bottlenecks, single points of failure, and slow reconciliation processes, directly impacting efficiency and increasing operational costs. High transaction fees, particularly for cross-border payments, coupled with long wait times, result in significant financial losses for both institutions and customers, hindering liquidity and economic activity. Furthermore, the inherent lack of tamper-proof mechanisms in traditional banking data makes it susceptible to alteration without proper oversight, leading to concerns about fraud, theft, and falsification of records. Blockchain technology can simplify transactions by doing away with the need for middlemen like clearinghouses. This has the potential to save expenses for banks as well as clients by greatly accelerating the processing of transactions. The primary driving force behind blockchain technology is the need for decentralization, which is accomplished by allocating compute duties to each blockchain network node. Decentralization also fosters censorship resistance and enhances financial inclusion by lowering barriers to entry for unbanked populations. The fundamental technology of blockchain generates an unchangeable transaction record. By making it extremely impossible to change or modify financial data, this can increase security. However, it is important to acknowledge that while decentralization offers significant advantages, it also introduces complexities related to regulatory compliance and governance. The main and summarised objectives of our method are as follows: Enhance transparency and security Leverage blockchain technology to ensure immutable transaction records, fostering user trust and enabling independent verification of all financial activities within the banking system. This specifically aims to establish a cryptographically secured and auditable financial ledger, fundamentally transforming how trust is established and maintained. Streamline user experience Develop intuitive interfaces and features like Metamask integration to facilitate seamless navigation and management of digital assets for all users. Expand functional capabilities Incorporate mobile payment systems, third-party logins, and account creation features to enhance accessibility and support diverse transaction needs within the evolving cashless economy. System architecture of the proposed blockchain framework. Our system is built on using the Ethereum blockchain which is a decentralized blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ethereum provides a decentralized, public ledger system perfectly suited for secure and transparent financial transactions. Transactions are immutable and auditable by all participants, fostering trust and eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries. Among cryptocurrencies, ether is second only to bitcoin in market capitalization. Our smart contract is written using the solidity programming language. Solidity is a high-level, object-oriented programming language specifically created for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Smart contracts cannot be changed once they are deployed on the blockchain, in contrast to traditional software. Because of this immutability, extensive testing is more essential than ever. We perform unit testing and staging to ensure smart contracts work as intended without unexpected behavior or errors. Deployment of a smart contract to any blockchain network is the most challenging part using a local development environment. That's why we use Hardhat which is an Ethereum Development Environment. Hardhat facilitates the deployment of smart contracts to various blockchain networks, including Hardhat's own local network for testing purposes. This allows you to thoroughly test your contracts in a safe and controlled environment before deploying them. After that, we deploy out smart contract into the Seploia Testnet which is a public test network for the Ethereum blockchain. The Sepolia Testnet provides a safe and cost-effective environment to thoroughly test and debug our smart contracts before deploying them on the Ethereum mainnet. This mitigates risks and ensures a smooth user experience. Deploying a smart contract to any blockchain network requires gas fees, which are necessary to execute transactions on the network. To cover these gas fees, we typically need a cryptocurrency wallet that holds the native token of the blockchain network. This wallet allows to sign transactions and pay for the computational resources required for deploying and interacting with smart contracts. After completing the development of a smart contract, the next step is integrating it into a web application to enable user interaction. For the frontend development of the web application, we use React js which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js was chosen for its component-based architecture, declarative programming style, and large, active community, which collectively enable the development of highly modular, reusable, and maintainable UI components. React.js enables us to create a user friendly and responsive web application for interacting with our financial functionalities. By leveraging React's component-based architecture, we can ensure a modular and maintainable codebase. To connect our web application with the smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, we utilize a Web4-compatible library such as Ethers.js. Ethers.js was selected over alternatives like Web3.js due to its lighter footprint, improved type safety, built-in support for Ethereum Name Service (ENS), and a more streamlined Application Binary Interface (ABI) handling, which collectively enhance security and development efficiency. It simplifies complex blockchain operations like sending transactions, receiving transaction details, and managing accounts. This allows us to develop our user interface components in React.js while seamlessly integrating with the underlying Ethereum blockchain functionality. The system architecture, as depicted in Fig. The proposed blockchain-based framework relies on Ethereum smart contracts for executing core financial operations, including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and peer-to-peer transfers. Their computational and time complexities are analyzed as follows: Each step operates on fixed-size inputs, leading to constant complexity. The heaviest operation is elliptic curve point multiplication in ECDSA, which remains constant time for fixed key sizes13. In our prototype, execution time is not limited by computational steps, but primarily by block confirmation latency inherent to Ethereum's consensus mechanism. As with deposits, actual execution time is determined by consensus latency and network throughput rather than algorithmic growth. For n transactions processed sequentially, the overall computational complexity is linear: Practical performance is further influenced by blockchain characteristics such as throughput, consensus latency, and gas consumption. Gas cost analysis reinforces constant complexity, as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers consumed stable gas units (78,364; 61,207; and 41,667 respectively), regardless of input size13. By contrast, traditional banking settlements involve multiple intermediaries (correspondent banks, clearing houses), creating multi-step verification and reconciliation processes that may extend settlement to 2–3 business days17,18. The proposed framework introduces several technical innovations in its design that strengthen both efficiency and security of banking settlements: Smart contract–based settlement All banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers are executed by Ethereum smart contracts. This ensures deterministic execution, immutability, and transparency, reducing dependency on multiple intermediaries in traditional banking. Gas-efficient contract design The smart contract functions were structured to minimize redundant computations, thereby lowering gas costs while maintaining correctness. This enhances scalability and cost predictability for high-volume financial transactions. Wallet-centric user custody By integrating MetaMask and custom wallets, users retain full control of their private keys and assets. Unlike conventional systems where banks act as sole custodians, this design significantly reduces risks of centralized fraud or mismanagement. This bypasses centralized servers, ensuring that user interactions are securely and directly recorded on-chain. These provide fault tolerance, immutability, and protection against fraudulent or conflicting transactions, ensuring secure and reliable financial settlements. These innovations distinguish the proposed approach from prior blockchain applications in banking3,5,6. The quantitative evaluation of these design choices, including gas efficiency, transaction latency, and settlement speed, is presented in the Outcome and Result Analysis section. To situate our framework within prior research, we compared it against representative blockchain-based banking studies. Joseph and Karunan5 proposed a decentralized settlement system but without wallet-level integration or gas optimization. Bagrecha et al.3 outlined blockchain's potential in banking but presented only a conceptual model without complexity or latency analysis. Gas-optimized smart contracts validated on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet with real gas benchmarks. Seamless wallet integration (MetaMask/custom) ensuring user custody of funds. Our proposed blockchain-based approach system as depicts on Fig. 2, uses the Ethereum blockchain and Ether (ETH) as the native currency to achieve unparalleled efficiency and security within these critical financial processes. Our system leverages the capabilities of Ethereum to offer a core set of financial functionalities built upon the Ethereum blockchain. New user accounts are created on the Ethereum blockchain. This generates a unique Ethereum address for each user, acting as their public identifier and the destination for deposits and transactions. User can create accounts in two different ways. It's a method of encoding a private key so that people may more easily recall and record it. The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), is used to generate a 64-byte (or 512-bit) value from a private key in Ethereum. Using the Keccak-256 hash function to extract a 20-byte (or 160-bit) value from a public key and use that value to construct an Ethereum address. User can also use their existing account on the Metamask wallet to create account into our system. Users can deposit Ether (ETH) into their accounts. This process involves initiating a transaction on the Ethereum network and sending ETH from an external source (like a crypto exchange) to the user's Ethereum address. It is permanently recorded on the blockchain, a public and immutable ledger. This ensures the transaction cannot be altered or reversed, providing security and transparency. Figure (a) Meta mask creation, (b) Deposit Ether Diagram, (c) Withdraw-amount-diagram, (d) Transfer-ether-diagram. Users can withdraw Ether (ETH) from their accounts by initiating a transaction on the Ethereum network. This includes ensuring the user has sufficient ETH in their account to cover the withdrawal, and checking that the transaction adheres to any predefined rules or conditions set by the platform, such as withdrawal limits or timing constraints. ETH Withdrawal on Ethereum Network with Complex Validation Users can transfer Ether (ETH) to other accounts on the Ethereum network, by utilizing the blockchain's core transfer capabilities. Users initiate a transaction by specifying the recipient's address and the amount of ether to be sent. The Ethereum network validates and secures these transfers through its consensus mechanism, ensuring that transactions are transparent, immutable, and resistant to tampering. By enabling seamless and efficient ETH transfers, Ethereum showcases its potential to serve as a foundation for a secure and transparent decentralized banking system, where users have full control over their funds without relying on intermediaries. These core functionalities demonstrate the potential of Ethereum to build a secure and transparent banking system. Throughout this paper, we will dive deeper into the technical aspects of how these functionalities are implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, exploring the benefits and challenges associated with such an approach. Using blockchain technology, our proposed system combines user-friendly interfaces for smooth operation with transparent and impenetrable financial transactions. A user-friendly Reactjs online application enables peer-to-peer transfers as depicts on Figs. Etherjs enables smooth communication between these functionalities and the blockchain. The prototype successfully demonstrated near-real-time transaction processing for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers on the Sepolia testnet, with average transaction finality observed within seconds, reflecting the efficiency gains of a blockchain-based approach. This fosters security and trust by doing away with the necessity for a central authority. The implemented smart contracts, comprising approximately 500 lines of Solidity code, encapsulate core banking logic for managing user balances, processing transfers, and handling withdrawal requests. Their modular design facilitated independent testing of functions like ‘fund()‘, ‘withdraw()‘, and ‘transferEther()‘, ensuring robust and predictable behavior. Challenges encountered during development primarily involved gas optimization and ensuring reentrancy protection, which were addressed through careful code structuring and adherence to best practices. Deployment of Smart Contract is depict on Fig. Write a smart contract code containing fund(), withdraw(), transferEther() functions using solidity programming language and compile it using solc compiler. Specify the target blockchain network like testnet, mainnet. Create a blockchain account with sufficient funds to cover deployment costs and specify the contract bytecode and other relevant parameters like constructor arguments,gas limit, gas price etc. Therefore transaction history using our proposed system in sepolia testnet is shown on Fig. Users can connect to the blockchain and communicate with the banking application through MetaMask shown in Fig. This integration simplifies user onboarding and transaction signing. Once they have acquired the necessary amount of ether, their account will be established, allowing them to initiate transfers. Additionally, users can withdraw funds from the bank by submitting a withdrawal request for the specified amount, which will subsequently deduct the necessary ethers from their Ethereum wallet. Its speed is also high compared to the traditional system because there is no need to a middleman in our system. A comprehensive analysis reveals distinct advantages of our blockchain-based system over traditional banking frameworks across several key performance indicators. In terms of transaction speed, while traditional domestic transfers can be instantaneous, cross-border payments often incur delays of days due to multiple intermediaries and reconciliation processes. Our system, leveraging blockchain, enables near-instantaneous cross-border settlements, significantly reducing latency. Regarding costs, traditional banking involves various fees (e.g., wire transfer fees, foreign exchange markups, intermediary charges), which can be substantial. Our system primarily incurs gas fees, which are often lower for direct peer-to-peer transfers, thereby reducing overall transaction expenses. From a security perspective, traditional systems, despite robust measures, remain susceptible to centralized database breaches and insider threats. Our blockchain-based system, with its cryptographic security, distributed ledger, and immutability, offers enhanced resilience against data tampering and unauthorized access. Transparency is another critical differentiator; traditional banking offers limited visibility into transaction flows, whereas our system provides a publicly verifiable and auditable record of all transactions on the blockchain. Finally, user control is significantly enhanced, as users maintain direct custody of their funds through their cryptographic keys, unlike traditional banking where funds are held by the institution. In this performance benchmark, we have tested our smart contract's efficiency on Sepolia Ethereum Testnet. Unlike Mainnet, Sepolia Testnet uses the no-value token SepoliaETH to cover its gas fees. Throughput, gas cost, and latency are the key performance evaluation metrics. In our paper, these metrics represent the overall system's stability. In blockchain, throughput is the rate of transactions happening per second. Which is another important factor to consider. This provides a quick look at how fast the Blockchain is processing and validating transactions. Using these metrics, this study aims to demonstrate the efficiency of the Blockchain by comparing it with its non-blockchain counterparts. 9, we found that in the Sepolia Testnet, the Deposit, Transfer, and Withdrawl operations consume respectively 78,364, 41,667, and 61,207 gas units every time. The same method can be used for Transfer and Withdraw. For example, if we consider every deposit transaction on Mainnet with 78,364 consumed gas and at a gas price of 15 Gwei, then the cost for this transaction would be $4.11. Sepolia Testnet has a fixed block rate of 12 seconds, which means that every new block will be merged on the blockchain every 12 seconds, plus the time for the transaction to be picked up by a validator. We found that, on average, the deposit, transfer, and withdrawal take 16 seconds (Time to Inclusion) to write on the Testnet. TPS analysis of ethereum and traditional banking system. The ability of a system to handle transactions is determined by its throughput, which is expressed in Transactions Per Second (TPS). The Ethereum Mainnet (Layer 1) and the Sepolia Testnet are intended to be identical, and both are subject to network consensus rules. 11, which usually handles 15–30 TPS, is essentially constrained. This limits scalability but guarantees decentralization and security. Ethereum Layer 2s (such as Arbitrum and Optimism) overcome the limitations of Layer 1 and have the TPS ranging from 1,000 to 7,000. By processing transactions off-chain and submitting compressed data to Layer 1, they achieve a dramatically higher throughput. For comparison, the traditional payment system represented by Visa's global network (VisaNet) is a highly optimized, centralized system. This is based on the theoretical numbers of banking card systems, which claim 65,000 TPS for Visa and 5,000 for Mastercard, with their practical TPS ranging from 1300 to 2000 as shown in Fig. Our banking system, which is built on blockchain technology, introduces revolutionary concepts that fundamentally transform traditional banking procedures. By leveraging decentralized ledger technology, it ensures unparalleled transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions. The incorporation of smart contracts automates agreements, eliminates the need for intermediaries, and significantly reduces operational costs, providing users with a seamless banking experience. In our innovative system, we offer a range of cutting-edge features designed to enhance user engagement and streamline banking operations: Metamask connection We have developed a user-friendly button that allows users to effortlessly connect their Metamask accounts. This integration facilitates secure and direct interaction with the blockchain, empowering users to manage their digital assets efficiently. Account interface The account interface serves as a comprehensive dashboard for users to monitor their financial activities. Through this interface, users can easily view their account balance, deposit and withdraw funds, and transfer ether from their account with just a few clicks. The intuitive design ensures that even those new to blockchain technology can navigate the system with ease. All account interface This section provides users with visibility into all accounts that interact with our banking system. Users can not only view the transaction history of each account but also track their own transactions, fostering a sense of accountability and trust within the community. Using a distributed ledger, each transaction is tracked as a block that is connected to the one before it to create an unchangeable chain. Because there is no longer a need for middlemen, there is less chance of fraud and data breaches. Furthermore, our utilised blockchain uses cryptographic encryption to protect private data, guaranteeing its secrecy and integrity. Smart contracts automate procedures, reduce errors, and boost productivity. They are self-executing contracts with predetermined terms. Moreover, the consensus method makes it very difficult to falsify or alter the data because it requires several nodes to validate transactions. This coordinated effort guarantees the highest level of security for banking transactions while fortifying the system's resistance to hackers. Potential vulnerabilities could arise from smart contract bugs, user private key compromise, or sophisticated social engineering attacks, necessitating continuous security audits and user education. Our system's data is securely stored on the Alchemy Sepolia Testnet, allowing users to scrutinize every transaction's hash value, block number, date, transaction amount, gas fees, and other relevant details. This feature underscores the transparency of our system, as users can verify each transaction independently. Moreover, the architecture of the Sepolia Testnet ensures that no one can alter transaction data once it has been recorded. This immutability is a cornerstone of our banking system, providing users with confidence that their financial data remains secure and unchangeable. The combination of transparency and immutability not only enhances user trust but also sets a new standard for how banking systems can operate in a digital age. Through these advancements, our blockchain-based banking system is poised to redefine the landscape of financial services, making banking more accessible, efficient, and secure for all users. This guarantees that the funds of users are protected by our system and that there will never be any financial loss. Compared to the previous manually operated transaction applications, such as bank transactions, this is an upgrade. Transactions in a variety of sectors can be made quick, safe, immutable, decentralized, fraud-free, and transparent with Ethereum-based transaction systems. Finance firms will use decentralized finance, which eliminates the need for investors to deposit their money with a central bank. The results, while promising, are based on a limited deployment on a test network and without integration with real financial infrastructures. Future work will focus on extending the platform with mobile payment integration, third-party login mechanisms, enhanced security auditing of smart contracts, and usability testing with end-users. Specifically, future work will involve developing native iOS and Android mobile applications with features like biometric authentication and push notifications, integrating decentralized identity solutions (e.g., Verifiable Credentials) for robust KYC/AML compliance, conducting formal verification and continuous security audits of smart contracts, and performing extensive user studies to refine the user experience. Furthermore, rigorous performance benchmarks will be established to measure transaction throughput (TPS) and latency under various load conditions, and strategies for interoperability with existing traditional financial APIs will be explored to facilitate real-world adoption. A real-world pilot with measurable performance benchmarks and user studies will be required before deploying such systems in practical financial services environments. While our blockchain framework demonstrates potential for secure and transparent financial transactions, several limitations exist. First, the system was only tested in a controlled testnet environment and not connected to real banking APIs or financial institutions. This implies that the system's performance under real-world network congestion, variable gas prices, and regulatory compliance requirements remains untested. Second, the evaluation lacks formal benchmarks for speed, throughput, or fault tolerance. Third, the system does not include features like mobile application support, user identity verification (KYC), or audit compliance mechanisms necessary for real-world deployment. The absence of these features means the current prototype cannot address critical aspects of user onboarding, anti-money laundering regulations, or financial reporting standards required for practical banking operations. These limitations will be addressed in future iterations of the work. Ultimately, the vision for this research is to contribute to a future where blockchain technology serves as a foundational layer for a truly inclusive, efficient, and secure global financial ecosystem, moving beyond theoretical concepts to practical, impactful implementations19,20,21.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX and one of the most closely watched voices in crypto macro-analysis, has argued that the next altcoin bull run will be driven by utility, users, and paying customers, not hype. That's a distinct shift from the way things have been so far, where projects rely on hype and momentum to build up enough of a user base to establish themselves. In his recent remarks, Hayes said the era of projects thriving solely on token hype and venture backing is coming to an end. Instead, projects with real users, paying clients, and sustainable value-sharing models will shape the new cycle. That's distinct from previous cycles, where projects launched innovative projects – but never had a good market fit, never retained customers, and never generated the revenue they needed to stay alive. Each cycle brought new innovation, but many tokens eventually faded once hype outpaced product-market fit. Amidst this shift, one new presale – PepeNode – is gaining attention. Though it carries a playful meme aesthetic, it's designed around an actual mine-to-earn virtual node ecosystem, directly appealing to the ‘utility + user' vision Hayes outlined. At its core, PepeNode ($PEPENODE) transforms the familiar meme-coin playbook into a gamified virtual mining experience, where users deploy digital nodes, upgrade facilities, and earn $PEPENODE rewards – all without real-world hardware or energy costs. The presale offers $PEPENODE at $0.0011363 per token, with a total supply of 210 billion tokens minted on the Ethereum network (ERC-20 standard). Early participants can purchase via ETH, USDT, BNB, or even credit/debit cards and stake $PEPENODE tokens for 621% dynamic APY; you can learn more about how to buy $PEPENODE with our guide. The approach introduces a ‘mine-to-earn' structure designed for accessibility and engagement. It's a gamified approach to meme coin mining, delivering meme coin rewards without any of the technical and energy barriers typical of Proof-of-Work mining. The presale's appeal lies in its blend of meme familiarity with functional engagement, offering something to do, not just to hold. As Hayes noted, the market is turning toward projects that give users tangible reasons to participate. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home » News » Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Risks Breakdown as Traders Look for Safer Momentum Ethereum price prediction is on edge as ETH trades at $3,336.09, facing downward pressure and a red day across major exchanges. Maxi Doge, a meme coin built on Ethereum, has crossed $3.92M in its presale, offering high staking rewards while ETH struggles to hold the line. With RSI in deep oversold territory and whales shifting their capital, Ethereum's ability to hold key support could dictate not just ETH's short-term bounce, but the path altcoins and presale markets follow next. The current price of $3,336.09 reflects a 1.36% daily drop, and more importantly, ETH sits on a key support zone that's been tested multiple times this month. But if that support cracks, Ethereum could accelerate downward – and drag altcoins with it. The threat of a deeper pullback is real, and even meme traders are watching it closely. Robert Kiyosaki's “massive crash” warning may sound theatrical, but ETH's structure shows genuine vulnerability. A breakdown here could confirm his bearish outlook – and set off wider panic across the altcoin space. Even before today's dip, the token failed to reclaim $3,900, a level that has served as major resistance multiple times. Traders tracking Ethereum price prediction scenarios know that failure to climb above this resistance could lock ETH into a sideways or even bearish channel – especially if macro sentiment stays heavy. Altcoins, especially those tied closely to Ethereum's ecosystem, are already feeling this drag. Robert Kiyosaki is back with his usual warning: “MASSIVE CRASH BEGINNING.” He's told audiences that silver, gold, Bitcoin, and Ethereum are the assets to hold. But traders familiar with his past know he's posted over 30 crash warnings in the last 12 months – many of which were followed by rallies, not collapses. Still, this time around, Ethereum's chart is showing real weakness, and Kiyosaki's timing happens to align with the current breakdown risk. While some may dismiss Kiyosaki's words, the chart doesn't lie. And if this support breaks, the Ethereum price prediction narrative could flip fast from recovery to capitulation. While Ethereum struggles to stay above water, Maxi Doge is exploding in presale activity. With a staking pool already live and strong tokenomics, it's catching attention from ETH holders who want to stay within the Ethereum network but are looking for early upside, fixed rewards, and presale momentum. Traders aren't just betting on ETH anymore – they're rotating into Ethereum-powered tokens or best altcoins that give them more upside per dollar.

The digital asset infrastructure provider brings enhanced self-custody technology to financial firms in the Asia-Pacific region

Blockchain technology and digital assets, including cryptocurrency, are already moving beyond their initial limitations as niche technologies to shape a more accessible, secure and impactful ecosystem. Ninety per cent of finance leaders believe these technologies will have a profound effect on the industry within three years, according to a recent survey conducted by Ripple, a digital asset infrastructure company.

As compelling use cases emerge – from cross-border payments to tokenisation of real-world assets – the first challenge any firm must address is safe and secure custody. The institutional adoption of blockchain technology hinges on the ability to store, access and protect digital assets with confidence.

“The next wave of growth in digital assets won't be driven by retail speculation; it will be driven by institutional utility – and the foundation for that is secure custody,” says Jack Cullinane, Ripple's senior director, commercial, Asia-Pacific. “In hubs like Hong Kong, regulatory clarity is accelerating the move for institutions to enter this space.”

Across the world's financial hubs, including Hong Kong, regulators are moving to support these new technologies by ensuring that sophisticated, institutional-grade infrastructure is balanced with robust regulatory compliance for seamless, 24-hour-a-day usability. The city's Securities and Futures Commission's rules on digital asset custody ensure institutions manage assets in line with standards seen in traditional finance, reflecting the growing market need for secure, compliant infrastructure to support exchange-traded funds, tokenised funds, stablecoin settlement and cross-border treasury and liquidity solutions.

Secure crypto custody is critical to the global financial ecosystem. Ripple Custody provides the essential institutional-grade platform for securing, transferring and settling any class of tokenised financial assets. Ripple delivers the self-custody technology layer that enables banks and financial institutions to manage digital assets without compromising their existing security.</p>
