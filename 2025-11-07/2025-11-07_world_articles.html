Please make this work possible with a quick donation. Zohran Mamdani's historic mayoral victory on November 4 created a political earthquake both inside and outside New York City. With bold policies aimed at challenging the status quo in the U.S., a once obscure, long-shot democratic socialist candidate has become a celebrated new star of the Democratic Party — a party whose leaders continue to remain reluctant to endorse him. Mamdani recently unveiled an all–woman transition team that includes both municipal executives and former Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission Lina Khan, a leader in investigating antitrust and enforcing financial regulations who has taken on titans from Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Meanwhile, organizers who supported Mamdani are figuring out how to channel the grassroots energy of the volunteer mobilization that swept him into power into an ongoing movement to achieve his campaign promises of fast and free buses, freezing the rent for rent-stabilized apartments, and providing free universal child care. Kathy Hochul and the state legislators in Albany hold crucial purse strings for the funding of these priorities, analysts have rightly noted that a grassroots movement to reshape state-level politics and take on Wall Street will be necessary to realize Mamdani's campaign promises. Just as it was incorrect to write Mamdani off as a long-shot candidate for mayor, it is incorrect to write off his platform as unachievable: Grassroots political methodologies such as canvassing, public assembly, mass mobilization, protest, and political organizing that operate outside of of formal electoral politics make these ambitious policies more than a pipe dream. Most political commentators have a conventional understanding of politics: They expect elected leaders to engage in negotiations, based on political capital and personal relationships, to create outcomes. In this frame, power can come from formal and informal institutional structures, relationships, one's ability to tap into networks, moral positions, or certain kinds of momentum. According to this conventional understanding, someone like Mamdani, who polled at 1 percent at the start of his campaign, would not be considered a viable candidate for mayor. Yet there were many examples in Mamdani's relatively short but impactful political career that demonstrated his skill in effecting change by reaching beyond conventional and institutional means of legislative change. For example, Mamdani's orientation toward constituent services in his first years in office was the idea that nothing was “outside his lane.” Despite serving as a state assemblymember who focused on state-level issues in Albany, his office routinely helped constituents calling about municipal-level issues like traffic safety. Mamdani and his office didn't just tell constituents who to call in City Hall — his office helped turn constituents into organizers. Mamdani's brand of constituent services was aptly described as “sewer socialism,” as it focused on changing the political terrain in the community rather than only delivering services. To get a traffic light installed in a deadly Astoria intersection, Mamdani and his office didn't just tell constituents who to call in City Hall — his office helped turn constituents into organizers and to build their own organizations to become effective citizens in their community. Lessons From Mamdani's Role in Winning Debt Relief for Taxi Drivers Perhaps the most notable example of Mamdani's transformative view of political change was his work in 2021 on New York City's taxi medallion debt crisis. Many taxi drivers went into debt in order to purchase medallions, but the value of their investments suddenly dissolved when the city allowed ride-share apps to operate. As a result, yellow cab drivers could not pay their debts, and the average driver had $600,000 worth of debt. Even with lawsuits and a progressive Democratic mayor, cab drivers could not get their debt renegotiated. While Mamdani did not have a significant number of cab drivers in his assembly district, his connection to the New York Taxi Workers Alliance inspired him to get involved in the campaign to reduce the taxi drivers' debt, with the hope that his participation would draw attention from more elected officials. Mamdani's participation in this massive debt relief victory was hardly congruent with Cuomo's repeated attempts to characterize Mamdani as inexperienced and ineffective. Perhaps Cuomo was actually incapable of understanding this win as relevant political experience: Mamdani's role as an activist legislator made his accomplishments, and therefore his viability as a mayoral candidate, unintelligible for a conventional, power-brokering politician like Cuomo. Rather, just as Mamdani helped constituents build power through political organizing and mobilization, he built his political power through a grassroots canvassing operation that knocked on 3 million doors, and through the mobilization of more than 100,000 volunteers who built support for his affordability agenda. While his opponent Andrew Cuomo spent millions on ad buys, Mamdani's field operation and social media team reached young voters, and many new voters, resulting in over 1 million votes cast in his favor, leading to the highest voter turnout in New York since 1969. It remains to be seen whether the grassroots upswell that voted Mamdani into office will be powerful and enduring enough to reshape New York politics sufficiently to make Mamdani's affordability platform become a reality, but Mamdani's background as an organizer is clearly informing his efforts to fuel that momentum. His victory speech hinted at the importance of continued collective shared action, and a new coalition of Mamdani's supporters has emerged to continue building power and mobilizing to support his economic justice agenda. Because of the Herculean task that Mamdani faces — from the hostile federal government to institutional challenges at the state and city levels — this multiracial and community-based coalition has announced that it will continue organizing from the outside to build power for Mamdani's policies through lobbying, mobilizing, canvassing, and engaging in protest.

On Thursday, President Donald Trump rejected the premise that voter concerns about “affordability” and his administration's failure to address rising consumer costs played a role in the Republican Party's election losses earlier this week. In two gubernatorial races that were won by Democrats this week, voters who were most concerned about the economy overall voted for New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill (D) and Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger (D) over their Republican counterparts, with the latter defeating her opponent on the issue by more than 20 points, a CBS News exit poll revealed. An Associated Press exit poll also found that, while 6 in 10 voters taking part in elections this week believed their finances were “holding steady,” the vast majority of respondents said they were not “getting ahead,” while around a quarter of voters actually described themselves as “falling behind” when it came to their finances. Retail prices, specifically grocery store items, are indeed going up. Several specific food items, including beef, eggs, juice, bread, and more have seen moderate to extreme increases, year-over-year. “We just lost an election, they said, based on affordability. It's a con job by the Democrats,” Trump said, adding: Visibly upset over the matter, Trump continued to wrongly insist that prices were going down, not up. Everything is way down, and the press doesn't report it,” Trump insisted. You know, I call the Democrats con men and women. Trump's service to the billionaire class is currently manifesting a “K” shaped economy — one in which the wealthy do very well and continue to spend more, while those with moderate or low incomes are spending less. In addition to myriad other concerns, the shutdown is disrupting benefits for recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, which ran out of funding on November 1. Although the program has been funded without disruption in previous shutdowns, the Trump administration refused to fund it this time, even though a contingency fund for SNAP exists. “Faced with a choice between advancing relief and entrenching delay, it chose the latter — an outcome that predictably magnifies harm and undermines the very purpose of the program it administers,” McConnell said, adding, “This should never happen in America.” Food Research & Action Center (FRAC) president Crystal FitzSimons said her organization is “outraged” over the White House's appeal. “At a time when food insecurity is rising due to increasing grocery prices, the administration's legal maneuver sends a clear and devastating message: that the well-being of America's most vulnerable is not important,” FitzSimons said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Indonesian authorities said they have identified a 17-year-old boy as the suspected perpetrator of an attack that shook a mosque at a high school during Friday prayers in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, injuring at least 55 people, mostly students. Witnesses told local television stations that they heard at least two loud blasts around midday, from inside and outside the mosque, just as the sermon had started at the mosque at SMA 72, a state high school within a navy compound in Jakarta's northern Kelapa Gading neighborhood. Students and others ran out in panic as gray smoke filled the mosque. “The information I have is that the suspect is undergoing surgery,” Deputy House Speaker Sufmi Dasco Ahmad told reporters after visiting student victims at a hospital. “The suspect is a 17-year-old male student,” he said without giving more details. National Police Chief Listyo Sigit confirmed in a news conference at the presidential palace in Jakarta that the suspect was one of two students who were undergoing surgery due to suffering serious injuries in the blasts. Sigit said police investigators are still collecting all information to determine the motive, including how the suspect was able to assemble a toy submachine gun with words inscribed on it including “14 words. For Agartha,” and “Brenton Tarrant: Welcome to hell.” Most of the victims suffered injuries from glass shards and burns. He said the injured were rushed to nearby hospitals and 20 students remained hospitalized for burns, three of them with serious injuries. Videos circulating on social media showed dozens of students in school uniform running in panic across the school's basketball court, some covering their ears with their hands, apparently to protect themselves from the loud blasts. Some of the injured were carried on stretchers to waiting cars. Shocked relatives of the students gathered at centers set up at Yarsi and Cempaka Putih hospitals to seek information about their loved ones. Parents told television stations their children had wounds from being hit in the head, feet and hands by sharp nails and pieces of exploding objects. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority country, was struck by a major militant attack in 2002 when al-Qaida staged bombings on the resort island of Bali that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. In subsequent years, there have been mostly smaller, less deadly strikes that have targeted the government, police and anti-terrorism forces, as well as those considered infidels by militant groups. In December 2022, a Muslim militant and convicted bomb-maker who was released from prison the previous year blew himself up at a police station in West Java, killing an officer and wounding 11 people.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investigation ongoing after package was sent to the home of the US president's Air Force One Seven people were briefly hospitalized after a suspicious package containing “a white powder” was sent to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, home to the US president's Air Force One, on Thursday. According to a spokesperson for the base, someone opened the package sometime in the afternoon, and it was cleared up by early in evening. All those sickened have since been released from hospital – and the specifics of the powder, or the illnesses it may have caused, are unclear at this time. “Joint Base Andrews responded to an incident here today after an individual opened a suspicious package. As a precaution, the building and connecting building were evacuated, and a cordon was established around the area,” the base command said in a statement to WUSA9. “Joint Base Andrews first responders were dispatched to the scene, determined there were no immediate threats, and normal operations have resumed. The extent of their illnesses was not known. The outlet further reported that first responders from the base determined there was no immediate threat and had turned the scene over to the US air force's office of special investigations. CNN said that the room where the envelope was opened – located in a building that houses the Air National Guard Readiness Center – had been closed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several people have fallen ill at a key US airbase that hosts Air Force One after a package reportedly containing unidentified white powder was delivered to the facility. The incident at Joint Base Andrews (JBA) in Maryland on Thursday prompted an evacuation of two connected buildings, according to officials. A JBA spokesperson confirmed to the media that “multiple individuals felt ill” after a person opened a “suspicious package” that had been delivered to the base. As a precaution, the building where the incident occurred was evacuated and cordoned off and the scene was examined by HAZMAT teams, which detected no immediate threat. However, CNN has reported, citing two sources familiar with the investigation, that the delivery contained an unidentified white powder and was accompanied by political material. An initial field test conducted by a HAZMAT team reportedly did not detect any hazardous substances, though the composition of the material has yet to be confirmed, CNN said. Joint Base Andrews is the home base for Air Force One and other aircraft used by senior government officials. The most notable case occurred in 2001, when anthrax-laced letters were sent to media outlets and members of Congress, killing five people and infecting 17 others. The perpetrators have never been found. Since then, authorities have remained on heightened alert to sporadic reports or threats of powder-filled envelopes sent to government offices, election facilities, and military installations, most of which have proven to be hoaxes or non-hazardous substances.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, a passenger aircraft that can complete make the journey without stopping is in the final stages of construction, Qantas announced on Friday, releasing first images of the plane as it is assembled. With adaptations like a 20,000-liter rear center fuel tank, the Airbus A350-1000ULR will be able to fly for up to 22 hours straight. Qantas has labeled its plan for ultra-long-range services “Project Sunrise,” because the flights take so long they can encounter two separate dawns. When commercial flights are scheduled to start in the first half of 2027, they will shave up to four hours off the time it currently takes to reach Australia's east coast from London or New York. Although Boeing's 787-9 Dreamliner can fly 17 hours nonstop to Perth, on Australia's west coast, reaching the other side of the country has proven to be “aviation's final frontier,” as Qantas dubbed it in an Instagram post Friday. In 2022, it ordered 12 of the Airbus A350-1000ULRs for long-haul routes to and from Australia and the first is scheduled to be delivered in October next year. London to Sydney nonstop: 10 things we learned from the world's longest flight First, the aircraft's fuselage emerged from inside a specialized cargo plane, known as an Airbus Beluga because of its resemblance to beluga whales. All the key parts of the aircraft are now assembled, and it will be transported to a new hangar for engines and flight test instruments to be installed, Qantas said. Qantas reveals new first and business class cabins for ultra long-haul ‘Project Sunrise' flights As well as the groundbreaking flight time, the project aims to “transform how people experience ultra long-haul travel, through science backed design to minimise jetlag and maximise wellbeing,” Qantas CEO Vanessa Hudson said in a statement. Instead, there will be space for a “purpose built Wellbeing Zone” between the premium economy and economy cabins, as well as first-class suites.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Glen Casada, a former Republican state representative, was sentenced in September to three years in prison, and his former chief of staff, Cade Cothren, was also convicted and received a two-and-a-half-year prison sentence. The case centered on their actions after both had been driven from their leadership roles and were accused of running a scheme to win taxpayer-funded mail business from lawmakers. The moves continued a pattern of Trump, a Republican, using his second presidency to bestow unlikely pardons on political allies, prominent public figures and others convicted of defrauding the public. According to prosecutors, Cothren launched a company called Phoenix Solutions – with the knowledge and support of Casada and Robin Smith, then a representative. A “Matthew Phoenix” signature ended up on an IRS tax document. A purported associate of that fictitious person was portrayed by Casada's then girlfriend, prosecutors said. That all followed Casada having resigned as speaker in 2019 after a no-confidence vote by fellow Republicans due to swirling scandals – including revelations that he exchanged sexually explicit text messages about women with Cothren years ago. Cothren also left his post over those texts and racist texts, coupled with an admission that he used cocaine inside a legislative office building during a previous job. A White House official said on Thursday night that Trump approved the pardons for Casada and Cothren because the justice department under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, “significantly over-prosecuted these individuals for a minor issue”. The official spoke on background to discuss a pardon that had not yet been publicly released but said the case against Casada and Cothren involved constituent mailers, which were billed at competitive prices – and that the case was brought despite prosecutors not having received a complaint from legislators. Trump's moves for Casada and Cothren follow his earlier pardon of Rod Blagojevich, the Democratic former Illinois governor, and John Rowland, the Republican ex-Connecticut governor whose promising political career was upended by a corruption scandal and two federal prison stints.</p>

Russia's full-scale invasion has hit Ukraine's agriculture sector in every conceivable way — from blocked ports and occupied farmland to grain theft, trade disruptions, and direct attacks. But even as the sector struggles, Ukraine has become more dependent on it than ever before. With exports of metals, mining, and other key industries shrinking due to the war, agriculture and agrifood now account for more than half of Ukraine's annual exports and around 60% of foreign currency revenue, up from 44% in 2021, central bank data shows. That growing dependence is both a lifeline for Ukraine's economy but also proof of its fragility as it's forced to rely on a sector that is exposed to so many risks. Meanwhile, access to finance has dried up. Commercial banks have all but left the market, wary of the risks, leaving agribusinesses with no access to credit. Investment has been limited to domestic agricultural giants and international financial institutions focused on firms with large export capacity, where food security considerations justify lending. That grim picture brightens a little with news of an investment fund recently launched that is aiming to fill financing gaps and get much-needed capital back into the sector, particularly to medium-sized businesses. Ukraine-based Diligent Capital Partners and Dutch firm 2ndAries recently launched a 150-million-euro fund backed by the EU's Ukraine Investment Framework, offering both debt and equity to agrifood companies. According to Dan Yakub, founding partner at Diligent Capital Partners, Ukraine's largest agricultural firms account for about 20% of export revenue. Its current pipeline already stands at 500 million euros, he added, "and interest keeps growing." This interview has been edited for clarity. The Kyiv Independent: What prompted you guys to go into this investment together (with the Dutch firm) and create this fund? Dan Yakub: First of all, the war. Many companies we had invested in were completely shut off from financing — debt or equity. There wasn't an opportunity for companies to keep going. The lifeblood of business, loans or equity capital, wasn't there. During the war, it's difficult to get into valuation conversations with companies. So we thought there needs to be an instrument offering financing somewhere between debt and equity, where we don't have to start with valuation. We've done a lot of deals in Ukraine — confectionery, juices, cheese, milk, wine, seeds, export infrastructure, animal feed, pet food. The Kyiv Independent: Why did you and your partners decide to go with this particular financing tool for the investment? For investors, the key is that it needs to be a partnership with a European country. That's essential because most EU financing decisions happen at a government-to-government level. People who understand the context, risks, and opportunities are making decisions here, which makes the fund more nimble and responsive. Dan Yakub: Europe is the (part of the world) most interested in Ukraine winning and being successful. Also, many European countries have become successful in agribusiness. The Netherlands, for example, moved up the value chain — from commodities exports to finished goods and processing. The Kyiv Independent: How will you ensure the investments end up where they're intended to go? There will also be other reputable institutional investors. All of them care that this is a successful and safe investment. It's food and agribusiness — traditionally a non-monopolized or lightly monopolized sector. We're focusing on medium-sized businesses with investments of 10–15 million euros. These are Ukrainian entrepreneurs who built their businesses from the ground up. And here, once again, it's more of our bread and butter to understand who we're dealing with person-wise. We think, okay, we have this entrepreneur — they probably would have been in the market for some time, have dealt with multiple people, be it banks, development banks like the EBRD or IFC. Ukraine has open registers now, so much can be done from your desk before hiring a law firm. The Kyiv Independent: Realistically, how large is the pool of companies that are ready for investment through this fund? Dan Yakub: More than half of Ukraine's export revenue — about 60% — is from food and agribusiness. Large companies like Astarta, Nibulon, MHP, and Kernel make up maybe 20% of that. Some companies aren't ready due to structural issues — accounting, unpaid taxes, or legal problems — but overall, the pipeline is big. Even before announcing the fund, we had a pipeline three times the fund's size, around 500 million euros. The Kyiv Independent: What kinds of companies are you looking at? There are pure-play processors, integrated enterprises with farming, storage, and processing, and logistics companies in strategic locations. Ideally, we want value-added products — not just farming. One year can be good, another tough. That doesn't mean we won't look at farming businesses at all, but we will be more selective. The Kyiv Independent: At least 20% of funding will go to green projects. Biomethane is especially relevant in Ukraine now, and there's strong EU demand for it. For example, solar panels at agricultural enterprises could be purchased with the use of our funds, which are becoming significantly cheaper with battery technology — also fast growing in Ukraine. Companies want energy independence — solar and battery inthe  summer. How soon do you expect the first projects to be funded? There's preparatory work — collecting information, agreeing on terms, due diligence — so it takes a few months. Some projects are complex and take time to generate cash flow. We're happy to wait longer than banks for principal repayment. Dan Yakub: Their investments are guaranteed by the European Commission, which provides a backstop. Some investors are doing this partly to help Ukraine. The Kyiv Independent: How do you measure success? Dan Yakub: Making investments that yield maybe low- to mid-teens returns for investors, which would be a success regionally. Dan Yakub: War risks — like if Odesa port becomes inoperable. It's not even just the missile attacks, it's more that it's a very concentrated piece of sea that needs to be open for things to move in food and agribusiness. A very rapid return to normal could also bring too much capital and competition. That's a good problem to have, but it would make deals more expensive. Finally, human capacity — finding people focused on Ukraine, service providers — an outflow of those types of people or people getting tired, that would also be a risk. The Kyiv Independent: What is your vision for Ukraine's agricultural sector in the next five to ten years? And how do you view your fund's role in shaping it? We'll move deeper into finished products — starch, processed fruits and vegetables, substituting imports. The future is in capital-intensive projects: processing, logistics, and branded products. Ukrainian companies can succeed in global and European markets with branded products. Competing only on cost and volume will be politically sensitive in Europe. The Kyiv Independent: Right, when people are attached to brands, it's harder politically to block them.

The longest shutdown on record, now in its second month, has led to a government data blackout, making it difficult for policymakers, investors, economists and ordinary Americans to get a clear view of the economy. Though private institutions have stepped in with alternative data sources, economists have cautioned these are more limited in scope and could never replace government-issued statistics. While September's employment report, which was due on October 3, is likely to be published within days of the government being reopened, economists are not sure the Labor Department would be able to produce a full report for October as no data was collected during the month. U.S. private payrolls rebound in October, but some industries continue to shed jobs Data for the household survey is collected from a random sample of households by field workers, usually from the Census Bureau. “I don't think the household survey data will be published,” said Ron Hetrick, a senior labor economist at Lightcast. Should the government reopen next week, that would allow data collection for November's employment report. “The payroll data is actually a little different,” he said. “Companies are probably still tracking their payrolls ... they could potentially produce the payroll survey side of this, but I don't think the household survey is possible to do.” U.S. consumer confidence drops to six-month low as Americans worry about labour market Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bill Gates speaks at the annual Bloomberg Philanthropies Global Forum in Manhattan, New York City, on Sept. 24.Caitlin Ochs/Reuters When Microsoft co-founder and global philanthropist Bill Gates recently released a 17-page memo recalibrating his position on climate change, he knew controversy would ensue. In some quarters, though, Mr. Gates was met with pure elation. “Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely wrong on the issue.” That is certainly not what Mr. Gates said or conceded to. But he did call for a “strategic pivot” in the climate fight, away from focusing solely on limiting rising temperatures to focusing on preventing disease and poverty around the world. The memo included provocative quotes such as: “Although climate change will have serious consequences – particularly for people in the poorest countries – it will not lead to humanity's demise.” Now he's saying CO2 emissions aren't a threat to planetary existence, and he dismissed the “doomsday outlook” being propagated by alarmists in the climate-science field. So, does Mr. Gates truly believe this, or is he simply tapping into the current zeitgeist, which is decidedly cool toward climate initiatives, period? This, after Mr. Carney killed the carbon tax as one of his first measures after becoming national Liberal Leader, and ahead of the federal election. Analysis: Federal budget signals Carney's new tone on climate policy, but not much substance This is the same Mr. Carney who was once the UN special envoy for climate action and finance, and principal driver of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, which sought to encourage corporate investment in green initiatives. Even the respected U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations, a non-partisan think tank, recently advocated that the world give up attempting to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 C and instead prepare for an increase of 3 degrees or more. Mark Carney speaks at the 2020 UN Climate Change Conference in London, England.POOL New/AFP/Getty Images But the real villain has been Mr. Trump, who long declared climate change a fraud perpetrated on America by woke leftist radicals. But it's not just right-wing politicians responsible for the current state of affairs – COVID-19 played a role, too. Its worldwide disruption led to inflation, higher interest rates and more debt. It takes government funding to underwrite things like electric-vehicle rebate programs. This climate ennui is not just happening in North America. EU countries are bickering over the volume of polluting credits their industries can use to meet 2040 climate-neutrality targets. Some are demanding more flexibility, which usually translates into more time to meet goals, which means kicking the climate-change can down the road. He has the money to find workarounds, like air-conditioned mansions and cars. And the world will have to live with the burden of knowing it had a chance to do something about it, but didn't.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President's White House speech on cutting Wegovy and Ozempic prices delayed as man sways then faints A healthcare official collapsed in the Oval Office as Donald Trump announced a deal to cut the price of weight-loss drugs. He had been seen swaying and stumbling before falling. The US president was holding the press conference on cutting drug prices for patients with Medicare or Medicaid. It was paused for 30 minutes as reporters were asked to leave the room. As officials guided the man to the ground, lifting his legs and resting his head, Mr Ricks was heard saying: “You okay? Gordon, you okay?” The White House said a “representative with one of the companies fainted” but did not name him. Initial reports suggested the man was Gordon Findlay, an executive from drugmaker Novo Nordisk, but the company later said he was not there. Mr Ricks later said he was a “guest” of his company, Eli Lilly. Mr Trump also looked briefly at the man as he collapsed before turning towards the press gaggle, standing silently and awkwardly. So we had a little bit of an interruption, sorry about that.” He became faint, and if you've ever been in the Oval Office, you stand a long time, and it's warm. The White House's deal with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly will see the prices of Wegovy and Ozempic, also used for diabetes and other health issues, fall to $245 (£186) a month for patients with Medicare or Medicaid. A US-made weight-loss pill being developed by Lilly and Novo will, if approved, cost $149 (£113) per month for all Medicare and Medicaid enrollees, via TrumpRx. Mr Trump's weight-loss drugs deal will increase access to the treatments through Medicare, which is for people aged 65 and over, and those with Medicaid. The programmes together provide healthcare for almost half of all Americans. Under current rules, Medicare does not normally cover the drugs for obesity, while Medicaid coverage varies.</p>

BELEM, Brazil (AP) — World leaders warned Thursday that time is running short for urgent and decisive action to prevent the worst effects of climate change, and blasted the United States for its retreat from those efforts, as they gathered at the edge of Brazil's Amazon rainforest for the annual United Nations climate summit. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened a gathering of heads of state in Belem, Brazil, with harsh words for world powers who he said “remain captive to the fossil fuel interests, rather than protecting the public interest.” Allowing global warming to exceed the key benchmark of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), laid out in the Paris Agreement, would represent a “moral failure and deadly negligence,” Guterres said, warning that “even a temporary overshoot will have dramatic consequences … every fraction of a degree higher means more hunger, displacement and loss.” Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva sought to mobilize funds from world powers to halt the ongoing destruction of tropical rainforests and advance the many unmet promises made at previous summits. But reduced participation — with only half the heads of state in attendance as there were at last year's summit — showcased global divisions and set a somber tone. Leaders spoke in Belem as the U.N. weather agency announced that 2025 was on track to be the second or third warmest year ever recorded. The concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which hit a record high last year, continued to rise in 2025, as did ocean heat and sea levels, said the World Meteorological Organization reported on Thursday. There are concerns that the absence of the U.S. — which has at times played a key role in convincing China to restrain carbon emissions and securing finance for poor countries — could signal a broader rollblack of climate politics. President Gustavo Petro of Colombia, however, called out Trump directly, saying his absence was “100% wrong.” “Trump is against humankind,” said Petro, whose feud with his U.S. counterpart escalated in recent weeks as Trump accused him of being a drug kingpin and imposed financial sanctions on him and his family. Chile's left-wing President Gabriel Boric similarly singled out Trump, saying his claims that “the climate crisis does not exist … is a lie.” Indigenous groups also warned that Trump's inaction could embolden other countries to ignore the crisis. “It pushes governments further toward denial and deregulation,” said Nadino Kalapucha, the spokesperson for the Amazonian Kichwa Indigenous group in Ecuador. President Javier Milei of Argentina, who threatened to quit the Paris Agreement and last year pulled Argentine negotiators out the climate summit in Azerbaijan, also boycotted this week's meeting. That left leaders like U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron to confront not only the consequences of an intensifying global climate crisis but a daunting set of political challenges a decade after the Paris Agreement promised a new era of global cooperation. Lula, who has presented himself as a champion of climate diplomacy in the Global South and won widespread praise for reducing deforestation in the Amazon, seeks to leverage Brazil's moment on the world stage to push for action on curbing planet-warming emissions and helping poor nations adapt to the perils of climate change. “I don't want to be an environmental leader,” Lula said Tuesday. Those tensions are at the heart of the conference and Lula's centerpiece proposal — a new fund called the Tropical Forests Forever Facility that would pay 74 developing countries to keep their trees standing, using loans from wealthier nations and commercial investors. The conference will test whether Brazil can drum up enough money to make its ambitions a reality. Existing U.N. funds for climate loss and damage have drawn only modest contributions. Brazil's government on Thursday announced $5.5 billion in pledges to the fund from Norway, Indonesia and a few other countries. It remained unclear whether major world powers would follow suit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Any such forced conscription of Ukrainians on occupied land is considered a war crime under international law. Russian authorities doesn't just target the youth. In a January report, Yellow Ribbon noted that they tend to focus mobilization efforts on Ukrainians in "difficult life situations," such as orphans, children of people with disabilities, and boys whose parents are in the hospital with cancer or other serious health problems. Russia is also moving toward formalizing year-round military conscription starting Jan. 1, 2026, under a decree signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Orlen will deliver three cargoes of American liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Ukraine in the first quarter of 2026. In a closed-door briefing with journalists, Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, and Oleksandr Kamyshin, an advisor on Strategic Industries to the President's Office, said that the current production capacity (for this year) of the Ukrainain defense industry is around $35 billion per year. "I will give you a brief answer: there is nothing true in these reports," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. HUR claims that the drone strike on Nov. 6 led to a fire in the workshop producing an additive known as agidol, used for aviation fuel. The European Commission adopted stricter rules on issuing visas to Russian citizens, who will be largely banned from receiving multi-entry visas, the EU announced on Nov. 7. Denys Shmyhal's announcement comes as Ukraine aims to strike deeper into Russian territory in an attempt to disrupt its logistics and grind down its war machine from a distance. Ukraine has submitted a draft education law to Hungary that partly addresses Budapest's demands related to language policy in schools, Deputy Prime Minister Taras Kachka said on Nov. 7.</p>

Japan's efforts toward implementing Originator Profile (OP) in society was highlighted at a meeting of the world's largest international press organization. Originator Profile is a digital technology that allows internet users to verify the originator or publisher of online content, and the technology is aimed at enhancing security within the online space. Makoto Yoshiike, deputy secretary general of the Originator Profile Collaborative Innovation Partnership (OPCIP), took the stage on Thursday and introduced the efforts of OPCIP, which comprises 46 companies and organizations that are primarily news outlets such as newspapers and TV stations. “The safety of the online space will be significantly enhanced if a system like OP, which verifies the source of information, becomes an international standard,” Yoshiike said. OP embeds third-party verified data about the creator of online content, making it easier to identify fake or misinformation. Japan, especially OPCIP members, are currently working for adoption of OP. Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

WASHINGTON, November 7. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump believes that Washington, Moscow and Beijing can agree to reduce nuclear weapons.

"I think something like that could happen - the denuclearization," he pointed out at a meeting with the leaders of five Central Asian nations at the White House, commenting on the possibility that the US, Russia, and China could reduce nuclear weapons.

"I think that denuclearization would be a great thing. <...> I've spoken to President Putin about it, I've spoken to President Xi about it, and everybody would like to spend all of that money on other things, things that can benefit people now," the US leader pointed out.

"My doctrine would be denuclearization, because we have enough nuclear [weapons]," Trump stressed.</p>

WASHINGTON, November 7. /TASS/. The US Senate has rejected a resolution to block President Donald Trump from attacking Venezuela without congressional authorization, according to a live broadcast of the session by C-SPAN.

As many as 49 senators backed the resolution, and 51 voted against; a majority was needed for it to pass.

The document points out that "Congress has the sole power to declare war." "Congress has not declared war upon, nor enacted a specific statutory authorization for use of military force against, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, nor any transnational criminal organizations," the document notes.

CNN reported on Thursday, citing sources, that "the Trump administration is seeking a separate legal opinion from the Justice Department that would provide a justification for launching strikes against land targets without needing to ask Congress to authorize military force."

US administration officials, namely Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth, told lawmakers at a closed-door briefing on Wednesday that the US currently did not have plans, nor legal grounds, for attacks on land targets in Venezuela. They explained that the existing legal opinion authorized only strikes on the ships the US authorities believed carried drugs. The US Navy has conducted a number of such strikes since September.</p>
