                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Expedia is monitoring potential disruptions from the ongoing U.S. government shutdown and related FAA-ordered flight cancellations. The Seattle-based company is “watching the government shutdown very closely,” said Scott Schenkel, chief financial officer, speaking on Expedia's earnings call Thursday. Air travel is a relatively small part of the company's business — about $101 million in revenue last quarter. Expedia shares rose nearly 20% on Friday after the company topped expectations for its third quarter, reporting revenue growth of 9% to $4.41 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $7.57. Gorin, who is in her first year leading Expedia, called out an “exceptional quarter” for the company's B2B business. “We're moving fast and deliberately to ensure our brands show up wherever travelers are,” she said. Schenkel said AI is also helping internally: “Our virtual agents resolve over 50% of traveler queries. And when human support is needed, it delivers concise summaries to the agent, reducing our service cost per transaction,” he said. “While we saw continued momentum in October, we're keeping a close eye on economic indicators and remaining focused and agile amidst a dynamic macro environment,” she said.

Elon Musk is thinking about outsourcing some of Tesla's chip production to Intel Foundry and even establishing the company's own chip production operation, he said at the company's Annual Shareholder Meeting event. Musk is perhaps the first executive of a big company to consider building an entire semiconductor production facility due to the extreme complexities and costs associated with such a project. Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, already reacted to Musk's musings, noting that the head of Tesla may be underestimating the challenge. “I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab,” Musk said. TSMC calls its fab complexes with production capacity from 30,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month ‘Megafabs', whereas fab complexes with production capacities of over 100,000 WSPM are referred to as ‘Gigafabs.' To put the capacity into context: TSMC's Fab 21 complex in Arizona — which will cost the foundry $165 billion in total — is expected to become a Gigafab with six fabs, two advanced packaging facilities, and an R&D center. But let us decode the whole story first, as it takes more than money to become a chipmaker these days. “Building advanced chip manufacturing is extremely hard,” Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, said at a TSMC event on Thursday. As a major carmaker that also owns some of the industry's largest AI supercomputers, Tesla needs a steady supply of high-performance processors to power its artificial intelligence efforts. Musk also mentioned tapping Intel for chip production, though this might be a bit challenging as the company does not have any automotive-grade process technologies. “One of the things I am trying to figure out is how do we make enough chips,” Musk asked rhetorically during his keynote speech at the Tesla event. “So, I have a lot of respect for the Tesla partners, TSMC and Samsung, you know, maybe we will do something with Intel. We have not signed any deal, but it is probably worth having discussions with Intel.” However, he believes that his company will need more AI processors in the long term, which will necessitate building its own chipmaking operations, essentially becoming an integrated device manufacturer (IDM), a role that even established chip designers like AMD, Fujitsu, IBM, and Panasonic gave up in recent decades. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. “So, I think we may have to do a Tesla TeraFab. It is like [TSMC's] Giga[fab] but way bigger. Rapidus — Japan's first new chipmaker with plans to build chips on advanced nodes in decades — estimates that it needs around ¥5 trillion (about $32 billion) in total investment to develop a process technology and build a fab capable of commercial production of 2 nm-class chips in 2027. While we can only applaud this ambitious project, it remains to be seen whether becoming a leading chipmaker from scratch is possible in the 2020s and with leading-edge nodes. Developing a new process technology from scratch is a particularly complex, multidisciplinary endeavor that takes 5 or more years these days, from inception to yield ramp. Rapidus has licensed its 2nm GAA transistor structure from IBM, but it is also possible to license a chunk of similar technologies from imec and CEA-Leti, public-private R&D institutes. Once transistor technology is complete, engineers build thousands of tightly coupled process steps organized into FEOL, MOL, and BEOL modules — covering transistor formation, interconnects, and metallization. Each of these steps demands atomic-level precision in deposition, etch, lithography, and anneal. Tuning those steps (each with hundreds, if not thousands, of parameters) for manufacturability, uniformity, reliability, defectivity, power, and performance requires decades of engineering experience and time from the team. At this point, technology providers like IBM, Imec, or CEA-Leti cannot really help. Again, these integration recipes are not available for licensing from R&D companies or institutes. After device performance, power, and yield meet targets, the process must be made design-usable by generating PDKs, SPICE models, verified standard-cell libraries for EDA tools, and IPs for chip designers.

Unfortunately we did not make the heroic effort it would have taken to get a close look, so as with 1I/ʻOUMUAMUA we'll be left with enigmas and uncertainty.Unless of course it brakes hard into a parking orbit. :)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle's startup lawyers and bankers have long helped founders raise capital. Now they're pooling some of their own money to invest in promising early stage tech companies across the Pacific Northwest. A trio of longtime Seattle startup service providers — Minh Le of Stifel Bank and Craig Sherman and David Wickwire of Wilson Sonsini — are teaming up to lead the Pacific Northwest fund for Service Provider Capital (SPC), a national firm that invests region by region. SPC launched in 2014 out of Colorado with a unique startup investing model. It co-invests in early stage rounds led by institutional venture firms, typically writing smaller checks into those same deals. The investors — limited partners, or LPs — come from law, banking, accounting, and insurance communities, reflecting an effort to let the professionals who support startups also invest in them. Angel investors and serial entrepreneurs are also part of the mix, using SPC as a way to back more local founders. SPC has expanded its model from Boulder into other regions such as New England, Texas, and Chicago. It has raised 11 funds across six regions, investing in about 60 companies per fund. Jody Shepherd, co-founder of SPC, said the region felt like a “perfect fit” given its strong venture community and deep talent pool around tech giants such as Amazon and Microsoft. “Once we found a team like Minh, David, and Craig to lead the fund, plus an outstanding crew of well-connected LPs, an SPC Pacific Northwest fund was a no-brainer,” he told GeekWire. Le, Sherman, and Wickwire are mainstays of the Seattle tech ecosystem. Unlike traditional funds, the local managing directors keep their day jobs. They help surface deals through their networks, while Service Provider Capital makes final investment decisions. Diligence is minimal; meeting the criteria (early stage tech or life sciences startup in the Pacific Northwest raising its first round from an institutional investor) is often enough. The fund also aims to fill a gap left by longtime angels who've retired or joined venture firms, serving as a kind of “strategic angel” to help complete early rounds, Wickwire said. The Seattle startup ecosystem has long been critiqued for lacking local capital to invest in up-and-coming companies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If that's the case, it might come in handy next time someone nags you about your sleep hygiene. That's because a study published this summer in the journal Sleep Health suggests that adults' nightly bedtime screen use might not be as detrimental to sleep as previously believed. The researchers investigated the self-reported bedtime screen use (using screens in bed or within an hour of bedtime) and sleep health of over 1,000 adults in Canada. More than 80% reported being on screens during bedtime in the past month, and almost half reported bedtime screen use every night. It's worth noting that participants' self-reported claims about sleep health might not be as accurate as researchers physically tracking their sleep in a lab. Nonetheless, these results seem to challenge findings from previous studies. For example, in a 2021 paper, researchers write that “screen exposure, especially near bedtime, directly leads to poor sleep quality.” A 2023 paper on medical students in Egypt reported a remarkably greater occurrence of poor sleep quality among smartphone users at bedtime. A 2022 study explains that smartphone screens emit blue light, which can impact sleep quality. However, “the previous coverage of blue light has not factored in age, timing and intensity of the blue light exposure when making sweeping generalizations about this research,” Colleen Carney, a co-author of the study and director of the Sleep and Depression Laboratory at Toronto Metropolitan University, said in a university statement. “There may be reason to be cautious about excessive blue light exposure in the evening for teens as puberty increases light-sensitivity. As we age, we are not as light sensitive and there are age-related effects of the eye that make light less disruptive.” Adults' sleep health might also be impacted by how one uses a smartphone or similar device before bed, not just when. Sweeping Review Finds No Link Between Cell Phones and Cancer Adults can test out the effects of bedtime screen use on their sleep directly by monitoring their current sleep for one week and then monitoring it for a second week during which they don't use devices at least one hour before bedtime, according to Carney. “If you sleep and feel better with an earlier bedtime for your device, make it a new habit. If you don't notice a difference, like the people in this study, the device is not the problem we have been led to believe,” Carney concluded, though this might seem like a simplistic conclusion to some. As if we needed another reason to put our phones down. But at least the budget phone has a microSD card slot for storage expansion! Here's our list of winners for everything that blew us away. Nothing might want to pull out its reverse Uno card right about now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The product selection, available now on Android and iOS, will be available in its own app that's available in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Taiwan, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Nigeria. The app has significant overlap with Amazon Haul, which launched last November as a competitor to Shein and Temu. (Amazon using two names for the same low-cost selection of inventory is confusing! But Amazon thinks the different names “better resonate with local language preferences and cultures.”) The move to create a standalone shopping destination for its cheaper inventory signals Amazon is ramping up the competition with the low-cost Chinese shopping apps, like Temu, Shein, and TikTok (TikTok Shop), which have seen broad adoption by younger users and others without as much disposable income to spend on clothing, decor, electronics, and other household items. The Bazaar app will offer these users “hundreds of thousands” of affordable products in categories like fashion, home goods, and lifestyle products, the retailer says. Product pages feature familiar Amazon features like customer reviews and star ratings. Shipments take around 2 weeks or less, returns are free within 15 days of receipt, and Amazon offers multilingual customer support. The app itself supports six languages: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, and Traditional Chinese. New customers will also receive 50% off their first delivery as an incentive to try the app. Alphabet is increasingly launching ‘moonshot' projects as independent companies — here's why Elon Musk wants you to know that Sam Altman got a refund from Tesla AI researchers 'embodied' an LLM into a robot – and it started channeling Robin Williams</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That might not sound like much, but altogether, it has meant that some neighborhoods — like the Canal District that borders the bay — have sunk three feet, placing them at greater risk of flooding from sea-level rise. A new startup is proposing an alternative: raise the city instead. “The canal district is really far under sea level,” Laurence Allen, co-founder and CEO of Terranova, told TechCrunch. The city has been working with flood consultants to find a solution, he said. In San Rafael's case, the startup has quoted $92 million to lift 240 acres four feet. The company recently raised $7 million in a seed round led by Congruent Ventures and Outlander with participation from GoAhead Ventures, Gothams, and Ponderosa, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. Lifting land by injecting stuff underground isn't new. All of this is managed by software that Terranova has developed. When plans are finalized, they guide the robotic injectors, telling them both where to inject and how much. Human operators remain on site as a safety precaution, Allen said. Though some experts have questioned whether the consolidated wood slurry will exacerbate earthquake shocks, Allen said the most frequently mentioned alternatives have risks, too. “We think it'll help [with earthquakes] versus dikes and seawalls.” The company plans to make money by splitting revenue for projects with contractors. It's hoping the costs are low enough that the process will be attractive for a range of land-lifting projects beyond cities, including remediating wetlands that are disappearing either due to subsidence or sea-level rise. But given the urgency of rising waters, cities are Terranova's first priority. “I'm from San Rafael, born and raised,” Allen said. Tim De Chant is a senior climate reporter at TechCrunch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seattle startup Upward raised $8 million and announced a strategic partnership with Mastercard to make it faster and simpler for businesses to roll out financial products. Founded in 2021 by early Remitly executives, Upward provides infrastructure that lets businesses embed payments, cards, and banking products without managing separate integrations for banks, processors, or compliance. The 20-person startup focuses on customers that sell to independent workers, creators, and small businesses — segments often underserved by other fintech competitors, according to Aaron Gregory, co-founder and CEO. Gregory was general counsel at Remitly, where he helped the Seattle-based digital remittance giant go public in 2021. He co-founded Upward with Danielle Hill, former head of global operations at Remitly. Upward said it's processing more than $10 million in monthly payment volume. Scout, a name-image-likeness (NIL) platform for college athletes, uses Upward to manage payouts to athletes at schools including Alabama, SMU, Louisville, and Clemson. Unlike traditional “banking-as-a-service” providers that rely on multiple vendors, Upward said it rebuilt its infrastructure from scratch, combining cards, payments, banking, and compliance into a single, developer-friendly system. The partnership with Mastercard allows Upward's customers to quickly launch Mastercard-branded card programs, including access to Mastercard's Easy Savings and Business Builder programs. “For too long, businesses that wanted to offer a financial product have had to choose between innovation, flexibility, and speed,” Gregory said in a statement. “This investment and our Mastercard partnership will help to tear down those barriers — empowering our customers to launch and operate smarter, customer-centric financial products faster than ever.” AWS re:Invent connects you with global leaders, builders, and innovators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton late on Thursday said he is suing online gaming platform Roblox over child safety concerns, accusing the company of “deceiving parents about the dangers of its platform.” In a statement, Paxton alleged that Roblox chooses to prioritize “pixel pedophiles” and profit over the safety of children, and said the platform has become a “breeding ground for predators.” “We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators,” Paxton said. “Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. The company has come under fire repeatedly for not implementing adequate child safety measures and exposing minors to dangers like grooming, explicit content, and violent or abusive material. Other states, including Arizona, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Virginia, are also considering similar laws. The company has so far responded by adding a slew of safety features, including an age-estimation system that scans users' selfies and analyzes facial features to estimate age, standardized content and maturity labels, an AI system to detect early signals of child endangerment, safeguards for teenagers, content controls, and more. The company also offers parental controls, tools to restrict communications, and technology that detects when a large number of users are breaking its rules. “We are disappointed that, rather than working collaboratively with Roblox on this industry-wide challenge and seeking real solutions, the AG has chosen to file a lawsuit based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims,” a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Our policies are purposefully stricter than those found on many other platforms.

The Dutch government is reportedly ready to give up its control of Nexperia if Beijing allows its China unit to resume exports. The Netherlands seized control of this niche chip maker in early October after it raised concerns that its most important technologies were going to be transferred to Wingtech, its Chinese parent company. Beijing responded to this move by blocking Nexperia China's exports, which accounted for nearly 70% of the company's global output. Although Beijing has softened its stance on the export control of Nexperia chips, with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce allowing companies to apply for exemptions so they can get their chip orders going again, this adds a layer of red tape, and approvals are released on a case-by-case basis. This move meant that subsidiaries and affiliates with more than 50% Chinese ownership would be included in Washington's entity list. This would gravely impact Nexperia, as Wingtech has a more than 75% stake in the company. We don't know the reason behind the Dutch move, especially as its concerns about technology transfers don't seem to be resolved yet. But with Nexperia holding a big chunk of the automotive semiconductor market, car manufacturers in Europe and Japan would have to reduce their output or stop production altogether if the chip supply does not resume sooner, affecting not just the big corporations but potentially thousands of smaller businesses and millions of workers as well.

Premium headphones usually demand premium prices but right now you can grab the best alternative to Apple's AirPods Max for almost half what you'd pay for the competition. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones have dropped to an all-time low of $329 on Amazon, down from their usual $429 price tag. These sit in the ultra-premium segment where Apple's AirPods Max reign at $599. The QuietComfort Ultra brings spatial audio into your everyday listening and creates an immersive soundstage that makes music feel three-dimensional rather than flat. The headphones actually measure how sound moves through your ear canals and compensates for any acoustic quirks in real time. Three distinct listening modes give you control over your audio environment: 1) Quiet Mode delivers Bose's legendary noise cancellation, blocking out the chaos of commutes, open offices, or noisy neighbors. 2) Aware Mode lets external sounds through so you can stay alert to announcements or conversations without removing the headphones. This matters during video meetings when you're working from a coffee shop or taking calls while walking through busy streets. Comfort becomes crucial during long listening sessions, and the QuietComfort Ultra addresses this with soft ear cushions that envelop your ears without creating pressure points. The headband distributes weight evenly across your head rather than concentrating it on a single spot, preventing the headache that some premium headphones cause after a few hours. With Immersive Audio engaged, you still get 18 hours, which covers most people's weekly listening habits. A quick 15-minute charge delivers 2.5 hours of playback in standard mode or 2 hours with Immersive Audio active, perfect for those mornings when you forgot to charge overnight. This is the best Bose deal we've seen recently, make sure you don't miss that opportunity.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. I recently found myself googling “how to get your cat to lose weight” and stumbled upon countless Reddit threads and pet blogs with vague, often contradictory information. Full disclosure: This particular search was brought on when my cat's automatic litter box sent me a notification that my cat Basil was at the heaviest he's ever been—17 pounds. I often joke that Basil is just a big, corn-fed Missouri boy, of hardy stock. So I set out on a mission to find out how pet parents can get their often-overweight cats and dogs to lose weight healthily; especially for pet parents like me with indoor cats who live in small areas. Consulting a veterinarian is best if you suspect your pet is overweight in order to get on a healthy fitness and diet plan. But initially, you can usually easily tell if the pet is overweight by checking them from top and side views: “You should be able to feel the ribs with [a] gentle touch,” says veterinarian Daniel Dixon. “When you look at them from above, you should be able to [see the] waist, where the abdomen tucks in a little bit.” There are also body condition scoring charts for dogs and cats available online, with guidelines and visual representations of different pet weights, so you can easily compare your pet to the various body weights. Most often, you'll be able to feel the ribs and spine without too much pressure. These metrics are based on size and length, not weight in pounds, since every pet's body is different, and ideal weight for each will vary as well. For indoor cats, you may need to get more creative: As I'll say about mostly everything in this guide, make sure you consult a veterinarian before making any big changes, to get a plan tailored for your specific pet and their needs. Nearly all of the veterinarians and literature I consulted cautioned against raw diets, as they could harbor potentially harmful bacteria and may not have the complete nutrition needed for a well-rounded diet. “Raw meats mimic the natural or ancestral diets of cats as carnivores, and claim to have higher protein-to-carbohydrate ratios, along with increased antioxidants and flavonoids. But, considering their disadvantages, […] raw meats pose food safety risks due to pathogenic microorganisms,” says Choi. Like I said, as the pet tech writer here at WIRED, my cats basically can't pee, poop, eat, or nap without me monitoring it. This is one of the most effective ways to monitor their health and find when something is out of the norm (i.e., when my automatic litter box alerted me Basil was at his highest weight ever). There are so many types of automatic feeders, which can help with portion control (I've tested more than a dozen). Some models, like the Petlibro One RFID feeder, use a special tag to ensure only that a specific pet is getting their portion to prevent greedy animals from stealing more than their share; others, like the Petkit YumShare, have an AI-enabled camera to analyze the remaining food in the bowl and will stop dispensing to prevent overfeeding. Automatic feeders also help manage the gorge-vomit cycle that many cats struggle with. There are some automatic feeders that can be very helpful for this, especially since many cats enjoy snacking throughout the whole day, the ration can be split up into very small feedings throughout the entire day,” says Dixon. I've tested the above Tractive tracker on my cat and have begun testing the Fi Mini Smart Pet Collar in preparation for a brand new guide on smart pet collars. The smart health collar has been a great way to measure Basil's normal activity and sleeping patterns. I set up daily activity goals to ensure he's getting enough exercise, and the app compares him to similar cats and with his historical activity, measuring how he stacks up. I really love tracking his patterns and progress over time. I think it's worth trying out for anyone who wants to more closely monitor their pet's activity and set health goals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Oscar-nominated legend currently has three big ones under her belt—Ghostbusters, Alien, and Avatar—and next year, she's adding a fourth: Star Wars. “It was not my intention to find a fourth franchise,” Weaver recently said. Well, Weaver is one of the new additions in next year's Star Wars film, The Mandalorian and Grogu. And, in an excellent interview with Empire, Weaver explains why she decided to go to a galaxy far, far away. “So [with] The Mandalorian and Grogu, it was not my intention to find a fourth franchise, I didn't ever imagine that I would enter the Star Wars world. They're letting the universe exist, and tell[ing] really interesting stories within that.” “I think Jon Favreau thought, ‘Okay, we want this very strong character. Let's make it a woman,'” Weaver said. “I'm not sure it was supposed to be a woman. I think again, these days, they often think, ‘What do I need to do to make this seem more timely?' and now, because women are doing everything, hooray for us. [But] I just fell in love with the script and said, ‘I don't know anything about this world.' She didn't even know this movie was based on a TV series. She's coming at it with fresh eyes. And if she thinks this movie puts things on the right path, that's certainly encouraging. The Mandalorian and Grogu opens on May 22, 2026.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some US tech giants are abandoning their decade-long practice of publishing statistics about the gender and racial makeup of their workforce. It could also raise barriers for workers and civil rights groups seeking to reshape tech companies to better reflect the makeup of the countries in which they operate. Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia all released new diversity data this year. Disclosures over the past decade showed Google and dozens of other tech companies steadily hiring more women and racial minorities, though these groups were still underrepresented in technical and management roles relative to their overall populations in the US. Some companies also published additional data showing higher attrition rates for racial minorities and a lack of diversity in terms of disabled or LGBTQ employees. Microsoft chief spokesperson Frank Shaw said in a statement to WIRED that the company is not doing “a traditional report this year as we've evolved beyond that to formats that are more dynamic and accessible,” including “stories, videos, and insights that show inclusion in action.” He added that the company's “mission and commitment to our culture and values remain unchanged.” Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton confirmed the company will not be publishing a diversity report this year. Jesse Jackson and his Rainbow PUSH Coalition advocacy group, Google released employee diversity data for the first time in 2014. Several other tech giants followed suit later that year. “It's hard to address these kinds of challenges if you're not prepared to discuss them openly, and with the facts,” Google's people operations leader Laszlo Bock wrote at the time. Google went on to release 11 annual reports in the years that followed. This included data from 2013 through 2023, with the last report published in June 2024. And Microsoft's final update of this kind came in October 2024. He ordered federal agencies to “combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities,” including by potentially suing companies or fining them for prioritizing identity over merit in employment decisions. Google employees who spoke with WIRED say that a number of colleagues who focused on diversity-related issues have left the company or been assigned to new priorities this year. Employee resource groups have faced new limitations on their programming, and the company has even curtailed employees from posting fliers about community events on physical bulletin boards in its offices, these workers allege. Parul Koul, president of the Alphabet Workers Union, which represents over a thousand workers at Google and other Alphabet companies, alleges Google's decision to not issue a diversity report is an appeal to the Trump administration and an attempt to hide possible declines in workforce diversity. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Apple and Amazon also continued to voluntarily publish their annual reports to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which requires workforce race and gender breakdowns from businesses with over 100 employers. But recent federal court rulings and the Trump administration's stance on DEI threaten to obstruct future access. In the past, businesses' voluntary release of the EEOC filings and accompanying DEI reports have helped inform outside advocacy campaigns as well as lawsuits brought by current and former employees who alleged their workplaces discriminated against them based on their race or gender. Last year, the EEOC released a report based on over a decade of tech industry data alleging that “discrimination likely contributes to the relatively low employment of women, Black workers, Hispanic workers, and older workers in high tech.” Rights activists have described DEI programs as essential to fostering equitable hiring, and ultimately, creating well-rounded teams that are better able to understand customer needs and develop more inclusive consumer experiences. Julie Owono, executive director of the nonprofit Internet Sans Frontières, which advocates for tech giants to combat online hate speech in countries outside the US, says she believes DEI becoming a lower priority has led some trust and safety teams to take longer to respond to her requests. “I sense there is a lot of caution,” she says.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These devices are distributed throughout 16,460 Video Surveillance Technology Systems (VTS)'s, which make up a total of 48,156 installed cameras. Also known as “C5 poles,” each of these systems can incorporate up to five lenses and a camera with a maximum resolution of up to 4K, which allows for a 360-degree view. In addition to the VTS's, there are 17,629 camera-equipped poles. Each one has two cameras installed, an emergency button, and a turret to issue visual and audible alerts in an emergency. It is a fundamental piece in the security plan promoted by city authorities. “What is recommended is that when something happens, they go to open the folder and the next day request the video evidence, because [without an investigation file] they will not be able to access this information,” says Salvador Guerrero Chiprés, general coordinator of C5 CDMX. In fact, he shared that they receive around 160 requests per day from people asking for the C5 recordings to present as evidence in court. In other words, if an average of 640 investigation files are opened every day in Mexico City (232,476 per year, according to data from the 2024 National Census of State and Federal Prosecution of Justice), 25 percent of these have a recording from government cameras as evidence. In a survey conducted in 2025 by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, 75.6 percent of residents said they did not feel secure. Data shared by the head of C5 reveals that only a third of the city is covered by these cameras. “Nowhere in the world does it happen [that there is surveillance in 100 percent of public spaces],” Guerrero Chiprés says. “That is why there must be contribution from the whole community. If the community does not participate with its own cameras and also with its civic view, [security] is impossible, because there are more than 63,000 blocks in the city, and we have a presence in 20,000.” Although C5 is primarily known for video surveillance, this space brings together different ways to follow up on complaints from residents. As part of the modernization and strengthening of the video surveillance system, Mexico City is in the process of replacing older equipment and obsolete technology dating back to 2009, when the Emergency Attention and Citizen Protection Center of Mexico City was created. At that time, the first 8,000 cameras were installed. There are cameras that are able to keep recordings for seven days, others for 14 days, and the most recent ones have the ability to keep videos for 30 days. In order to reinforce the security strategy in Mexico City, the local government allocated 345 million pesos ($18.5 million) to purchase 30,400 new surveillance cameras as part of the “Eyes that take care of you” program. In addition, they have an internal alert system that warns of operational failures, which speeds up the attention to the devices in case of failures or damage due to use, factory problems, weather conditions, and even birds that nest on the video surveillance posts. In 2024, according to the response to a public information request, the C5 allocated 354 million pesos for preventive and corrective maintenance of all video cameras. By 2030, at the end of Clara Brugada's administration as head of government, it is projected that throughout Mexico City there will be 150,000 government video cameras installed in public spaces with a high concentration of people, as well as in neighborhoods and areas with high crime rates. In her book La Ciudad Videovigilada, Carmina Jasso López explains that terrorist attacks in different cities around the world triggered an increase in public investment for the installation of video surveillance cameras. No one knows exactly how many video cameras there are (estimates range from 600,000 to 900,000), as more than half of the devices are installed by private individuals—a model that Mexico City authorities are taking inspiration from. “We recommend that all private persons buy cameras, that all businesses have cameras—if possible, that they acquire cameras technologically compatible with those of the C5—to expand the video surveillance network, and that this task is not only of the central government, but can also be of the entire community, as happens in some cities in Europe such as London,” Guerrero Chiprés says. The installation of private cameras, however, also entails an undesirable possibility. In Mexico, all levels of government work daily to dismantle private recording equipment that is placed on public infrastructure such as poles or traffic lights, and which is used by criminal groups to monitor and react in real time to operations by public security forces. In her book, Carmina Jasso López also points out the importance of regulating both public and private video surveillance to protect the human rights of people, which could be violated by constant monitoring. According to Jasso López, there are three rights that could be violated if governments do not work and promote a regulatory framework: the right not to be discriminated against, the right to personal data protection, and the right to privacy. Research shows that “camera operators use a series of highly stereotyped and questionable markers related to a citizen's age, race, clothing, and behavior to identify people who deserve special attention,” she adds. Questioned on the matter, Salvador Guerrero Chiprés affirmed that the ethical limits in the operation of video surveillance cameras are bound by the Federal Law for the Protection of Personal Data in Possession of Individuals (and by extension, in possession of institutions), as well as by all laws and regulations related to public security. According to the research conducted by Jasso López, although Mexico does not have a national legal framework on video surveillance, different cities around the world have already made significant progress in regulating these and other ethical dilemmas.
