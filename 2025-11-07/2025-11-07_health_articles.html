                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although national programs in cancer prevention and early detection have improved survival rates, regional inequalities persist. At the same time, lifestyle-related risk factors such as smoking, alcohol use, and obesity continue to rise. Due to these challenges, a comprehensive analysis of long-term cancer mortality trends and future projections was needed to inform national prevention strategies. A research team from the Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College has published (DOI: 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2025.0158)new findings in Cancer Biology & Medicine, revealing national cancer mortality trends from 2013 to 2021 and projections through 2030. Drawing on 2.37 billion person-years of data from the China Causes of Death Surveillance System, the study reports significant overall declines in cancer mortality but warns that population aging and regional disparities will continue to drive increases in absolute cancer deaths nationwide. The researchers analyzed mortality data from 605 surveillance sites across 31 provinces, representing 24% of China's population. Using age-period-cohort modeling, they calculated age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and projected trends through 2030. Urban areas achieved faster reductions (-3.0% per year) than rural ones (-2.0%), highlighting persistent inequalities. Decomposition analysis revealed that population aging contributed 20-50% of the increases in differentcancer deaths. By 2030, lung cancer will remain the leading cause of cancer-related death in both genders, followed by liver, colorectal, gastric, and esophageal cancers in men, and colorectal, liver, gastric, and breast cancers in women. The team estimates that 2.4 million people will die from cancer in 2030 despite continued improvements in mortality rates, underscoring the dual challenges of an aging society and unequal healthcare access. China has made remarkable strides in reducing cancer mortality through nationwide screening and risk-control programs. However, the demographic shift toward an older population means that absolute cancer deaths will continue to rise. The study provides a crucial evidence base for policy decisions aimed at reducing China's future cancer burden. Strengthening early screening in rural areas, promoting HPV and HBV vaccination, and encouraging healthier lifestyles could significantly reduce mortality in high-risk populations. Moreover, expanding cancer control into rural revitalization strategies can ensure that prevention and treatment reach underserved areas. The researchers suggest that coordinated national efforts to address environmental, behavioral, and demographic factors could not only lower cancer mortality but also serve as a model for other developing countries facing similar aging-related health transitions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This article and associated images are based on a poster originally authored by Paulina Chorobik, Maciej B. Olszewski, John Vincent and Kirsty Winn and presented at ELRIG Drug Discovery 2025 in affiliation with Selvita. The information contained is for informational purposes only and should not be considered validated by independent peer assessment. Target engagement is a key step in early-stage drug discovery, offering valuable insight into a compound's efficacy and mechanism of action. This is typically assessed by measuring how well a drug binds to its intended therapeutic target. To make these findings more meaningful, it's important to evaluate target engagement within a cellular and disease-relevant context - one that includes the appropriate cytoplasmic mediators and proteins. Adding this biological complexity helps ensure the results reflect real-world conditions. Measuring compound engagement with a validated target early in the screening cascade provides a strategic advantage, as it can accelerate the identification and prioritization of promising drug candidates. Here, a proprietary Chemical Protein Stability Assay (CPSA) is described that directly measures drug–target interactions in cellular lysates. CPSA is a distinctive technology licensed to Selvita from Medicines Discovery Catapult (MDC). After exposing cells or lysates to compounds of interest, the protein target is treated with a chemical denaturing agent, and the proportion of the protein in its folded and denatured states are assessed. This leads to a shift in the denaturant concentration response curve compared to a suitable control and indicates that the protein and the compound are bound to one another. Few steps make it simple to run, the use of lysates reduces variability and removes any need for protein generation, and there is no requirement for specialist equipment or high temperature incubations. EC50 comparison between CPSA and an alternative thermal denaturation assay. Target engagement to p38 was assessed for the same compound set in both chemical (CPSA) and thermal (commercially available alternative) denaturation assay formats. Cellular lysates were screened in a 384-well format. There was significant correlation between the two technologies (r = 0.79 p=,0.0001). Measurement of protein stability in multiple detection technologies. This potency shift was detected by AlphaLISA, HiBiT and Western blot technologies. Denatured proteins disrupt the mechanism of action of detection technologies, resulting in disruption to protein proximity measurements or antibody binding. Here a different chemical denaturant was used for each technology and a final denaturant concentration determined for subsequent experiments. Application of CPSA to multiple cellular targets. Lysates were generated from HeLa (p38) or HEK cells (BTK & KRAS) overexpressing HiBiT-tagged target proteins. For each target, the optimal chemical denaturant type and concentration was determined. [A] shows an example of this for p38. Assays were run in 96-well (p38) or 384-well (BTK & KRAS) microtiter plates with the appropriate denaturant. Protein binding was measured via the Nano-Glo® HiBiT Lytic Detection System. [B] Target appropriate control compounds were screened in concentration response to determine pXC50s. There was parity between XC50s independent of the detection technology used. [C] Two inhibitors of KRAS were screened against HiBiT tagged WT protein or the G12C mutation. CPSA is a target engagement technology that has demonstrated comparable pharmacology and data quality to commercial temperature-driven protein stability assays - for the targets tested. Its cost-effectiveness, streamlined HTS-compatible workflow, and scalability make CPSA a practical and efficient screening tool for assessing cellular target engagement in drug discovery programs. Selvita has successfully applied CPSA across multiple protein targets and continues to collaborate with Medicines Discovery Catapult to broaden its applications.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Wayne State University will work with Michigan agencies and education partners to improve access to school-based substance use prevention and treatment programs for adolescents who are at risk of substance misuse and substance use disorders (SUDs). Dr. Andria B. Eisman, associate professor of community health in Wayne State's College of Education, will lead the study, "Reducing Addiction through Prevention Infrastructure Development (RAPID)." According to Eisman, preventing opioid and other drug use problems before they begin or escalate provides substantial benefits to individuals, communities and society. While schools offer a crucial setting for implementing evidence-based prevention and early intervention programs to mitigate these risks and promote positive development, many lack the infrastructure required for sustained delivery and long-term impact of school-based services for youth at risk of SUDs. This project will address this critical need by building upon our research team's prior work, Rapid Adaptation to Prevent Drug Use, to establish a sustainable infrastructure for multi-tiered SUD prevention in high schools. We will work collaboratively with our state agency, community and education partners, and leverage a unique resource in our state, the network of Regional School Health Coordinators, to aid schools in building essential capacity to support substance use services." The project will also give the research team an opportunity to examine effective financing strategies for implementing substance use services in school settings. The team will identify feasible funding options and create a roadmap to guide their selection, supporting RAPID's goal of improving sustainability of these essential services. which will allow them to conduct a large-scale trial of the RAPID infrastructure-building strategies and determine costs and return on investment compared to standard technical assistance. "This research will offer critical tools needed for the prevention and intervention of substance use disorders," said Dr. Ezemenari M. Obasi, vice president for research & innovation at Wayne State University. "In addition, this program led by Dr. Eisman could create cost-effective strategies that ultimately impact public health by lowering the risk of substance use disorders throughout the lifespan. I look forward to the important outcomes of this research."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The discovery could serve as a starting point for antiviral strategies. A research team at Ruhr University Bochum, Germany, has identified a previously unknown cellular mechanism crucial to the replication of coronaviruses: c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated during infection with human coronavirus HCoV-229E and mediates the phosphorylation of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein, an integral step in the virus cycle. These results aid in better understanding virus-host interactions and may open new approaches to exploring antiviral strategies in the long term. The team led by Dr. Yannick Brüggemann and Professor Eike Steinmann reports its findings in the journal npj Viruses from September 18, 2025. By using live-cell microscopy, quantitative immunofluorescence, and biochemical analyses, the researchers were able to demonstrate that JNK is specifically activated in infected cells. They used a kinase translocation reporter (KTR) to directly visualize the marked increase in JNK activity approximately 16 hours after infection. If the kinase is blocked by specific inhibitors, virus production was reduced significantly. In cooperation with the group led by Professor Michael Kracht at University of Giessen, the team was also able to show that JNK phosphorylates specific serine residues on the N protein. These sites are conserved in various coronaviruses, indicating that JNK plays a joint role in the replication of various virus types. Our data highlight JNK as an important host factor that is directly involved in the modification of the N protein, a critical step in virus replication." "The fact that inhibition of JNK hampers the replication of both HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 shows the potential of this signal pathway as a future starting point for new antiviral agents," adds Steinmann. The team in Bochum was given access to state-of-the-art live-cell microscopy and was thus able to conduct the critical experiments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a national effort to make medicines safer for older Australians, the University of South Australia is calling for aged care providers and pharmacists to join a new pilot study to assess medication safety and management in residential aged care. Chief Investigator UniSA's Associate Professor Janet Sluggett says person-centred medication management has never been more important in residential aged care. Pharmacists are critical to ensuring medications are used safely and effectively among residents of aged care homes, but until now, there hasn't been a structure for comprehensively evaluating quality use of medicines in this setting. Our framework gives aged care homes and pharmacists structure and support to deliver high-quality, consistent care, under five key domains relating to medication management. It helps on-site pharmacists measure impact, contributes to clinical governance, and promotes discussion with care teams, residents, and families to achieve person-centred care. Importantly, it identifies enablers that facilitate the quality use of medicines and supports ongoing improvement, as well as highlighting aspects of medicines-related care that matter most to residents." Alarmingly, 98% of people living in aged care facilities have at least one medication-related problem, with many prescribed potentially inappropriate medicines. Around one third of all residents in aged care homes are hospitalised each year, and 17% of unplanned hospital admissions are caused by an inappropriate medicine. As the first structured, evidence-based approach to monitor, evaluate, and continually improve the quality of medication management and pharmacist-led care in Australian aged care homes, the new framework aims to help care providers reduce risks linked to polypharmacy and support medicines to be used in the best possible way. Anne-Marie Gillard, Operational Services Executive from Eldercare says the PHARMA-Care Project sets a new national benchmark for quality use of medicines in aged care homes. "Eldercare is proud to be involved in this visionary work which will drive excellence and deliver safer outcomes across the sector." "It provides guidance to credentialed pharmacists in their role to improve quality use of medicines amongst patients in residential aged care homes." Senior Research Fellow UniSA's Dr Sara Javanparast says the team is now disseminating and testing the framework's quality indicators in aged care homes across Australia and are seeking expressions of interest from aged care providers and on-site pharmacists interested in participating. "Assessing this framework is an important step towards building a national quality monitoring system for medication safety in aged care," Dr Javanparast says. "By partnering with pharmacists and aged care providers, we can ensure the new program delivers on its aim of safer medicines, better communication, and improved quality of life for aged care residents."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aerobic and resistance exercise can significantly improve physical performance in patients living with metastatic breast cancer according to new results presented at the Advanced Breast Cancer Eighth International Consensus Conference (ABC8) today (Friday). "Until now, there has been limited evidence that physical exercise can improve muscle mass and strength in patients with metastatic cancer, partly because they were often excluded from studies," said Professor May. "Treatments for the disease can affect patients' quality of life, with debilitating side effects such as fatigue, nausea and pain. Combined with the underlying disease itself, the treatment and physical inactivity, these factors often cause a decrease in skeletal muscle mass, which negatively affects body composition, muscle strength and functional performance. "In patients who are having chemotherapy for localised or advanced breast cancer, low muscle mass has been associated with increased treatment-related toxicities, more frequent dose reductions, as well as poorer treatment outcomes and survival. In addition, hormonal therapy is associated with low muscle mass. "Exercise has proven to be effective in patients with non-metastatic disease. The PREFERABLE-EFFECT study is the largest study to date to investigate whether physical exercise is a viable and effective option for patients with advanced breast cancer." The study is an international, randomised controlled trial involving centres from five European countries (Germany, Poland, Spain, Sweden and The Netherlands) and Australia. It enrolled 357 patients with stage IV metastatic breast cancer between 2019 and 2022. Most were receiving first or second line treatment and 74% had bone metastases. All participants received an activity tracker [3], and general advice to take part in a physical activity for 30 or more minutes a day. "After six months, we found that exercise significantly improved physical performance, including balance and muscle strength at three and six months," said Prof. May. "Whole body lean mass, which is an indicator of muscle mass, increased in the exercise group, while a decrease in the control group was seen. Compared to the control group, muscle mass was on average 0.79 kg higher after three months, which was significantly different, and 0.32 kg higher after six months in the exercise group." At three months it had increased by an average of 0.6 kg and by 0.48 kg at six months, compared to the control group. The skeletal muscle mass index, which is like body mass index (BMI) for muscles, also increased by an average of 0.22 kg/m2 after three months and 0.18 kg/m2 after six months compared to the control group. These measurements for muscle mass in the arms and legs are important because they are responsible for movement and load bearing; therefore, deterioration is an important indicator of skeletal muscle loss resulting in frailty. Prof. May said: "Importantly, balance improved in the exercise group. Preventing falls is particularly important in patients with bone metastases as they have an increased of fractures. One patient, who had balance problems, was not able to get on and off a bus at the start of the study. The ABC Global Alliance will be launching a Physical Activity Resource Hub in early 2026. "As a cancer physiotherapist, I have seen how physical exercise brings great benefits to patients. Ms Eva Schumacher-Wulf, who is a patient living with metastatic ABC, editor-in-chief of the German cancer magazine Mamma Mia! and a member of the working group developing the physical exercise hub, said: "We all know how important exercise is – for quality of life and perhaps even prognosis. However, people with advanced cancer have special needs, and not every exercise programme is feasible or suitable. That is why targeted exercise programmes are so important for these patients." In the management of advanced or metastatic breast cancer it is fundamental to find a good balance between quantity and quality of life. By learning how to best exercise, the patient can directly improve her or his quality of life and regain some control over the disease."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at Moffitt Cancer Center have developed a novel biomaterial-based system that induces the formation of tertiary lymphoid-like structures, or TLSs. These immune cell clusters are increasingly linked to improved outcomes and treatment responses in cancer. However, many tumors lack these structures, which can limit the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Understanding how TLSs form and function has been challenging because traditional laboratory models cannot easily reproduce them. Using an innovative approach, researchers created a biodegradable, injectable hydrogel that slowly releases immune-signaling molecules, including chemokines and cytokines, beneath the skin. When tested in mice, these induced immune clusters supported the activation of tumor-targeting T cells and slowed tumor growth. Why are TLSs such an important focus in cancer immunology right now? The presence of TLSs is increasingly shown to associate with better patient outcomes and improved responses to immunotherapies, making them a key focus in cancer immunology research today. The origins and functions of TLSs in antitumor immunity remain poorly understood, mainly because suitable mouse models have been lacking. In this study, we developed a biomaterial-based system that induces TLS-like structures in a controlled way, which can be used both as preclinical models to study how TLSs form and function within tumors and as platforms to explore new therapeutic strategies that harness these structures to boost antitumor immunity. Can you explain, in simple terms, how your biomaterial system works? We designed biodegradable materials that release immune-signaling molecules, such as chemokines and cytokines, after being injected under the skin. These signals attract immune cells, like T cells and B cells, to the site, where they begin to organize into structures that resemble TLSs found in tumors, allowing us to study how these structures form and function. How might this research eventually benefit cancer patients, especially those whose tumors lack TLSs? By learning how to trigger TLS formation, we hope to help the immune system better recognize and attack these tumors, improving treatment options for patients who currently have limited responses to immunotherapies. Chemokine/cytokine-releasing biomaterials induce in situ tertiary lymphoid–like structures and enhance antitumor immunity.

These findings provide evidence that COVID vaccination has an important secondary effect in helping to mitigate the risk of long COVID in adolescents." Melissa Stockwell, pediatrician at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and clinical senior author of the study The RECOVER research team estimates that approximately 5.8 million youths have experienced long COVID which can include prolonged symptoms such as daytime fatigue, joint and muscle aches, and memory problems. Previous studies have shown that vaccination against COVID-19 can reduce the risk of long COVID in adults. But evidence of a similar benefit among youths has been limited. The researchers found that the risk of developing long COVID was over 20% among unvaccinated youths and about 13% among those who were vaccinated-representing a 36% reduction in risk after vaccination. "Every day, our study sees young people who are unable to fully participate in the activities they enjoy while they deal with long COVID symptoms," says Stockwell. "While our study did not look at the effects of COVID vaccination in adolescents with subsequent infections, our findings strongly suggest that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 could allow many more adolescents to live their lives normally after COVID infection."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers using the U.S. government's own cost model found that while the Harvard diet is affordable under SNAP, the Mediterranean and DASH diets remain out of reach for many, exposing how benefit limits restrict access to proven, disease-preventive nutrition. Study: An Analysis of the Affordability of Harvard, Mediterranean and DASH Eating Patterns for Individuals Enrolled in the Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). In a recent study published in the journal Nutrients, researchers investigated whether the United States' Supplementary Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are sufficient to cover three recognized healthy eating patterns. The study leveraged the U.S. government's cost-analysis framework, finding that the Mediterranean (MED) and DASH diets, both proven to reduce chronic disease, are unaffordable for individuals with higher caloric needs, creating a documented “poverty tax” on health. The SNAP provides monthly funds to help low-income households, which account for over 12% of Americans, purchase food. SNAP benefits are based on the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), a market-basket model designed to represent a nutritionally balanced, low-cost diet. Despite its purpose, the TFP has long faced criticism for prioritizing cost-cutting over realistic nutrition and equity. Critics argue it assumes recipients have sufficient time to cook from scratch and access to affordable, healthy ingredients, conditions that are rarely met. These diets are widely recognized for their ability to reduce chronic disease and promote cardiovascular health. Yet, a crucial question remains: Can SNAP participants actually afford these healthier diets within their benefits? To answer this, researchers used the 2021 U.S. government TFP mathematical framework as an economic model to assess whether SNAP benefits cover the costs of the Harvard Healthy Eating Pattern (HHEP), MED, and DASH diets. The model calculated diet plans for 15 predefined age and sex groups (e.g., “Female 20–50,” “Male 14–19”), ensuring that each met nutritional standards and food group proportions while reflecting typical American eating habits. All diets were nutritionally achievable, but costs varied substantially. For beneficiaries requiring more than 2,100 calories daily, both diets exceeded SNAP's maximum allowance. The DASH diet surpassed the limit in 6 of 10 modeled age groups (ages 14 and above), costing on average $2.37 more per day. For males aged 20–50 (a 3,000-calorie group), the SNAP benefit was $8.54 per day, but the DASH diet cost $13.60, which is over 50% higher. This disparity reflects existing socioeconomic patterns, where wealthier individuals are more likely to follow the MED diet. The study concludes that SNAP benefits, based on 2021 federal data, are insufficient for many recipients to adopt the MED or DASH diets. This shortfall effectively creates a “poverty tax” that prevents low-income individuals from accessing diets linked to longer life expectancy and lower disease risk. As federal budget projections propose $187 billion in SNAP cuts through 2034, this inequality may deepen unless policymakers revise benefit calculations to reflect true food costs and caloric needs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By creating high-resolution cellular and molecular visual maps of lung cancer before and during development, researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have discovered that the earliest stages of lung cancer may be driven by inflammation, suggesting that targeting proinflammatory pathways could be an early intervention approach. The research was led by Humam Kadara, Ph.D., professor of Translational Molecular Pathology, and Linghua Wang, M.D., Ph.D., professor of Genomic Medicine, associate member of the James P. Allison Institute™ and focus area co-lead with the Institute for Data Science in Oncology. We find that the earliest cells that give rise to lung cancer are in regions with very high inflammation and are surrounded by proinflammatory cells. Targeting inflammation by neutralizing a driver called IL-1B reduces these precursor cells of lung cancer. Our work paves the way for targeting inflammation to intercept the earliest stages of lung cancer and impact patient lives." Spatial transcriptomic maps provide a visual representation of where and how genes are expressed within samples. Characterizing the cells and genes in precursor lesions – early-stage growths or changes in tissues that have the potential to develop into cancer – can identify potential targets for early intervention. The researchers generated spatial transcriptomic maps of 56 human precursor lesions and advanced lung cancer samples from 25 patients. They validated their findings using an independent cohort of 36 lesions from 19 patients, providing 486,519 spots and 5.4 million cells for analysis. For instance, there are proinflammatory areas within precursor lesions that have alveolar cells associated with tumors. These proinflammatory regions also are more active and more prevalent in earlier phases of lung cancer development, and are conserved in lab models of lung cancer, suggesting that inflammation in these regions is likely initiating tumors. The findings show that targeting inflammation alone or in combination with immunotherapy may be promising early interception strategies for lung cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Type 1 diabetes is caused by an insufficient production of the hormone insulin by cells in the pancreas called beta cells and estimated to affect 9.5 million people worldwide. People with diabetes require lifelong monitoring of blood sugar levels coupled with insulin injections to keep blood sugar levels at a stable, healthy level. A potential new treatment option for those patients is the replacement of lost or dysfunctional pancreatic beta cells, either by cell transplantation, or by the generation of new beta cells from existing cells within the body. This latter strategy was pursued by the team of Xiaofeng Huang from Weill Cornell Medicine, USA and Qing Xia from Peking University, China who previously discovered that cells in the mouse stomach can be transformed into pancreatic beta cells by genetic engineering. To test this, the researchers started off by making human stomach organoids, microscopic structures that model aspects of a normal stomach function. The stomach organoids were genetically engineered so that they could be transformed into pancreatic beta cells upon turning on a "genetic switch." Upon turning on the "genetic switch," the human stomach cells were converted to insulin secreting cells within the mice and resembled pancreatic beta cells with respect to gene and protein expression. Encouragingly, when those experiments were done with diabetic mice, insulin secreted from the transformed human cells helped control blood sugar levels and ameliorated diabetes. The scientists hope that a similar approach can be taken to convert cells from a patient's own stomach into insulin secreting cells directly within the body. Importantly, additional studies are needed to address if this approach is safe and effective to be used in patients.
