                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On top of the cutbacks, air traffic control facilities are still reporting staffing problems. “I don't want to see that,” Duffy said, noting that “if controllers start coming to work and the pressure goes down, we can move those numbers in the other direction. ET and has asked his fellow Senate Democrats to be on the floor as well. Democrats are expected to present an offer that includes a one-year extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, a stopgap bill into January – along with three full-year funding bills – and a demand for some way to rein in Trump's attempts to override Congress's power of the purse, according to three sources familiar with the discussions. There is little expectation that Republicans will take their offer, given fierce GOP resistance to extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies with no reforms. Majority Leader John Thune acknowledged Friday he's seeking to reengage Democrats in negotiations to reopen the government and told reporters the chamber was not expected to vote Friday on a compromise deal they had been working towards. He said the Senate would instead take up legislation it had previously attempted to pass, a measure from GOP Sen. Ron Johnson that would pay federal workers who are required to work through the government shutdown. Thune said that talks between centrist Democrats and Republicans have abruptly fallen off after a burst of optimism among GOP leaders earlier in the week. “I thought we were on a track,” Thune said. “And then yesterday, everything kind of – the wheels came off, so to speak. Democrats insist Republicans have not given them what they want, which is a deal to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies as part of any funding measure. The deal that centrist Democrats and Republicans were working towards was a short-term measure to fund the government for several weeks, paired with a package of three full-year appropriations bills covering key agencies. Negotiations were also underway to attach some kind of measure promising a future vote on the expiring health care subsidies. Congress: Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated he expects the Senate to be in session this weekend if Democrats block a plan today to reopen the government. White House: President Donald Trump, who is meeting today with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, will be attending the Washington Commanders NFL game on Sunday against the Detroit Lions, according to a White House official. He isn't scheduled to meet with lawmakers on the shutdown. Economic impacts: The shutdown's impact on the economy is “far worse” than expected “because it's gone on for so long,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business Friday, predicting a downturn in GDP if the shutdown continues. CNN's Ellis Kim, Kit Maher and Aaron Cooper contributed reporting to this post. As the federal government shutdown drags on and Senate Democrats are expected to oppose a vote to reopen the government again today as they seek more commitments on dealing with rising health care costs, open enrollment for 2026 coverage on the Affordable Care Act exchanges is underway. Millions of consumers are now seeing just how expensive their health insurance policies will be without the enhanced premium subsidies that have been in place since 2021. If Congress does not agree to renew enhanced subsidies, those who will be hit the hardest by soaring premiums include lower-income, older and middle class enrollees. Enrollment has more than doubled since 2021, when the enhanced premium tax credits were introduced. Read more and view additional graphics on this topic here. When Luana Griffin's mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer this past week, she booked a flight to go spend a few days with her. Now, the Federal Aviation Administration's slowing of air traffic is putting that trip in jeopardy, at a time when she and her family are already under an immense amount of stress. Griffin's trip, from San Diego to Sacramento, is planned for next week, she told CNN. Griffin said she has limited windows of time to be able to see her mom because she is working a contract job. “I have very limited time left with my mom and so many other decisions, this is the last thing I need,” she told CNN in an email. On top of that, Griffin, who usually flies six to eight times a year, said she paid much more for this round trip than she usually pays for similar flights to Sacramento. “I am the main person providing for my family. There have been at least 15 reports of staffing problems at the Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control facilities that have prompted delays across the country Friday, even as airlines cut 4% of their flights at 40 major airports. Here's a look at some of the recent impacts: • The control tower at Washington's Reagan National airport is again short-staffed until 10 p.m. ET tonight after an earlier staffing problem was reported there this morning. The FAA says delays for flights headed to DCA average about 83 minutes and only 24 planes will be allowed to land each hour. • Flights headed to San Francisco today must wait on the ground about an hour for takeoff. • Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport is seeing delays for planes departing of 45 minutes, and increasing, according to the FAA. • Newark Liberty International Airport's control tower is short-staffed until 2 p.m. The TRACON facility handling flights approaching and departing Newark was short-staffed earlier. • The control at airports in New Orleans, Austin, Texas and Ontario, California, were also short-staffed today. • TRACONs, which handle flights arriving or departing airports, do not have their full complement of controllers this afternoon in Houston, Phoenix, and Southern California. “THIS is safety management, the very foundation of our aviation system, and it's the right thing to do,” National Transportation Safety Board Chair Jennifer Homendy posted on X. The Federal Aviation Administration's emergency order calls for airlines to reduce operations at the 40 selected airports on a “rolling schedule” through next Friday, November 14, which means travelers will still see disruptions well into next week. According to the emergency order released Thursday, airline operations “shall be reduced seven days in advance on a rolling schedule.” Airlines needed to provide an “initial list of reduced operations” to the FAA today for reduced operations from today until next Friday. Tomorrow, airlines must “retain a reduction of at least 10%” for November 15. That means even if the government were to reopen next week, travelers can still see flight cancellations. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy reaffirmed that air travel wouldn't immediately return to normal if the government reopened because air traffic controllers probably wouldn't return to work right away. “If the government opens, on day one, will I see an immediate response from controllers? No, the union is telling me it's going to take time to get them all back,” Duffy said this morning at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Although many airlines are not preemptively calling off flights in advance, some cancelations have been reported through Saturday and Sunday, according to FlightAware. Like many brides, Alicia Leva has dreamed about her wedding day for months, taking each detail into consideration as she prepares to exchange vows surrounded by the people she loves the most. But with more than half of her guests attending from across the country amid a reduction in domestic flights at 40 airports in major US cities, Leva sees travel plans unraveling fast. Leva doesn't want her wedding woes to triumph over others who have been deeply affected by the government shutdown, but is still mourning her original vision of the couple's special day. Mickayla Vialpando joined the wedding travel frustration as she waited in anticipation at Denver International Airport this morning staring at the departure screens tracking her Cancun-bound flight for two wedding celebrations, she told CNN affiliate KCNC. While Vialpando's flight wasn't affected by any cancellations — the flight reduction order “does not require a reduction in international flights,” a joint statement from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Department of Transportation said. Either way, Vialpando said, “it's a lot of added stress.” With about 800 flight cancellations today, major carriers are impacted differently across the board. Take a look at how each airline is faring below: Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated he expects the Senate to be in session this weekend if Democrats block a plan today to reopen the government. Senate Democrats are expected to oppose a vote to reopen the government, as they seek more commitments on dealing with rising health care costs. The government shutdown, which started on October 1, has prevented many federal employees from getting paid. Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration screeners are considered essential employees during the shutdown and are expected to go to work. The cancellations have left some travelers with no backup options. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is citing safety concerns as the reason for cutbacks, but acknowledged the exact number of flight reductions is somewhat arbitrary. Here's a look inside airports across the country this morning: As the government shutdown leaves air traffic controllers working without pay, pilots from North Las Vegas Airport are stepping in to help. “I've been in the situation where I've had an in-flight emergency, and the air traffic controllers make a difference,” pilot Jeffrey Lustick told CNN affiliate KTNV. They alert people that you need help … air traffic controllers save lives.” Lustick and fellow pilots have made two deliveries so far. He said the pilots' support for controllers is “not political at all.” A reduction in flights across 40 major US airports due to staffing issues caused by the government shutdown is frustrating travelers. Flight disruptions: Delays were reported for flights headed to Newark Liberty International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Austin-Bergstrom International Airport this morning, as Federal Aviation Administration staffing problems continue to expand across the country. “It is not a science, it is (an) art that we're trying to deploy to keep people safe in the airspace,” Duffy said today. When the government reopens, travel will not bounce back immediately, he said. Cancellations: About 800 flights have been canceled, leaving some travelers with no backup options. Another apparent dead end day in Congress: As of last night, Senate Democrats signaled they are prepared to block GOP plans to force a vote today to reopen the government — until they get more commitments on dealing with rising health care costs. An update on SNAP benefits: The Trump administration made an emergency request to the First Circuit Court of Appeals to pause a federal judge's order requiring the government to fully cover food stamp benefits for tens of millions of Americans in November. “If Democrats are going to go home this weekend, and they've kept the government shut down, that's shameful,” Duffy told reporters while exiting Reagan National Airport this morning. Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, tells CNN that air traffic controllers will continue to work to ensure the safety of the flying public, but that they can't “somehow suddenly put money in our own pockets” to support their livelihoods. Delays were reported for flights headed to Newark Liberty International Airport, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and Austin-Bergstrom International Airport this morning, as Federal Aviation Administration staffing problems continue to expand across the country, the same day the FAA implemented cuts to airline traffic at 40 major airports. The TRACON facility handling flights approaching and departing Newark is also short-staffed until noon. The control tower at Washington's Reagan National airport is short-staffed until 2 p.m. ET and the FAA is currently reporting average delays of about 24 minutes. The control tower at New Orleans International Airport is also short staffed until 2 p.m. Flights headed to Austin, Texas were also delayed by about 45 minutes, the FAA reported. Air traffic controllers were also briefly understaffed at Ontario International Airport's control tower in California earlier this morning. The Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center, which handles flights enroute at higher altitudes, is understaffed until 11 a.m. “If you are flying Friday or in the next ten days and need to be there or don't want to be stranded I highly recommend booking a backup ticket on another carrier,” Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle posted on Instagram. For example, book Economy on Frontier so you can reuse the ticket value as changes are free or you can get a credit,” Biffle wrote. “If your flight is cancelled your chances of being stranded are high so I would simply have a backup ticket on another airline.” Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and American Airlines are waiving fees for travelers who want to cancel or change their upcoming flights. It's also helpful to book directly with an airline instead of through a third-party website. And try to avoid booking flights with layovers, the US Public Interest Research Group says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It currently affects 40 airports in major US cities, but further cuts are planned in coming days, due to staffing issues caused by the government shutdown. • Hundred of flights affected: About 800 flights at main hubs across the US have been canceled today, and travelers are frustrated with the disruptions. • Gridlock in Congress: Senate Democrats signaled yesterday they were prepared to block GOP plans to force a vote today — until they got more commitments on dealing with rising health care costs.

With an increasing number of air traffic controllers not showing up for work as they can't be paid during the government shutdown, Duffy said they are seeing more close calls. “We've seen more breaches in regard to that loss of separation,” said Duffy. When the government reopens, flights will not go back to normal immediately because all air traffic controllers may not return to work right away, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said this morning. “If the government opens on day one, will I see an immediate response from controllers? No, the union is telling me it's going to take time to get them all back in,” Duffy told reporters at Ronald Reagan National Airport on Friday morning. Are you flying today or worried about your future travel plans? “People are really hurting out here,” traveler Jay Curley, who had hoped to fly to Wilmington, North Carolina, from Newark International Airport last night, told CNN's Jason Carroll this morning. “It's not just the traveling public, but it's affecting the whole economy, and you people are to blame,” a frustrated Curley said, addressing federal lawmakers. Curley said he'll now be renting a car and driving from Newark to Wilmington. The economic impacts of the government shutdown, which has reached day 38, are “far worse” than expected “because it's gone on for so long,” National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told Fox Business Friday, predicting a downturn in GDP if the shutdown continues. “We're starting to see pockets of the economy that look like they might be in a recession — that we're not in a recession because of this — but there are pockets that are really hurting. And if we go another month or so, then who knows how bad the economy could be this quarter, and we know whose fault that will be,” Hassett said on Fox Business. “I would get Secretary Bessent to tell you which ones he thinks are in recession. “Travel and leisure is a place that's really being heavily hit right now, and if it continues to get hit, if the air travel thing goes south for another week or two then, yeah, you could say that they would have at least a near term downturn.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A memo circulating within the federal government lays out her office's reasoning for wanting to transfer counterintelligence work away from the FBI. Listen to more stories on the  Noa app. This article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. But these attacks have generated real action: Gabbard has revoked security clearances of supposed Trump opponents by the dozen and fired high-ranking staff while the Justice Department busies itself with dismissing civil servants and prosecuting the president's enemies. Now Gabbard's agency, which coordinates among the different elements of the intelligence community, is advocating for legislation that would transfer significant authority over counterintelligence to her office and away from an FBI that her staff has portrayed as the home of a traitorous deep state. For now, at least, Gabbard's quest to take control of counterintelligence seems to lack the allies it would need for success. Patel's ominous warnings of anti-Trump vipers lurking within the bureau apparently weren't enough to prevent him from allowing the FBI to defend its own turf. Gabbard, in contrast, may have just discovered that ominous warnings of deep-state conspirators aren't enough to persuade the White House to hand her more power. For months now, Gabbard has accused current and former government personnel who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election of taking part in a “years-long coup” against Trump. FBI counterintelligence played a central role in efforts to stop Russia from meddling in the presidential campaign and to identify the perpetrators. In Trump's telling, FBI agents are among the core peddlers of the “Russia hoax”—the idea that Democrats and the federal government engineered lies about Russian election interference to falsely tarnish Trump's 2016 campaign. No wonder, then, that Gabbard is proposing to take control over much of the FBI's counterintelligence work. But the White House, thus far at least, seems cool to a major reorganization. Gabbard has struggled to find her place in the president's inner circle. Over the summer, her influence had so eroded that one Trump ally called her a “nonplayer.” Trump has also told aides and allies that he's not sure the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is even necessary. Gabbard has attempted to raise her stock by declassifying documents that she claims allege a grand conspiracy by Trump's enemies to undercut him in 2016. But she is still on shaky footing, and has arguably erred in trying to take on the FBI, a far larger and more bureaucratically powerful organization than the one she runs. It dates back only to 2004, when it was established as part of the post-9/11 project of improving cooperation among intelligence agencies, and has never really managed to consolidate its authority over the older and better-established centers of bureaucratic power that make up the nation's intelligence community. Read: What everyone gets wrong about Tulsi Gabbard Today, the FBI appears uninterested in giving up any of that power. Counterintelligence can be a tricky area to define. Essentially, it's spy versus spy—the work of catching foreign agents and disrupting espionage against the United States. As part of this work, specially trained FBI agents cultivate sources in foreign intelligence agencies. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which is largely an administrative agency, has no comparable investigative arm, something law-enforcement officials and intelligence veterans we spoke with were quick to point out. China is undoubtedly the main focus of FBI counterintelligence operations. And in July, the Justice Department charged two Chinese nationals with spying on U.S. Navy bases and helping to identify service members whom China's security service might try to recruit. H. R. McMaster: What Trump got right about national security Supporters of Crawford's legislation say that the FBI has bogged down counterintelligence work by treating it as a law-enforcement matter. The bureau's job is to gather evidence to bring criminal charges, which is fine as far as that goes, they say. But—in their argument—rampant espionage by China, which includes the theft of valuable technical research from U.S. corporations and universities, demands a strategy to disrupt and deter those adversaries, not one that is always premised on bringing cases to court. Michael Feinberg, a former FBI agent who spent much of his career in the bureau's Counterintelligence Division, questioned this characterization of the FBI's work. (Feinberg was pushed out of the FBI earlier this year as part of the agency's effort to purge agents considered insufficiently loyal to Trump.) “Prosecutions represent only one tool used by the organization to thwart foreign spies,” he said over text. “Both on its own and with other intelligence community partners, the FBI engages in a wide swathe of activities—most never revealed to the public—to keep our nation's secrets safe.” But with Trump in the Oval Office, sometimes all it takes to turn things around is for a person with a convincing pitch and an enmity for the deep state to sell their idea to the president. In a government stocked with combustible personalities and conspiracy theorists, no proposal, however far-fetched, can truly be declared dead for long.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A woman walks by a Cornell University sign on the Ivy League school's campus in Ithaca, New York, Jan. 14, 2022. WASHINGTON (AP) — Cornell University has agreed to pay $60 million and accept the Trump administration's interpretation of civil rights laws in order to restore federal funding and end investigations into the Ivy League school. Cornell President Michael Kotlikoff announced the agreement on Friday, saying it upholds the university's academic freedom while restoring more than $250 million in research funding that the government withheld amid investigations into alleged civil rights violations. The university agreed to pay $30 million directly to the U.S. government along with another $30 million toward research that will support U.S. farmers. It requires Cornell to comply with the government's interpretation of civil rights laws on issues involving antisemitism, racial discrimination and transgender issues. A Justice Department memo that orders colleges to abandon diversity, equity and inclusion programs and transgender-friendly policies will be used as a training resource for faculty and staff at Cornell. The campus must also provide a wealth of admissions data that the government has separately sought from campuses to ensure race is no longer being considered as a factor in admissions decisions. President Donald Trump has suggested some campuses are ignoring a 2023 Supreme Court decision ending affirmative action in admissions. Education Secretary Linda McMahon called it a “transformative commitment” that puts a focus on “merit, rigor, and truth-seeking.” “These reforms are a huge win in the fight to restore excellence to American higher education and make our schools the greatest in the world,” McMahon said on X. Cornell's president must personally certify compliance with the agreement each quarter. It appears to split the difference on a contentious issue colleges have grappled with as they negotiate an exit from federal scrutiny: payments made directly to the government. Virginia's deal included no payment at all. The Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and radio host Dean Obeidallah called out Democratic Party leadership for not endorsing Zohran Mamdani. EXCLUSIVE: New York City's lone Republican member of Congress is criticizing an effort within her own party to defund the Big Apple over Zohran Mamdani's victory in the mayoral race on Tuesday. "These attempts by those within my party to score cheap political points by going after New York City are not going to be met lightly. We're going to fight back," Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital on Friday. "I'm the only Republican representing our city in Washington. My constituents did not vote for Zohran Mamdani, and then you have people in Washington wanting to punish the whole city for the stupid decisions of a few." Buddy Carter, R-Ga., revealing plans for new legislation called the Moving American Money Distant from Anti-National Interests Act, or the "MAMDANI Act" for short. Rep. Nicole Malliotakis is criticizing legislation by fellow Republican Rep. The two-page bill text stated, "Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during any period in which Zohran Mamdani is mayor of New York, New York" that "any unobligated Federal funds available" for the city "are hereby rescinded," and that "no Federal funds may be obligated or expended for any purpose to New York, New York." It is expected to be introduced Friday, Fox News Digital was told the day prior. Malliotakis called out Carter by name, telling Fox News Digital, "Attempts by Congressman Buddy Carter to strip New York City of all its funding is ludicrous and a slap in the face to the hardworking taxpayers of this city, half of which did not even support Zohran Mamdani for mayor." She argued that New York City pays "an exorbitant amount of federal taxes" and that U.S. government dollars were critical to funding education, transportation and national security priorities like counter-terrorism efforts. Malliotakis also pointed out that the city is a popular hub for fellow Republicans to seek high-dollar donations. "Anyone who signs onto that bill, including Buddy, should not come to New York City to raise a dollar for their campaign," she said. "If they're going to sponsor a hostile bill toward our city, then they shouldn't be coming to raise money from our residents." Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa (pictured during an October 2025 debate). Malliotakis herself had endorsed Republican Curtis Sliwa, who won less than 10% of the vote after a last-ditch bid by the GOP to coalesce around Cuomo. "I totally agree, we don't want any money going to fund a socialist or communist agenda or specific policies that we strongly disagree with. That's where we're going to hold Zohran Mamdani accountable," she said. Carter responded to Malliotakis in a statement to Fox News Digital, "Nicole is New York City's last line of defense against socialism. If everyone stood up for New York City the way Nicole does, it wouldn't be in this awful mess." "She and I agree: Taxpayers shouldn't bankroll a socialist or communist agenda. The MAMDANI Act makes that clear, plain and simple," Carter said. The internal House Republican battle could be a potential warning of what's to come as the socialist readies to begin his term.

Senate Democrats for years have warned of the negative side effects of government shutdowns that would largely affect their priorities, but as the shutdown drags on, they find themselves in direct opposition to their own pet projects. "There's a tremendously twisted irony," Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., told Fox News Digital. John Feehery of EFB Advocacy, who served as press secretary to former Republican House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert, said, "The most unbelievable thing" about the shutdown is Democrats "hurting their own constituents." I mean, they've let the Republicans shut the government down, but they've never done it on purpose," he said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., addresses reporters at a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, Nov. 5, 2025. As Senate Democrats have pushed the shutdown into the longest on record, they still aren't ready to reopen the government, even as millions who rely on food stamps from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are only set to get partial benefits. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his caucus have remained firm in their demand that they get a guarantee to extend expiring Obamacare premium subsidies in exchange for their votes to reopen the government. Democrats have blasted President Donald Trump and his administration for threatening to not fund federal food benefits. Earlier this week, Trump said that food stamps would not be funded despite a court order requiring that they at least be partially paid for. It's within their control to reopen the government. His administration has since changed course, however, and announced in a memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that Americans that rely on the benefits would receive 65% of their typical allotted amount. A federal judge then ordered the administration to fully fund food benefits by Friday. I mean, it's hurting Democrats," Feehery said. "Their higher priority is showing that they're tough against Trump, and they're more than happy to use their constituents as cannon fodder." President Donald Trump during a breakfast with Senate Republicans in the State Dining Room of the White House in Washington, Nov. 5, 2025. I want it over here, but I don't think we have fully come to recognize how much pain is going to exist in this country when 4 million people lose their healthcare insurance," Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said. "That's as devastating, if not more devastating, in the long run, than the pain people are feeling this month." Julian Epstein, former chief counsel for House Judiciary Committee Democrats, told Fox News Digital that Republicans had an opportunity to seize the narrative on healthcare. "If I were advising Trump, I would tell him to make the case in an Oval Office address that the Democrats are voting to close the government and that it's the Republicans that want to open it. The president should also lay out his vision for controlling healthcare premiums," Epstein said. They want a clear plan for their economic concerns." And Feehery similarly argued Republicans should take their moment on healthcare, pointing out that Democrats are effectively delaying the discussion on Obamacare by prolonging the shutdown. "If Republicans were smart, they would be talking about why Obamacare is fundamentally broken and how to fundamentally change that. But Republicans don't really like to talk about healthcare, which is kind of annoying," he said. "But yeah, I do think that the fact that it's gone past the [Nov. 1 open enrollment] deadline has made this even more complicated." There is a sense on Capitol Hill that the shutdown could be coming to an end, but Republicans contend it will be up to Senate Democrats. But many in the caucus say that's not enough, and demand that Trump sit down and meet with Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to hash out a deal. Democrats also believe that Republicans are feeling the heat from Tuesday night's elections, where Democratic candidates swept their Republican opponents in statewide elections, and they point to comments Trump made that the shutdown was hurting the GOP. Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., contended that what Trump meant was Democrats were using the shutdown "to fire up their base." "But I think it's also incredibly sad that SNAP recipients and federal workers and their families and Head Start families all had to go without so they could help the New York City election," Lankford said. Meanwhile, Rep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., who is running for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, told Fox News Digital, "Every day the Schumer Shutdown drags on, Americans pay the price — missed paychecks, canceled flights, and threats to public safety. Democrats aren't helping anyone, they're sowing chaos and achieving nothing." "It's really awful what people are going through. And the only way out of this is a negotiation."

A North Carolina home invasion left a national kart racing champion dead — gunned down in front of his fiancée in a late-morning break-in last month, according to authorities. Tyler Weaver, 25, suffered fatal gunshot wounds in what the local police chief called a "targeted" robbery that took place around 10 a.m. on Oct. 24, according to the Forest City Police Department. Weaver's fiancée, Nevaeh Quintero, was held at gunpoint but managed to escape and call 911, according to court documents. Quitez Watkins, 35, and Jaquavious Craig, 26, face charges of first-degree murder after a deadly home invasion robbery targeting 25-year-old former go-kart champion Tyler Weaver in his North Carolina home. The suspects are both repeat offenders who avoided capture for 10 days before authorities caught up with them. They were later identified as Quitez Watkins, 35, and Jaquavious Craig, 26, according to the Forest City Police Department. Both men face charges of first-degree murder. Watkins, who picked up the nickname "Bando Red" in prison, was arrested Tuesday and is being held without bond, according to the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office. Despite a violent criminal history, he was out on bond in connection with a slew of pending charges in Rutherford, Cleveland and Polk Counties, court records show. He was convicted in federal court of an assault that led to someone's death. Tyler Weaver, left, with his mother, sister and niece in an undated family photo. Authorities did not immediately reveal why they believe Craig allegedly chose Weaver as a target. Craig has a prior conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon from 2020, according to court documents. The judge ordered him held without bail as well. Weaver was a 2018 national champion at Maxxis Kart Racing North America. The organization called him "one of the most proud champions we've ever had" in a post on Facebook mourning his death. Weaver and Quintero were expecting their first son in April 2026, according to an online obituary. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., questions the panel of witnesses during a House Committee on Education and Workforce Committee hearing on “Antisemitism in Higher Education: Examining the Role of Faculty, Funding, and Ideology” on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, July 15, 2025, in Washington. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., President Donald Trump's nominee to be the United Nations Ambassador, testifies during a Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearing for her pending confirmation on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025, in Washington. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY., speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Feb. 22, 2025, in Oxon Hill, Md. In her video, a narrator declares “The Empire State has fallen” as it paints a grim picture of urban, liberal leadership and life in New York City, though the message appeared to be aimed at audiences in other, more conservative parts of the state. Her candidacy sets up a potential battle with Gov. Kathy Hochul, a centrist Democrat, though both candidates would have to first clear the field of any intraparty rivals before next November's election. In a written statement, Stefanik said she is running to make “New York affordable and safe for families all across our great state.” “Our campaign will unify Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to Fire Kathy Hochul once and for all to Save New York,” she said. “Apparently, screwing over New Yorkers in Congress wasn't enough — now she's trying to bring Trump's chaos and skyrocketing costs to our state,” said Hochul campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika. Representing a conservative congressional district in northern New York, Stefanik had once been a pragmatic and moderate Republican who would avoid uttering Trump's name, simply calling him “my party's presidential nominee.” But in recent years she has reshaped herself into a brash disciple and ardent defender of Trump's MAGA movement, rising through the ranks of the Republican Party's congressional hierarchy as it molded to Trump's political style. Her announcement video, which was titled “From the Ashes,” casts New York as a dangerous place plagued by “migrant crime” and economic crisis, placing the blame on “Kathy Hochul's failed policies,” as urgent, ominous music plays in the background. New York City police officials have long touted drops in crime and this week said the city is in its eighth consecutive quarter of major crime decline. On Long Island, Republican Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman has said he's weighing a run for governor. In a statement Friday, he said he has “tremendous respect” for Stefanik but that the GOP needs to nominate a candidate who has “broad based appeal with independents and common sense Democrats.” U.S. Rep. Mike Lawler had been contemplating a run but instead decided to seek reelection in his battleground House district in the Hudson Valley. Democrats have a major voter registration edge in New York. George Pataki, who left office about two decades ago. Still, Republican Lee Zeldin, a former Long Island congressman and current head of the Environmental Protection Agency, made a serious run for the office in 2022, coming within striking distance of upsetting Hochul.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's according to the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey, which showed the index falling to 50.3 this month from 53.6 in October. “With the federal government shutdown dragging on for over a month, consumers are now expressing worries about potential negative consequences for the economy,” Joanne Hsu, director of surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan, said in a statement. The drop this month represents a 6.2% decline from October and a 29.9% decline compared to last November. Meanwhile, economists polled by FactSet had been anticipating a slight improvement this month. “The index certainly looks like the economy is ready to roll over the proverbial cliff,” Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FwdBonds, said in commentary issued Friday. The increased level of pessimism was “widespread” across different ages, income levels and political affiliations, Hsu noted. They reported an 11% improvement in sentiment as the stock market hangs near record highs. That group of consumers is crucial because they have “the biggest influence on the aggregate consumer spending data, so continued strength here is important for the resilience of the economy overall,” Thomas Simmons, chief US economist at Jefferies, said in a note to clients Friday. “However, that middle tercile is important too, and the decline in their sentiment appears to be intensifying. If this group is unable to continue to keep up their pace of spending, the top-line growth numbers may finally break from their above-trend pace,” he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House, April 30, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Near the end of his first term, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that aimed to reduce harmful, planet-warming pollutants emitted by refrigerators and air conditioners. Five years later, the second Trump administration is reversing course, as it moves to loosen a federal rule — based on the 2020 law — that requires grocery stores, air-conditioning companies and others to reduce powerful greenhouse gases used in cooling equipment. The shift in approach has upended a broad bipartisan consensus on the need to quickly phase out domestic use of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, that are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and are considered a major driver of global warming. The plan is among a series of sweeping environmental rollbacks that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has said will put a “dagger through the heart of climate change religion.” The HFC proposal will help “make American refrigerants affordable, safe and reliable again,” Zeldin said in a statement. But environmentalists say the plan will exacerbate climate pollution while disrupting a years-long industry transition to new coolants as an alternative to HFCs. With HFCs one of the main drivers of extreme heat and pollution, any delay in their phaseout “is going to be have negative outcomes and significant ones,” said Kiff Gallagher, executive director of the Global Heat Reduction Initiative, an international effort to reduce trapped heat that is warming the planet. The 2020 law signed by Trump, known as the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, phased out HFCs as part of an international agreement on ozone pollution. The law accelerated an industry shift to alternative refrigerants that use less harmful chemicals and are widely available. The 2020 law led to a 2023 rule, now being relaxed, which imposed steep restrictions starting next year on HFCs. Zeldin said the Biden-era rule did not give companies enough time to comply and the rapid switch to other refrigerants had caused shortages and price hikes. In September, the EPA announced it is relaxing standards for cold storage warehouses and other cooling equipment and delaying other aspects of the HFC rule until 2032. On a visit this summer to a refrigeration facility in swing-state Georgia alongside Vice President JD Vance, Zeldin said the administration was responding to grocery stores and refrigeration companies that have complained about the federal rule. Zeldin said the so-called Technology Transitions Rule, finalized under former President Joe Biden, has been restricting access to refrigerants Americans need to cool their homes and businesses, while costs are going up and supply is going down. Alta Refrigeration, along with grocery stores, the semiconductor industry and residents across America, were dissatisfied with the rule, he said, vowing to “fix this mistake.” Jorge Alvarez, co-founder of iGas USA, a Florida air conditioning company whose products include HFCs, said the Biden rule was “shoved down our throats” and threatened to create havoc. The delay “gives industry a chance to create new refrigerants, and we will,” he said. “Changing the schedule now would disrupt planning and inject uncertainty across the market,” said Samantha Slater, a senior vice president at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, which represents more than 330 HVAC manufacturers and commercial refrigeration companies. Manufacturers have already retooled product lines and certified models based on the current timeline, she said, noting that nearly 90% of residential and light commercial air conditioning systems use substitute refrigerants. A delay would give an advantage to foreign-based competitors that did not invest in alternative refrigerants and risks “higher costs for U.S. consumers,” Slater said. Chemours, the Delaware-based chemical giant that is a leading producer of alternative refrigerants, said in a statement that it has “consistently supported an orderly phasedown schedule of HFCs as outlined in the AIM Act.'' A temporary shortage this summer of cylinders used by HVAC contractors — which Zeldin and others have cited as a reason to delay the EPA rule — has been resolved, Martinko and other industry representatives said. David Doniger, a senior strategist at the environmental nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, said the current rule ensures an efficient, affordable phasedown of harmful HFCs, while offering industry regulatory uniformity and a way to remain globally competitive. He said the federal rule averts a previous patchwork of state laws and regulations. States such as California, Washington and New York have similar requirements to the Biden rule and may end up in conflict with the Trump standard.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vox delivers the depth, context, and clarity you need to understand what's happening and why it matters. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The people likely to be sending them are victims, too. If it feels like you're being inundated with these spam texts right now, you aren't imagining things. There's been a huge spike in these scams since 2020, and that's because they work. Last year, the Federal Trade Commission received nearly 250,000 reports of text scams. And Americans lost about $500 million to them. On the latest episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast, we discuss the origins of these scams. According to Matt Burgess, an information security writer for Wired, that text in your inbox is likely from a group known as the “Smishing Triad.” These groups use SMS texting to trick people into giving up their address, banking, and other personal information. They've been estimated to be sending 100,000 messages per day,” Burgess told Vox. “They develop their own software, and they sell it to other cyber criminals who may be able to use that software to then go and scam people further. The amount of messages they're sending per day is huge, and the amount of people that they're trying to target is colossal.” Those of us receiving the texts aren't the only victims of these crime syndicates. The people sending them are often the victims of human trafficking, lured to countries in Southeast Asia under the guise of getting a good-paying job, only to be trapped and forced to scam. This is something Erin West has seen firsthand. West was a prosecutor in California for over two decades, and after seeing so many people get their money taken in scams, she decided to do something about it. She started an organization called Operation Shamrock, which teaches people about scams. Since its inception, she's investigated scams coming out of Cambodia, Myanmar, and all over Southeast Asia. The industry “has developed Cambodia into literally a scamming state,” West said. “Where previously their industry was tourism and garments, now scamming makes up 60 percent of their GDP.” It's an industry built on the back of what is essentially slave labor. West tells us what's on the other side of the phone on Explain It to Me. Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. You've talked to some of the victims who were forced to work at these scam facilities. I met a Ugandan man named Small Q. A fellow Ugandan came in and told him, “I know you're making $100 a month working here. You'll be doing data entry.” Small Q went through the interview process. He told his brother, “I could give this a shot, or I could die poor in Uganda.” When he arrived in Bangkok, they took his phone, they took his passport, drove him for hours and hours, and ultimately he found himself in a gated, massive walled community with large dormitories. Wow, so it sounds like the people who end up being the scammers are actually victims of an employment scam themselves. On the other side of that text is likely someone who was human-trafficked to be there. You've been to several of these compounds. They often have bars on the windows to keep the people from jumping out, surrounded by a massive concrete-walled-off area. Chinese organized criminals are no strangers to the gambling industry. In combination with a road that China was building in Cambodia, Chinese organized criminals thought, “We should fill this area with casino towers.” And so they did. And so when their casino towers sat empty, they had to pivot. That's when they started the human trafficking angle on it. When people like Small Q arrive, what happens next? Small Q's day would then be to report to a long table of people just like him, forced to be working on desktop computers and 10 phones. There are different roles within this facility. When you first come in, you are one of the people who are trying to locate new clients. They submit at the end of the day to their boss what their character will be doing that day. I'm glad you picked up on the corporate nature of this. So if Small Q were to be successful and scam money from someone, that's a big win. Sometimes there's fireworks for the massive scores. There can be treats offered like a karaoke room staffed with attractive women and liquor and cigarettes. What happens if these people don't meet their quotas? Small Q is not the only person I'm in touch with. He's beaten with an electric baton. There are sexual consequences for women. There is something called the dark room, where there is a metal bar that's attached to the wall, where you are handcuffed to the wall and beaten, and then you are placed in a room where you are hung by your arms for three days. We're talking about war crime-level torture that is happening to people. And all that because you didn't scam enough because you didn't hit the quota? It sounds like you can't just quit. You really don't get out. They're told they can pay a ransom, and the ransom could be anything from $3,000 to $10,000 to $20,000. If they are able to get that money, there are ways that their escape can be brokered. Ultimately, Small Q was able to get home by stealing a phone from one of the bosses. He was able to contact Madam Betty Bigombe, who is the high commissioner for Uganda. She was able to help him and 23 others get home. But the mental toll is massive. But they're missing an important danger. Vox's Astead Herndon and immigration reporter Molly O'Toole unpack the latest (confusing) polls. How to change your mind on the climate's future, according to data scientist Hannah Ritchie.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>From using the Justice Department to achieve partisan goals to advancing his immigration agenda via executive actions, Obama set the precedent for expanding executive authority that Trump is now relying on to test the limits of Article II. Critics of the Trump administration have spilled considerable ink decrying what they characterize as an unprecedented use of federal power to coerce private institutions and Democratic states into compliance with the president's agenda. What often goes unsaid, however, is that much of President Donald Trump's playbook has precedent in actions taken by the Obama administration. Former President Barack Obama has recently returned to the political scene, serving as a fixture at Democratic campaign events and frequently criticizing the Trump administration. Obama, much like Trump, did not shy away from using the tools available to him as president to pressure people into complying with his vision for the nation. Under Obama, federal funds were used to influence law enforcement, nondiscrimination, healthcare, and education policy at the state and local level across the country. Not least among Obama's efforts to remodel American society using the federal government was his administration's reinterpretation of Title IX to reshape how educational institutions receiving federal funding approached questions of gender identity and sexual harassment. Practically, the Obama administration's reforms related to gender identity, enacted between 2010 and 2016 through the Education Department, required publicly funded schools to use the preferred names and pronouns of transgender students, make sex-segregated spaces such as bathrooms and dormitories open to transgender students in alignment with their gender identity, and avoid disclosing the gender status of students without their consent. Failure to comply with these terms meant risking the loss of federal funding, as compliance with Title IX is a prerequisite for such support. 2011 brought further Title IX reforms when the Obama administration issued a letter requiring universities to thoroughly investigate and sanction any unwanted conduct of a sexual nature, including speech. Beyond mere speculation, Northwestern University professor Laura Kipnis faced a university-led Title IX investigation in 2015 for writing an essay defending a colleague who had been accused of violating Title IX. A number of other students and professors faced similar restrictions on expression during the Obama administration. The actions taken under the Obama administration to shift internal policies at universities bear a striking resemblance to moves made by the Trump administration to quash diversity, equity, and inclusion and anti-Israel rhetoric in higher education. Trump, however, has been more direct than Obama at times. In the opening months of his second term, Trump canceled billions of dollars in funding to prestigious universities such as Harvard University, Columbia University, and the University of California, Los Angeles, over their alleged failures to address antisemitism on campus following last year's wave of pro-Palestinian protests. Dan Patrick (R-TX), who declared “we will not be blackmailed” in response to the president's expansion of civil rights law to cover transgender people. In October, the White House offered all institutions of higher education preferential access to federal grants in exchange for accepting a list of 10 policy changes. Among these were prohibiting discrimination based on immutable characteristics or political beliefs in admissions, the use of standardized test scores in admissions, addressing alleged anti-conservative “institutional units,” prohibiting support of terrorist organizations or incitements to violence, nondiscrimination in hiring, institutional neutrality on questions of politics, cracking down on grade inflation, the establishment of single-sex spaces based on biological sex, reducing the proportion of foreign students, free tuition for students studying the hard sciences at universities with an endowment exceeding $2 million per undergraduate student, and the disclosure of all foreign funding. While some states did adopt Common Core to receive grant funding, the actual program did not require doing so, as it merely encouraged the adoption of some form of consistent educational standards. Despite its lofty goals, critics, including those on the Left, argued that states participating in the program overpromised to get funding and subsequently underdelivered on their promises. Obama administration officials at the time, however, tried to rebut such claims by stating that benefits derived from the program were not easily measurable. Beyond using federal funds as leverage for policy concessions, which many admit is business as usual in Washington, critics have accused Trump of being uniquely authoritarian for his plans to investigate left-wing nonprofit groups following the assassination of Charlie Kirk. In the telling of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, the administration is poised to crack down on nonprofit organizations that use their resources to organize riots, street violence, doxing operations, or messaging campaigns designed to incite violence. Liberal nonprofit groups have broadly denied links to such activities, with a coalition of over 100 left-of-center organizations penning an open letter in September accusing the president of working to “undermine our democracy” through his investigations. Conservatives levied similar criticisms against Obama in 2013 after an IRS official admitted that the agency had been aggressively scrutinizing organizations whose names included words such as “Tea Party” or “patriots,” which was widely viewed as an attack on conservatives. Liberal groups were also targeted, albeit in much smaller numbers. The federal government under Trump, for instance, has taken stakes in Intel, rare earth producer MP Materials, Lithium Americas, Trilogy Metals, and U.S. Steel Corporation. Some media outlets have described these moves as “unusual.” The Obama administration sold its stake in 2013, ultimately losing taxpayers over $10 billion. Despite their employers being forced to declare bankruptcy, the terms of the bailout made it impossible to cut union member pay. A 2012 Heritage Foundation report argued that the taxpayers' losses on the bailout were largely spurred by automakers being forced to pay “uncompetitive” wages to unionized workers. Obama's political allies, the UAW among them, made out well during his tenure. Solyndra, an ill-fated solar power company whose primary backers secured large sums for Obama's campaign account, received a fast-tracked $500 million loan guarantee from his administration in 2009. On the nonprofit side of things, New Venture Fund, which is an arm of a Democratic-aligned dark money network managed by Arabella Advisors, pulled in $1.2 million during Obama's time in office. Obama's State Department even approved a grant to the foundation after Anne-Marie Slaughter, an alumnus of the Obama State Department, took over as its CEO. Trump, meanwhile, faced criticism for canceling grants to left-of-center nonprofit organizations that his White House deemed “frivolous.” One area where Trump's actions do not have a precedent in Obama's is his large-scale deployment of National Guard units to cities he believes are doing a poor job of addressing crime. While Obama avoided similar deployments, he did attempt to shape local public safety policies through grant-based incentives and Justice Department compacts with municipal law enforcement agencies. His administration, for instance, threatened to withhold Medicaid funding from states that refused to expand Obamacare, with Florida being the most notable example. In a more emotionally charged episode, the Little Sisters of the Poor, a Catholic religious society that cares for elderly and downtrodden people, filed a complaint in 2013 arguing that Obamacare's contraceptive mandate violated their religious beliefs.</p>
