Ukrainian and European officials rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for Kyiv to cede its eastern territories to Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Aug. 9.

The EU and Ukrainian officials instead offered a counterproposal to U.S. officials ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin on Aug. 15 in Alaska.

Putin told U.S. envoy Wikoff during a meeting on Aug. 6 that Russia would agree to a full ceasefire if Kyiv withdrew its forces from Donetsk Oblast, giving Moscow full control of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as Crimea. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky firmly rejected on Aug. 9 the idea of ceding any Ukrainian territory to end Russia's war, with talks on the proposal beginning in the U.K. with U.S., Ukrainian, and EU officials on Aug. 9.

Two European officials familiar with the talks told WSJ that Europe aims to draw a unified red line with Ukraine, instituting that that EU officials should be involved in any potential peace negotiation with Russia and reiterating that Ukraine's future cannot be discussed without Kyiv's participation. The development comes as Trump has suggested he will include Ukraine in future negotiations only after an initial meeting with Putin.

The counterproposal presented to Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg and Witkoff, also demands that a ceasefire be enacted before further steps are taken, adding that territory can only be exchanged in a reciprocal manner, the news agency reported.

The New York Times reported on Aug. 9, citing two EU officials, that European leaders are increasingly concerned Trump and Putin will formulate an agreement that will then be imposed upon Ukraine.

"You can't start a process by ceding territory in the middle of fighting," one European negotiator told WSJ, amid Trump's comments on Aug. 8 that Moscow and Kyiv would likely include "some swapping of territories."

"Well you're looking at territory that's been fought over for three-and-a-half years... So we're looking at that, but we're actually looking to get some back," Trump said during a press conference alongside the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. "Some swapping, it's complicated."

"We're going to get some back. We're going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both," Trump added.

Expressing concern with the United States' openness to begin negotiations surrounding the framework of Putin's proposal as well as skepticism toward Putin adhering to the ceasefire, a European official told WSJ that "the proposal is much worse than Trump said on the call," with another adding that it gives "Putin everything he wants in exchange for nothing."

Zelensky, who was not present in person for the discussions, held calls throughout the day with European leaders, including leaders of France, the U.K., Finland, Spain, Denmark, and Estonia, seeking a unified approach to the proposals. 

In a post on X, French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that "the future of Ukraine cannot be decided without the Ukrainians who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now," adding "Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as it concerns their security."

I have just spoken again with President Zelensky, as well as with Chancellor Merz and Prime Minister Starmer. We remain determined to support Ukraine, working in a spirit of unity and building on the work undertaken within the framework of the Coalition…

A senior European official said told WSJ that any agreement reached in Alaska between the U.S. and Russia would not hold much weight without the participation of European leaders.

Kyiv and Moscow have previously held three rounds of negotiations on an end to the war, with each round failing to halt hostilities amid Russia's refusal to implement a ceasefire.

Russia has repeatedly espoused maximalist demands to end its war in Ukraine publicly demanded that Kyiv forgo NATO membership and withdraw troops from all four regions as preconditions for peace. Under this condition, several large cities under Ukrainian control would have to be handed over to Russia.

European leaders reiterated their support for Ukraine's territorial integrity on Aug. 9 after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to the U.S. a ceasefire plan that involves halting hostilities in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern territories to Russia.

As a result of the attack, five people were hospitalized with shrapnel wounds. The status of the injured victims was not immediately provided.

Ukrainian and European officials rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for Kyiv to cede its eastern territories to Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Aug. 9. 

Flight delays lasted for several hours, leading to large crowds forming at Sochi Airport.

Canada will lower the price cap on Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel.



Ukrainian drones from the SBU's Special Operations Center "A" flew roughly 1,300 kilometers (about 800 miles) to strike the logistics hub.

The Russian strike took place at approximately 8:00 a.m. local time, resulting in the hospitalization of 16 people, two of whom suffered serious injuries.

Vladislav Vlasiuk, the president's representative on sanctions policy, said the latest sanctions are "100% synchronized" with U.S. restrictions.

The Yenisei radar station is used not only in Russia's S-500 air defense system but also as part of the S-400 system.

Russian forces launched 47 Shahed-type drones and decoys, as well as two Iskander-K missiles against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force.

The day before, Donald Trump claimed that peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv would likely involve "some swapping of territories."

The number includes 940 casualties Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

Ukrainian, U.S., and European senior officials are set to meet in the U.K. ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week, Axios reported on Aug. 8, citing three sources with knowledge of the plans.

The news comes as the U.S. president is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for a high-level summit on Aug. 15 in Alaska to discuss ways toward ending the war in Ukraine.

Co-founded by president's eldest sons, Eric and Don Jr, World Liberty has earned the family $500m since its launch

World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture backed by Donald Trump and the US president's family, is sounding out investors for a $1.5bn fundraising round meant to set up a public company that will hold its WLFI tokens, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.

The structure of the deal is yet to be finalized, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter, adding that large investors in the crypto and tech space had been approached for the venture.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. World Liberty did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

World Liberty – a “decentralized platform” which counts Trump and his sons Eric and Donald Jr as co-founders, according to its website – has earned the family $500m since its launch, according to Reuters' calculations.

World Liberty tokens, known as $WLFI, are not classified as securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are hence not subject to the same level of scrutiny as investments such as stocks.

Economists who follow crypto and some key Senate Democrats have voiced multiple concerns about Trump's glaring conflicts of interest in the crypto sector and the broader economic threats that his administration's ongoing deregulatory efforts pose.

“Trump and his family are clearly eager to establish a broad foothold in the sector prior to further regulatory actions that are likely to boost crypto asset valuations,” Cornell economist and crypto watcher Eswar Prasad told the Guardian in an article published in April. “Such investments by the Trump family take potential conflicts of interest to an altogether new level.”

British foreign minister David Lammy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance will meet Ukrainian and European allies in Britain on Saturday to discuss President Donald Trump's push for peace in Ukraine, a spokesperson for Downing Street said.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of the security meeting, the spokesperson said. 

Starmer and Zelensky discussed Trump's proposals for ending the war in Ukraine ahead of talks with his Russian counterpart on August 15 in Alaska.

Trump says he will meet with Putin in Alaska next week to discuss war in Ukraine

“The Prime Minister spoke to President Zelensky of Ukraine this morning. They looked ahead to the meeting of National Security Advisers from Europe, Ukraine and the United States taking place today, hosted by the U.K. Foreign Secretary and U.S. Vice President,” the spokesperson said. 

“They agreed this would be a vital forum to discuss progress towards securing a just and lasting peace.”

Food banks in the Global South may sell offsets to stay afloat, a practice critics say does little for the climate.

Eight to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food wasted somewhere along its journey from farm to table. When that organic waste ends up in a landfill, it emits methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, as it slowly decomposes. 

Food banks can help prevent food waste from occurring by rescuing unsold food from grocers and retailers and redistributing it to families and individuals in need. Now a small number of food banks around the world have recently started tracking their operations and quantifying how many emissions they're avoiding — with the goal of using that data to better aid decarbonization efforts as well as to sell  carbon credits. 

These carbon credits could help open up new avenues to raise money for food banks at a time when other sources of funding, like foreign aid from wealthy to developing countries, are threatened, according to the Global FoodBanking Network, or GFN. The nonprofit organization has piloted this carbon credit program in Mexico and Ecuador and is working to bring food banks in 12 other countries onboard.

But the carbon markets where such credits are traded have been heavily criticized for rampant fraud; the harshest critics say that purchasing credits representing avoided would-be emissions amounts to greenwashing. The rollout of GFN's program for calculating food banks' carbon footprint raises the question of whether nonprofits with social and environmental missions should make use of these controversial accounting instruments to stay afloat and further their impact. 

Carbon markets are marketed as a way for big polluters (think: airlines, large corporations, even national governments) to minimize their impact on the environment without fundamentally changing the way they operate. In theory, buyers can emit carbon into the atmosphere and then purchase credits — which represent emission reductions — to make up for it, allowing them to claim their operations are carbon neutral.

The problem is that without rigorous standards and verification to show that credits represent additional permanent cuts in emissions, analysis has shown that most of these credits are essentially meaningless. Among other issues, sellers and certification organizations have struggled to meet the additionality standard by proving that if a buyer had not purchased the credits, the reduction of emissions would not have happened. 

Socially driven and environmentally conscious nonprofits have experimented with selling carbon credits. For example, conservation programs have long offered offsets on carbon markets based on the idea that protected ecosystems sequester emissions, said Khaled Diab, communications director at Carbon Market Watch, a nonprofit watchdog organization that studies various carbon pricing programs. These groups can fall victim to overestimating just how much their work reduces emissions: For instance, a Bloomberg investigation in 2020 into The Nature Conservancy's forest-based carbon credits program found that many of its emissions reductions were likely bogus. The Nature Conservancy has not stopped selling credits but launched a review of its own practices and canceled one project the organization said did not meet its newly developed internal criteria.

In April, Carbon Market Watch released a report on programs that give gas or electric stoves to families in poor countries who would otherwise chop down and burn wood to cook food. These programs sold carbon credits based on the reduction in emissions that came from families going from burning wood to using a cleaner source of fuel. “We found that the climate impact is overstated significantly,” said Diab, in part because of assumptions the programs made when measuring emissions.

In the process of developing the Food Recovery to Avoid Methane Emissions, or FRAME, methodology, GFN was aware of these issues, said Ana Catalina Suarez Peña, head of strategy and innovation for the organization. 

“All the scandals around voluntary carbon markets are associated with the rigor of the monitoring, reporting, and verification schemes” that underpin them, she said. If carbon credit sales are growing and global temperatures are also continuing to rise, then “something is not correct,” said Suarez Peña. 

So when GFN was researching how to quantify how many emissions it saves by diverting food from landfills, the organization was focused on ensuring “what we are reporting is real,” said Suarez Peña. The methodology is in the process of being certified by the Gold Standard, a standard-setting organization that verifies credits sold through voluntary carbon markets, according to GFN.

This involved getting specific about what counts as an avoided emission. In this case, participating food banks are comparing the emissions they run up by transporting rescued food, refrigerating it, and potentially losing some edible food to spoilage to a scenario where grocers and retailers dispose of their food in a way that doesn't end up feeding people — i.e., sending it to a landfill or to be made into compost or animal feed. 

The FRAME methodology only looks at food intended for human consumption that would otherwise arrive at one of these destinations but is then diverted by food banks and given to people who will eat it. It also only looks at food that is donated to food banks, rather than purchased by them. 

But some experts say this framework is flawed. For one, it assumes that if shops don't donate the leftover food, then the food will inevitably end up going to waste, said Marc Roston, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. That ignores a scenario where shops could get rid of leftover food by selling it at a discount — perhaps even directly to the food bank. “The food bank buys food very inexpensively: no credits. The grocery store gives food to the food bank: credits issued. That's not good carbon accounting,” said Roston. 

In order for carbon credits to represent a legitimate offset in emissions, they also need to reflect new or additional work being done to reduce climate pollution. The idea is that by selling credits, organizations can prevent even more carbon emissions than they were preventing before. The food banks in GFN have long diverted food at risk of being wasted — but according to GFN, its carbon credits program represents additional work in the sense that the funds generated by selling credits allow food banks to expand their capacity to rescue food. Suarez Peña said that member food banks ensure they're capturing accurate data by tracking operations-related emissions in real time and submitting quarterly reports to GFN. 

Most food banks within GFN operate with a budget of $1 million or less, according to the organization — meaning that even relatively small losses in funding can have a big impact on its ability to stay open. As the Trump administration retracts billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid, European countries are also reconsidering how much money they spend abroad. That means that food banks in the Global South, whose budgets are typically dependent on receiving funding from wealthier nations, are newly interested in exploring alternative sources of funding. 

The Mexican Food Banking Network, or BAMX, which previously sold carbon credits under a separate methodology, participated in the pilot to test out the FRAME system. Asked what BAMX learned from the experience, BAMX head Mariana Jiménez said in an interview in Spanish that the organization has a greater awareness of its environmental impact. According to Suarez Peña, the food bank in Quito, Ecuador, that participated in the FRAME pilot has used the data it collected to have conversations with representatives from the national government about Ecuador's decarbonization platform. 

But critics like Roston argue that unless credits represent actual carbon removed from the atmosphere — for example, by turning food scraps into biochar and then using the biochar to store carbon — they are unlikely to represent real permanent emissions reductions. “I think there are probably better finance tools to fund food banks than voluntary carbon markets,” said Diab of Carbon Market Watch.

Suarez Peña, however, sees value in food banks auditing their own operations and sharing that data extending far beyond carbon markets. “I think in the coming years, having better, accurate, and robust data will be the way to demonstrate how everyone is contributing” to climate targets, she said. As countries prepare to report on their climate progress at the annual United Nations climate summit later this year, data on food waste will be extremely valuable, she argued — even though most countries' accounting methods do not yet make the connection between food waste and emissions. Suarez Peña hopes food banks can help “connect both in just one conversation.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Witnesses say disabled death-row man was in distress upon gurney, while lawyer calls execution ‘100% botched'

For attorney Kelley Henry, the visible blood was the first indication that the execution of her client was going wrong.

At 10.15am on Tuesday inside the Riverbend maximum security prison in Nashville, the longtime Tennessee death row lawyer watched as staff attempted to place an IV into the right arm of Byron Black. Black was locked on to a gurney with crisscrossing black straps over his chest, stomach and legs, and Henry saw blood ooze from the injection site.

The staff managed to insert the IV and cleaned the wound, but then struggled for roughly 10 minutes before finding a vein in Black's second arm, Henry recalled.

The IVs would be used to inject a lethal quantity of pentobarbital, a sedative, into Black, a 69-year-old wheelchair user with lifelong intellectual disabilities, dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, severe heart failure and prostate cancer. The drug was meant to render him unconscious as it stopped his breathing and killed him.

“You're almost home,” the spiritual adviser by Black's side told him as the lethal injection began.

While the reverend touched Black's face to comfort him, Black started breathing and sighing loudly, and after several minutes groaned in agony, saying, “I can't do this,” and “It hurts so bad,” according to Henry and several journalists who witnessed the execution. He repeatedly lifted his head.

“I'm so sorry. Just listen to my voice,” said the reverend, who sang, “The Lord is my shepherd.”

Black eventually became still and was pronounced dead at 10.43am, roughly 10 minutes after he had cried in pain.

Tennessee had argued that Black would not consciously experience drawn-out pain. But outside the chamber, seven reporters shared similar accounts suggesting that was exactly what had occurred, the final journalist saying: “It was unanimous among all of us that we saw him in distress.”

“Something went horribly, horribly wrong, and I don't know what it is yet, and all I could do was take notes and watch,” Henry, who represented Black for 25 years, told the Guardian on Thursday. “For him to lift his head up several times and say it hurts, I really wasn't prepared. I could not believe it was happening. It was horrific.”

The execution – which Henry said she considered “100% botched” and amounted to “torture” – appears to be the latest in a long line of troubled state killings.

Despite historically low public support for the death penalty, a handful of conservative states have continued to aggressively pursue executions, maintaining the US's status as a global leader in capital punishment. Donald Trump, who oversaw 13 federal executions in his first term, has pledged to revive capital punishment, reversing Joe Biden's moratorium on federal killings.

Reports of botched executions include a 2024 Idaho execution halted after eight failed attempts to find a vein for lethal injection; an Alabama killing using an experimental nitrogen gas method that caused “violent” shaking last year; and a 2021 lethal injection in Oklahoma that caused vomiting and convulsing. A Guardian report in May revealed that South Carolina appeared to botch an execution by firing squad, a rarely used method now making a comeback, with autopsy records suggesting shooters missed the target area on the man's heart.

Tennessee's department of correction declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, did not respond to an email. Lee declined to grant Black clemency.

Jonathan Skrmetti, the state's attorney general, defended the execution in a statement, writing: “Every American has the right to their own opinion about the death penalty, but courts rely on actual facts and actual law, not on theatrics and passion. Black filed a dozen separate legal challenges to avoid his sentence. Every one of them failed. Byron Black's execution was entirely legal.”

Black's apparently excruciating death was the final chapter in a life that his lawyers said was marked by challenges.

Black spent 35 years on death row after he was convicted of the 1988 homicides of Angela Clay, his 29-year-old girlfriend, and her two daughters, Latoya, nine, and Lakeisha, six.

Black has maintained his innocence, though the critical courtroom battles have revolved around his intellectual disability, according to the Nashville Banner, which reported that Black's attorney in 1989 had argued he was incompetent to stand trial. During sentencing, he did not understand he had already been found guilty, his lawyers have said.

Black suffered from prenatal alcohol exposure and was exposed to toxic lead as a toddler, contributing to lifelong cognitive and developmental impairments, his attorneys said. He struggled throughout school, endured traumatic brain injuries from playing football and was never able to live independently, having difficulties performing basic chores as an adult.

When Henry first met Black in 2000, she was pregnant with her second son, and they bonded over conversations about family: “Getting to know Byron is getting to know his family. He always wanted to talk about his family's reunions, which are just legendary.” She learned about how he had relatives in all 50 states, tracing their roots to ancestors enslaved by President James Polk.

“He was always, always smiling. Talking to him was like sitting on the front porch having a glass of iced tea,” she said, recalling how he wrote down everyone's birthday in a makeshift calendar and never missed them. He never complained about prison treatment nor asked about his case. “I would give him updates, and his response was always, thank you so much. I never had a visit where he didn't say, ‘God bless you, I appreciate you,' including up until the very last moment.”

Henry, a federal public defender, watched as Black's physical and mental health deteriorated over two decades on death row. For years, he struggled to walk, but staff at the prison would wheel him into his legal visits on an office chair, before eventually giving him a wheelchair, she said. When prostate cancer surgery went wrong, he nearly died, she said. “Still, he never said a negative word about the doctor.”

The state conceded in 2022 court proceedings that Black was, in fact, intellectually disabled under current laws. The Tennessee legislature had amended statutes in 2021 to align its definitions of intellectual disabilities with contemporary medical standards. Executing people with Black's condition is prohibited.

The courts, however, ruled that the new law did not apply to him, because Henry's intellectual disability claim had been considered and rejected two decades earlier under the old standards.

If he had filed the disability claim for the first time after the 2021 reform, his execution would have been deemed illegal, Henry said.

It's a procedural loophole that torments Henry, who said she feels responsible for what happened since it was her original claim that was rejected 20 years ago.

“Every execution takes a piece of your heart,” said Henry, who has represented 13 people who were executed, three of which she witnessed. “But this one hurts so much … Because I raised the intellectual disability claim when I did, he is dead. The law was wrong, the law changed, and he couldn't get due process because we'd raised it before. And I just cannot reconcile that.”

In the weeks leading up to the execution, Black's attorneys had voiced significant concerns over the procedure, arguing that there was a serious risk that his defibrillator, implanted to regulate his heart disease, would respond to the injection by repeatedly shocking him, causing protracted, agonizing pain. But Tennessee's supreme court allowed the execution to proceed with the device activated.

Henry said initial evaluation of the device after his death showed that it did not shock him.

Black's lawyers now hope that the autopsy, which will take weeks to complete, will help make clear what did go wrong.

It's possible the pentobarbital entered his muscle tissue, instead of his veins, due to the IV insertion problems, she said. The drug may have failed to flow properly due to the tight straps constraining his body, which also could have masked convulsions indicating pain. He may have endured pulmonary edema, a condition seen in others executed by injection, where the lungs fill with fluid, causing a sensation akin to suffocation and drowning.

Henry said the lack of transparency around where the state obtained the drug raised fears the supply could be subpotent, improperly stored or have other problems.

The state's attorneys have argued that the pentobarbital should make people unresponsive and unable to perceive pain, but Black's repeated lifting of his head while groaning in agony suggested otherwise, she said.

Skrmetti, the attorney general, said in his statement that the defibrillator not shocking Black was “just as the state's medical expert predicted”. He also condemned the criticisms of the drug, saying that in previous litigation, Black's lawyers had argued that pentobarbital had lower risk of pain compared to other lethal injection drugs.

Nine days before the execution, Henry had to explain to Black that she was running out of options to save him. The two wept, she recalled: “He grabbed me and held me really, really tight and said, ‘I want you to know that what you did mattered.'”

Black made no final statement in the execution chamber.

After Black was pronounced dead, Henry stood at a podium in front of television cameras and condemned the state for executing “a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in violation of the laws of our country simply because they could”. He said: “What happened here was the result of pure, unbridled bloodlust and cowardice. It was the brutal and unchecked abuse of government power. It was the result of a failed criminal legal system.”

She told the crowd Black had said he was shy about speaking, but had asked her to read a message.

“He wanted his friends and family to know: ‘I love you and I won't never forget you. All of our relationships have been very special. It was my pleasure in meeting everybody and the way we connected with each other,” she read, through tears. “And to his legal team, who I know is watching this, keep doing what you're doing. God gave you a gift. You have power, and I can feel it.”

Cabinet meeting minutes show how Netanyahu chose to create famine in Gaza over securing release of Israeli hostages.

Israel decided to starve the people of Gaza as a strategy of war and in order to sabotage the ceasefire deal, according to Israeli cabinet meeting minutes leaked on Wednesday to Israel's Channel 13. 

The document purports to show that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refused multiple proposals that would have secured the release of the remaining Israeli captives during the ceasefire between January and March 2025. Netanyahu decided to break the ceasefire, against the advice of top Israeli military and security officials, and to cut off all aid to Gaza to “force Hamas to surrender,” the leak shows.

The Israeli cabinet's meeting, dated March 1, was to discuss the fate of the ceasefire with Hamas as the first phase of the agreement was set to expire. The prospective second phase of the ceasefire was supposed to see the beginning of talks on the permanent end of the war. The minutes released by Channel 13 show that army and intelligence officials argued for concluding the ceasefire deal, while cabinet ministers opposed it.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Major General Nitzan Alon, the Israeli army official in charge of prisoners and missing persons, reportedly argued that “the only opportunity to release the captives is to discuss the conditions of phase two,” while Ronen Bar, the chief of the Israeli internal intelligence agency (the Shabak), said that his “preferred option is to move forward with phase two,” stating that Israel could “easily” return to war later. “Let's get everyone back first, then resume the fight,” he reportedly said.

The minutes also revealed that a senior Israeli security official told the ministers that “it is possible to secure the release of more captives, but that requires engaging in talks about phase two — ending the war.” The government, however, led by Netanyahu, rejected the proposal. He was backed by Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, who reportedly said that Israel was “not prepared to end the war while Hamas remains in power.” Dermer, who supports Netanyahu's hardline position on Gaza, was named by the Prime Minister as head of the negotiating team in the ceasefire talks.

Also backing Netanyahu's refusal was hardline Finance Minister Bezelel Smotrich, who lashed out at military and intelligence officials, insisting that they were “misleading the public” into thinking Israel could “stop the war and return to it later,” which Smotrich regarded as “ignorance.” 

For his part, Israeli Defense Minister, Israel Katz, supported a partial deal, saying that, “If Hamas returns even a number of hostages — less than half — that's excellent.”

On March 18, Israel broke the ceasefire by launching a wave of bombings on Gaza, killing 400 Palestinians, mostly civilians, in the first minutes of the onslaught. Israel also announced the complete closing of the crossing points, causing an immediate drop in available goods in the strip and cutting off the entry of humanitarian aid. The continuation of the blockade caused the spread of severe hunger, which UN agencies have qualified as famine. UNICEF has called the deaths of Palestinian children due to starvation “unconscionable”.

Israel also halted the work of UN agencies in Gaza, limiting the distribution of the little aid it began to allow in since April to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). The GHF is the controversial Israeli-backed and U.S.-run organization that replaced the UN in May, and has forced Palestinians to travel to four distribution centers in the southern Gaza Strip to collect aid. The centers have been described as “death traps” that use aid as “bait” to lure Palestinians into southern Gaza. There, the Israeli army opens fire on aid-seekers, resulting in numerous recorded “aid massacres.” As of the time of writing, 1,561 people have been killed at GHF sites or while waiting for aid trucks in the north, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.

According to the Health Ministry, some 160 Palestinians, including 90 children, have died due to malnutrition brought on by starvation.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Buyers and sellers alike struggle to survive under both siege and constant threat of Israeli airstrikes on the markets.

In Gaza, survival has been redefined. It is no longer just about fleeing bombs — it is about keeping ourselves from dying of hunger. The echoing question — “Where do we go?” — has now been compounded by another, more desperate one: “What can we eat so we don't collapse?”

Gaza was once a self-sufficient agricultural society. More than that, it also exported citrus, strawberries, oranges, lemons, olives, and even flowers to the West. Today, it is corralled not only by siege and death, but by hunger and devastation.

On July 26, I ventured out to Al-Nuseirat market to secure a meal. I walked four hours under the blazing sun, but the “market” was nothing more than two war-battered streets with a few makeshift stalls and hundreds of shops bearing the same lifeless sign: “Closed.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

I searched from one stall to the next for something edible and reasonably priced. But the piercing cries nearby shattered the last sliver of hope I was holding onto.

A horse cart rolled by, overflowing with the bodies of martyrs, gunned down at the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aid access point. Grieving relatives ran alongside, rushing them to Al-Awda Hospital, still hoping their loved ones might be clinging to life.

On the opposite side of the street stood a young, dust-covered man clutching a bag filled with a few canned goods — his entire gain for the day. Bystanders gathered around him, asking, “Do you want to sell them?”

He tightened his grip on the bag, groaned, quickened his pace, and replied, “No, of course not.”

A few withered vegetables sat atop one or two stalls. People stopped, asked about prices, then laughed — bitterly, ironically — before walking away in stunned silence.

I, too, stood at one of the stalls, frozen in disbelief at the soaring prices:

A kilo of half-rotten tomatoes: $40.

A kilo of onions: $23.

A kilo of cucumbers: $30.

A kilo of eggplants: $13.

A kilo of peppers: $34.

A kilo of bell peppers: $72.50.

A kilo of okra: $101.50.

“Why are the prices so ridiculously high?” I asked the vendor.

“Our farmlands in eastern Al-Qarara were bulldozed. Our trees uprooted. Our only sources of livelihood — severed,” he replied. “People think we're the problem — that we're complicit in this genocide. But this is just the final scene in a long cascade of atrocities that brought us here.”

Another vendor nearby interrupted, adding, “The vegetables we're selling today at these high prices were once given away for free before the genocide — because they had started to rot. But even these withered few now cost us our lives. We could be shot dead just picking them.”

Like most people in Gaza, I walked away empty-handed.

But before I left, I asked if anyone was truly able to afford these prices.

“Weeks go by without selling a single vegetable,” one vendor replied.

I kept walking — until I reached a crowd stampeding toward a flour stall. People fought desperately to get just one kilo. I pushed through and finally caught the seller's attention.

A kilo of flour was being sold for 80 shekels — about $23 in U.S. dollars — the same price that used to buy an entire sack before the war. I offered the seller the full amount — but in smaller bills.

To my shock, he refused. “These are worn-out, torn bills,” he told me. “No vendor will accept them.”

Before I left home that morning, my father had given me money. But the edge of a bill tore as he pulled it from the drawer. I had gone earlier to a man who fixes torn currency, but he refused. “You need the small separated piece to repair it,” he told me.

I offered to pay for the flour via bank transfer. The vendor agreed — but only if I paid 160 shekels instead (around $46), citing commission fees that can reach $40–$50. Cash is nearly nonexistent in Gaza. Money is either half-useless, or it vanishes — spent on survival, slipping through our fingers like sand.

I had no choice but to accept. Flour might be there today — but tomorrow, it might vanish.

Just a few meters ahead, the smell of bread wafted through the air. A young man was selling a single loaf for 15 shekels — nearly $7 — yet no one came.

No buyers.

Most Palestinians in Gaza have no stable income. And if they do, it's barely enough to buy anything in this economy strangled by war.

Across the street sat a young boy, who should have been in a classroom at that hour, seated at a table instead. His backpack, filled with books, was now just a symbol of a future stolen. He should have been celebrating academic wins with his family, not selling grams of lactose, a sugar substitute, at $150 per kilo.

Many have said lactose can be harmful, but no one can afford to care.

Behind him stood an UNRWA school-turned-shelter.

I approached him.

“How much for a gram of lactose?” I asked.

“Forty-five shekels,” he replied. About $13.

I asked if he accepted bank transfers.

His voice cracked. “No,” he said. “My father used to deal with bank transfers … but he was killed. I need cash now — to support my family.”

I stopped by our friend's gold shop to say hello — and was stunned to see people lined up to sell their jewelry. They were desperate to convert gold into cash, just to meet the bare demands of existence — even if only temporarily.

I kept wandering the market. One vendor was selling two school backpacks — no longer used for education, but for carrying belongings amid constant displacement.

Another stall had only a few figs. I asked the price, hoping to buy them as a birthday gift for my father. I paid $15 for five figs and surprised him later that day.

I interviewed Abdurrahman Nijm, a local farmer, about the skyrocketing food crisis.

“After two years of this devastating genocide, it's nearly impossible to plant or harvest anything,” he said. “I have just two dunams of land. The occupation may have started this — but its effects have devastated every part of our lives.”

Nijm explained that Tropsin, a crop insecticide, now costs 5,000 shekels ($1,200), compared to just $10 before the war.

“These conditions have crushed all of us — sellers and buyers alike,” he said.

“Even the vegetables I managed to grow were destroyed by toxic smoke, airstrikes, sewage floods from overcrowded displacement centers. Eventually, my land became a shelter for displaced families with nowhere else to go.”

He paused and added bitterly, “I've lost so much. Our survival attempts have failed. It's not just that vegetables are scarce — so is fuel. Everything in our lives has been on hold since October 7.”

My neighbor, Mohammad Johar, owns a stall at the Al-Nuseirat market.

“I see prices change during the day depending on political announcements — talks of aid, borders, or ceasefires. If a ceasefire seems to collapse, traders immediately raise prices,” Johar said. “Flour prices dropped from 120 to 25 shekels the moment negotiations seemed hopeful.”

“This genocide destroyed everything I built — and everything I dreamed of building,” Johar continued. “My new home, which I moved into just one month before the genocide, was demolished. My future projects — all gone. Now I work only to keep my children alive.”

Parched, I searched for water. I found a small child selling plastic pouches filled with it. He stood with his younger brother under the same scorching sun, the buzz of drones overhead, selling each pouch for the equivalent of 50 U.S. cents.

Suddenly, an airstrike landed nearby.

The earth shook. My vision blurred. My heart pounded. Children's screams pierced my soul. I will never forget the fear in their eyes.

They grabbed their water and ran, calling for their parents.

It had been a deadly attack on a group of young men chatting beside a cigarette stall. Two were killed. Dozens injured.

Johar witnessed the airstrike, and described the incident as a bloodbath.

In Gaza, stepping outside — from home, or from shelter — means accepting you might never return.

Just like my cousin, Yahya.

He went to the At-Tuffah market in June to buy his little girl a sweet candy. But the airstrike was faster — more brutal, more soul-crushing. It killed him and 12 other civilians.

After the bombing at Al-Nuseirat market, my family panicked. My phone exploded with calls.

I replied, “I'm fine. I survived… by a mere fluke.”

On the way home, I saw a frail child and his father selling firewood, uprooted from their own trees.

One kilo: $2.

Just to scrape by, barely, under astronomical prices.

Another stall displayed beach hats. My heart leapt — a flicker of summer.

Then it sank.

Access to the sea — Gaza's last escape — is now banned. No sailing.

I passed by a stall selling plants I had never seen before. My sister explained that these purslane plants grow naturally on farmlands — but now, because of starvation, people are cooking them.

A few meters away, a woman argued with a vendor. His stall had lentils for $10, rice for $25, spaghetti for $10, and cooking oil for $25. It looked like humanitarian aid.

The woman tried to barter — an act of resistance against starvation. He refused.

“I'm selling my family's rations,” he said. “I have no choice. I need cash — I need to buy their medications.”

I was lucky to find a horse-drawn cart to carry me home. After four hours of walking, I returned with nothing but a kilo of flour and five figs. I reached home dizzy, scorched by heatstroke.

That day's meal was lentils, a quarter loaf of bread, and one pepper.

It's been nearly two years of genocide. And still, our anguish compounds — layer upon layer of hunger, displacement, fear, and lurid, evolving forms of death.

And yet — it seems that no one cares.

“To secure clean water is to risk your life,” Nijm had told me earlier that day. “To buy a single loaf of bread for your starving children means giving up your last savings — if you have any. To approach an aid distribution point is to gamble with death. And to stand beneath the sky, hoping for an airdrop, is to surrender the last thing we Gazans still cling to: our dignity.”

“We are suffering. We are persecuted. We are being systematically erased. Life here in Gaza is impossible,” he said.

Then he repeated, louder: “Life here in Gaza is impossible. Let food and medicine reach us. Stop the carnage. Let us live.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The leaders of New Zealand and Australia on Saturday discussed closer cooperation between their expanding militaries against the backdrop of a recent extraordinary Chinese live-fire exercise near their shores.

New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon hosted his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese at the tourist city of Queenstown for their second annual bilateral leaders' meeting.

Luxon said his country wanted closer military cooperation with Australia, a country he describes as New Zealand's “only ally.”

“A big focus for us has been interoperability with Australia. We want to be a force multiplier,” Luxon told reporters.

“We want to be one, sort of, essential Anzac force essentially operating within our region,” he added, referring to the Australian New Zealand Army Corps in which the two nations' soldiers first fought together during World War I.

The summit follows a Chinese naval flotilla firing weapons in February in the Tasman Sea, which separates Australia and New Zealand. The exercise forced commercial airlines to divert flights.

The Chinese navy rarely ventures so far south and the mission that partially circumnavigated Australia was seen as a demonstration of China's growing military reach.

Albanese said last month that he complained to China's President Xi Jinping during a state visit to Beijing about the lack of notice the Chinese had given of the live-fire exercise. Xi replied that Australia also engaged in exercises, referring to freedom of navigation missions conducted by Australian military in the disputed South China Sea.

Albanese and Luxon recognized their countries face the most unpredictable and dangerous strategic environment in decades and their alliance plays a critical role in protecting and advancing their shared interest in the region, they said in a joint statement.

The prime ministers also commended progress over the past year to intensify defense cooperation and integration.

While the statement did not mention China, the prime ministers confirmed their most important trading partner was discussed.

“Of course, the geostrategic competition, in particular between the great powers, is something that countries like Australia and New Zealand do discuss together and we cooperate politically,” Albanese said.

Luxon said “both countries have followed pretty much the same playbook” in their bilateral dealings with China.

“China's an important world power. It's important that we can engage,” Luxon said.

“We genuinely are able to have a conversation — I think a very mature one now — to say, look, we do have very different histories, we do have different systems, we do have different values, that does mean we do have differences. Good partners should be not afraid to talk about those things,” Luxon added.

Luxon announced in April a plan to make the New Zealand Defense Force more combat capable that would double defense spending to more than 2 per cent of GDP. He described the rise from around 1 per cent over the past two decades as “a big step up for us.”

In a demonstration of Tokyo seeking deeper strategic ties in the South Pacific, Japanese warships docked in New Zealand on Friday for the first time in almost 90 years.

Australia announced this week Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will build a fleet of 11 Australian naval frigates with a contract expected to be worth US$6.5-billion.

Australia's most expensive defense expansion is a submarine deal with the United States and Britain that is expected to cost up to $245-billion. Under the trilateral partnership known by the acronym AUKUS, Australia will acquire a fleet of eight submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology.

U.S. President Donald Trump has urged western countries to increase their defense budgets and rely less on the U.S. for their security.

Albanese told reporters on Saturday, “If people argue that we should increase our defense spending, we are.”

            The human genome is made up of 23 pairs of chromosomes, the biological blueprints that make humans … well, human. But it turns out that some of our DNA — about 8% — are the remnants of ancient viruses that embedded themselves into our genetic code over the course of human evolution.
    


            These ancient viruses lie in sections of our DNA called transposable elements, or TEs, also known as “jumping genes” due to their ability to copy and paste themselves throughout the genome. TEs, which account for nearly half of our genetic material, were once waved off as “junk” DNA, sequences that appear to have no biological function. Now, a new study offers support for the hypothesis that these ancient viral remnants play a key role in the early stages of human development and may have been implicated in our evolution.
    


            By sequencing TEs, an international team of researchers identified hidden patterns that could be crucial for gene regulation, the process of turning genes on and off. The findings were published July 18 in the journal Science Advances.
    


            “Our genome was sequenced long ago, but the function of many of its parts remain unknown,” study coauthor Dr. Fumitaka Inoue, an associate professor in functional genomics at Kyoto University in Japan, said in a statement. “Transposable elements are thought to play important roles in genome evolution, and their significance is expected to become clearer as research continues to advance.”

            There are many benefits to studying how TEs activate gene expression. It could help scientists understand the role that the sequences play in human evolution, reveal possible links between TEs and human diseases, or teach researchers how to target functional TEs in gene therapy, said lead researcher Dr. Xun Chen, a computational biologist and principal investigator at Shanghai Institute of Immunity and Infection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
    


            With more research, “we hope to uncover how TEs, particularly ERVs (endogenous retroviruses, or ancient viral DNA), make us human,” Chen added in an email.
    


            When our primate ancestors were infected with viruses, sequences of viral genetic information would replicate and insert themselves in various locations in the host's chromosomes.
    


            “Ancient viruses are effective in invading our ancestral genomes, and their remnants become a big part of our genome. Our genome has developed numerous mechanisms to control these ancient viruses, and to eliminate their potential detrimental effects,” said Dr. Lin He, a molecular biologist and the Thomas and Stacey Siebel Distinguished Chair professor in stem cell research at the University of California, Berkeley, in an email.

            For the most part, these ancient viruses are inactive and are not a cause of concern, but in recent years, research has shown that some of the transposable elements may play important roles in human diseases. A July 2024 study explored the possibility of silencing certain TEs to make cancer treatment more effective.
    


            “Over the course of evolution, some viruses are degenerated or eliminated, some are largely repressed in expression in normal development and physiology, and some are domesticated to serve the human genome,” said He, who was not involved with the new study. “While perceived as solely harmful, some ancient viruses can become part of us, providing raw materials for genome innovation.”
    


            But because of their repetitive nature, transposable elements are notoriously difficult to study and organize. While TE sequences are categorized into families and subfamilies based on their function and similarity, many have been poorly documented and classified, “which could significantly impact their evolutionary and functional analyses,” Chen said.
    


            The new study focused on a group of TE sequences called MER11 found within primate genomes. By using a new classification system as well as testing the DNA's gene activity, researchers identified four previously undiscovered subfamilies.
    


            The most recently integrated sequence, named MER11_G4, was found to have a strong ability to activate gene expression in human stem cells and early-stage neural cells. The finding indicates that this TE subfamily plays a role in early human development and can “dramatically influence how genes respond to developmental signals or environmental cues,” according to a statement from Kyoto University.
    


            The research also suggests that viral TEs  had a part in shaping human evolution. By tracing the way the DNA has changed over time, the researchers found that the subfamily had evolved differently within the genomes of different animals, contributing to the biological evolution  that resulted in humans, chimpanzees and macaques.  



            “To understand the evolution of our genome is one way to understand what makes humans unique,” said He. “It will empower us with tools to understand human biology, human genetic diseases, and human evolution.”
    


            Exactly how these TEs were implicated in the evolutionary process is still unclear, Chen said. It is also possible that other TEs that have yet to be identified played distinct roles in the evolutionary process  of primates, he added.
    


Gene that protected humans 5,000 years ago may be linked to debilitating modern disease



            “The study offers new insights and potential leverage points for understanding the role of TEs in shaping the evolution of our genomes,” said Dr. Steve Hoffmann, a computational biologist at the Leibniz Institute on Aging in Jena, Germany, who was not involved with the study. The research also “underscores how much more there is to learn from a type of DNA once slandered as a molecular freeloader,” he added in an email.
    


            Hoffmann was the lead researcher of a scientific paper that first documented the nearly complete genome map of the Greenland shark, the longest-living vertebrate in the world that can survive  until about 400 years old. The shark's genome was made up of more than 70% jumping genes, while the human genome  is composed of less than 50%.   While primate genomes are different from those of a shark, “the study provides further evidence for the potential impact of TEs on genome regulation” and “is a message with relevance for all genome researchers,” Hoffmann said.
    


            By investigating how genomes have evolved, researchers can determine which DNA sequences have remained the same, which have been lost in time and which have emerged most recently.
    


            “Taking these sequences into account is often critical to understanding, e.g., why humans develop diseases that certain animals don't,” Hoffmann said. “Ultimately, a deeper understanding of genome regulation can aid in the discovery of novel therapies and interventions.”

            Three people were wounded during a shooting at New York City's iconic Times Square, police said Saturday.
    


            One person was held in custody and questioned over the shooting, the New York Police Department said. No charges have been pressed yet.
    


            Video on social media showed people running away from the scene, police surrounding a vehicle and attending to the wounded lying on the ground. Several have been hospitalized, but their injuries are not life-threatening, the police said.
    


            The shooting took place at 1:20 a.m. No details have been released so far on how it unfolded.
    


            New York City has seen a remarkable drop in gun violence this year. Through August 3, it has seen its fewest shootings in decades, down 23% so far since last year.
    


            New York bans firearms from certain so-called sensitive locations such as public transportation, hospitals, schools and Times Square, and requires that handgun owners prove “good moral character.” The US Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge to the state's gun laws in April.

The three-time Olympic champion secured victory with her final attempt, throwing 70.94 metres. The mark is the best ever recorded in her age category.

In other Polish performances, Anna Gryc finished second in the women's 400 metres hurdles, clocking a personal best of 55.05 seconds — the fifth-fastest time in Polish athletics history, according to the national federation.

Angelika Sarna was also runner-up in the 800 metres, setting a lifetime best of 1:59.19. Both Gryc and Sarna collected valuable points towards qualification for the world championships in Tokyo in September.

The Trump administration is seeking to launch an initial public offering of shares in mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac later this year, a senior administration official said on Friday.

The IPOs could give the two government-backed entities a combined valuation of nearly $500 billion, according to the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Friday that the state will move forward with a ballot measure in November to redraw its congressional map in response to a Republican-backed redistricting plan in Texas.

Speaking alongside state Democratic leaders, Newsom said they would call for a special election in the first week of November to vote on redrawing the congressional map, a move that could potentially add five more U.S. House seats to the Democratic tally.

MOSCOW, August 9. /TASS/. Russian servicemen destroyed 60% of the enemy's assault group in the Novokonstantinovka and Yablonovka areas of the Sumy Region during three unsuccessful Ukrainian attacks, security forces told TASS.

"The enemy made three unsuccessful attempts to attack the positions of the North battlegroup's marines and paratroopers, and all three attempts were thwarted: two were in the Novokonstantinovka area, and one was in the Yablonovka area. As a result of the firefight, 60% of the enemy's assault groups, one T-64BV tank, and one D-20 howitzer were destroyed," the sources said.

Earlier, security forces reported the transfer of more than 40 Ukrainian army brigades and regiments from various sections of the front to the Sumy and Kharkov areas. The security forces also reported that the Ukrainian military had reduced the intensity of their counterattacks, though they were still attempting to break through the right flank of the North battlegroup in Novokonstantinovka.

LUGANSK, August 9. /TASS/. Russian servicemen have surrounded a Ukrainian grouping stationed near Volchansk in the Kharkov Region, military expert Andrey Marochko told TASS.

"When it comes to the town of Volchansk, we have complete control of the situation. <...> One of the enemy groups, which was located in the area of the settlement of Tikhoye, has been surrounded. At the moment, our servicemen are engaged in destroying enemy manpower and mopping up the wooded area," he said.

The military expert noted that enemy units located near Volchansk are trying to resist.

The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a joint declaration for peace and bilateral economic agreements with Washington in a ceremony hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Aug. 8.

"For more than 35 years, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a bitter conflict that resulted in tremendous suffering for both nations… Many tried to find a resolution… and they were unsuccessful. With this accord, we've finally succeeded in making peace," Trump said.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed the "peace roadmap" joint declaration alongside Trump following decades of conflict between the two nations over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, primarily populated by ethnic Armenians, but internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory.

Azerbaijan recaptured the territory from Armenian forces in 2023, prompting the exodus of over 100,000 ethnic Armenians from the region.

"Today, we have reached a significant milestone in Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. We are laying a foundation to write a better story than the one we had in the past. This breakthrough would simply not have been possible without President Trump's personal engagement and his resolute commitment to peace," Pashinyan said.

A transportation corridor between the two countries will be created and will connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave located west of southern Armenia. The U.S. will have leasing rights for private companies to develop the new transit corridor.

The bilateral economic agreements that the two leaders signed with Trump will promote cooperation in trade, transit, energy infrastructure, and technology with the U.S.

"The countries of Armenia and Azerbaijan are committing to stop all fighting forever; open up commerce, travel, and diplomatic relations; and respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity," Trump said.

Following the signing of the peace deal in Washington, Aliyev and Pashinyan are both expected to nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize.

"Who, if not President Trump, deserves the Nobel Peace Prize? ... we will agree to issue a joint letter," Aliyev said.

Trump has previously expressed that his mediation efforts in various conflicts deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.

The U.S. leader previously announced that he would host the two leaders for a "Historic Peace Summit" and formally settle the conflict.

Russian President Vladimir Putin introduced a sweeping proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine during a meeting with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff, offering a halt in hostilities in exchange for Ukraine's eastern regions, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Aug. 8, citing European and Ukrainian officials.

Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's claim that the talks between Witkoff and Putin did not serve as a breakthrough in peace negotiations, the U.S. president announced on Aug. 8 that he will meet Putin for his first in-person encounter on Aug. 15 in Alaska.

According to European officials briefed on a call by Witkoff, Putin told Wikoff that Russia would agree to a full ceasefire if Kyiv withdrew its forces from Donetsk Oblast, giving Moscow full control of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as Crimea, WSJ reported.

European officials briefed on the proposal reportedly expressed serious reservations about the plan, worried about the prospects that Putin is pulling along negotiations as a means to avoid punishing secondary sanctions proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. 

Additional reservations posed by European officials include a lack on clarity as to territory partially occupied by Russian forces in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts — with conflicting impressions as to whether the front line would be frozen in its current place or whether there would be a withdrawal of Russian forces in the region.

According to the WSJ, Putin's proposal contains two phases. The first phase would entail Ukrainian forces withdrawing from Donetsk, thus freezing the front line. The second phase would entail Trump and Putin agreeing to a final peace plan that would later be negotiated with President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Ukraine currently controls the northern part of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts, as well as part of Donetsk Oblast.

Amid reports of the proposal, in recent days the U.S. has publicly toyed with the prospects of swapping land in exchange for peace. Trump told reporters on Aug. 8 that a potential peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv would likely include "some swapping of territories."

"Well you're looking at territory that's been fought over for three-and-a-half years... So we're looking at that but we're actually looking to get some back," Trump said during a press conference alongside the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. "Some swapping, it's complicated."

"We're going to get some back. We're going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories to the betterment of both," Trump added.

Trump did not specify what he meant by "swapping." Russia previously declared the annexation of the latter four regions, which are partially occupied by Russia, in 2022 following sham referenda.

Seemingly ramping up pressure to come to a peace agreement, Trump said that Zelensky was "going to have to get ready to sign something," without specifying what terms to agreement may be present.

Bloomberg reported on Aug. 8, citing undisclosed sources, that U.S. and Russian officials are working on a territorial agreement, aimed at freezing the conflict and laying the groundwork for a ceasefire and technical negotiations toward a final peace settlement.

Kyiv and Moscow have held three rounds of negotiations on an end to the war, with each round failing to halt hostilities. Zelensky earlier this week signalled his willingness to participate in leader-level discussions, but it was not immediately clear whether he will participate in talks in Alaska.

Ukraine's Presidential Office has not yet publicly commented on the proposal. A Ukrainian official who participated in the call with Witkoff told the WSJ that Kyiv was not opposed to any proposals, however, stressing that a ceasefire would serve as a prerequisite for any further steps.

Russia has repeatedly espoused maximalist demands to end its war in Ukraine publicly demanded that Kyiv forgo NATO membership and withdraw troops from all four regions as preconditions for peace. Under this condition, several large cities under Ukrainian control would have to be handed over to Russia.

Jim Acosta, former senior White House correspondent for CNN, spent President Donald Trump's first term making himself the story. An ultimate example of this behavior was when he lectured Stephen Miller on Trump's call for immigrants to learn English. 

“The Statue of Liberty says, ‘Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. It doesn't say anything about speaking English,” Acosta piously said in what was supposed to be a question in 2017. “This whole notion of, ‘Well, they have to learn English before they get to the United States' — are we just going to bring in people from Great Britain and Australia?” 

Miller responded thusly: 

“I am shocked at your statement that you think only people from Great Britain and Australia would know English,” Miller retorted. “It reveals your cosmopolitan bias to a shocking degree. This is an amazing moment — that you think only people from Great Britain or Australia would speak English is so insulting to millions of hardworking immigrants who do speak English from all over the world. That is one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant, and foolish things you have ever said.” 

Good for Miller. And he's right: 125 million people speak English in India alone. Acosta would later go on CNN that night to make himself the victim for asking a ridiculous question. 

Eight years later, he was basically shown the door by CNN after being offered to anchor the graveyard shift to the smallest audience possible. Acosta declined and was out at the network, but not before (again) having another look-at-me moment before signing off. 

“People often ask me if the highlight of my career at CNN was at the White House covering Donald Trump,” he said during his last broadcast. “Actually, no. That moment came when I covered President Obama's trip to Cuba in 2016 and had the chance to question the dictator there, Raul Castro, about the island's political prisoners. As the son of a Cuban refugee, I took home the lesson: it is never a good time to bow down to a tyrant. I have always believed it's the job of the press to hold power to account. I've always tried to do that at CNN and plan to go on doing it in the future.”

The tyrant in Acosta's mind, of course, is Trump. As for holding the powerful to account, it's worth noting Acosta couldn't leave his position of White House correspondent fast enough after Biden's victory in 2020 because that would mean holding a Democrat administration accountable and that simply was not going to happen. 

Since leaving CNN, Acosta has launched a podcast that involves only interviewing Democrats. It couldn't be any more tedious since the conversation is two people agreeing with each other the entire time. 

With barely anyone watching these online interviews (his last one on Thursday generated a whopping 5,700 viewers on his YouTube channel), the host decided to do the unthinkable: Interview an AI-generated avatar of a dead teenager, Joaquin Oliver, who was murdered during that horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 that left 17 dead. 

“A show you don't want to miss at 4p ET / 1p PT. I'll be having a one of a kind interview with Joaquin Oliver. He died in the Parkland school shooting in 2018. But his parents have created an AI version of their son to deliver a powerful message on gun violence,” a shameless Acosta posted on X while turning replies off. 

It is ironic: A leading purveyor of fake news interviewing a fake person to draw attention to himself. 

“I would like to know what your solution would be for gun violence,” Acosta asked AI Joaquin at one point. 

“Great question. I believe in a mix of stronger gun control laws, mental health support, and community engagement. We need to create safe spaces for conversations and connections, making sure everyone feels seen and heard,” the avatar responded. “It's about building a culture of kindness and understanding. What do you think about that?” 

“I think that's a great idea, Joaquin,” Acosta responded while acting as if this were an interview with an actual person. 

It can't be underscored enough just how sick and unethical this is. For starters, we have zero idea what Joaquin's views were on gun control or if he had an opinion on the matter at all. In this case, the AI version was obviously pre-programmed to agree with Acosta on gun control. 

With no boss or advertisers to answer to, Acosta got away with this. But it's hard to see how he's not going to lose subscribers over this. And since this drew attention, thought mostly negative, Acosta will likely do something this again to satisfy his constant need for attention. 

So who's next? AI Nicole Brown Simpson to answer questions about O.J.? 

What is so telling in 2025 is how much those who claimed to be serious, objective journalists have completely exposed themselves for who they've been all along: Lefty activists with a microphone. 

In the past few months alone, we've heard ex-ABC White House correspondent Terry Moran argue that it's “not reporter's job to be objective” while calling Trump's immigration policy “a terror campaign.” 

Chuck Todd, the former moderator of NBC's Meet The Press, said the press were mere victims of the attempted cover-up of Joe Biden's cognitive health and bore no responsibility for taking part in the cover-up “because they were lied to.” 

Don Lemon, another ex-CNNer, argued that “no rational Black person” could support Trump (after Trump got the highest share of the Black vote in more than 50 years in 2024), while ex-MSNBCer Joy Reid has compared Trump's immigration centers to “concentration camps” designed to round up “brown people.”

Jim Acosta interviewed a dead teenager this week. He says he has zero regrets. 

JIM ACOSTA'S INTERVIEW OF A DEAD KID IS A SHAMELESS STUNT

And therein lies the rub of “journalism” without the guardrails of an editor or authority. 

Because no sane person would ever greenlight such an obvious, and pathetic, publicity stunt.

DETROIT (AP) — Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris shared a social post Saturday, saying he's OK and thanking people for their support after he was taken off the field in an ambulance late in a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons.

Norris reposted a screenshot about being grateful along with a Bible verse, adding a message of his own.

“Amen Amen,” he posted on his Instagram story.

“I'm all good man don't stress,” he said, adding he appreciates all of the check-ins and support.

Norris was in stable condition late Friday night after he was attended to for about 20 minutes by medical personnel and taken to an Atlanta hospital.

The 24-year-old Norris was hurt with 14:50 left in the preseason game after hitting Falcons running back Nathan Carter. He hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back's midsection and his head snapped back after assisting on the tackle.

When play resumed, Atlanta quarterback Emory Jones snapped the ball as players from both teams stood at the line of scrimmage as the clock continued to run.

“Usually you see a couple trainers out there,” Lions quarterback Kyle Allen said. “It's never good when they bring out the stretchers.”

With 6:31 remaining in the fourth quarter, an official announced the game had been suspended “per New York” with the Lions leading the Falcons 17-10.

Detroit coach Dan Campbell and Atlanta coach Raheem Morris made the decision to not finish the game.




“Raheem Morris is a class act,” Campbell said. “He's the ultimate class act. We agreed it just didn't feel right to finish that game.”

Norris, a former Fresno State standout, played in eight games last season after earning a spot on the team as an undrafted rookie.

NFL preseason games ended early in consecutive weeks two years ago.

New England's game at Green Bay in Week 2 of the 2023 preseason was called off when Patriots cornerback Isaiah Bolden was carted off in the fourth quarter. Bolden appeared to collide with teammate Calvin Munson while attempting to make a hit on a pass completion to Malik Heath of the Packers. Bolden was taken to a hospital and released the next day.

A week later, a game between Miami and Jacksonville was not completed after Dolphins receiver Daewood Davis was carted off in the fourth quarter. Davis was hurt when he ran a slant route and was attempting to catch a pass when he was hit by Jaguars linebacker Dequan Jackson. Davis was released from the hospital a day later.

The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular-season game at Cincinnati in January 2023. Hamlin has enjoyed a remarkable recovery and resumed football the following season and spent last year as a Bills starter.

“You sign up for football and you understand the risk, you understand the injury risk,” Allen said. “You never think something like that is going to happen. At the end of the day we're all out here as football players. We may be on 32 different teams but we've all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it.”

The White House has announced an increased federal law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C., for at least the next week to combat crime.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. A robust but not unusual contingent of city police cruisers lingered around the edges of the crowds. At other late-night hot spots, nearly identical scenes unfolded. 

What wasn't apparent in Friday's earliest hours: any sort of security lockdown by a multiagency flood of uniformed federal law enforcement officers. That's what President Donald Trump had promised Thursday, starting at midnight, in the administration's latest move to impose its will on the nation's capital. 

In short, that law enforcement surge to take control of the District of Columbia's streets did not appear to unfold on schedule. A two-hour city tour, starting around 1 a.m. Friday, revealed no overt or visible law enforcement presence other than members of the Metropolitan Police Department, the city's police force. 

That still might change in the coming evenings as Trump puts into action his long-standing plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. According to his Thursday declaration, the security lockdown will run for seven days, “with the option to extend as needed.” In an online post Saturday, the Republican president said the Democratic-led city would soon be one of the country's safest and he announced a White House news conference for Monday, though he offered no details.

On Friday night, a White House official said Thursday night's operations included arrests for possession of two stolen firearms, suspected fentanyl and marijuana. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said more than 120 members of various federal agencies — the Secret Service, the FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service — were to be on duty Friday night, upping the complement of federal officers involved. 




“This is the first step in stopping the violent crime that has been plaguing the streets of Washington, D.C.,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. The police department has gone similarly silent. 

The catalyst for this latest round of takeover drama was the assault last weekend on a high-profile member of the bureaucracy-slashing Department of Government Efficiency by a group of teenagers in an attempted carjacking. 

Police arrested two 15-year-olds and were seeking others. Trump quickly renewed his calls for the federal government to seize control.

“If D.C. doesn't get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they're not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later told reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” 

The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year.

The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. Emergency legislation passed by the D.C. Council this summer imposed tighter youth curfew restrictions and empowered Police Chief Pamela Smith to declare temporary juvenile curfew zones for four days at a time. In those areas, a gathering of nine or more under the age of 18 is unlawful after 8 p.m. 

Trump is within his powers in deploying federal law enforcement assets on D.C. streets. He could deploy the National Guard, although that is not one of the dozen participating agencies listed in his declaration. The first Trump administration called in the National Guard during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 and again on Jan. 6, 2021, when his supporters overran the Capitol.

Further steps, including taking over the police department, would require a declaration of emergency. Legal experts believe that would most likely be challenged in court. Such an approach would fit the general pattern of Trump's second term in office, when he has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs. In many cases, he moved forward while the courts sorted it out. 

Imposing a full federal takeover of Washington would require a congressional repeal of the Home Rule Act of 1973. It's a step that Trump said lawyers are examining.

That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia.

Signed into law by President Richard Nixon, the measure allowed D.C. residents to elect their own mayor, council and local commissioners. The district had been previously run by federally appointed commissioners and members of Congress, some of whom balked at having to deal with potholes and other details of running a city of 700,000 residents.

So far, Trump's criticisms of Washington can be felt most directly in the actions of the National Park Service, which controls large pieces of land throughout the capital. In Trump's second administration, the agency has stepped up its clearing of homeless encampments on Park Service land and recently carried out a series of arrests of people smoking marijuana in public parks. 

Earlier in the week, the agency said a statue of a Confederate military leader that was toppled by protesters in 2020 would be restored and replaced, in line with an executive order.

A co-owner of a Trump-branded burger chain in Texas is facing deportation as officials allege that the Lebanese national overstayed his visa, engaged in "sham" marriages and has a criminal record that includes an assault charge. 

The 28-year-old restaurateur, Roland Mehrez Beainy, entered the United States in 2019 as a non-immigrant visitor and remained in the country illegally when his visa expired in February 2024, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told Fox News Digital on Saturday.

Beainy – who currently operates Trump Burger locations in Houston, Bellville, Flatonia and Kemah – opened the first restaurant in Bellville in 2020 but was never authorized to use the Trump name or branding, according to local reports. The Trump Organization, President Donald Trump's private business, sent the Bellville location a cease-and-desist letter earlier this year, The Fayette County Record reported.

Officials said Beainy's political leanings won't shield him from President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.

"Despite false claims to the contrary, Roland Mehrez Beainy does not have any immigration benefits that prevented his arrest or removal from the United States," an ICE spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Saturday. "Under the current administration, ICE is committed to restore integrity to our nation's immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission. This is true regardless of what restaurant you own or political beliefs you might have."

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said officials revoked Beainy's petition for immigration status after members of his own family admitted that his marriage was "a sham designed to game the system."

"The Department of Homeland Security has zero tolerance for immigration fraud, and this individual's claims are baseless," a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement Saturday. "This person has no Green Card, a history of illegal marriages, and an assault charge. DHS is actively pursuing all legal avenues to address this flagrant abuse of our immigration laws."

Beainy has denied the allegations, calling them "not true" in a statement to the Houston Chronicle.

The restaurateur was arrested by ICE in May and placed into immigration proceedings, but was granted bond in June, the agency said, adding that his deportation case will continue to proceed through the courts.

Beainy's burger chain has been embroiled in branding conflicts and other business disputes this year.

In February, attorneys for the Trump Organization sent Trump Burger a cease-and-desist letter accusing it of "misleading the public into falsely believing that your business is affiliated with the Trump Organization or endorsed by our clients," according to The Fayette County Record.

"We were surprised to learn that you have been flagrantly infringing upon the Trump Organization's valuable and well-established intellectual property right by operating at least three restaurants under the Trump name and brand," the letter read.

The company demanded Beainy stop using the Trump brand, scrub all references from marketing materials, and provide "a full accounting of all revenues" generated from the alleged misuse, The Fayette County Record reported, adding that the letter warned of legal actions if demands were not met.

In a separate matter in June, the restaurant sued its Kemah, Texas, landlord, Archie Patterson, who allegedly forced staff out and took control of the location, according to the Houston Chronicle. Patterson responded with his own lawsuit accusing Beainy of unpaid debts, the outlet added.

The Trump Organization and the attorney representing Beainy, Geoffrey S. Binney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Saturday.

            • Zelensky defiant: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country “will not give land to the occupier” after US President Donald Trump said there could be some “swapping of territories” to end the war in Ukraine.
    


            • Ceasefire talks: In a video address after Trump's announcement, Zelensky said Kyiv is “also ready to work together with President Trump.”
    


            • Trump will meet Putin: This came after Trump said he will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin next Friday in Alaska, the first time Putin will have been on US soil since 2015.

            Location matters, former real estate mogul US President Donald Trump said.
    


            Moments later he announced Alaska, a place sold by Russia to the United States 158 years ago for $7.2 million, would be where Russian President Vladimir Putin tries to sell his land deal of the century, getting Kyiv to hand over chunks of land he's not yet been able to occupy.
    


            The conditions around Friday's summit so wildly favor Moscow, it is obvious why Putin leapt at the chance, after months of fake-negotiation, and it is hard to see how a deal emerges from the bilateral that does not eviscerate Ukraine.

President Donald Trump said he'll be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss a potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine that could include “some swapping of territories.” But as CNN's Nick Paton Walsh explains, the conditions around Friday's summit so wildly favor Moscow, it's hard to see how a deal emerges that does not eviscerate Ukraine. #cnn #news #ukraine #russia #zelensky #putin #alaska #trump #analysis #war #peace 


            US officials have said a plan offered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine would include significant territorial concessions by Kyiv, according to Western officials briefed on the matter.
    


            The plan, which Putin presented to US President Donald Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff in a meeting in Moscow on Wednesday, would require Ukraine to cede the eastern Donbas region — the majority of which is currently occupied by Russia — as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. The plan would also freeze current battle lines, but other details of the proposal were still unclear.
    


            But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has quashed the idea of any territory concessions, saying his country “will not give land to the occupier.”
    


Some background: Donbas, a sprawling and beleaguered heartland region of Ukraine, has suffered years of conflict. Those who have lived in and studied the region describe it as an independent and gritty center of industry that has remained suspicious of outside forces for decades.
    


            War broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk, in the Donbas region, in the hands of Russian-backed separatists.
    


            Shortly before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin issued a decree recognizing the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has spoken to several European leaders today and expressed his gratitude for their continued support for Ukraine.
    


            It comes just ahead of a quickly-arranged meeting in England, featuring US Vice President JD Vance, UK foreign minister David Lammy and European officials.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a post on X that he had a discussion with Zelensky as well as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
    


            “We remain determined to support Ukraine, working in a spirit of unity and by leaning on the work carried out within the framework of the Coalition of the Willing.
    


            “The future of Ukraine cannot be decided without the Ukrainians who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now.”
    


            The Ukrainian leader earlier confirmed he had held a phone call with the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer. He noted that both leaders see the danger of “Russia's plan to reduce everything to a discussion of the impossible.”
    


            Zelensky said he had also spoken to Estonia's Prime Minister Kristjan Michal, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, and Finnish President Alexander Stubb.
    


            Ukrainians in Kyiv have been giving us their reaction to the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska next Friday.
    


            Speaking to CNN in the capital city, Artem, 33, said the meeting is “just for show,” and described Trump as a “spineless windbag.”
    


                    “While they are negotiating something there, people are dying. If they could make a deal, or wanted to, they would have already done it,” he said.
                





            Trump indicated Friday there could be “some swapping of territories” between Russia and Ukraine as part of a negotiation to end the war.
    


            Natalya, 48, described the prospect of ceding the Donetsk region to Russia to secure peace as “unfair and horrible.”
    


                    “Our boys, girls, how many have died? How many people are waiting for us under occupation, who unfortunately do not have the opportunity to leave. And they are waiting for Ukraine under the threat of death,” she said.
                





            Svitlana, 57, said she believes Putin has no intention of halting his offensive, and offered a bleak outlook on Ukraine's prospects for victory.
    


                    “We don't have the weapons to defend our land, we don't have Taurus missiles, we don't have long-range weapons. We can't take back our territory with drones. The population numbers are clearly incomparable,” she said.
                





            “We'll wait until Putin is carried out dead, maybe then the situation will change,” she added.
    


            We can give you more now on the backdrop to today's quickly arranged meeting in England, featuring US Vice President JD Vance and UK foreign minister David Lammy.
    


            It is intended to provide European officials a better sense of the United States' position ahead of next week's Alaska summit, as well as American officials' understanding of Russia's stance, according to Western officials.
    


            European leaders have been scrambling since Wednesday to gain a better read on what Putin told Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Moscow on Wednesday. When Trump briefed European leaders on the telephone the same day, he was light on details beyond saying the plan would require Ukraine to cede certain territory.
    


            Witkoff was expected to participate in Saturday's meeting virtually, the officials said. Vance was already in England on holiday with his family, and the meeting was added to his schedule, which had already included a meeting with the British foreign secretary on Friday.
    


            The way the Europeans understand it, the plan put forward by Putin would give Russia control of Ukraine's entire eastern Donbas region, which Russia currently partially occupies. But the exact contours of the plan remain somewhat unclear, even after several follow-up phone conversations between the Europeans and Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Witkoff.
    


            That includes the fate of the two other regions that have been in Moscow's sights, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. Also unclear is the status of US security guarantees going forward, the officials said.
    


            That has left European leaders urgently working to both ascertain more details, but also to stress the importance of Ukraine having a say in the final plan.
    


            When Russian President Vladimir Putin travels to Alaska next week to meet with President Donald Trump, he will be able do so with confidence that he won't be arrested.
    


            That's because while Putin is subject to an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued in 2023, neither Russia nor the US are signatories to the Rome Statute, which set up the court in 2002.
    


            The ICC charged that the Russian leader was “allegedly responsible for the war crime of unlawful deportation of (children)” from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia. The Kremlin labeled the court's actions as “outrageous and unacceptable.”
    


            Putin has been careful with his travel itineraries since the warrant was issued. In 2023, he declined an invitation to a summit in South Africa. But, a year later, he did make his way to China and North Korea, neither of which is signed up to the court.
    


            The ICC relies on members to arrest and extradite suspects to The Hague, where it is based.
    


            In 2023, Putin did travel to Mongolia, which is a signatory. Mongolia asserted that under Article 98 of the Rome Statute, a state cannot “act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the (…) diplomatic immunity of a person.”
    


            As Russia's head of state, the Mongolians argued Putin enjoys absolute immunity from ICC proceedings unless Russia waives it.
    


            The court rejected that claim, saying that another article removes all immunities. A panel of judges said member states “are duty-bound to arrest and surrender individuals subject to ICC warrants, regardless of official position or nationality.”
    


            Not only has the US never been a signatory to the Rome Statute, but in February Trump ordered sanctions against the court after it issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant.
    


            An executive order accused the ICC of engaging in “illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America and our close ally Israel.”
    


            After a Russian assault left all three of his fellow soldiers dead and himself wounded, Andriy, stationed near Siversk, Ukraine, thought his life was over.
    


            But back at his command bunker, they hatched a plan. Armed with determination, a will to live - and a bike - he was able to escape. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports.
    


            National security advisors, including those from the US, Ukraine and Europe, are gathering in Britain later today for a meeting hosted by US Vice President JD Vance and UK foreign minister David Lammy.
    


            Earlier, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted his country “will not give land to the occupier” after US President Donald Trump – who is due to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday – said there could be some “swapping of territories” to end the war in Ukraine.
    


If you're just joining us, below are the latest developments: 



            We reported earlier on the phone call between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
    


            We know now US Vice President JD Vance and the UK's Foreign Minister David Lammy are hosting a meeting later today in Britain, with Ukrainian and European allies.
    


            According to Downing Street, the meeting is taking place in Kent at the request of the US and comes ahead of an expected meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, as we've also been reporting.
    


            The UK is hosting national security advisers including from the US, Ukraine and European partners, Downing Street said.
    


            The meeting is expected to run for the rest of the day.
    


            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke on the phone with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of the gathering.
    


            Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just said he held a phone call with the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier today.
    


            “I spoke with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. I am grateful for his support,” Zelensky said.
    


            He noted that both leaders see the danger of “Russia's plan to reduce everything to a discussion of the impossible.”
    


            Zelensky added that they agree on the need for “truly lasting peace” for Ukraine.
    


            A UK government spokesperson added they looked ahead to the meeting of National Security Advisers from Europe, Ukraine and the United States taking place today, hosted by the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and US Vice President JD Vance.
    


            “Both leaders welcomed President Trump's desire to bring this barbaric war to an end and agreed that we must keep up the pressure on Putin to end his illegal war,” the spokesperson added.
    


            “The Prime Minister ended the call by reiterating his unwavering support for Ukraine and its people.”
    


            Away from developments on next week's US and Russia summit in Alaska now, and a memo written by the Pentagon's policy chief last month gives the Defense Department the option to divert certain weapons and equipment intended for Ukraine back into US stockpiles, according to four people who have read it.
    


            This is a dramatic shift that could see billions of dollars previously earmarked for the war-torn country go toward replenishing dwindling American supplies.
    


            The memo adds even more uncertainty to an already murky picture of the status of US arms shipments to Ukraine ahead of President Donald Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin next Friday.
    


            Even as Trump has greenlit a plan to sell US weapons to Ukraine through NATO, there remain deep concerns inside the Pentagon over arming Kyiv in its war with Russia at the expense of US stockpiles. That is particularly true of highly sought-after items that remain in short supply, such as interceptor missiles, air defense systems and artillery ammunition.
    


            Read more details, here.



            We can bring you Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's video address following US President Donald Trump's announcement of a summit in Alaska involving the US and Russia.
    


            You can watch it in the report below:
    

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address after President Trump's announcement to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine is "ready to work together with President Trump," but quashed the idea of any territory concessions.


            Former CNN Moscow Bureau chief Jill Dougherty has been reacting to the confirmation of next Friday's summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            She told CNN's Isabel Rosales on CNN This Morning the fact the summit is taking place on US soil makes for an “amazingly complex and fascinating moment,” when it comes to relations between Russia and the US.
    


            “The United States has up to this point, isolated Russia, isolated Putin…I think it is a very big deal to say, welcome to Alaska,” she said.
    


            “There's a lot of history here, Alaska used to be part of Russia until the US bought it and at this moment, there are nationalists in Russia saying we “want it back”. So I think there's a lot going on.
    


            “I would say there's a new wrinkle, though, the Russians now are saying that maybe because all of this is so complicated, we need a second summit…the first one hasn't even taken place.
    


            “Now they're talking about another one in Moscow, and they're also talking about what I would say is kind of luring President Trump with the idea that the Arctic, of course, up near Alaska, is a place that could be developed and there could be all sorts of deals.”
    


            Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said today it had struck a Russian logistical hub storing Iranian-made Shahed drones in Russia's east-central region of Tatarstan.
    


            Long-range drones hit the warehouse located in the village of Kzyl-Yul, a statement from the SBU said.
    


            Video footage released by the SBU appears to show one drone hitting the site directly, before erupting into a huge fireball.
    


            “The warehouses where the enemy stores the Shahed drones it uses to terrorize Ukraine every night are one of the legitimate military targets,” the statement added.
    


            “Each such successful special operation reduces the enemy's ability to wage a war of aggression against Ukraine.”
    


            Russian forces in eastern and northern Ukraine have made further advances, according to analysts – with the towns of Pokrovsk in Donetsk and Kupyansk in Kharkiv at risk of being surrounded.
    


            The incremental Russian gains come as Russian President Vladimir Putin proposes a plan to the US that would require Ukraine to cede the eastern Donbas region — most of which is currently occupied — as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, according to US officials.
    


            The Russians have been trying to take Pokrovsk for more than a year. Ukrainian defenses have held, but Moscow's advances to the north and southwest of the town are threatening to cut off Ukrainian supply routes.
    


            The Ukrainian military said Saturday that there had been 45 Russian attacks in the Pokrovsk area over the past 24 hours.
    


            A Ukrainian officer in the area told CNN today: “I can't say the situation is critical but there are risks (of encirclement).” He added that at present the Russians had not reached a village to the north of Pokrovsk that is a vital resupply route.
    


            The Russians have also made further advances towards the border of the Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to the unofficial DeepState website, which follows battlefield developments.
    


            The Russians have closed in on Kupyansk from the north. The Center for Defense Strategies – a Ukrainian think-tank – said Saturday that Russian forces are trying to reach the main highway supplying Ukrainian troops in the area.
    


For context: According to the Belfer Center at Harvard University, Russian forces gained 226 square miles (585 sq kms) of Ukrainian territory between July 8 and August 5, up from 190 square miles the previous month.
    


            US officials have briefed European leaders and Ukrainian officials on a plan offered by Putin to halt the war in Ukraine in exchange for significant territorial concessions by Kyiv, according to Western officials briefed on the matter.
    


            The plan, which Putin presented to Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff in a meeting in Moscow on Wednesday, would require Ukraine to cede the eastern Donbas region — the majority of which is currently occupied by Russia — as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014.
    


            The plan would freeze current battle lines, but other details of the proposal were still unclear.
    


            It alarmed some European officials, who voiced concern it was Putin's attempt to avoid Trump's threatened sanctions, which were supposed to come due Friday, while offering little in return.
    


            But the plan appeared to be the impetus for which Trump put in motion plans for a summit meeting with Putin as soon as next week.
    


            Additional calls with the Europeans have occurred over the past two days, including with Witkoff and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Witkoff spoke with several European officials on Friday to lay out additional details of the plan.
    


            It wasn't clear what the plan would mean for two other regions in Ukraine — Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — where Russia controls some territory, beyond Russia stopping its offensive there.
    


            Nor was it clear how Putin's proposal would address the Russian leader's other demands for ending the war, including a pledge that Ukraine never join NATO or that it limit the size of its military.
    


            Back now to the summit itself, and Russia has confirmed President Vladimir Putin is to meet US counterpart Donald Trump in Alaska next Friday, August 15.
    


            Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov described the two countries as “close neighbors, so it is quite logical that the leaders' summit will take place in Alaska,” Russian state news agency TASS reported.
    


            He said the summit would focus on the options for a “long-term resolution to the Ukrainian crisis.”
    


            Ushakov also said the two countries had overlapping economic interests in Alaska and the Arctic, and that there were “prospects for the realization of large-scale projects.”
    


            Moscow expects that, after the Alaska summit, the next meeting between Putin and Trump will take place in Russia, Ushakov said, adding that an invitation had already been extended to the US president.
    


            Meanwhile, Russia's investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev also responded to the news of the summit in Alaska, calling on the two countries to partner on the “environment, infrastructure and energy in the Arctic and beyond.”
    


            “Born as Russian America – Orthodox roots, forts, fur trade – Alaska echoes those ties and makes the US an Arctic nation,” Dmitriev said in a post on X.
    


            A Trump-Putin meeting has been floated by both sides for some time.
    


            When the two men do meet on August 15, one apparent American objective is a trilateral summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss an end to the war.
    


            Still, the summit – which has been floated before and delayed before – raises the question of how the war might end.
    


Here are five possible scenarios:



1. Putin agrees to an unconditional ceasefire -  Highly unlikely. It's improbable that Putin would agree to a ceasefire in which the front lines stay as they are – the United States, Europe and Ukraine already demanded such a pause in May, under the threat of sanctions, and Russia rejected it.
    


2. Pragmatism and more talks -  The talks could agree on more talks later, that seal in Russian gains when winter sets in, freezing the front lines militarily and literally around October.
    


3. Ukraine somehow weathers the two years ahead - In this scenario, US and European military aid to Ukraine helps them minimize concessions on the front line in the coming months, and leads Putin to seek to talk, as his military have yet again failed to deliver.
    


4. Catastrophe for Ukraine and NATO - Putin could correctly see the cracks in Western unity after a summit with Trump that improves US-Russian relations but leaves Ukraine to fend for itself.
    


5. Disaster for Putin: a repeat of the Soviets in Afghanistan - Russia could blunder on, expending thousands of soldiers' lives a week, for relatively small gains, and seeing sanctions erode his alliance with China, and revenue from India.
    


            Read more on the five ways the war could end here.
    


            More reaction now from Ukraine to the meeting between Trump and Putin next week in Alaska.
    


            Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has said in a post on X that Ukraine deserves a peace based on “respect for our territorial integrity and borders defined by our Constitution.”
    


            “Russia must not be rewarded for starting this war,” he added.
    


            “Despite tireless efforts by the United States and Ukraine's continued willingness to seek a fair peace, Russia continues its terror against civilians, ignores deadlines, and shows no genuine interest in ending the war.
    


            “Ukraine remains open to meaningful dialogue and real solutions negotiated together with Ukraine, respecting the will of our people.”
    


            Sybiha added that Ukraine stands “ready to work with the United States and all our international partners” to achieve a “just and lasting peace.”
    


            As we've been reporting, President Donald Trump said he'll be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska after previewing terms of a potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine that could include “some swapping of territories.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected any peace deal that would involve Ukraine ceding territory, setting up a major barrier for President Donald Trump's peace summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

Hopes of a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine are high in Washington, D.C., with Trump announcing on Friday that he would be meeting Putin on U.S. soil to discuss a lasting peace to end fighting over Ukraine.

Earlier in the day, Trump said that a peace deal could involve the swapping of territories between Russia and Ukraine, a stipulation that Zelensky said was a non-starter in a Saturday video address. His statement took on a much more stern tone with the United States than in previous weeks.

“Ukraine is ready for real decisions that can bring peace. Any decisions that are against us, any decisions that are without Ukraine, are at the same time decisions against peace. They will not achieve anything. These are stillborn decisions. They are unworkable decisions. And we all need real and genuine peace. Peace that people will respect,” Zelensky said.

He appeared to dismiss the Alaska peace talks, saying it was “Very far away from this war, which is raging on our land, against our people, and which anyway can't be ended without us, without Ukraine.”

The Ukrainian president repeatedly stressed that Ukraine would only accept a “dignified peace,” which he defined as not ceding any territory to Russia.

“The answer to the Ukrainian territorial question already is in the Constitution of Ukraine. No one will deviate from this—and no one will be able to. Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,” Zelensky said.

The Ukrainian president then flexed his diplomatic support from the European Union, delivering statements about his calls with the leaders of Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, and Estonia, thanking them for their support. His readout of the call with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen elaborated on his objections to Russia's peace overtures.

“The Russians still refuse to stop the killings, still invest in the war, and still push the idea of ‘exchanging' Ukrainian territory for Ukrainian territory, with consequences that guarantee nothing except more favorable positions for Russia to resume the war. All our steps must bring us closer to a real end to the war, not its reconfiguration. And our joint decisions with partners must serve our common security,” Zelensky said.

I spoke with the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen @Statsmin. I am grateful for the support. We discussed the diplomatic situation and communication with partners, both ours and Mette's. These days, diplomatic activity is extremely high.However, we see no changes in…

Ukraine has been on the back foot against Russia for over a year and a half, with most hopes of an outright military victory over Moscow largely disappearing following Kyiv's disastrous summer counteroffensive in the Zaporizhzhia oblast in 2023. While Kyiv had ceased outright saying that the only acceptable end to the war would be the restoration of Ukraine's 1991 borders, a position it voiced throughout 2022 and 2023, Zelensky's newest comments appear to show that, despite military defeats, Ukraine hasn't changed its position.

Russia solidified its annexation of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts in September 2022, and has repeatedly stressed that it considers the areas fully Russian territory and would not accept any peace deal that involves ceding its land.

The irreconcilable differences have sunk all previous attempts at peace talks, and could very well sink any breakthroughs made in Alaska on Friday.

A U.S. official briefed on the negotiations around the peace talks in Alaska, speaking with the Washington Post, said that Russia initially proposed meeting in the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia, to which the U.S. countered with Europe instead. After the Kremlin rejected this, the two settled on Alaska.

The exact details of Russia's latest peace proposal are murky. A report from the Wall Street Journal, based on talks with European and Ukrainian officials, said Moscow offered to halt fighting if Ukrainian forces completely withdrew from Donetsk Oblast, which would then be followed by a lasting peace deal. Analysts argued the deal would be a nonstarter even before Zelensky's public denunciation of any territorial concessions. Donetsk is the location of Ukraine's most heavily fortified positions, leaving it more vulnerable if the ceasefire breaks down.

Kyiv's supporters immediately began comparing the suggestion to the infamous 1938 Munich Conference, when France and the British Empire ceded the German-majority Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany in exchange for a commitment that it wouldn't take more territory in the future. The ceding of the country's most defensible positions left it vulnerable when Berlin dismembered the rest of the country months later.

The anonymous U.S. official speaking with the Washington Post said that Putin was acting “like Hitler who received some lands and wanted more.”

Friday's planned meeting in Alaska will be Putin's first visit to the U.S. since 2015. Trump and Putin last met in person in Osaka, Japan, in 2019 on the sidelines of the G20 summit. Putin last met with a U.S. president when he sat down with former President Joe Biden in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2021.

Direct communication between Moscow and Washington was cut off following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which saw Biden rally behind Ukraine. Trump opened up direct dialogue with Putin shortly after beginning his second term in an effort to serve as a neutral mediator, but a face-to-face meeting on U.S. soil is another major step.

TRUMP ANNOUNCES MEETING WITH PUTIN TO TAKE PLACE IN ALASKA

The sudden turnaround came after months of deteriorating relations between Washington and Moscow, with Trump growing frustrated by Russia's continued offensive in Donetsk and constant missile and drone attacks throughout Ukraine. Trump had softened his position on Kyiv over the past few weeks, committing to more military aid for Ukraine.

Despite Ukraine's stalwart defense, Russia has gained the upper hand on nearly every front, slowly grinding away the Ukrainian armed forces while hopes of a Russian economic collapse remain elusive.

WASCO, Ore. (AP) — Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden is in his fifth decade in Congress and showing no inclination to step aside even as pressure builds on aging Democratic officeholders to give way to a new generation.

He says he plans to seek another term in 2028, when he will be 79 years old. He has traveled to all 36 Oregon counties every year he has been in the Senate and intends to keep doing so.

After a recent town hall in Wasco in conservative Sherman County, Wyden said questions about age are “fair game for debate” but that he is still up to the job and the fight against Republican President Donald Trump's policies.

“I believe you ought to be held accountable,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. “But I think that the Founding Fathers wanted a results-oriented, commonsense approach to government, and that's what I'm trying to do. And I've got the energy.”




Many Democrats have lingering anguish about Joe Biden's decision to seek a second White House term despite persistent concerns about whether he was up to the job at age 81. He dropped out in July 2024 and Trump went on to defeat then-Vice President Kamala Harris.

 “I've consistently called for all elected officials over the age of 70 to make this their final term — to step down with dignity and make room for the next generation of leaders,” said Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a group that supports progressive young candidates.

Many Democrats feel Biden withdrew too late and cost the party the presidency. Multiple Democratic senators have announced this year that they won't seek reelection, including 80-year-old Dick Durbin of Illinois. Durbin's career in Congress began in 1983, two years after Wyden joined the House.

Litman said she hopes another Democrat emerges to challenge Wyden.

“I think competitive primaries in particular are how we as a party decide what we believe,” she said.

Wyden continues to travel across his state engaging with voters of all political stripes. The Wasco town hall was the 23rd he has held this year, and the 1,125th town hall of his career. Some 20 people gathered at a former grade school nestled among wheat fields and wind turbines.

“Every Oregonian counts, no matter where they live,” Wyden told them.

As other Democrats grapple over strategy, the senator says the old-school town hall tradition has become a key communication tool in an era of deepening division.

“I believe the town meetings are more important now than ever, because they allow for an opportunity in a community to chip away at some of the polarization and the mistrust,” he told the AP.

That stands in contrast to congressional Republicans, who in recent months have largely avoided town hall meetings, where they often face protesters. The National Republican Campaign Committee recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to promote the new tax breaks and spending cuts law, but in smaller settings they can control.

Some 75% of Sherman County's voters cast ballots for Trump last November, and Wyden hasn't carried the county of about 2,000 people since 2004. Yet the small town hall gathering stood out for its civility, compared with the raucous crowds faced recently by other members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans.

Meeting with a small group of Democrats, Republicans and independents in Wasco, Wyden talked at length about health care, trade and democracy. While some pressed Wyden, they waited to be called on and thanked him for coming.

Charlie Hogue, 71, asked a question that went to the heart of Democratic concerns that leaders aren't pushing back hard enough against Trump.

“I thought we had checks and balances in this country, and I'm beginning to lose hope because the current administration ignores court orders,” he said. “So are the Democrats planning to just message for the next elections … or do you have a plan?”

Wyden cited examples of how he had challenged Trump: a recent trip to Canada, where the senator spoke with the prime minister about trade, and discussions with Oregon wheat farmers about tariffs.

T.L. Fassbender, 76, wondered why it seems that Democrats support immigrants who entered the country illegally.

Wyden responded that he believed the immigration system was “broken” and noted that a bipartisan border bill collapsed in the Senate last year after then-candidate Trump came out against it. 

In the ensuing exchange, Fassbender said he didn't think Wyden had answered his question, so the senator tried again.

“If somebody has committed a crime, for example, I don't think that should be something that is protected as part of legislation,” Wyden said. “What's been going on, unfortunately, is we have some government agencies coming and swooping up people who've done nothing wrong.”

When immigration came up again later, Wyden noted that his parents were fleeing Nazi Germany when they came to the United States.

“I believe that legal immigration makes our country better and stronger,” he said.

Recently, Wyden has emerged as a leading Democratic voice in pressing for more information on the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case. He isn't new to the effort, which has become a political crisis for Trump. 

The president's supporters are angry that his administration didn't keep promises to release records from the investigation into the wealthy financier's exploitation of underage girls for sex. The Justice Department and FBI recently said there was no Epstein “client list,” walking back a notion that the administration had previously promoted.

As the top Democrat on the powerful Senate Finance Committee, Wyden had been pressing for Epstein's financial records long before the scandal resurfaced.

“We spent three years following the money,” he told the AP after the Wasco town hall. “And we're going to stay at it until the facts come out.”

Wyden said Democrats agonizing over low voter morale and party strategy should hold more meetings in conservative areas, where they might learn something from the people they represent.

“The old saying is, ‘most of life is just showing up,'” he said. “But it's especially important in government because there is a sense that this is rigged.”

Fox News Digital spoke to Cincinnati entrepreneur Adam Koehler about the downtown street brawl that has captured nationwide media coverage.

CINCINNATI, OHIO - Southwest Ohio residents are expressing outrage at local leadership after a viral street fight in their backyard that captured the nation's attention. One resident, a local political activist, told Fox News Digital a "Democrat monopoly" is partially to blame.

The Saturday night violence in downtown Cincinnati on July 26, which left a woman knocked unconscious on the street at the hands of a male assailant, was the result of a city that wasn't "prepared" due to political ideology, Price Hill native Adam Koehler told Fox News Digital. He added that the response to the fight was "not leadership."

"Leadership comes out and says, 'Hey, we've got a problem. Here's my solution to fix it,'" Koehler said. "But instead, they want to be cowardly and hide the fact that crime is actually happening."

Cincinnati's mayor and other local officials have faced heated criticism in recent days over the perception they are not taking crime seriously. One elected Democrat, Councilwoman Victoria Parks, posted on social media saying that the victims of the fight "begged for that beatdown."

"This is a Democrat monopoly they've got here," Koehler, an entrepreneur and former candidate for Hamilton County commissioner, told Fox News Digital. "So, I mean they can just pretty much do whatever they want. And a lot of that kind of rhetoric is excused, right? It's, you know, past injustices and you know now I feel like I can say whatever I want and it's excused. And luckily there are some city council members that denounced the words that Victoria Parks said, which is great, but you've got other people that just want to stoke the flames."

Holly, the woman brutally knocked out and bruised in the attack, told Fox News this week she is yet to receive a phone call from the mayor or top officials "just apologizing for what happened and for letting these thugs and criminals run the streets when they should have been in jail to begin with."

Koehler told Fox News Digital that Democrats running the city "have an agenda" and "want to look a certain way" and "ignore the problem."

"It's a lot of these ideologies that come out of the universities, right?" Koehler said. "Every generation thinks they figured something out about crime and they're soft-hearted people, they wanted to do things, but, you know, policies like what Giuliani did in New York, those kind of things work."

Koehler, who was speaking to Fox News Digital outside a GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy town hall event on Cincinnati's west side, said figures like Ramaswamy, Sen. Bernie Moreno, and Ohio native VP JD Vance are reasons to be optimistic about addressing the crime spike downtown. 

"Those guys got power," Koehler said. "I mean you start throwing the DOJ down here and start investigating some of the things that are happening, why wasn't there more police there?"

Koehler added, "I mean there's a lot of grifting that goes on whenever you have a one-party monopoly in any city. Obviously, you're gonna have corruption. And it's just, it's festered here, and it's culminated in what you see."

Moreno said this week he is introducing "Holly's Act," a move aimed at ending what he calls the justice system's revolving door for repeat offenders.

"Let's be honest, because a lot of times you guys are qualifying this as a brawl," Moreno told reporters. "This was attempted murder of an innocent woman. And that person had a rap sheet a mile long. Nobody who has that rap sheet should be walking the streets of any Ohio city free."

            Shortly after former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced his plans to run for Senate, a group backing Republicans released an ad with an echo of last year's presidential campaign.
    


            “Roy Cooper sides with they/them,” read the language on screen in the ad, produced by the Senate Leadership Fund.
    


            Republicans are reprising a key attack line from last year's presidential race for elections this year and next, betting that anti-trans messaging will help them counter Democrats running on GOP-led cuts to Medicaid and other parts of Trump's policy megabill.
    


            Trump allies spent tens of millions of dollars airing an ad highlighting 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' one-time commitment that detained immigrants would have access to treatment associated with gender transition as was required by federal law, including surgical care. The ad's tagline mocked the pronouns used by non-binary individuals, saying “Kamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you.”
    


            Widely cited by strategists in both parties as having shaped the campaign, that ad is now being mimicked in North Carolina and another competitive Senate contest in Georgia. Trans and gender identity issues have also come up in this year's race for Virginia governor.
    


            One ad attacking Sen. Jon Ossoff aired during a basketball game and referenced the broadcast.
    


            “Man-to-man defense isn't woke enough for Ossoff – he's playing for they/them. Call and tell Sen. Ossoff, stop dunking on defenseless girls,” said the ad, from an affiliate of SLF and backed by more than $350,000.
    


            Chris LaCivita, Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager and an architect of the “Kamala is for they/them” ads, said it made sense for Republicans to bring back messaging they see as driving a wedge between Democrats and key voting blocs.
    


            “The purpose of the ads in the 2024 campaign was built around the need to increase our vote share with men, Hispanics, and moms. The ads in question -  there were three - achieved the results that we were looking for,” said LaCivita in an email. “That's what is playing out right now across the country, in Senate, House and gubernatorial races.”
    


            Democrats argue that Republicans are using the issue as a distraction.
    


            “Republicans have given in to the most extreme fringes of their party by abandoning pocketbook issues in favor of an anti-freedom agenda that is obsessed with letting politicians make decisions that should be left to parents and doctors,” said Viet Shelton, a spokesperson for the Democrats' House campaign arm, in a statement. “Rather than getting involved in personal matters, House Republicans should perhaps spend their time expanding the middle class, lowering costs, and protecting freedoms.”
    


Trump administration takes all-of-government approach to target transgender community



            The Trump administration has moved across government to target trans rights in particular, from removing trans people from the military to ordering investigations of hospitals that provide particular medical services for trans children. The White House often promotes its actions against trans-friendly policies, posting Wednesday about a move to restrict visas for trans female athletes competing in women's sports.
    


            Trans people make up less than 0.6% of the United States population ages 13 and older, according to the Williams Institute, a public policy research center focused on sexual orientation and gender identity at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
    


            North Carolina and Georgia host US Senate elections that are expected to rank among the most competitive contests of next year's midterms. In both races, Republicans are launching transgender-focused attacks against Democrats, centered on policies governing youth sports participation and bathroom access.
    


            The North Carolina GOP issued a statement slamming Cooper, saying that he “championed radical transgender ideology” and “vetoed bills to keep men out of women's sports.” In another statement, the Senate Leadership Fund criticized Cooper's “vetoes that allowed boys in girls' sports.”
    


            Meanwhile, one of Ossoff's challengers, Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, is running  an ad featuring a person wearing a dress and a wig complaining that Carter “helped Trump” in “banning people like me from competing in women's sports.”
    


            Ossoff campaign spokesperson Ellie Dougherty said that “National Republicans are scrambling to hide from Trump's budget law after facing intense backlash in Georgia for gutting Medicaid and defunding hospitals.”
    


            Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor in Virginia, has also been regularly targeting Democratic opponent Abigail Spanberger with attacks focused on transgender policies, as Republicans look for an opening in the challenging off-year race.
    


            Earle-Sears wrote on social media last week that Spanberger and Ghazala Hashmi, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, “think your daughter should compete and share a locker room with biological men.”

            Sam Newton, communications director for the Democratic Governors Association, argued that party leaders at the state level had successfully navigated similar attacks from Republicans in recent elections.
    


            “In battleground and red-state races for governor in 2022, 2023 and 2024, voters consistently rejected Republicans who made clear they only cared about stoking division with culture wars in favor of Democratic candidates who won by staying laser-focused on addressing the biggest issues impacting working families every single day. This cycle will be no different,” Newton said.
    


            The “they/them” ads come as some Democrats who could run for president in 2028 have debated in public where they should stand on the participation of trans female athletes in girls' sports.
    


            California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2028, told conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on his podcast in March that transgender athletes competing in women's sports was “deeply unfair.” And Pete Buttigieg, another potential 2028 contender, also voiced sympathy for conservative complaints about transgender sports policies in an interview on NPR this week.
    


            “I think most reasonable people would recognize that there are serious fairness issues if you just treat this as not mattering when a trans athlete wants to compete in women's sports,” Buttigieg said.
    


            Others have argued for resolve and attempted to build up infrastructure to support pro-transgender policies. The Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBTQ rights organization, is planning a series of town halls in red-state cities over the summer aimed at supporting LGBTQ individuals and policies.
    


            “Stories move people. Shared humanity is powerful. When the American people get to know who we are, and not who Donald Trump says we are, everything changes: hearts and minds first, policy and politics next,” HRC spokesperson Brandon Wolf said about the tour.
    


            Wolf urged Democrats to “be bold, stand up to the bullies, and to say unequivocally: we refuse to compromise on freedom.”
    


            Another effort is underway in the Christopher Street Project, a PAC formed earlier this month to endorse and raise funds for candidates that advocate for pro-transgender policies. The group released a list of 16 initial endorsees including Rep. Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress, and prominent Democrats such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Pramila Jayapal, Katherine Clark, and Jamie Raskin.
    


            During an interview last month at the Center for American Progress, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, also advised his party to avoid looking “weak” and backing down to Republicans.
    


            “I think it's a mistake to focus just on economics and allow trans children to get bullied or something. I think they have to go – or we look weak, if we don't do it,” Walz said.
    


            One minor Democratic candidate for California governor, meanwhile, tried to turn the tables on Trump and Republicans with their own line. The ad from Stephen Cloobeck's campaign shows Trump's photo next to disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
    


            “Trump is for they/them,” the narrator says, with the names of Epstein and Maxwell highlighted. “Stephen Cloobeck is for you.”

Attorney Mehek Cooke joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss her take on judges stifling President Donald Trump's immigration agenda and what to expect with the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial as jury selection is expected to kick off.

On July 15, President Trump nominated my friend and former Gorsuch clerk colleague Eric Tung to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. If confirmed, Tung will succeed Judge Sandra Ikuta, who recently assumed senior status after a distinguished tenure. Judge Ikuta leaves behind a strong legacy, one Tung is more than equipped to uphold and extend.

MIKE DAVIS: CONFIRMATION OF EMIL BOVE A TRIUMPH OF NEW OVER OLD

Tung's credentials are exceptional. He earned a philosophy degree from Yale in 2006 and graduated with high honors from the University of Chicago Law School in 2010. While there, he served as managing editor of the University of Chicago Law Review, one of the most rigorous legal journals in the country.

Following law school, Tung clerked for two of the most respected jurists in America: then-Judge Neil Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. These clerkships are offered only to the legal elite. Even among that group, Tung stood out.

Tung's brilliance, ethics, and temperament have earned him bipartisan respect. A letter supporting his nomination was signed by fellow Supreme Court clerks from across the ideological spectrum, from Justice Ginsburg's to Justice Thomas'. That level of cross-aisle support is rare and speaks volumes.

One signer, Danielle Sassoon, a former federal prosecutor who has publicly disagreed with the Trump administration, went out of her way to endorse Tung. Her support underscores how widely admired he is for his intellect and integrity, regardless of politics.

Ultimately, what really matters is Tung's record, and it's unimpeachable. He is a brilliant legal mind, a fair-minded jurist, and a committed constitutionalist.

Tung's experience goes far beyond the top of the legal profession. He served in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Policy, where he helped vet judicial nominees, giving him a firsthand look at what makes a good judge. As an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, he prosecuted serious criminal cases, gaining invaluable courtroom experience. Now a partner at Jones Day, Tung handles complex appellate and trial work at a national level.

Although President Trump made inroads during his first term in balancing out the nation's most liberal federal appeals court outside of Washington, D.C., of the 29 active judges, 16 were Democratic nominees. Tung replacing Ikuta won't change that balance, but it will ensure the vacated seat remains in the hands of a strong constitutionalist.

Despite this impeccable record, Tung's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was marred by partisan theatrics. Several Democrat senators ignored his qualifications and fixated instead on social media posts I had written. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., quoted part of an old post of mine and demanded Tung "condemn" it. Tung, noting the canons of judicial ethics, rightly declined to weigh in, clarifying that my opinions are not necessarily his.

Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., followed suit, hitting Tung over a post where I had labeled certain Democrats "evil Marxists." Booker then attempted to cast himself as a model of bipartisan civility, citing his friendship with Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., conveniently omitting that he once claimed supporters of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court were "complicit in evil." Again, Tung refused to be drawn into political grandstanding, displaying the restraint and poise we should expect from a federal judge.

This guilt-by-association line of attack is dishonest and irrelevant. Tung's record speaks for itself. Rather than engage with his legal merits, some senators tried to hijack yet another Judiciary Committee  hearing to score cheap political points. Tung never took the bait.

His nomination also highlights the double standard in how judicial diversity is treated. As the son of Chinese immigrants and a fluent Mandarin speaker, one would think Democrats would celebrate Tung at least for their sacred metrics of representation and diversity on the federal bench. But because he's a conservative, his background is downplayed, or even used against him. The selective celebration of diversity and identity politics in judicial nominations is glaring.

Ultimately, what really matters is Tung's record, and it's unimpeachable. He is a brilliant legal mind, a fair-minded jurist, and a committed constitutionalist. His combination of courtroom experience, academic rigor, and ethical clarity makes him an ideal appellate judge.

The Senate should rise above political posturing and confirm Eric Tung without delay. His confirmation will not only fortify the Ninth Circuit, but strengthen the rule of law nationwide. President Trump's reshaping of the federal judiciary with principled, constitutionalist judges will take a significant step forward with Tung's appointment.

Eric Tung is exactly the kind of judge Americans want: sharp, steady, and scrupulously fair. The Senate must act upon its return and confirm him in September.

            President Donald Trump recently nominated one of his economic advisers to the Federal Reserve's top ranks, but his next choice will be far more consequential. Plans for picking the next Fed chair are already taking shape.
    


            Trump on Thursday nominated White House economist Stephen Miran to temporarily fill a vacant seat on the Fed's Board of Governors, though he still needs to be confirmed by the Senate.
    


            Meanwhile, the Trump administration has also been interviewing candidates for an even more powerful role: Fed chair. The current chair, Jerome Powell, has long drawn Trump's ire for his refusal to acquiesce to the president's demands to lower interest rates — and his term expires in May.
    


            Just this past week, Trump's search for who will steer the world's most powerful central bank next year took various twists and turns. It shows Trump is leaving no stone unturned, especially considering he has repeatedly said he's regretful of his nomination of Powell.
    


            Trump said he is no longer considering Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for the job. Meanwhile, Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, unexpectedly gained ground with the president's inner circle, according to people familiar with the matter. And two Republicans named Kevin — former Fed governor Kevin Warsh and White House economist Kevin Hassett — remain on Trump's shortlist. It's also possible that Miran, if he's confirmed, ends up impressing the president so much that he is elevated to lead the Fed.
    


            The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that Trump expanded his list of potential picks for Fed chair, now including former St. Louis Fed president James Bullard.
    


            “It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out because the two Kevins are certainly quite viable, but Waller might be the one that the market forces as a choice,” said Derek Tang, an economist at research and consulting firm LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics.
    


            Waller was appointed to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020, and until recently, he had built a reputation for being a key messenger on the Fed's policy moves.
    


            After the Fed hiked interest rates aggressively to tame inflation in 2022 and 2023, investors listened closely to Waller's speeches for clues on when central bankers might finally begin lowering rates instead. Fed officials have a tradition of giving Wall Street a heads-up on what they plan to do with rates through their public engagements, known as “forward guidance.”
    


            In recent months, Waller has chosen to set himself apart from the rest of the Fed's rate-setting committee of 12 voting members.
    


            Last month, Waller was one of two Fed governors who dissented on the Fed's latest decision to hold borrowing costs steady for the fifth consecutive time, instead backing a rate cut. That was the first time since 1993 that more than one Fed governor dissented on a policy move.
    


            In a statement explaining his dissent, Waller said that “tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary increase” and that the Fed should step in with a rate cut to prevent the labor market from falling off a cliff.
    


            When pitching Waller to the president, Trump's advisers repeatedly referenced Waller's dissent, according to people familiar with the matter. The dissent undoubtedly boosted Waller's chances for Fed chair, the sources said.
    


            When Trump was threatening to sack Powell in the spring, Kevin Warsh quickly emerged as a potential replacement. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett eventually joined him on the list of potential Fed chairs.
    


            Warsh, a longtime Trump ally, has said the president's expansive tariffs won't stoke inflation — a stance that's at odds with the general consensus among economists. During a speech in Stanford, California, in May, Warsh said the Fed would be to blame if it can't combat the persistent impacts of tariff-induced inflation.
    


            “The president clearly trusts Kevin Warsh and thinks highly of him, and as I understand it, his in-laws are close with the Trump family, so there's a personal connection there,” said Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at investment firm Stifel. (Warsh is married to billionaire Jane Lauder, granddaughter of Estée Lauder, the late cosmetics industry mogul.)
    


            Warsh was previously under consideration for Fed chair during Trump's first term, but Powell was ultimately chosen on advice from then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
    


            But before Waller's dissent drove up his stock with Trump, Hassett was seen as a front-runner for Fed chair.
    


            Hassett, a PhD economist with a long track record of supporting Republican politicians, has been a key supporter of Trump's sweeping economic agenda.
    


            For example, Hassett — like Warsh — has vehemently defended Trump's tariffs. In early April, when Trump unveiled massive tariffs hikes, Hassett told ABC News: “I don't think that you're going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US,” because countries will be negotiating trade deals with the administration.
    


            “People assume Hassett is eventually going to be nominated because he's at the White House and he definitely scores very highly on loyalty, having been with Trump since his first administration,” Tang said. “Trump probably feels like he can trust him.”
    


            Both Warsh and Hassett have said the Fed should remain independent.

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) — Tom Brady's statue weighs six tons and rises 17 feet off the ground, from the bottom of the six-sided base — one for each of the New England Patriots' Super Bowl victories — to the tip of the bronze fist raised in celebration.

For a player who was too slow and immobile coming out of college to merit more than a No. 199 draft pick, that seems just about right.

“When I was drafted, I just hoped to make the team. I never dreamed I'll be standing here two and a half decades later, made of bronze and frozen in time,” Brady said Friday night at a ceremony to unveil the statue before the Patriots' exhibition opener against the Washington Commanders. “But actually, it actually feels pretty appropriate given my 40-yard dash time.” 

A three-time NFL Most Valuable Player, five-time Super Bowl MVP and seven-time NFL champion — he won one after defecting to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Brady retired in 2023 as the league's most-decorated player ever, holding records in dozens of categories that include most wins, yards passing, and passing touchdowns — for both the regular season and playoffs.

The Patriots inducted him into their Hall of Fame last year, waiving the usual four-year waiting period, and retired his No. 12. At the ceremony, owner Robert Kraft said Brady would be the first player in franchise history to have a bronze statue outside the stadium.

The work by sculptor lifelong Patriots fan Jeff Buccacio unveiled Friday on the plaza outside the team's Pro Shop and Hall of Fame features a hexagonal granite base and a 12-foot Brady, honoring Brady's uniform number and making good on Kraft's wish for it to be larger than life. It is 17 feet in all, representing the 17 AFC East titles the Patriots won in Brady's 19 seasons.




In his remarks, Brady pretended to be interrupted by a call from former coach Bill Belichick giving his opinion of the statue.

“He said there's still room for improvement,” Brady said. “I know that feeling.”

Fans crowded the plaza, lined a nearby stairway and leaned over railings inside the stadium to watch the ceremony, interrupting Brady by chanting his name. 

Among those at the ceremony were Brady's parents and children, current coach Mike Vrabel and former teammates Devin and Jason McCourty, David Andrews, Wes Welker and Brian Hoyer. Several members of the Commanders entourage also came by, including general manager Adam Peters and ex-Patriot and current Washington defensive end Deatrich Wise.

“It was always important for me to be out there,” Vrabel said after the 48-18 victory over the Commanders. “Having somebody like that be part of this organization is pretty unique and pretty special. Glad I could be part of it a little bit.”

In addition to the self-deprecating comments and the shot at Belichick, Brady said he didn't think a statue was appropriate until he was “really old,” like Vrabel. 

But he saved his best for the rival New York Jets. 

“This statue isn't just for Pats fans. It'll also give all the Jets fans something to throw their beers at as they leave the stadium every year,” Brady said. “Probably in the second quarter.”

California Democrats are moving full steam ahead on their efforts to counter Texas's mid-decade redistricting plan despite Lone Star State Republicans escalating their crackdown on absent state Democrats who fled the state.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), along with congressional and state leaders from California, held a press conference on Friday to provide further details on California's redistricting plan and offer support to the Texas Democrats who left the state last weekend. Over a dozen Texas state leaders were in attendance.

It came just hours after the Texas state Legislature once again did not have a quorum or the attendance needed to conduct business for its scheduled session on Friday. State Speaker Dustin Burrows gave absent Democrats a deadline to return by Friday, but none came.

In response, Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit to vacate the seats of 13 Texas House seats held by Democrats on the grounds of “continued unlawful absences.” Burrows said he is also ending direct deposits of the checks for lawmakers, noting he doesn't have the power to withhold Democrats' money, but he can require in-person paycheck pickup.

“The rogue Democrat legislators who fled the state have abandoned their duties, leaving their seats vacant,” Paxton said in a statement. “These cowards deliberately sabotaged the constitutional process and violated the oath they swore to uphold. Their out-of-state rebellion cannot go unchecked, and the business of Texas must go on.”

During the press conference in California, Texas state Democrats insisted they are “running from nothing.”

“We see the danger that is coming, and we are running straight for it,” state Rep. Ann Johnson said. 

Texas Democrats who fled the state are facing threats to return from GOP Gov. Greg Abbott, who has engaged the FBI, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and Texas Rangers to locate and, if needed, arrest the absent lawmakers and return them to the legislature for a special session on redistricting and   Texas flood aid.

But the Democrats insist that the FBI has “no authority” over them, and threats of arrest are not deterring them from their mission of stopping the redistricting vote that could add more GOP seats in the U.S. House and help save President Donald Trump's majority after the 2026 midterm elections.

“We had 700 calls on this bill proposing a new map that hasn't even been out a week for the public to see. Four were opposed. The rest were all in support of my breaking quorum,” state Rep. Gina Hinojosa said. “I'm doing exactly what my constituents want, and it is shameful for our governor or for our attorney general to try to remove a duly elected representative of the people from office.”

As Republicans seek to add five GOP congressional seats to their Texas delegation, Democrats in California are looking to slash five Republican districts from the state's congressional map to offset losses in the Lone Star State.

Newsom made it clear on Friday that the goal is not to eliminate the state's independent redistricting commission. Instead, it would seek “emergency measures” to create new maps for a special election intended for November. State leaders from the California legislature echoed this plan, noting they predict the new maps will be released for public viewing as early as next week.

California's countermove has spurred legislation from Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA), one of the five GOP incumbents whose districts would suffer from the new maps. His bill seeks to ban mid-decade redistricting and “stop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.”

But California leaders are brushing off the argument that “two wrongs don't make a right.” 

“We don't move unless they move,” Newsom said of Texas. “This is triggered. They drew first blood. We're responding to this action, and this is how we choose to respond.”

Pelosi echoed Newsom, arguing California's redistricting decision is “self-defense for our democracy.”

Abbott has said he will call “special session after special session” until the congressional maps are passed, “regardless of how long the Democrats hold out in these leftist states.”

Like many Democrats this week, Johnson said she wouldn't be deterred by threats of prosecution, job loss, and daily $500 fines.

“We are now facing threats, the threat that we're going to lose our jobs, the threat of financial ruin, the threat that we will be hunted down as our colleagues sit on their hands and remain silent,” Johnson said, adding that those most concerned about keeping their jobs “are not worthy of public service.”

The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations. 

UCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.

President Donald Trump's administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as in its ongoing battle with Harvard University.

The White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.

The Trump administration had suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA, the university said this week. On July 29, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.”

The university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. One night, counterprotesters attacked the encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested. Later, Jewish students said demonstrators in encampments blocked them from getting to class.




The University of California's president, James B. Milliken, said Friday the university had “just received” a document from the Department of Justice and would review it. He said the size of the proposed settlement would “devastate” the University of California, whose campuses are viewed as some of the top public colleges in the nation.

“Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,” said Milliken, who started as president last week. “As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country's greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday accused Trump of trying to silence academic freedom in his attack on such a prestigious public university system. 

“He has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine unless we do his bidding,” Newsom told reporters. Apparently referencing the settlements with Columbia and Brown, he added: “We will not be like some of those other institutions that have followed a different path.”

The $1 billion demand in the UCLA settlement is linked to Newsom's status as one of Trump's most outspoken foes, said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents.

“Anyone who thinks this appalling demand is not blatantly political and ideological has their head in the sand,“ McDonough said. “Of course it's influenced by the fact that UCLA sits within the California system and the California system sits within the state of California.”

The Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.

Last month, Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government's allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restored more than $400 million in research grants. 

The Trump administration is using its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation. For instance, the administration is pressing for a deal that would require Harvard to pay far more than Columbia's $200 million. Harvard leaders have been negotiating with the White House even as they battle in court to regain access to billions in federal research funding terminated by the Trump administration.

UCLA has already reached one settlement about the 2024 protests. The university agreed last week to pay $6 million to settle a lawsuit from three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who argued the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.

UCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students' access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.

But in a preliminary injunction a year earlier, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests, with an Office of Campus and Community Safety at UCLA.

As part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university's Jewish community. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, also launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.

President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will hold a press availability at the White House next week to address violent crime in Washington, D.C., days after the White House announced it was increasing federal law enforcement across the city.

"On Monday a Press Conference will be held at the White House which will, essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C," he wrote on social media.

Trump, who has frequently criticized the Democratic-led city, claimed that D.C. will "soon be one of the safest cities," even as data shows that violent crime in the nation's capital has been decreasing.

Trump this week ramped up his rhetoric about crime in the district, after a former member of the Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted in an attempted carjacking.

"He went through a bad situation, to put it mildly, and there's too much of it. We're going to do something about it," Trump said Wednesday.

Trump also threatened to federalize Washington, D.C., if local officials don't "get [their] act together, and quickly."

On Thursday, the White House said it was launching a seven-day effort to crack down on crime in the city.

"Washington, D.C. is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, according to NBC Washington.

"President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C."

Local officials condemned Trump's order and warned that he is encroaching on "home rule," the decades-old act that allows D.C. residents to elect their own mayor and council members.

"Even if crime in D.C. weren't at a historic low point, President Trump's comments would be misguided and offensive to the more than 700,000 people who live permanently in the nation's capital," Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s nonvoting delegate, said in a statement.

"Although I won't allow them to succeed, the Republicans pushing to repeal the Home Rule Act have no plan to run the District should they abolish the mayor's office and D.C. Council," she said.

Pooja Tripathi might not have become a successful comedian if she hadn't quit her corporate marketing job in the middle of a meeting in 2018.

By then, Tripathi had spent five years working in the fashion industry, but felt defeated after dealing with a toxic boss, she says. One morning, in a last-minute meeting, her boss started personally insulting Tripathi in front of her manager. She'd watched her coworkers experience similar bullying in the past — and decided to quit the job, where she earned a mid-five figure salary, on the spot, she says.

"Having a job everyone thinks sounds cool … [then] feeling like you can't reach any goals day-to-day is not easy," Tripathi, 32, says. "You feel like a lie."

The second act of Tripathi's career is more authentic, fulfilling and twice as lucrative, she says. With a friend, she started writing and acting for a YouTube series, and over time, became a successful content creator, she says.

Tripathi started her most popular project, Brooklyn Coffee Shop, in June 2023. In the short videos posted to TikTok and Instagram, she plays a dry, uninterested barista who interacts with and often rejects a cast of stereotypical Brooklyn customers — a Pilates instructor, a guy who loves crypto — who try to order drinks like an unsweetened collagen lattes with unpasteurized goat's milk.

Some episodes of the series are viewed over 3 million times.

The success of the series has helped land Tripathi personal social media brand deals, she says. She now earns more than twice what she used to earn as a fashion marketer, enough to quit her part-time jobs and focus on social media full-time in December 2024, she says.

The series is also starting to take on its own brand deals, she adds.

Tripathi had to take risks to get this far, she says. She had no experience writing comedies or acting before she left her fashion marketing job. She took on a roommate in her one-bedroom New York apartment to save money and worked part-time marketing jobs to cover the bills while she built a social media following in her spare time, she says.

"I had a very strong North Star, which was I needed another paycheck," she says. "My mom would call me and remind me I wouldn't have health-insurance [once I turned 26] … I think there's a fear in the core of all Americans that if we don't perform, if we don't make money, we can't go to the doctor."

Juggling multiple jobs while trying to succeed in an uncertain career path was mentally exhausting — but coming up with Brooklyn Coffee Shop felt natural, Tripathi says. In 2023, she spent 30 minutes discussing alternative dairy products, like water buffalo milk, with a friend and barista in a café.

She went home, set up her iPhone on a tripod and filmed herself acting out the conversation — playing both the barista and customer — in front of a makeshift greenscreen in her apartment, she says. That first installment of the series got over 1 million views, she says.

The production of the series looks much different now. Tripathi splits the production workload with her boyfriend, Sagi Shahar, who helps with sound design, and her friends like Nitay Dagan and Eyal Cohen, the series' director and cinematographer, respectively. Another friend adds in special effects, like kiosk screens that prompt fictional customers to tip over 200%.

Comedians like Kyle Gordon, Grace Reiter and Gianmarco Soresi now guest star as customers, too.

"We can only do [what we do] because everybody is so technically savvy," Tripathi says. "Working with the guests [and crew] has been probably the single most rewarding thing about my entire career so far."

Plenty of kids would rather sit in front of their phone screen than play a sport, pick up an instrument or read a book.

They might be modeling that behavior from their parents, bestselling author and podcast host Mel Robbins said during a panel discussion hosted by Verizon on Wednesday. She spoke from personal experience, she added: Robbins would lose herself in her iPhone for extended periods of time, and then look up to see her kids buried in their own devices.

"I used to be the kind of person who always had [my phone] in my hand," said Robbins, 58. "I felt like I just completely lost control of the situation."

Kids typically have a different relationship with phones than adults do: They have a higher tendency to overuse social media and watch videos for hours on end, according to Michael Robb, head of research at Common Sense Media. This can cause problems with their sleep, physical and mental health, and shorten their attention spans — all making them less likely to develop into happy, successful adults, Yale University psychologist Laurie Santos told CNBC Make It in October 2023.

At first, Robbins would demand that her kids to put their phones away or scold them for being plugged in all the time, she said. Then, she realized her kids were mirroring her behavior, she said — seeking connection through social media, and texting friends to make up for the lack of in-person interaction.

"Where you put your attention determines the quality of your life, and when you give your attention away to everything, it often feels like nothing is getting your attention," said Robbins. "So phone-life balance is a very important thing."

DON'T MISS: How to build a standout personal brand—online, in person and at work

Thirty-one percent of U.S. adults struggle with mindlessly reaching for their phones throughout the day, according to a 2024 Morning Consult survey. Changing your habit means making a conscious effort — first to put your phone down when you've just picked it up, and then to avoid picking it up at all, Robbins said.

You can start trying to catch yourself "immediately," she noted.

"I want you to look in the mirror. Do you sleep with your phone? Do you constantly have it? Are you the kind of person that goes out to dinner with friends or work colleagues and you've got the phone out or on the table?" said Robbins. "You cannot yell at your kids or expect your kids to police themselves [and] have balance if you're not modeling it."

Specifically, Robbins stopped keeping her phone on her person after work, while walking around the house and while sleeping, she said. The physical distance helped her curb the urge to check one last email or send a text that could probably wait until later. When she saw her kids on their phones, she asked about what they were doing instead of being "controlling" or "judging," she said.

Maybe they were texting their friends, for example — theoretically a better use of technology than mindlessly scrolling through social media, which can damage your brain's "executive function," psychologist Gloria Mark said in April.

"When we're overwhelmed with processing so much information, our cognitive resources drain. When they drain, our mind gets fatigued," said Mark. "There's a part of the mind that's called executive function, and that has the job of keeping us on track. It helps us with decision making, filtering out distractions and sticking to goals. When the mind gets fatigued, executive function just can't do its job."

Understanding why your kids use their phones the way they do can help you build stronger connections with them, noted Robbins.

"We get judgy because we miss that connection of being present with each other, and then we blame it on the phone instead," she said. "But when I started to ... get curious about it, it [shifted] the dynamic."

To be considered wealthy in the U.S., Americans say you need a net worth of $2.3 million in 2025 — but that number can be even higher depending on where you live.

It's down from $2.5 million last year, according to Charles Schwab's latest Modern Wealth Survey, which polled 2,000 adults nationwide between April 24 and May 23.

While the wealth benchmark has decreased, nearly two-thirds of respondents say it feels harder to reach. Inflation, high interest rates and broader economic uncertainty were the most commonly cited reasons.

Here's how much Americans say you need to be considered wealthy, by region:

You need the highest net worth to be considered rich in Western states, including California, Washington and Colorado.

That may be unsurprising given the region's high cost of living — especially in California, where major cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles are among the most expensive places in the country, especially for housing costs.

Schwab's survey defines wealth in terms of net worth, which is a measure of your total assets minus your debts and liabilities. However, many Americans have a broader view of what it takes to be rich.

When asked what being wealthy means to them, 45% said happiness, nearly equal to the 44% who cited the amount of money they have. Others cite physical and mental health, strong relationships and free time.

That helps explain why many Americans say they already feel wealthy in non-financial ways. About 4 in 5 say they feel rich when it comes to their relationships, happiness and free time, according to Schwab.

The threshold for feeling financially comfortable is lower — $839,000 on average in the U.S., up from $778,000 last year, according to the survey. As with wealth, a comfortable net worth varies by region:

Schwab's data suggests that financial comfort feels more within reach than wealth. Nearly half of respondents say they're already financially comfortable or on the path to get there.

Another 25% say it's possible, but only with lifestyle changes, which could include reducing spending or increasing income.

The Dayton Mall has been a shopping staple for residents of Dayton, Ohio, since it opened in 1970.  The once-prospering mall, like many, has faced hard times with increased vacancies, exacerbated by the closing of two anchors, Sears and Bon Ton, in 2018.

As a result, the mall was put into receivership, where it remains. But the 162,000-square-foot former Sears space was sold to a local church, Crossroads, which has transformed 90,000 square feet of the former store into a house of worship and community hub with a traditional indoor entrance to the rest of the mall.

"Nothing says dying mall like having a church move in," said Rebecca Maguire, marketing manager of the Dayton Mall. "But Crossroads has a huge following, and they are so community driven that I think any mall in the world would be lucky to have a partner like that."

It's fair to ask if a struggling mall is the right place for a church, and Matt Castleman, the pastor of Crossroads Church in Dayton, said the religious organization had its own reservations.

"People were asking, is chaining yourself to a mall wise?" said Castleman.

The church, part of an eight-church network based in Cincinnati, celebrated its first services on this year's Easter Sunday and has drawn thousands to the once moribund mall. The church also decided to keep the complex open seven days a week, whenever the mall is open.

"We have 400 to 500 people a week pop in who have no affiliation to the church," Castleman said.  Teenagers fan the mall after services to eat at the food court and show back up at the church with bags from stores like Claire's and Dick's Sporting Goods, Castleman said.

Of course, Claire's bankruptcy filing this week is one more sign of how the hard times for long-time mall tenants are not going away. But filling old anchors with new, niche businesses or destinations, like in the case of the Dayton Mall with its new church tenant, is precisely the type of "cross-shopping" mall landlords are seeking.

While a church is the unconventional salvation of the Dayton Mall, other malls are also finding out-of-the-box suitors to fill big empty spaces.

The fall of the American mall has long been chronicled, and not exactly greatly exaggerated. Enclosed malls with anchor stores, a bustling food court, and a stable of trendy fashion retailers sandwiched between were the centerpiece of post-WWII suburbia for generations. However, changing demographics, shifting shopping habits, and the rise of Amazon and e-commerce all contributed to the decline of malls.

But recent data and industry executives suggest that the enclosed mall could be positioned for a rebirth.

The trend of repurposing empty anchors, which in some cases began a decade ago, took a long time to bear fruit, said Stephen Lebovitz, CEO of CBL Properties, one of the largest mall landlords in the U.S. with more than 155,000,000 square feet of mall space.

"We have had a rebound and built a lot of positive momentum. These projects to backfill anchors don't happen overnight," Lebovitz said. And even when the old anchors were filled relatively quickly, it can take time to break through to customers.

"It has taken several years to recover from anchor closings in 2017-2018," Lebovitz said, referring to a wave of anchors that closed that year. The past decade has seen traditional anchors like Macy's, JCPenney, and Sears shutter.

Lebovitz said the key to success is subdividing formerly sprawling anchor stores into niche players that all draw in their cross-shopping constituencies. There are former Sears' locations in the CBL portfolio that were generating $7 million to $8 million a year, with newly filled, subdivided ones bringing in a combined five to six times that amount, according to Lebovitz. A variety of different businesses are filling those voids, from restaurants like The Cheesecake Factory, to large retailers like Dick's Sporting Goods, entertainment options like Dave & Buster's, or hotels. 

Lebovitz said that mall developers are also trying to add more experiential categories, such as games, bowling, and laser tag.

Other mall owners are taking it even a step further, converting old stores into things like apartments or large food courts.

Brookfield Properties, another major mall landlord, is seeing similar success from the same playbook.  Brookfield's mall portfolio is more upscale, insulating it from some of the retail turmoil, but they've still had to repurpose some anchors (or "reprogram the box" in industry parlance).

"Gen Z loves the mall; they love the experience of the mall and being in person with each other at malls," said Kirsten Lee, executive vice president of luxury leasing at Brookfield Properties. Lee points to the post-Covid experience as a turning point when people sought out old comforts like the mall.

"People are seeing the shopping center as a community space," Lee said. To lean into that, Brookfield's Tyson's Galleria, for example, has added a bowling entertainment complex and yoga studio to the mix.

That has helped to increase the amount of crossover shopping, Lee said, with customers who may hit the lanes for some games of bowling and then go look for a new shirt.

Recent data from Placer.ai shows that the positive mall vibes from owners are more than just corporate cheerleading, with a tangible increase in traditional enclosed mall traffic. R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, agrees with mall owners that the changes made to anchors over the past few years are finally taking hold.

"It takes time," Hottovy said, adding that open-air "lifestyle centers" were the first to adopt mixed-use strategies successfully. "Now we are starting to see enclosed malls do it."

Hottovy credits much of the success to non-traditional anchor selections, with malls incorporating a variety of tenants into their mix. For the 2024 holiday season, mall visits were ahead of retailers, Hottovy said. People were going to malls for reasons other than shopping, including seasonal events, restaurants, and movie theaters.

In some cases, Hottovy said, the malls are experiencing a "Barnes & Noble" effect even when it isn't a formal anchor. At the Coronado Center mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Barnes & Noble accounted for 7.9% of visits to the mall in 2024, outperforming both Macy's and JCPenney. Barnes & Noble has approximately 660 stores throughout the United States, with 107 of them located in traditional enclosed malls.

"Malls are absolutely places we are interested in being a part of," said Jason Stryker, head of real estate and development for Barnes & Noble, which has been lauded for its turnaround. The company is considering adding 10 more enclosed mall locations this year and is actively exploring approximately a dozen now-vacant Forever 21 sites, which are often sprawling and sometimes two stories high, making it a good fit for a Barnes & Noble layout, Stryker said.

Stryker says the bookseller aims for a store in the 18,000 to 22,000 square foot range so that an old anchor is often carved up among niche retailers.

"We like to be around stores where people will cross-shop," Stryker said, adding that Barnes & Noble can be especially appealing to malls because "We really don't compete with any other retailer there."

Developers point to something intangible that malls capture, nostalgia, and they may be onto something.

"Most Gen X and millennials spent their adolescent years making memories in malls – going to the food court with their friends, smelling all the lotions or perfumes at a store, or just generally hanging out chatting," said Dr. Vassilia Binensztok, a Florida-based licensed mental health counselor and the founder of Juno Counseling and Wellness, a group psychotherapy practice. "For many people, going to the mall can make them feel more like themselves as it evokes memories of those younger days," Binensztok said.

Meanwhile, the coffee and free WiFi will continue to flow at Crossroads Church at the Dayton Mall while other malls look to unconventional anchor tenants.

"We want life, business, money, and energy to surge back into the mall," said Castleman.

Restaurant chains are joining in on the protein frenzy, hoping to encourage diners to pay more for extra macronutrients during a time when many consumers aren't spending as much.

From "gym bros" to users of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, many Americans are trying to add more protein to their diets, with the goal of building or maintaining their muscle mass and feeling more satiated after meals. Moreover, diet trends that don't emphasize protein intake, such as the ketogenic diet, have fallen out of favor.

"A lot of younger consumers are more proactive about their health habits, so they're looking for ways to support health now but also to support their health in the future," said Julia Mills, a food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel. "Generation Alpha, Gen Z, millennials — these consumers are very active on social media, so they're constantly being fed this message that you need more protein, and protein helps you gain muscle and makes you stronger."

Roughly a third of consumers said they loved high protein in the second quarter of 2025, up from 24% three years ago, according to Datassential, which tracks restaurant menus and consumer preferences.

The trend has fueled a protein takeover in grocery store aisles, from protein-packed Eggo waffles to Khloe Kardashian's Khloud protein popcorn.

But it's also hitting the menus of restaurants that are seeking ways to encourage diners to pay for premium food and drinks.

Take Starbucks, for example. The coffee giant said in late July that it will roll out a cold foam packed with 15 grams of protein later this year; the regular cold foam add-on typically costs customers an extra $1.25 per drink. The new foam comes as the chain's U.S. sales have been shrinking for the past year as coffee drinkers brew their java at home or seek out trendier options.

Rival Dutch Bros launched a protein coffee in early 2024 and charges customers an extra $1 for the customization. The menu addition fueled strong same-store sales growth and profits for the upstart chain.

Eateries are seeking to attract diners like Jared Hutkowski, a 42-year-old director of brokerage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He works out six days a week and tries to hit his daily protein goal to improve his physique and overall health. When he dines out, he tries to maximize his protein, although he sometimes goes for pizza anyway.

"The biggest factor is what I am in the mood for that day, and then I normally try and select a meal that has a least a serving of some type of protein in it," Hutkowski said.

This year, 28.4% of U.S. restaurant menus call out "protein," up from 5.9% a decade ago, according to Datassential. And the trend looks like it has staying power. Datassential predicts that by 2029, more than 40% of eateries will highlight protein on their menus.

"Protein is one of those things that's never been vilified, because no one's ever said that eating too much protein can be bad for you," Mintel's Mills said.

In the short term, consuming more protein than your body needs likely won't cause health issues, but in the long term, it could cause kidney problems, according to Diane Han, a registered dietitian based in San Francisco and the founder of Woking Balance Wellness.

The recommended daily amount of protein intake varies by body weight but is roughly 46 grams for women and 56 grams for men, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

For restaurants, protein's step change happened several years ago. In 2021, protein only had a menu penetration of 11.5%; by 2022, more than a quarter of restaurant menus used the term, based on Datassential data. That year, Dine Brands' IHOP, for example, introduced pancakes with 18 grams of protein per flapjack.

Fast-casual eateries are the restaurant segment most likely to call out protein on their menus, thanks to the common practice of asking customers to pick their protein or offering to double their portion, according to Datassential.

Fast-casual salad chain Sweetgreen introduced a line of "protein plates" in late 2023 as part of an effort to introduce more hearty options for dinner customers. The menu addition has helped the company grow its dinner business from 35% of sales to about 40%, executives said in March.

Many restaurants are also leaning into U.S. consumers' desire for convenience. Accessibility may be why Datassential found that consumers tend to prefer protein-packed beverages.

For Smoothie King, protein has been a menu staple since its founding more than 50 years ago. But in October,  the chain took one step further, launching a menu aimed at consumers who take GLP-1 drugs for weight loss or diabetes. The rapid weight loss that can occur from the medications can cause muscle mass to drop, so doctors often advise patients to increase their protein intake to maintain their muscle.

"It's a convenient, on-the-go way to get in your protein that you're looking for in your diet," said Lori Primavera, Smoothie King's vice president of research and development and product marketing.

Many restaurants are also choosing to highlight existing protein-packed options, rather than adding new menu items that would slow down kitchens or add to much complexity to their operations.

For example, Panda Express introduced its own protein plates earlier this year. The line, created in partnership with a registered dietitian, includes pre-existing menu items but packages them as a balanced meal, highlighting protein and fiber content.

Chipotle Mexican Grill employed a similar strategy back in 2019 when it introduced "lifestyle bowls," marketed to fit different dietary goals, like the paleo diet or offering double protein.

Likewise, in July, Chick-fil-A put the spotlight on its own high-protein options in a company blog, highlighting its grilled nuggets and the Cool Wrap, which features a grilled chicken breast, cheese and lettuce in a tortilla.

But for the eateries that want to add new menu items, nachos with a choice of protein, restaurant-made protein bars and egg dishes that highlight high protein content are all increasingly popular options, according to Datassential trendologist Claire Conaghan.

Eggs are one reason why breakfast, brunch and lunch eatery First Watch has always been "protein forward," CEO Chris Tomasso told CNBC. The chain hasn't adjusted its menu specifically to address consumers' demand for more protein, but TikTok influencers have highlighted how to order a high-protein meal when visiting its restaurants.

"We hope that continues to be a trend because we're right down the middle of the fairway on that," Tomasso said.

Of course, protein isn't the only way to win over health-conscious consumers. Hutkowski said his primary issue with eating at restaurants is that most of the food is cooked in oils, butter and heavy greases that rapidly add to his intake of fats for the day.

"A restaurant finding cleaner ways to cook would be much more attractive to me than overly loaded protein dishes," he said.

Business: Viasat is a global communications and defense technology company that operates at the intersection of secure communications, global connectivity, as well as aerospace and defense technology. The company operates in two business segments: Communication Services and Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT). The Communications Services segment encompasses Viasat's fixed broadband, government, maritime and inflight communications services. The DAT segment offers defense-technology platforms for information security and cyber defense, space and mission systems, tactical networking and advanced technologies.

Stock Market Value: $3.44B ($25.62 per share)

Ownership: 2.60%

Average Cost: n/a

Activist Commentary: Carronade Capital is a multi-strategy investment firm that focuses on process-driven investments in catalyst-rich situations. Carronade was founded in 2019 by Dan Gropper as primarily a credit investor. But, four people on the firm's seven-person investment team, including Gropper, have spent considerable time working at Elliott Management: They have experience with shareholder activism and are not afraid to use it.

On July 31, Carronade sent a letter calling on Viasat to separate its Defense and Advanced Technologies ("DAT") business through a spin-off or initial public offering.

Viasat operates in two businesses segments: Communications (73% of revenue and 80% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Defense and Advanced Technologies ("DAT") (27% of revenue and 20% of EBITDA). Communications is Viasat's legacy satellite business, with offerings of fixed broadband, government, maritime and inflight communications (IFC). DAT offers defense-technology platforms for information security and cyber defense, space and mission systems, tactical networking and other advanced technologies. This is a newer but rapidly growing business, with high to mid-teens revenue growth. Despite the company's strong strategic positioning, prior to Carronade's engagement, Viasat's share price had significantly underperformed, down 21.12%, 51.56%, and 57.98% over the past 1-,3-, and 5-year periods, respectively.

As Carronade describes in its letter, this is a "materially misunderstood" business. Carronade believes that the reason why this company is trading down is simple: Viasat has been treated by the market as a small-cap legacy satellite company that has been marked for death due to new high-profile entrants like Starlink. This narrative is two pronged: (i) that Starlink and similar entrants will make Viasat's Broadband business obsolete and (ii) that they are encroaching on Viasat's IFC market dominance. It is true that the broadband business is declining, as revenue is down over 27% year over year, but this is only a piece of the Communications business and the worst piece with the lowest margins. The Communications segment also has three other businesses: (i) Government, which is growing approximately 25% year over year; (ii) IFC, with 22% growth; and (iii) Maritime, which is growing at 11%. The second part of this narrative – the market threat in IFC – is greatly exaggerated. Viasat's IFC business is not going anywhere. The company's customers have long-term contracts (five to 10 years) and face high switching costs as they would need to replace their entire connectivity systems. Viasat presently has customers with 4,120 planes and a backlog of another 1,600 planes from just those existing customers. And this is a very nascent market with only approximately one third of airplanes globally having Wi-Fi, so there is a huge untapped market, which Viasat should get a large piece of despite competition from Starlink and other competitors. Additionally, Viasat is aware of the Broadband drag and is actively pivoting out of it to double down on the growth businesses with better margins. Exiting the broadband business over time while the other businesses continue to grow could be a plus for the company as it will no longer be viewed as a sleepy broadband communications business.

But that isn't even the biggest misunderstanding of Viasat's business. The DAT business has been buried under the legacy business and its accompanying negative sentiment. DAT is a hidden gem, with best-in-class EBITDA margins of 28%, double-digit revenue growth, and significant exposure to hot button next-generation defense and dual-use technologies such as the Golden Dome, next-generation encryption, drones, device-to-device (D2D) and low Earth orbit. While Carronade highlights how each of these translates into promising growth avenues, perhaps the best illustration of DAT's mis-valuation lies in its D2D platform services, which is designed to enable global connectivity directly to unmodified smartphones and other Internet of Things devices. DAT has $1.22 billion of revenue and $285 million of EBITDA. The peer comps to DAT – companies like AeroVironment, Kratos, Mercury Systems and Redwire all have lower margins and weaker growth profiles, yet trade at multiples ranging between the mid-20s to above 80-times EBITDA. Viasat currently trades at approximately six-times EBITDA.

Carronade's proposed solution is simple but compelling: spin-off or IPO the DAT business to unlock this intrinsic value and eliminate the drag caused by the narratives orbiting the satellite business. Carronade models 20-times to 51-times (comp median) valuations for this business giving it a value of $6.3 billion to $16.2 billion, versus a present enterprise value for the entire company of approximately $8 billion. This leaves the Communications segment with $3.3 billion of revenue and $1.2 billion of EBITDA. Applying a conservative 4-times value to this business creates another $4.9 billion of value, and there is another $1 billion of value from the upfront and long-term annual payments pursuant to a recent legal settlement with Ligado Networks. According to the Carronade analysis, this gives Viasat a total valuation of anywhere from $48.93 per share to $112.49 per share or a 76% to 304% return.

Carronade is a multi-strategy firm that focuses on investing in non-traditional, undervalued debt instruments. Viasat is highly levered, and its investment base is filled with creditors, so we imagine Carronade likely entered its position (currently approximately 2.6% of shares outstanding) in a similar fashion. The firm's analysis almost seems too good to be true, but there is not a lot of focus on small-cap companies in today's market and this lack of focus is exacerbated when you have companies like Starlink greatly winning the PR battle against companies like Viasat. This is how a company can go from $34 per share to $16 per share (prior to Carronade's engagement) over two years despite revenue increasing from $2.6 billion to $4.5 billion and EBITDA growing from $344 million to $1.4 billion. Fortunately for Viasat shareholders, Carronade's involvement should help bring the market's attention to this strong value case. While Carronade is not known for confrontational activism, that is OK, because this is a situation where no more than a nudge should be needed and Carronade's best weapon is the power of the argument. Moreover, management has already signaled that they have been considering selling some of the DAT business, suggesting that they may already recognize Carronade's value proposition and are headed in the right direction.

Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist 13D investments. Viasat is owned in the fund.

Tesla Robotaxi was granted a permit to run a ride-hailing service with autonomous vehicles in Texas as part of a new state law that seeks to regulate driverless vehicle services.

The Texas Department of Licensing & Regulation's (TDLR) website showed a new listing for a license granted to "Tesla Robotaxi LLC." Tela Mange, a spokesperson for the division, confirmed to Business Insider that the license was issued on Wednesday. It grants Tesla the ability to operate a ridehailing service with autonomous vehicles across the state and expires in a year, the spokesperson said.

However, the permit doesn't mean that Tesla's robotaxi is officially classified as an autonomous vehicle.

The TDLR spokesperson told BI that the permit only allows a company to use automated motor vehicles for a commercial ride-hailing service. Tesla Robotaxi will have to seek authorization from the state Department of Motor Vehicles to be classified as an autonomous vehicle, Mange wrote.

Spokespeople for Tesla and the Texas DMV did not respond to a request for comment sent outside of business hours.

The requirement to seek authorization from the DMV is part of a new state bill, SB 2807, which will become effective on September 1. The bill establishes a statewide legal framework for autonomous vehicle commercial services.

The bill specifies how companies need to get authorization from the DMV to operate driverless AVs. It also includes requirements for the driverless vehicle operator to be compliant with federal motor vehicle safety standards, and for the vehicles to be equipped with a data recording device, among other stipulations. The Texas Department of Licensing & Regulation only regulates rules around ride-hailing services, Mange said.

In June, just before Tesla's robotaxi launch, seven Democratic state lawmakers signed a letter urging Tesla to delay the launch until the state bill goes into effect or provide a detailed response that shows how the company is proactively complying with the new law.

Tesla moved forward with the launch since the state law had yet to go into effect.

The bill comes as the Lone Star State becomes ground zero for the robotaxi wars. Technology companies, including Alphabet's Waymo, have flocked to the Lone Star state because its laws regarding driverless vehicle operations are less stringent than those in states like California.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, Tesla has deployed a ride-hailing service with a human safety monitor behind the wheel as it awaits regulatory approval for its robotaxis.

"Treatonomics" — a consumer trend that covers spending on 'everyday luxuries' to larger, life-affirming experiences — is booming as people look for a mood boost in ongoing unsettling economic times.

Spending on small-item 'pick-me-ups' is a well-established recession-resistant trend, with consumers often turning to purchases of modest personal items such as make-up, perfume and candles — or even collectible rubber ducks or Labubu dolls — for a morale boost when times are hard or uncertain.

It's no wonder then, that the consumer trend has long been seen as a bellwether for how consumers feel about the wider economic backdrop, which is currently typified by inflationary pressures, persistently high interest rates and concerns over growth and jobs.

The phenomenon is not new; the "lipstick effect" — the theory that lipstick sales increase during economic downturns — has been around for almost a century, for instance. First documented during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the term had a renaissance in the 2000s when Leonard Lauder, former chairman of makeup brand Estée Lauder, noticed a spike in sales after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

"The lipstick effect means basically, buying yourself small treats when you're under financial pressure," John Stevenson, retail analyst at Peel Hunt, told CNBC Tuesday.

"You can't afford a new dress or outfit, but you can always get a new lipstick. You can't afford to get a new sofa, but you can get a throw or some cushions. You can't redecorate the house, but you can get a new tablecloth," he said, noting this was why the homewares retail category is "much more resilient than people imagine."

The Covid-19 pandemic, and a re-evaluation of personal wellbeing and what makes for an enriching and memorable life, has spurred the trend of treatonomics with consumers willing to make everyday sacrifices in order to have "experiences," particularly one-off events such as spending $200 or more for a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert or the Oasis reunion tour.

"Treatonomics is almost another step further [than the lipstick effect] where you are cutting back on on everyday living costs, you're cutting back on basics, maybe you're buying more own brands in the supermarket, but by the same token, you'll go and do an Oasis concert for the weekend and spend £500-£1000 (up to $1330)," Stevenson said.

Economists agree that the treatonomics trend has been able to flourish in an era of economic uncertainty and shaky consumer confidence.

"This rise of 'Treatonomics' — also called 'Little Treat Culture' by Gen Z on TikTok — is less about 'guilty pleasures' and instead about injecting moments of guilt-free joy into life," Meredith Smith, senior director at retail analysis firm Kantar told CNBC Tuesday.

"It's like the 'Lipstick Effect' on steroids, because consumers have this heightened sense of uncertainty coupled with more options and access than ever before to turn life's everyday decisions into an opportunity for a treat. As a result, people are romanticising their water intake, how they dress and decorate their homes, buying themselves treats as a 'mental health' boost and more – all to inject joy into fraught times."

Smith said life's traditional milestones, such as marriage, home ownership, workplace achievement and retirement, looked different now for "nearly every living generation" and were being reinvented or disappearing, "out of desire or because they're no longer attainable."

That has prompted a shift from being able to celebrate 'milestones' to celebrating more 'inch-stones,' resulting in this rapid rise of treatonomics.

"For example — for those who can't afford a home before 40, treating has been a welcome respite and a way to express themselves in their environment when a milestone passes them by," Smith said.

"For those without a partner or children, instead of celebrating weddings and baby showers, they are throwing their energy into breakup parties, dog birthdays, high-effort wellbeing-driven treating routines and more. We've seen a rise in 'Resignation Parties' in China, 'Divorce Parties' in the U.S. and Europe, and people treating themselves to cakes or even diamonds after a breakup or when they don't get a promotion at work," he noted.

On a similar note, Millennials and Gen Z have turned to 'Kidulting' – enjoying adult versions of joys from childhood -- which has "catapulted LEGO's adult offering, seeing some spend up to $1,000 on kits," Smith added.

In the U.K., GfK's Consumer Confidence Index measures a range of consumer attitudes, including forward expectations of the general economic situation and households' financial positions, and views on making major household purchases. It fell to -19 in July 2025, down by one point from June.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., consumer confidence saw a slight increase in July. Overall, however, consumer confidence levels remain subdued "below last year's heady levels," Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of Global Indicators at The Conference Board, which produces the consumer confidence data, noted in a statement last week.

That lingering pessimism feeds into the treatonomics trend, economists say, meaning that more affordable and perhaps more gratifying purchases and experiences, will remain attractive.

Kantar's Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, a measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding economic policy at a global level, "has declared the current era as one of 'Great Uncertainty', relative to the last 40 years. Life feels uncertain, with no light at the end of the tunnel – yet," Smith said.

The volatility and uncertainty we are experiencing are not likely to dissipate for the next five to eight years, Kantar predicts.

"This gives us a strong indication that treatonomics will persist for at least another three to five years – though we can expect to see trends in 'Little Treat Culture' to move faster and become more fragmented by geography and cultural niches. This is a challenge for brands, who will need to be agile and attuned to how these micro-trends are developing."

The month of August 2025 was a time when a crypto cash bubble swept the world as blockchain companies received more than 880 million dollars in the largest funding rounds. The month saw deals ranging over infrastructure, gaming, exchanges, and decentralized systems, which reveals the resiliency of the industry. The financing transaction helped to propel several companies into competitive growth in their market segments.

On top of the crypto cash fest in August was Verb Technology, which raised $558 million in a series that was backed by Sand Hill East, WSI, and Entoro Capital. The company is in the blockchain-based communication and productivity solution, and it gets attention because of its scalable platform. Such a huge investment indicates a strategic growth to increase the product potential and market presence.

Also, the recent raise of Verb Technology was one of the largest venture rounds in blockchain in 2018 that only reaffirmed the idea that enterprise-oriented crypto solutions are flourishing. It is likely that the funding will help with infrastructural development, acquisition of customers, and advanced integrations. With the crypto cash boom gaining pace, such transactions show that the market is ready to finance enterprise tools with high values

Scale-ups that the company may consider might be seeking out new markets in the international sphere and enhancing the cross-platform compatibilities. This is in line with trends in the wider sector where blockchain businesses want to have this fast user adoption. The fact that Verb has entered such a growth phase strengthens the trend of the total funding boom in August this year.

Satsuma Technology raised 217.6 million, as one of the investors was Goldman Sachs, who added to the list of the crypto cash boom. It works on blockchain infrastructure solutions that increase scalability and efficiency of transactions. This capital provides Satsuma with a competitive advantage in cases of dealing with performance issues in decentralized networks.

The purpose of its infrastructure tools is high-volume applications that should be secured and decentralized. It is an ability that is still critical because the adoption of the same keeps growing in both financial and non-financial sectors. Satsuma is the raise and therefore demonstrates vigorous institutional belief concerning blockchain infrastructure plays.

The money can stimulate research and enhance throughput and partnership with developers and enterprises. These would enhance adoption and reliability in the network. The role of Satsuma in the explosion in crypto cash lends credibility to the role of infrastructure in the next phase of blockchain upsurge.

Over the past weeks, the altcoins' season (or the altseason) seems to be the biggest narrative in the digital asset market, leading virtually all conversations amongst the crypto crowd. This narrative is beginning to feel even more organic due to the strong performances of the largest altcoins, ETH and XRP, in recent weeks.

Ethereum, the “king of altcoins,” has been on a relatively significant run in the last two months, reclaiming the $4,000 mark for the first time since December 2024. Meanwhile, the price of XRP has returned above $3, surging by more than 10% in the past week.

However, the latest on-chain observation points that the altcoin season might only just be warming up and has not kicked in full gear just yet. The altseason, a period when mid/small-cap altcoins outperform BTC, is often marked by capital rotation from the largest cryptocurrency to the rest of the market.

Last True Altcoin Season Was In Early 2024: Analyst

In a recent post on the X platform, an on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost postulated that the altseason “has not really started yet.” This hypothesis comes despite the relatively improved performance of the altcoin market over the past few months, with various non-BTC assets leading the sector in gains.

The rationale behind this Darkfost's theory is based on the performance of various asset classes relative to Bitcoin over the last few months. The analyst compared the market cap growth of Bitcoin, large-cap altcoins (the top 20 largest altcoins), and mid-to-small-cap altcoins by calculating the difference between their 365-day and the 30-day moving average (MAs).

Typically, the difference between the 365-day moving average and the 30-day moving average can be considered an indicator of growth momentum. Rapid market cap growth is witnessed when the short-term moving average (30-day MA) rises faster than the long-term moving average (365-day MA), while a lagging 30-day moving average indicates slow growth momentum.

In their post on X, Darkfost noted that the altcoin market is having its weakest performance in this cycle relative to the premier cryptocurrency. As shown in the highlighted chart, the Bitcoin market capitalization currently outpaces the top 20 largest altcoins and the other mid-to-small-cap assets.

According to the crypto analyst, this similar performance pattern was seen earlier in the year before the general market experienced a severe downturn. Nevertheless, Darkfost noted that the strongest action, which resembled a “true” altseason, happened back in the first quarter of 2024.

Altcoin Market Capitalization 

As of this writing, the altcoin market is valued at over $1.55 trillion, reflecting an over 12% increase in the past seven days.

This is a technical analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

XRP XRP$3.2670, the payments-focused cryptocurrency, surged 11% on Thursday, reportedly breaking out of a bull flag pattern to suggest renewed upward momentum. However, it's not yet clear, as prices remain well below the crucial $3.65 level, where a bearish "tweezer top" candlestick pattern occurred last month.

The tweezer top is a bearish reversal pattern, comprising two candles with identical highs that represent a clear rejection point, in this case $3.65. It's as if the market tried to climb to a new level twice and was met with a brick wall of selling pressure at the same spot, a sign that the upward momentum has completely stalled.

The bulls, therefore, need to overcome the significant supply point at $3.65, a move that would invalidate the bearish reversal pattern.

However, this may be easier said than done, as on-chain data suggests that holders are sitting on substantial profits and have a strong incentive to sell at current valuations.

"The [XRP] Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) remains at elevated levels not seen since the 2021 peak, reaching similar levels to those observed in 2018. These high values indicate that the market still carries significant unrealized profits, which historically represents zones of potential distribution and price correction," research firm Alphractal said on x.

Bitcoin's (BTC) recent pullback is currently taking the shape of a descending channel (white lines) within its primary uptrend (yellow lines). This pattern is a classic "bull breather" that suggests the market is consolidating its recent gains.

The price's recent bounce from the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) further reinforces the strength of this consolidation. For traders, this means that while the short-term trend is still corrective, the path of least resistance remains to the upside.

A decisive breakout from the descending channel would confirm a continuation of the broader uptrend, potentially yielding a move to record highs above $123,000. Conversely, a move below the May high of $111,965 would increase the risk of a deeper sell-off to $100,000.

Ether has rallied to over $4,200, reaching levels last seen four years ago. The cryptocurrency has broken out of a prolonged symmetrical triangle that contained its price since the all-time high in late 2021, which is a major bullish signal.

The decisive breakout, particularly on a chart with this long a time horizon, indicates that the market has officially entered a new, powerful uptrend, opening the door for a retest of record highs above $4,800.

The Central Bank of Brazil speeds Drex CBDC rollout, shifting to a centralized design while balancing privacy, regulation, and future blockchain use.

The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) is speeding up the launch of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), known as Drex. The updated timeline aims for a full rollout in 2026. This acceleration comes after the bank faced repeated difficulties in creating privacy solutions that could fully meet Brazil's strict financial secrecy and security requirements.

At first, Drex was projected to be running on blockchain technology intensively. The initial vision involved decentralized networks, programmable money, and peer-to-peer lending. These aspects were supposed to enable novel services without conventional intermediaries. But now things have changed with the BCB. Rather, Drex will open as a more centralized system. Many of the partners in the pilot project in the private sector were surprised by this change.

Since July 2023, 16 consortia have tried out how Drex might be used. These involve the tokenized sale of property, trade finance, and cross-border payments. The trials involve such large companies as Microsoft, Chainlink, and Banco Inter. An example is the testing of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) that enables delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) systems. These operations are being supported by Microsoft through the provision of cloud infrastructure. Although the new plan of Drex downplays the role of blockchain, the partners of this business do not lose hope in the future of blockchain in the tokenized economy of Brazil.

The centralization drive has significant implications. A large number of use cases that were tested in the pilot might now not operate as intended since the new architecture does not have sophisticated programmability. It is also unclear whether Hyperledger Besu, the Ethereum-compatible blockchain platform adopted in 2023, remains the project.

According to Fabio Araujo, who coordinates the Drex project, the new approach was confirmed. He further described that the implementation will occur in two stages. The initial stage, which is going to be implemented next year, will not feature decentralization elements. The second step will start to experiment and optimize blockchain-based aspects.

The BCB says Drex will start simple but evolve. It will also provide features like credit services even without heavy integration of blockchain. The issue of privacy is not straightforward, and the central bank is trying to achieve a balance between the confidentiality of the user on the one hand and regulation on the other.

The switch is occurring in a period when CBDCs are under discussion around the world. Similar projects in certain nations have been halted or slowed by political opposition. Indicatively, the evolution of some CBDCs has been prohibited in the recent U.S. legislature. Although the blockchain enthusiasts might be disillusioned about the centralized base of Drex, the BCB believes that even the pragmatic approach of a solution like lien reconciliation can help to reinforce the financial infrastructure of Brazil. The bank says Pix's instant payments show that practical innovation drives adoption.

The second-phase pilot application will be available until November 29, 2025. This demonstrates that the BCB does not discontinue its interest in the collaboration of the private sector in the development of the future of the currency.

Drex is an ambitious project as Brazil continues its move forward. It aims to achieve speed, security, and scalability even though the blockchain will be used less. The world will be interested in whether this moderate approach can provide a CBDC that will be able to satisfy the Brazilian needs and act as a role model.

The Central Bank of Brazil speeds Drex CBDC rollout, shifting to a centralized design while balancing privacy, regulation, and future blockchain use.

The Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) is speeding up the launch of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), known as Drex. The updated timeline aims for a full rollout in 2026. This acceleration comes after the bank faced repeated difficulties in creating privacy solutions that could fully meet Brazil's strict financial secrecy and security requirements.

At first, Drex was projected to be running on blockchain technology intensively. The initial vision involved decentralized networks, programmable money, and peer-to-peer lending. These aspects were supposed to enable novel services without conventional intermediaries. But now things have changed with the BCB. Rather, Drex will open as a more centralized system. Many of the partners in the pilot project in the private sector were surprised by this change.

Since July 2023, 16 consortia have tried out how Drex might be used. These involve the tokenized sale of property, trade finance, and cross-border payments. The trials involve such large companies as Microsoft, Chainlink, and Banco Inter. An example is the testing of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) that enables delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) systems. These operations are being supported by Microsoft through the provision of cloud infrastructure. Although the new plan of Drex downplays the role of blockchain, the partners of this business do not lose hope in the future of blockchain in the tokenized economy of Brazil.

The centralization drive has significant implications. A large number of use cases that were tested in the pilot might now not operate as intended since the new architecture does not have sophisticated programmability. It is also unclear whether Hyperledger Besu, the Ethereum-compatible blockchain platform adopted in 2023, remains the project.

According to Fabio Araujo, who coordinates the Drex project, the new approach was confirmed. He further described that the implementation will occur in two stages. The initial stage, which is going to be implemented next year, will not feature decentralization elements. The second step will start to experiment and optimize blockchain-based aspects.

The BCB says Drex will start simple but evolve. It will also provide features like credit services even without heavy integration of blockchain. The issue of privacy is not straightforward, and the central bank is trying to achieve a balance between the confidentiality of the user on the one hand and regulation on the other.

The switch is occurring in a period when CBDCs are under discussion around the world. Similar projects in certain nations have been halted or slowed by political opposition. Indicatively, the evolution of some CBDCs has been prohibited in the recent U.S. legislature. Although the blockchain enthusiasts might be disillusioned about the centralized base of Drex, the BCB believes that even the pragmatic approach of a solution like lien reconciliation can help to reinforce the financial infrastructure of Brazil. The bank says Pix's instant payments show that practical innovation drives adoption.

The second-phase pilot application will be available until November 29, 2025. This demonstrates that the BCB does not discontinue its interest in the collaboration of the private sector in the development of the future of the currency.

Drex is an ambitious project as Brazil continues its move forward. It aims to achieve speed, security, and scalability even though the blockchain will be used less. The world will be interested in whether this moderate approach can provide a CBDC that will be able to satisfy the Brazilian needs and act as a role model.

The altcoin market could see yet another bullish rally in the near term, according to fresh market data—one that could shake up the crypto market long-term. The new data comes only a month after the market recorded a massive price boom, with leading altcoins outperforming the leading crypto asset, Bitcoin.

According to data from Cryptoquant, altcoins have recorded the highest altcoin inflows in 10 months. Notably, altcoin inflows have skyrocketed on Binance to levels not seen since last November. This new uptick suggests that Altcoins might be preparing for yet another altcoin rally.

Key implications of increased altcoin inflows suggest an upsurge in positive sentiments in the altcoin market, which is often driven by positive news, project developments, and broader crypto market trends. Increased price inflows and an increase in market liquidity are also key bullish implications.

Another key technical factor fueling the bullish sentiment has been spotted. Notably, altcoins have hit a golden cross—a widely recognized technical analysis pattern in trading that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses a longer-term moving average on the price chart.

🚨BREAKING: ALTCOINS JUST HIT THE GOLDEN CROSS!Last time it happened, altcoins surged by 4,646% in 1-2 months$1k porftolio will be around $150k-$170k at the end of 2025I scanned over ~1,000 alts: Here are 10 alts with huge upside for the upcoming altseason🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/VLyoyPD0Dt

The technical signal is considered to be a strong indicator of increased momentum, citing a shift from a bear market to a bullish market. Remarkably, altcoins soared by 4.646% within a 1-2-month period when this trend was last observed. 

Currently, altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin, with some leading altcoins experiencing hourly gains of up to 20%. Leading altcoins include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), DOGECOIN (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) with gains sustained over the last 24 hours hitting 5.37%, 2.42%, 5.81% and 4.11% respectively. 

The near-term outlook remains largely bullish for altcoins with momentum sustained over time, suggesting heightened demand.

According to @ysiu, he purchased 15 NFTs from Mocaverse and Cool Cats to celebrate their collaboration and International Cat Day (source: @ysiu on X, Aug 9, 2025). He stated that some of these NFTs will be used in a giveaway to be announced tomorrow (source: @ysiu on X, Aug 9, 2025). Participation will require at least 88 MOCA tokens, setting a clear token-based eligibility threshold that traders can factor into positioning ahead of the announcement window (source: @ysiu on X, Aug 9, 2025).

In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency trading, exciting developments like the recent collaboration between Moca Network and Cool Cats are capturing the attention of investors and NFT enthusiasts alike. According to Yat Siu, a prominent figure in the Web3 space, he has personally purchased 15 NFTs from Mocaverse and Cool Cats to celebrate this partnership and International Cats Day. This move not only highlights the growing synergy between blockchain projects but also sets the stage for a giveaway that could drive engagement and potentially influence the $MOCA token's market performance. Traders should note that participants in the upcoming giveaway, announced for tomorrow, must hold at least 88 $MOCA tokens, which could spur short-term buying pressure and increase trading volume in this asset.

From a trading perspective, this announcement by Yat Siu on August 9, 2025, comes at a time when the crypto market is increasingly focused on community-driven events and NFT integrations. The requirement of holding 88 $MOCA tokens for giveaway eligibility acts as a clever mechanism to boost token utility and demand. Historically, such promotions have led to noticeable price surges; for instance, similar NFT giveaways in other projects have seen token values rise by 10-20% in the 24 hours leading up to the event due to FOMO (fear of missing out) among traders. Without real-time data, we can still project potential scenarios: if $MOCA is trading around its recent support levels, this could provide a catalyst for breaking resistance points. Traders might consider monitoring on-chain metrics, such as wallet activity and token transfers on platforms like Etherscan, to gauge accumulation trends. Moreover, the collaboration with Cool Cats, known for its vibrant NFT community, could enhance $MOCA's visibility, attracting institutional flows from investors interested in meme-inspired tokens and digital collectibles.

For those looking to capitalize on this news, a strategic approach involves scalping opportunities around the giveaway announcement. Assume $MOCA's 24-hour trading volume spikes as participants rush to acquire the required tokens; this could create volatile price swings ideal for day traders using tools like RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Long-term holders might view this as a bullish signal for $MOCA's ecosystem growth, especially if the giveaway leads to sustained user adoption. However, risks abound in the crypto market—regulatory uncertainties and broader market sentiment tied to Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) could overshadow these positive developments. Cross-market correlations are key here; if BTC experiences a dip, it might drag altcoins like $MOCA lower, regardless of the hype. Savvy traders should set stop-loss orders below key support levels, perhaps at 5-10% below entry points, to mitigate downside risks while targeting upside potentials from increased liquidity.

Beyond the immediate trading implications, this event underscores broader trends in the NFT and token markets. Yat Siu's involvement, as a key influencer, often signals confidence in projects like Mocaverse, which could ripple into stock market correlations through companies invested in Web3 technologies. For example, if traditional stocks in gaming or tech sectors show sympathy moves, it might open arbitrage opportunities between crypto and equities. Investors should watch for on-chain data points, such as the number of unique holders increasing post-giveaway, which could validate long-term value. In terms of market indicators, keeping an eye on trading pairs like MOCA/USDT on major exchanges would be prudent, as volume surges often precede price breakouts. Overall, this collaboration and giveaway represent a prime example of how community events can drive trading momentum, offering both short-term gains and insights into the evolving crypto landscape.

To wrap up, while the exact price movements remain to be seen, the strategic purchase and giveaway by Yat Siu position $MOCA for potential upside. Traders are encouraged to stay informed through verified channels and use this as an opportunity to diversify into NFT-related tokens. With the crypto market's inherent volatility, combining fundamental analysis of such events with technical indicators will be crucial for successful trades. This development not only celebrates feline-themed fun but also highlights actionable trading strategies in the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder of crypto exchange BitMEX, appears to have reversed course on a major ether (ETH) trade just days after warning of a market downturn.

Last week, data from Arkham Intelligence showed that Hayes sold 2,373 ETH worth around $8.32 million, when the second-largest cryptocurrency was trading near $3,500 and moved into stablecoins.

This weekend, however, he seems to have a change of heart.

Hours ago, data first spotted by Lookonchain showed an address linked to Hayes moved out of $10.5 million in USDC to buy back ether, with the price of the cryptocurrency now hovering around $4,200.

The move comes after Hayes liquidated over $13 million in crypto holdings last week, including ethena ENA$0.7544 and meme token pepe PEPE$0.0₄1240.

At the time, he cited U.S. tariffs and weaker-than-expected jobs data as headwinds for crypto, predicting bitcoin could test $100,000 and ether could revisit $3,000.

Yet Hayes' quick buyback suggests he may see renewed upside in ether. Hayes seemingly confirmed the acquisition of ETH in a post on X, saying he “had to buy it all back” while sharing an ether price chart.

Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum is expanding regulated institutional access to the Sui blockchain with a suite of new products, including custody, trading, and lending services for its professional clients.

Key Takeaways:

The Zurich- and Singapore-based bank announced Friday it will now provide institutional-grade custody as well as spot and derivatives trading for SUI.

Staking services are set to roll out in the coming weeks, while SUI collateral-backed Lombard loans are scheduled for launch in the fourth quarter.

All SUI holdings will be kept off the bank's balance sheet and structured to be bankruptcy remote.

The initiative follows Sygnum's July 2025 integration of SUI into its platform, making it the first Swiss bank to fully support the token.

Partnering with the Sui Foundation, the bank aims to tap demand from banks, asset managers, and high-net-worth individuals seeking secure and regulated access to blockchain ecosystems.

Sui Foundation managing director Christian Thompson said the collaboration strengthens the project's links to global institutional investors.

Sygnum CEO Mathias Imbach described the bank's role as operating at the “intersection” of digital assets and traditional finance, enabling clients to engage with new opportunities under a regulated framework.

Sui, created by Mysten Labs, a team of former Meta engineers, uses parallel transaction processing to boost scalability and supports applications in DeFi, payments, real-world asset tokenization, and gaming.

It has also moved early into the BTCfi sector, allowing Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi without sacrificing security.

Sygnum holds banking and digital asset licenses in Switzerland, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein.

In May, Sygnum added staked SOL to its Lombard loan collateral portfolio for double earning potential on one asset.

The crypto bank said it has added SOL to its portfolio of over 20 tokens as eligible collateral for its Swiss Franc, Euro, Singapore dollar, and US dollar-denominated Lombard loans.

Sygnum's other Lombard loan collateral portfolio includes major coins like BTC, ETH, POL, and XRP.

Earlier this month, Nasdaq-listed Mill City Ventures III announced plans to raise up to $500 million through a new equity agreement to expand its Sui token treasury.

The announcement came just days after Mill City secured $450 million via the sale of 83 million shares to institutional investors, including Pantera Capital, Electric Capital, ParaFi Capital, and FalconX.

The firm used those funds to purchase 76.2 million SUI tokens valued at $276 million. The remaining capital will support its existing short-term lending operations.

Mill City said it is positioning itself as a specialized SUI treasury, aiming to take advantage of the layer-1 blockchain's focus on low-latency, scalable infrastructure for AI and gaming applications.

The firm's new $500 million equity line was arranged with Alliance Global Partners and is intended to further scale its position in SUI.

Key Takeaways

OpenAI's launch of GPT-5 could inject fresh momentum into the crypto market, particularly for altcoins tied to artificial intelligence fundamentals. These projects usually benefit from AI-related hype cycles.

Hence, the launch of GPT-5could also impact their prices.

At the time of writing, the two AI-linked altcoins have not yet broken out following the news. However, current price action suggests they could be in price discovery — a phase where market participants establish a new value range.

Below, we analyze the two altcoins that could ride this AI-driven catalyst, why they are worth watching, and their potential price targets.

Worldcoin tops the list of altcoins likely to benefit from the GPT-5 launch — and for good reason. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly backs the project, giving it a unique credibility boost in the AI-crypto narrative.

Over the past week, WLD's price has increased by 15%. Yet, after the news of the recent launch broke, the altcoin remained muted and currently hovers around $1.

From a technical standpoint, Worldcoin's price has risen above a falling wedge.

Supporting this move, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has climbed above the zero line, confirming an influx of buying pressure and suggesting that market participants are actively accumulating WLD.

Adding to the bullish bias, the Supertrend indicator's green line has shifted below the current price. This positioning signals a buy condition, reinforcing the likelihood that WLD could sustain its upward trend if buying momentum remains strong.

Should this remain the same, WLD's price might rise to $1.41 in the short term. However, if selling pressure increases, the trend might change and Worldcoin's price might drop to $0.77.

Arkham (ARKM) may be another altcoin ready to break out following the GPT-5 launch. The connection comes from Arkham's Series A funding, which raised over $12 million from high-profile investors — including Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.

This link to one of the most prominent figures in AI could generate renewed market interest, especially as GPT-5 dominates the headlines..

ARKM trades at $0.50 at the time of writing, showing a technical setup similar to Worldcoin.

The Money Flow Index (MFI) is rising technically, suggesting increased buying pressure. Should this trend persist, ARKM's price could break above the $0.54 resistance.

A successful breakout may pave the way for a rally toward the $0.65 level. However, this might not be the case if the hype around GPT-5 fizzles and demand for altcoins fades.

ARKM's price might slide to $0.37 if that were to happen.

Home - Guest Post - Top Altcoins to Buy Before Ethereum's Next Breakout: VeChain, Remittix and HBAR Lead the Pack

As the crypto market continues to evolve, Remittix, VeChain and HBAR are emerging as top altcoins poised for strong growth. While some established cryptocurrencies show signs of stagnation, these top altcoins are gaining traction, thanks to their solid fundamentals, utility, and real-world applications. With 2025 on the horizon, these projects are attracting increasing investor interest and could lead the charge in the next wave of market growth.











VeChain (VET), currently priced at $0.02324014, is holding strong at a historically significant support level, signaling potential for a strong recovery. VeChain's recent launch of the Stargate Staking program is a game changer, offering up to 9% APY and addressing inflation concerns by creating token scarcity. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe have highlighted the token's potential, noting that VeChain's current valuation mirrors levels from last year, despite ecosystem changes.

With VeChain's bullish setup, including a double-bottom structure and a 300% Fibonacci target, the price could surge towards $0.12 in the coming months. The RSI and MACD are signaling strong bullish momentum, making VeChain one of the top altcoins to buy as the market prepares for a breakout.











While VeChain builds its bullish case, Remittix (RTX) stands out as one of the top altcoins for those seeking exposure to utility-driven growth. With over $18.4 million raised in presale funding, Remittix has solidified its position in the top altcoins category, offering a robust PayFi protocol that facilitates secure, instant crypto-to-fiat transfers across 30 countries. Here's why Remittix is generating excitement:

As Remittix continues to scale, it presents an attractive opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on top altcoins that focus on real-world applications. The project's strong institutional support and increasing utility make it a standout in the space.











HBAR is currently priced at $0.2553 and is showing bullish momentum after breaking the $0.20 resistance. The RSI and MACD are signaling a positive trend, with HBAR testing key support at $0.240. Analysts are optimistic about HBAR's growth as the project continues to build a solid base. If HBAR holds above $0.240, it could target the $0.30 level by the end of 2025. With strong technical indicators and increased institutional interest, HBAR is emerging as one of the top altcoins with strong growth potential.

As the market shifts, Remittix (RTX), VeChain (VET) and HBAR are emerging as the top altcoins for 2025. While other cryptocurrencies face uncertainty, these projects stand out for their utility, real-world use cases, and increasing institutional support. Remittix in particular offers an innovative solution with its PayFi protocol, positioning itself as one of the most compelling top altcoins for long-term growth.

For investors looking to capitalize on top altcoins with strong fundamentals and real-world utility, Remittix is a standout choice. Don't miss the opportunity to diversify your portfolio with these promising projects as the crypto landscape continues to evolve.

Algo salió mal

A provocative theory circulating on Reddit among Bitcoin enthusiasts suggests that any movement of Satoshi Nakamoto's legendary 1 million untouched coins would signal the arrival of quantum computing powerful enough to crack cryptocurrency's foundational security. While this idea might sound like science fiction, it highlights a very real long-term threat that could fundamentally reshape the crypto landscape.

The concern isn't entirely theoretical. Quantum computers could theoretically break the encryption that protects Bitcoin wallets by cracking private keys—the digital signatures that prove ownership of cryptocurrency. However, the vulnerability isn't uniform across all Bitcoin holdings.

According to analysis from Deloitte, approximately 25% of existing Bitcoin is currently vulnerable to quantum attacks, particularly coins whose public keys have been exposed through previous transactions. The remaining Bitcoin, including Satoshi's untouched reserves, sits behind additional layers of cryptographic protection using hash functions that are considered quantum-resistant.

The distinction matters because Bitcoin addresses that have never sent transactions keep their public keys hidden, making them significantly harder targets even for advanced quantum systems. This technical detail explains why Satoshi's dormant wallet has become a symbolic canary in the coal mine for quantum computing advancement.

If Satoshi's coins suddenly moved, the crypto community would face two competing interpretations. The optimistic view suggests it might signal that “the ship hasn't sailed yet,” potentially attracting new investors who see the Bitcoin creator's re-emergence as validation.

Trending: ‘Scrolling To UBI' — Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.

The pessimistic scenario paints a far darker picture. Market analysts worry that any movement could trigger massive panic selling, particularly if investors interpret it as evidence of quantum computing breaches. Institutional investors, already skittish about crypto's volatility, might “flee this mess long before it happens,” causing severe price crashes across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The psychological impact could extend beyond Bitcoin itself, potentially destabilizing confidence in all cryptographic security measures that underpin digital finance.

Bitcoin developers aren't sitting idle. The cryptocurrency community is actively working on quantum-resistant solutions, with the most likely remedy being a hard fork—essentially creating a new, quantum-proof version of Bitcoin while leaving the vulnerable version behind.

This approach would involve copying the blockchain ledger to a new, quantum-resistant chain, effectively freezing vulnerable coins like Satoshi's on the old network while preserving value on the secure version. Alternative cryptocurrencies positioning themselves as “quantum-safe,” such as Quantum Resistant Ledger, could benefit if Bitcoin faces quantum-related challenges.

Some experts propose interim measures, like limiting quantum-vulnerable transactions to one per block, to buy time for more comprehensive solutions.

Despite the dramatic scenarios, many crypto experts view the quantum threat as overblown—at least for now. Current quantum computing technology struggles with basic mathematical problems, let alone the “insanely astronomical” challenge of cracking Bitcoin's encryption.

Critics argue that more immediate threats deserve investor attention: stablecoin collapses, exchange failures, regulatory crackdowns, or smart contract vulnerabilities. As one analyst colorfully put it, worrying about quantum computing while these risks exist is like “worrying about alien invasions while your roof is on fire.”

The quantum computing threat represents a fascinating intersection of cutting-edge technology and cryptocurrency security, but it's likely decades away from becoming a practical concern. However, the mere possibility raises important questions about crypto's long-term viability and the need for continued technological evolution.

Smart investors should monitor quantum computing developments while focusing on more immediate market factors. The crypto space has survived numerous existential challenges—from regulatory uncertainty to exchange hacks—and will likely adapt to quantum threats when they become genuinely pressing.

For now, Satoshi's coins remain motionless, and Bitcoin's encryption stands firm.

 VivoPower shares surged over 32% after announcing a $100 million plan to buy Ripple Labs shares, expanding its exposure to Ripple equity and XRP tokens. 

Nasdaq-listed solar power company VivoPower International PLC saw its shares jump 32.12% to $5.10 on Friday after the company announced plans to purchase $100 million worth of privately held Ripple Labs shares, expanding its XRP-focused digital asset treasury strategy.

The move, which follows two months of due diligence, will see VivoPower acquire Ripple shares directly from existing shareholders, pending approval from Ripple's executive management, the company said in a Friday press release.

“Our portfolio construction strategy is to buy a combination of Ripple shares and XRP tokens. This will allow us to optimize for yield maximization while also minimizing the weighted average cost of XRP acquired,” Kevin Chin, executive chairman and CEO of VivoPower, said.

VivoPower will also continue acquiring XRP (XRP) tokens directly, becoming the first publicly listed US firm to provide investors exposure to both Ripple equity and XRP.

To manage the strategy, VivoPower will work with BitGo for custody and Nasdaq Private Market, Ripple's preferred partner for private share transactions. An independent auditor will review its Ripple holdings quarterly.

Ripple, which created 100 billion XRP at inception, has burned around 14 million tokens to date and holds 41 billion, mostly in escrow. Beyond XRP, the company operates the RLUSD stablecoin, digital asset prime broker Hidden Road, custodians MetaCo and Standard Custody & Trust and the stablecoin payment platform Rail.

VivoPower's management argues the combined strategy will lower the average acquisition cost per XRP to an implied $0.47, an 86% discount to current market prices, based solely on Ripple's XRP holdings and excluding the value of its other business lines.

According to the company, every $10 million in Ripple shares purchased could add an estimated $5.15 per share in value for VivoPower shareholders, though this depends on market volatility.

On Tuesday, South Korean crypto custodian BDACS launched regulated custody services for XRP, following its February partnership with Ripple. The move leverages Ripple Custody, an enterprise-grade solution, to give institutions secure storage and management capabilities for XRP.

Earlier this year, Ripple Labs partnered with South Korean crypto custodian BDACS to offer institutional custody support for XRP and its US dollar–backed stablecoin, RLUSD.

Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is identifying one major risk when it comes to companies holding ETH on their balance sheet.

In a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Buterin says that if companies holding ETH engage in overleveraging practices, it may lead to the altcoin's collapse.

“If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH, then, of course, my guess for why would basically be that somehow they turned into an overleveraged game, and then at some point a 30% drop turned into forced liquidations that turned into a 50% drop and then a 70% and 90% drop, and then that got compounded with a loss of credibility.”

However, Buterin says there are benefits in companies having an ETH treasury.

“The social aspect of coordinating around ETH just being an asset that companies can have as part of their treasury is good and valuable. Having different vehicles for people to have access to ETH, which is, I think, one of the reasons why people are buying into treasury companies instead of just hodling ETH directly, is also good. 

Giving people more options is good. There's always people in all kinds of different financial circumstances that put all kinds of requirements or incentives or properties on what formats of things that they participate in. There's definitely valuable services that are being provided there.” 

The price of ETH continues to surge after the signing of the GENIUS Act, which established a federal framework for stablecoin regulation, boosting Ethereum's ecosystem.

Ethereum has also witnessed record ETF inflows as institutional interest grows.

ETH is priced at $4,224 at time of publishing, up 8.5% in the last 24 hours and up 21.1% in the last week.

- Animoca Brands acquires majority stake in Cool Cats NFTs with Coin Operated Group, strengthening its NFT and blockchain gaming influence.

- The $410M-valued collection will integrate into Animoca's Mocaverse ecosystem, enhancing cross-project digital experiences and user engagement.

- Leadership changes, including Yat Siu and Kenneth Shek joining the board, prioritize long-term ecosystem growth over short-term financial gains.

- The strategic move reflects industry consolidation trends, emphasizing NFT brand consolidation and real-world utility development.

- New governance aims to expand Cool Cats' utility functions, reinforcing its market position through enhanced digital ownership features.

Animoca Brands has finalized a strategic investment in the Cool Cats NFT project, acquiring a majority stake in the Ethereum-based collection alongside Coin Operated Group. This development reinforces the company's growing influence in the NFT and blockchain gaming industries while strengthening its portfolio of digital assets. Yat Siu, Executive Chairman of Animoca Brands, and Kenneth Shek have joined the Cool Cats board to guide the project's future direction [1].

The Cool Cats collection, originally created in 2013 by artist Colin Egan, consists of 9,999 unique NFTs and has attracted significant attention in the NFT market. According to CryptoSlam data, the collection has generated over $410 million in cumulative trading volume, ranking it 19th globally among all NFT series [3]. The investment by Animoca highlights the value of well-established NFT brands with strong artistic foundations and engaged communities.

Animoca's move is expected to enhance the Cool Cats' market presence and further integrate the collection into its broader NFT ecosystem, including the Mocaverse. This integration could facilitate a more cohesive and globally relevant digital experience, leveraging cross-project synergies to expand user engagement and innovation [4]. The company's strategy reflects a broader industry trend of consolidation and partnership, where key players are increasingly acquiring prominent NFT collections to strengthen brand identity and user utility.

While the financial terms of the investment have not been disclosed, the move is seen as a strategic rather than purely financial play. Animoca Brands has emphasized its focus on long-term growth and ecosystem development over immediate returns, aligning with its position as a leader in the NFT and gaming sectors. The investment underscores the company's confidence in the continued evolution of NFT technology and its potential for real-world application [2].

The Cool Cats acquisition also highlights the importance of leadership and governance in the NFT space. By appointing experienced executives to the Cool Cats board, Animoca Brands aims to ensure the project's alignment with its broader vision for digital ownership and creativity. This leadership shift is expected to support the development of new features and utility functions for the Cool Cats NFTs, potentially increasing their appeal and longevity in a competitive market [5].

Animoca's investment in Cool Cats aligns with its broader mission to support and shape the future of digital ownership. As the NFT landscape continues to evolve, such strategic acquisitions are likely to play a key role in defining the next phase of growth and innovation in the sector.

Bitcoin is back in school early this year.

Harvard University's endowment has disclosed a $116.7 million position in BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, giving it more exposure to the top-ranked cryptocurrency than its stakes in Nvidia and Google's parent company Alphabet.

The 1.9 million IBIT shares were purchased in the second quarter, according to a Friday filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Spot Bitcoin funds have attracted more than $54 billion in net inflows since their US approval in early 2024, with IBIT leading the pack and becoming one of the fastest-growing ETFs in history.

Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said Harvard is now IBIT's 29th-largest holder out of roughly 1,300.

“Endowments are the hardest institution to hook — they rarely bite on ETFs,” he wrote on X, calling the buy “sizable” in ETF terms but small relative to Harvard's $53.2 billion endowment.

Harvard's Ivy League peer, Brown University, also reported IBIT holdings in its latest filing, with 212,500 shares worth over $13 million, nearly doubling its position from March.

While direct public equities make up only a small portion of Harvard's portfolio, the IBIT purchase marks a notable tilt toward alternative assets.

In the same quarter, Harvard disclosed a more than $100 million stake in the SPDR Gold Trust while cutting positions in several major tech stocks.

Bitcoin has gained 0.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading at $117,300.

Ethereum is up 7.7% in the same period to $4,195.

Discover how revisiting past bold ideas can lead to the next big breakthrough in the crypto industry, as suggested by a16z crypto.

An often overlooked strategy for founding a groundbreaking crypto company is to revisit and reimagine bold ideas from the past that didn't quite take off. According to a16z crypto, the key lies in identifying concepts from the previous era of crypto that have the potential to become transformative if adapted to today's technological and market conditions. 

Historically, many successful tech companies have been sequels to ideas that initially failed due to timing or technological limitations. Examples include companies like Doordash and Instacart, which emerged from the ashes of earlier ventures like Kozmo and Webvan. The same potential exists within the crypto industry, where past innovations can be revisited with a fresh perspective.

Several categories are currently gaining traction, such as stablecoins and their adjacent technologies, the intersection of artificial intelligence and crypto, and the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). These areas demonstrate how changes in infrastructure, user experience, regulation, and market size can create new opportunities for success.

In addition to these emerging categories, there are other promising areas ripe for reinvention. The evolution of NFTs from simple profile pictures to assets embodying true digital scarcity across games, media, and collectibles is one such area. Furthermore, the development of verticalized, application-specific blockchains could revolutionize cost and performance metrics, enabling entirely new applications to thrive on-chain.

Efforts to make Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) more efficient and workable could broaden their applicability beyond the crypto space to various organizational types. Additionally, leveraging crypto technologies to enhance the long-term value (LTV) curve of mobile gaming presents an opportunity to reshape the economics of the gaming industry.

Reflecting on past innovation waves, several ideas were ahead of their time or lacked the necessary technology for success. These include early iterations of social networking platforms, online retail, and even artificial intelligence companies. The crypto industry is poised for a similar evolution, where revisited ideas can lead to significant breakthroughs.

Jason Rosenthal, an Operating Partner and Head of Crypto Startup Accelerator at a16z crypto, emphasizes the importance of leveraging these past lessons to fuel future innovations. His extensive experience as an internet entrepreneur and startup CEO further reinforces the potential for success in this approach.

 Trump-linked World Liberty Financial is weighing a $1.5 billion Nasdaq-listed treasury company to hold WLFI tokens. 

World Liberty Financial, the Trump family-backed crypto venture, is exploring the creation of a publicly traded company to hold its WLFI tokens, with a fundraising target of roughly $1.5 billion.

The structure of the deal is still being finalized, but major investors in technology and crypto have been approached, and discussions are said to be progressing quickly, according to a Friday report from Bloomberg.

The move would place World Liberty among a growing wave of digital-asset treasury companies, which are publicly traded firms holding crypto reserves. These companies have raised an estimated $79 billion in 2025 for Bitcoin purchases alone, per the report.

World Liberty, whose website names Donald Trump as “co-founder emeritus,” launched last year with plans for a crypto-lending app and currently offers USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin.

The report, citing investor materials, said that the World Liberty treasury vehicle would be a shell company already listed on the Nasdaq, which the venture has acquired.

The approach mirrors strategies pioneered by Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, which transformed itself into a Bitcoin holding company in 2020. Strategy has since amassed over $72 billion in Bitcoin (BTC) and reached a market cap of nearly $113 billion.

The success of Strategy's stock as a proxy for Bitcoin has inspired a rush of copycats, from a Japanese budget hotel chain to new treasury firms for Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Sui (SUI) and other altcoins. Trump Media, another family-linked venture, bought $2 billion in Bitcoin earlier this year for its own treasury.

In June, Trump disclosed earning $57.4 million from his stake in World Liberty Financial. In his 2025 public financial disclosure, filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Trump reported holding 15.75 billion WLFI governance tokens. The filing attributes the income to token sales.

World Liberty Financial has raised about $550 million through two public token sales, positioning itself as a DeFi and stablecoin platform aiming to challenge traditional finance. High-profile backers include Tron founder Justin Sun, who invested $30 million for 2 billion tokens, and Web3Port, which contributed $10 million in January.

Ethereum is exploding, reaching peaks last seen almost four years ago. 

Ethereum has been the best performer amid the large-cap cryptocurrencies for the past 24 hours, wrapping up 7% gains in the interim and bringing its total weekly increase close to a whopping 20%.

At the time of this writing, ETH is trading at around $4,200.

The move marks a major feat in ETH's price as the last time it was trading this high was in December 2021. That said, over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency accounted for the lion's share of liquidations. Over $200 million were wiped out, $185 million of which were shorts.

Commenting on the matter was no other but Eric Trump, who said:

It puts a smile on my face to see ETH shorts get smoked today. Stop betting against BTC and ETH – you will be run over.

The rest of the market is also in the green, and many of the altcoins are charting considerable gains.

 BlackRock hasn't filed for a Solana ETF, but ETF analyst James Seyffart says they shouldn't be allowed to jump in at the last minute after other issuers' hard work. 

The world's largest asset manager, BlackRock, should not be allowed to launch a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) simultaneously with the US-based issuers who have already filed for one, says ETF analyst James Seyffart.

“That's messed up,” Seyffart told NovaDius president Nate Geraci in a video published to YouTube on Saturday, discussing a hypothetical scenario where BlackRock — despite no filing so far — submits an application at the last minute for a spot Solana (SOL) ETF and launches alongside firms that applied months ago.

“That shouldn't happen,” Seyffart said. “These smaller issuers, these guys have spent so much time working with the SEC getting the paperwork right,” he added. 

VanEck was the first US firm to apply for a spot Solana ETF in June 2024. Other Solana ETF bidders include Bitwise, Grayscale, Invesco, 21Shares, CoinShares, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton and Fidelity Investments.

Since the initial filing, the SEC has issued several delays in its approval decision and requested amended application forms to gain greater legal clarity on the proposed products.

However, Seyffart is leaning toward the view that BlackRock will instead launch a crypto index product tracking the spot prices of several cryptocurrencies beyond the two largest, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH).

“That's what I would do if I were BlackRock,” Seyffart said.

Meanwhile, Geraci said BlackRock may be waiting for its competitors to launch other crypto products first in order to gauge market demand. “If the demand looks like it's going to be really good, perhaps they can just swoop in,” he said.

Geraci also said that if BlackRock chooses not to file, they may be “making a market call that it is just going to be Bitcoin and ETH and nothing else.”

However, Seyffart says it's not a major risk for BlackRock if they don't file for another crypto ETF as approximately 90% of the crypto market cap is in Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Even if they don't, I don't think it is that big of a miss,” he said. 

“It obviously is not going to be what it is and was for Bitcoin, and like I said, I'm pretty bullish on the demand I see for index products,” Seyffart said.

Body coverings such as hair and feathers have played a central role in evolution. They enabled warm-bloodedness by insulating the body, and were used for courtship, display, deterrence of enemies and, in the case of feathers, flight. Their structure is characterised by longer and more complex skin outgrowths that differ significantly from the simple and flat scales of reptiles. Complex skin outgrowths have previously only been observed in mammals in the form of hair and in birds and their closest fossil relatives, dinosaurs and pterosaurs, in the form of feathers. An international team led by palaeontologists Dr Stephan Spiekman and Prof Dr Rainer Schoch from the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, Germany, describes a previously unknown tree-dwelling reptile from the early Middle Triassic in a recent study published in the prestigious journal Nature. The 247-million-year-old reptile 'Mirasaura grauvogeli', whose name means 'Grauvogel's Wonder Reptile', had a dorsal crest with previously unknown, structurally complex appendages growing from its skin with some similarities to feathers. The crest was probably used for display to other members of the same species. The find shows that complex skin structures are not only found in birds and their closest relatives but may predate modern reptiles. This important discovery forces us to reconsider our understanding of reptile evolution.

Unique skin structures in early reptiles

The crest of the rather small Mirasaura consists of individual, densely overlapping appendages that each possess a feather-like contour with a narrow central ridge. While real feathers consist of many delicate branched structures called barbs, there is no evidence of such branching in the appendages of Mirasaura. Because of this, the team believes that the structure of the complex, unique skin appendages of Mirasaura evolved largely independently of those of birds.

'The fact that we have discovered such complex skin appendages in such an ancient group of reptiles sheds a new light on their evolution. Mirasaura is even older than the dinosaurs and not closely related to them. Developmental biology studies show that the genetic basis for the growth of complex skin appendages such as feathers probably originated in the Carboniferous period more than 300 million years ago. Mirasaura provides the first direct evidence that such structures actually did form early on in reptile evolution, in groups not closely related to birds and extinct dinosaurs,' says Dr Stephan Spiekman, lead author of the paper and scientist at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart.

Dinosaurs and the origin of feathers

The study marks a turning point in a nearly 30-year trend in palaeontological research that began with the discovery of feathered dinosaurs in China in the late 1990s. Before this time, it was thought that reptiles, including dinosaurs that gave rise to birds, were covered with scales and that only true birds had feathers. As a result, dinosaurs were often depicted as sluggish, scaly animals. This image changed when research started to show that many dinosaurs were much more bird-like than previously thought. The discovery of feathered, non-avian dinosaurs in China caused a wave of new studies that began to blur the lines between scaly, 'cold-blooded' reptiles on the one hand and feathered, 'warm-blooded' birds on the other. Now, it is clear that the story is even more complex.

'Mirasaura grauvogeli shows us how surprising evolution can be and what potential it holds. It repeatedly produces similar structures that are completely independent of each other but also structures that are so different that they can be distinguished. Mirasaura developed an alternative to feathers very early in Earth's history, long before the dinosaurs, which we did not expect and which will stimulate discussion and research,' says Prof. Dr. Rainer Schoch, reptile expert and head of the Palaeontology Department at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart.

Bizarre tree-climbers with bird-like skulls and claws

The latest technologies have been used to study Mirasaura, including synchrotron imaging carried out at the European Synchrotron (ESRF) to reconstruct the skull. This revealed a bird-like shape with a narrow, mostly toothless snout, large forward-facing eye sockets and a large, domed skull. The snout was probably used to extract insects from narrow tree holes. The drepanosauromorphs, to which Mirasaura belongs, are known to palaeontologists as extremely bizarre creatures of the Triassic period. They had grasping forelimbs, sometimes with a huge claw resembling that of a Velociraptor. They had long, barrel-shaped bodies, a long, prehensile tail, and hands that allowed them to grab onto branches like monkeys. Some species even had a hook-shaped claw at the tip of their tail for hanging from branches.

'Drepanosaurs have many ecological adaptations and have only been known to science for a few decades. Mirasaura lived in trees in one of the first forests that emerged after the great mass extinction at the Permian-Triassic boundary. The dorsal crest with a novel skin structure in Mirasaura adds to the range of remarkable adaptations that make this group of reptiles so unique,' says palaeontologist Prof Dr Hans Sues from the National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC, USA who participated in the new research.

Melanosomes and skin structures

A thin, brown film was partially preserved on the crest of Mirasaura. Analyses confirmed the presence of melanosomes, tiny organelles that contain melanin pigments. They are found in most animals, including humans. The researchers compared the shape of the Mirasaura melanosomes with those found in the skin of living reptiles, hair and feathers. 'We know that in modern animals, melanosomes have specific morphologies linked to the tissue where they are found' says Dr Valentina Rossi, a co-author of the study from University College Cork, Ireland, and an expert on fossil melanosome research. 'the melanosomes found in Mirasaura soft tissues are more similar in shape to those found in extant and fossil feathers than melanosomes found in mammalian hair and reptilian skin.'

Grauvogel's 'Wonder Reptile'

Fossil collector Louis Grauvogel began excavating fossils from the Middle Triassicperiod in Alsace in the 1930s. Among his finds were fossils of Mirasaura. Over the years, he amassed an extensive collection, which remained in the Grauvogel family for many years. In 2019, the collection was transferred to the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, where Mirasaura was discovered during further preparation. The fossils are in the palaeontological collection of the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart.

Mirasaura grauvogeli -- Discovery story:

Local fossil collector Louis Grauvogel began excavating in Alsace, France, in the late 1930s. The fossils he found dated back to the Middle Triassic period, around 247 million years ago, and consisted mainly of plants, insects and other invertebrates. Unknown to Grauvogel at the time, the finds included the remains of Mirasaura. The collection, which was highly regarded by researchers, remained largely in the family's possession. Dr Léa Grauvogel-Stamm, a palaeobotanist and daughter of Louis Grauvogel, dedicated herself to researching and maintaining the collection. Dr. Grauvogel-Stamm is also involved in the study as a co-author. In 2019, the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, Germany, agreed with Dr Lea Grauvogel-Stamm to transfer the extensive collection to Stuttgart. There it will be available for research purposes and will also be on display to the public in future exhibitions. During the preparation of fossils from the Grauvogel Collection in Stuttgart, an unusual small reptile with a crest was discovered and further researched. In honour of its discoverer, Louis Grauvogel, the animal was named Mirasaura grauvogeli -- 'Grauvogel's Wonder Reptile'. The fossil is now in the palaeontological collection of the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart. An interdisciplinary team of palaeontologists wants to further investigate the site where Mirasaura grauvogeli was found to clarify why the skin outgrowths are so well preserved here. Future research will also focus on the ecology, biology and environment of Mirasaura, as well as its interactions with other animals.

The research was funded by the DFG -- Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation) and the European Research Council -- Consolidator Grant. The State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart was able to acquire the Grauvogel collection several years ago with financial support from the Gesellschaft zur Förderung des Naturkundemuseums Stuttgart e.V., the Cultural Foundation of the German Federal States (Kulturstiftung der Länder) and the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Württemberg.

Pretty simple, actually.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Pick any one of the more than 50 ships or 20 planes that have disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle in the last century. Each one has a story without an ending, leading to a litany of conspiracy theories about the disappearances in the area, marked roughly by Florida, Bermuda, and the Greater Antilles.

Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki doesn't subscribe to the Bermuda Triangle's supernatural reputation. Neither does the United States' own National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Both have been saying for years that there's really no Bermuda Triangle mystery. In fact, the loss and disappearance of ships and planes is a mere fact of probabilities.

“There is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the Bermuda Triangle than in any other large, well-traveled area of the ocean,” NOAA wrote in 2010.

And since 2017, Kruszelnicki has been saying the same thing. He told The Independent that the sheer volume of traffic—in a tricky area to navigate, no less—shows “the number [of ships and planes] that go missing in the Bermuda Triangle is the same as anywhere in the world on a percentage basis.” He says that both Lloyd's of London and the U.S. Coast Guard support that idea. In fact, as The Independent notes, Lloyd's of London has had this same theory since the 1970s.

NOAA says environmental considerations can explain away most of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances, highlighting the Gulf Stream's tendency towards violent changes in weather, the number of islands in the Caribbean Sea offering a complicated navigation adventure, and evidence that suggests the Bermuda Triangle may cause a magnetic compass to point to true north instead of magnetic north, causing for confusion in wayfinding.

“The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard contend that there are no supernatural explanations for disasters at sea,” NOAA says. “Their experience suggests that the combined forces of nature and human fallibility outdo even the most incredulous science fiction.”

Kruszelnicki has routinely garnered public attention for espousing these very thoughts on the Bermuda Triangle, first in 2017 and then again in 2022 before resurfacing once more in 2023. Throughout it all, he's stuck to the same idea: the numbers don't lie.

Even with some high-profile disappearances—such as Flight 19, a group of five U.S. Navy TBM Avenger torpedo bombers lost in 1945—pushing the theory into popular culture, Kruszelnicki points out that every instance contains a degree of poor weather or likely human error (or both, as in the case of Flight 19) as the true culprit.

But culture clings to Bermuda Triangle conspiracy theories. The concepts of sea monsters, aliens, and even the entirety of Atlantis dropping to the ocean floor—those are fodder for books, television, and movies. It sure does sound more exciting than poor weather and mathematical probabilities, anyway, even if the “boring” story holds more water.

For a wide variety of earthquake scenarios in Alaska, an earthquake early warning (EEW) system could provide at least 10 seconds of warning time for hazardous shaking, according to a new report.

Increasing the density and improving the spacing of seismic stations around the state could add 5 to 15 seconds to these estimated warning times, write Alexander Fozkos and Michael West at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. Alaska experiences tens of thousands of earthquakes each year, and has been the site some of the world's largest and most destructive seismic events.

The study's findings published in the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America could help lay the groundwork for the expansion of the U.S. ShakeAlert earthquake early warning system, which now covers California, Oregon and Washington State.

"There were a lot of studies before EEW was widely available on the West Coast, where people were looking at different scenarios," said Fozkos. "So we wanted a similar kind of science up here with numbers that are Alaska specific."

For earthquakes along well-known faults in southcentral and southeast coastal Alaska, Fozkos and West estimated potential warning times of 10 to 120 seconds for magnitude 8.3 scenarios.

For magnitude 7.3 earthquake scenarios in crustal faults in interior and southcentral Alaska, the researchers estimated potential warning times ranging from 0 to 44 seconds.

And for a set of magnitude 7.8 earthquake scenarios along the dip of the subducting slab beneath Alaska, estimated warning times ranged from 0 to 73 seconds.

"I was expecting decent warning times along the coast and for most of the subduction zone events," said Fozkos, because there is dense seismic station coverage in these areas. "I was not expecting decent warning times for the shallow crustal events, so that was the biggest surprise to me."

The scenarios used in the study vary in earthquake magnitude, depth, location and fault style -- all of which impacted warning times. The researchers' models estimated how many seconds after an earthquake's origin the quake could be detected, how many seconds after origin time an alert could be available, and minimum and maximum warning times at a location.

Warning times were defined as the time difference between the time of the alert and the time that peak ground motion from an earthquake arrived at a location. This definition differs from a more common definition used in EEW systems, which ties warning time to the arrival of the initial S-wave or shear wave of an earthquake.

The researchers wanted to use peak ground motion instead, to create a warning time measurement that might be more relevant to people as they respond to an earthquake. The initial S-wave may not always cause significant ground motion, and strong shaking can arrive tens of seconds after the initial S-wave in large earthquakes, they explain.

The study doesn't analyze "the time it takes to disseminate the alert -- the time it actually takes to send the alert from a radio tower or from a satellite to somebody's phone and then for them to take out their phone and react to it," Fozkos noted.

The potential lag time in transmitting data and sharing an alert with the public "could be a big challenge for Alaska, but I don't think it's going to be insurmountable," he added.

The harsh Alaskan winters and wilderness locations of some seismic stations could also be challenging for an early warning system, if stations go down and can't be repaired quickly. "I think there is definitely a need for adding stations to cover redundancy for remote stations," Fozkos said.

Ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and more earthquake detection via distributed acoustic sensing or DAS would also be welcome additions to a warning system, he added. "Coupled with the fact that some of our biggest earthquakes are going to be offshore, tsunamigenic threats, I think OBS and DAS are probably big targets for the future."

The Federal Trade Commission reached a $100 million settlement with Assurance IQ, the now-defunct Seattle-area insurance technology startup acquired by Prudential Financial in 2019 for $2.35 billion.

The FTC alleged that Assurance misled consumers shopping for health insurance and made deceptive statements about certain short-term medical and limited benefit indemnity plans, as well as supplemental products such as telemedicine, prescription discount, and vision and dental discount plans.

According to the FTC's complaint, Assurance's telemarketers followed company scripts that overstated coverage, promised steep “repricing” discounts without substantiation, and enrolled customers in supplemental products without clear disclosure or consent. 

“The Defendant has deceived consumers out of hundreds of millions of dollars through the deceptive sales of these healthcare plans,” the FTC said in its complaint.

Founded in 2016 by Michael Rowell and Michael Paulus, Assurance used technology to match consumers with insurance plans purchased online or through an agent. The startup flew under-the-radar in the Seattle region and never raised any outside capital as it quietly reached unicorn status as a $1 billion company.

The company's acquisition to Prudential was one of the largest insurance tech exits ever. 

Prudential shut down Assurance last year after missed financial targets and government inquiries. It laid off 112 workers in Seattle, according to a state filing.

Under a stipulated court order, Prudential — as Assurance's parent company — will guarantee payment and compliance with the settlement terms.

The FTC's action, filed this week in federal court in Seattle, is part of a broader $145 million settlement that also includes Los Angeles-based MediaAlpha, accused of misleading consumers through deceptive lead generation practices and robocalls.

Will the courts intervene to keep Windows 10 alive?

Lawrence Klein, who's based in Southern California, filed a complaint against Microsoft in the San Diego Superior Court over its plan to discontinue support for Windows 10 by October 14, 2025. According to the Courthouse News Service, Klein owns two Windows 10 laptops, both of which will become obsolete come October. He asserts that Microsoft is making this move “to force its customers to purchase new devices optimized to run Microsoft's suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) software such as Copilot, which comes bundled with Windows 11 by default.”

Upgrading to Windows 11 from Windows 10 is currently free, but millions of devices are barred from doing this because they lack one crucial requirement — TPM 2.0. Microsoft states that this is a non-negotiable requirement for all future Windows versions, so devices that do not have these installed aren't eligible for upgrade. You can bypass this requirement, but doing so means your computer is not officially supported, and you will have a difficult time obtaining technical support from Microsoft if you encounter any issues.

You can extend support by one year if you're an individual through a one-time $30 purchase under the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, but it requires a Microsoft Account. The requirement to create a Microsoft account to log into Windows 11 is one of the reasons why a few Windows 10 holdouts refuse to upgrade. Therefore, the ESU program will likely also be a no-go for them. For many, they have no choice but to bite the bullet and spend money on new equipment to upgrade; however, another group suggests switching to Linux instead.

Klein is requesting that Microsoft be compelled to support Windows 10 at no additional cost until its market share falls below 10% of all Windows users. If the court agrees with him, this will incur additional fees for the company and may even delay the adoption of Windows 11. After all, even though Microsoft launched the latest version of Windows almost four years ago, it wasn't until this year that it overtook Windows 10 — probably because of the impending demise of the latter.

With only a couple of months left until Microsoft sunsets Windows 10, we likely would not see the outcome of this case before then. Moreover, the company will likely fight this to the Supreme Court, utilizing its nearly limitless funds and armies of lawyers.

Ford is promising a revolution. The company plans to make a big announcement on August 11 about its electric vehicle future, an event it is hyping as a “Model T moment.”

In a blog post, Ford invoked the spirit of its most iconic creation, the car that “put the world on wheels” by making transportation “accessible to the masses.” The message is clear: Ford believes it is on the verge of launching a breakthrough EV that is both capable and, crucially, affordable. But what is it?

A new clue, uncovered by the site Ford Authority, suggests that Ford's futuristic revolution will be powered by a ghost from its past. Just days before its big announcement, Ford has filed a new trademark for the name “Ranchero,” specifically for use on “Electric vehicles,” namely “pick-up trucks.”

For Ford, this is a familiar playbook. The company has mastered the art of raiding its own archives, using beloved, gas-guzzling names from its history to sell a radically new electric future. They did it with the Mustang Mach-E, weathering a storm of outrage from purists to turn it into a best-selling electric SUV. They did it again with the F-150 Lightning, attaching their most trusted truck name to their flagship EV pickup. And with the Maverick, they revived another classic name to win over a new generation of buyers.

The Ranchero trademark filing signals that Ford is about to do it again. But this time, the stakes are even higher. The company is promising “breakthrough electric vehicles” made in America. According to reports, Ford is developing a low-cost electric platform meant to underpin a range of future models, starting with a midsize pickup. That strategy could give Ford a weapon in the fight for EV affordability, a challenge even Tesla hasn't fully solved.

The Ranchero nameplate hasn't been seen on U.S. roads since 1979, but its history is unlike anything else in Ford's lineup. Launched in 1957, the original Ranchero blurred the lines between car and truck, offering the comfort and style of a sedan with the practicality of a pickup bed. It quickly found a following among farmers, tradespeople, and California surfers alike.

It competed head-to-head with Chevrolet's El Camino, part of a wave of so-called “car-truck hybrids” that traced their lineage back to Australian “utes” of the 1930s, multipurpose vehicles that could haul hay bales in the morning and churchgoers in the afternoon.

Ford is clearly leaning into the symbolism. In the blog post, the company's heritage team invoked the birth of the Model T,  the 1908 car that put the world on wheels by making personal transportation accessible to the masses. Born in secrecy on the third floor of Ford's Piquette Plant, the Model T was designed to be universal: affordable, repairable, and adaptable for everything from climbing Pike's Peak to serving as a snowmobile. Ford says it wants to recreate that breakthrough, this time with EVs.

“Now Ford is going back to its roots for another Model T moment,” the company wrote. “Ford leaders will share more about our plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America.”

If the Ranchero is part of that vision, it could bring back the practicality and personality of the car-pickup hybrid for a new generation. This time powered by electrons, not gasoline. And if history is any guide, the electric version of the Ranchero could bridge the gap between work and play in a market where most EV pickups still aim for size and luxury, not versatility and price.

A team of researchers from the University of Maryland, Georgia Tech, and the University of Notre Dame created a new 3D printing method for building PCBs that can use fully recyclable materials. That means a PCB can be created, dissolved, and the materials entirely reused to create a new PCB.

According to the paper (via ResearchGate), this technique, called DissolvPCB, utilizes polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a printing filament to form a substrate with hollow channels, where eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) liquid metal is injected.

The printed circuit board (PCB) can then be immersed in water, where the PVA completely dissolves. It makes it easy to separate the components, allowing the team to reclaim the liquid metal and extract the PVA from the solution for extrusion. This will enable the team to reuse the materials, with recovery rates of up to 99.4% for the PVA and 98.6% for the EGaIn.

This technique is particularly for experimentation and prototyping, as you don't have to order or print multiple PCBs for every iteration. It's also much more sustainable than FR-4 PCBs, which are far more difficult to recycle. These often require a complex, multi-stage process that involves manual dismantling, shredding, and crushing, as well as the use of hazardous chemicals and high temperatures for treatment.

The team also developed a FreeCAD plugin that enables the conversion of KiCad PCB designs into a compatible format for FDM 3D printing. This means you don't have to manually convert your PCB design to make it compatible with the PVA and liquid metal used in this technique. It also supports through-hole and surface-mounted components, ensuring you can use DissolvPCB on a variety of circuit designs.

Furthermore, the team suggests that the method can be applied to 3D circuit topologies and shape-changing devices. DissolvPCB has been tested to support currents of up to 5A, which makes it compatible with USB-IF's maximum supported current. It also works with high-frequency signals up to 10 MHz, allowing you to use it for synchronizing and testing devices reliably.

You would likely not use this PCB building technique in durable electronics, such as phones or computers. However, they're great for engineering labs and makerspaces that frequently experiment with different circuits. Aside from reducing e-waste, it will also likely help engineers and researchers save money, as they no longer have to order new materials for every prototype they build.

It's not every day you find a working PC in the trash.

An eagle-eyed Redditor noticed an entire gaming PLC sitting in the dumpster, so they decided to remove it, clean it up, and see if it still worked. According to u/AcordeonPhx, they fished out the system with a broom and then thoroughly disinfected it inside and out, including using compressed air to blow out all the dust and then bathing it in alcohol after spending an unknown amount of time in the trash. After all that, they repasted the CPU, updated the BIOS and drivers, and the system is ready to rock ‘n roll.

The PC itself is powered by an Intel Core i5-6600, launched in September 2015, with 8GB of RAM, and an AMD Radeon R9 380 from the same era. They're mounted on a Gigabyte GA-H100M-A motherboard and powered by a Seasonic SS-520GB 520W power supply. The system boots up to Windows 11 IoT Enterprise, which was installed in July of last year.

We don't know the reason why this particular system was discarded, but its operating system provides some clues. The IoT Enterprise version of Windows 11 is designed for use on embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Given that it has a rather decent GPU for its time, this PC is unlikely to be used as just a simple POS terminal or record-keeping station. It's likely used for rendering user interfaces or signs, or maybe even for some light 3D work. Nevertheless, its former owner has thrown it out, likely because they've upgraded their system and have no longer use for it.

Thankfully, u/AcordeonPhx spotted it and saved it from becoming one more piece of e-waste. Although it won't run the latest AAA games today, it's still capable of handling some older titles and casual gaming. And if you don't want to deal with Windows' shenanigans, you can simply install Bazzite into it, maybe add an extra 8GB of RAM, and give it another 10 years as a Linux gaming machine in your living room. In the end, the Redditor said they gave it to their brother after upgrading it with an AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a new SSD, as well as replacing the CPU fan.

When I was an undergraduate working in a molecular biology lab my two mentors, Andrei and Svetlana were Russian emigrants. Andrei taught me, in the 00s, that he couldn't do the level of molecular biology in Russia because the downstream effects decades later put them far behind in the technical and cultural knowhow. Genetics was banned.

That said, the problem is a cultural one.  The communists poured gas on the tendencies of the Tsars and modern Russia suffers from that legacy still.Culture is hard to cure and the change has to come from within.  Japan had a similar problem but most of the sharp edges were dulled when they made a deal (surrender) with the Americans.You also see this tendency to cling to bad cultural habits by some enclaves of immigrants.  It can take decades of new generations to wipe some of those bad tendencies away. Some people see that as erasure of culture as a bad thing but it can also bring good.

I don't think this was the fault of that socioeconomic system known as “communism”. Yet the article tries to push that assumption a few times.> Hitler as the biggest criminal and murderer of the 20th century. It is hard to believe that, actually, Stalin murdered significantly more. Not only are the crimes of communism not condemned, but they are by and large not known.Right, so it was this particular implementation of communism, epitomized by Stalin's policies.

This is a detailed as it gets for a cardboard build.

Reddit user Zestyclose-Salad-290 shared a video on the social media platform of someone, presumably the user, assembling a PC entirely made out of cardboard. In the video, you can see them building a Genshin Impact-themed system, featuring the newly introduced Ineffa character. It opens with what appears to be a micro-ATX motherboard featuring four RAM slots, two PCIe x1 slots, and two PCIe x16 slots. It also has one NVMe SSD slot, as well as what looks to be an AM4 CPU socket.

They unbox a fictitious AMD miHoYo 5800GT CPU, complete with a protective plastic cover, and install it on the cardboard motherboard. They then add a cardboard mounting bracket that uses four real screws to keep it in place. Afterwards, an 8TB ‘PCIe 6.0' SSD was installed on the system, with a cardboard SSD heatsink cover screwed into place. They also added two ‘DDR8' 64GB RAM modules with LED strips, for a total of 128GB RAM. With all these ‘components' in place, they then installed a cardboard heatsink with a single rotating fan and connected it to the cardboard motherboard. We also see a cardboard GPU, which apparently features a dual eight-pin power connector.

With that complete, they revealed a cardboard PC case that will take it all in. But before they added the motherboard build, they also installed a ‘128TB' hard drive and a ‘2400-watt' power supply. Once everything was in place, they plugged the power cable into the cardboard PSU and hit the power button. This turned on the cardboard fan and its RGB lights on the CPU heatsink, as well as lighting up the LEDs on the cardboard RAM. To top it all off, they added a working vacuum cleaner to the front of the PC case and created a small cardboard display showcasing some Genshin Impact clips.

We can only salute the effort that went into this build. Although it's not a real PC, the size, details, and PC-building procedure that went into making this video are spot on, except for the inclusion of PCIe 6.0 SSD and DDR8 RAM. The only thing that the creator might have missed is adding thermal paste to the CPU — but, honestly, how much thermal paste does a cardboard processor need?

It wasn't that long ago that few people were monitoring the air—not the government, not its citizens. Today, weather apps provide estimates of outdoor air quality, and the government's own air quality monitoring website, AirNow, has an easy-to-use zip code portal and fire and smoke map.

There are real health benefits to owning an air quality monitor. Each US state is responsible for developing its own monitoring plan. Even in densely populated urban areas, outdoor air monitors owned by federal, state, and local jurisdictions might be geographically spread out, leaving monitoring gaps that don't accurately capture the air quality beyond one's front door.

Outdoor air quality monitors are not just for understanding the air quality when the odor of smoke fills your home—an outdoor monitor can keep you informed. America has been in the air quality monitoring business for less than a century. In the not-so-distant past, citizens died due to unregulated and unchecked air.

Once more, Trump's EPA is seeking to weaken current Air Quality Index standards, the numbers that decide what is good, moderate, or unhealthy air, along with repealing the regulations on emissions of greenhouse gases. Those actions will lead to dirtier air and less reliable data. Like face masks and air purifiers, an outdoor air quality monitor is no longer a niche appliance but an electronic canary in the modern coal mine of a bad-air world.

Back in January, I woke up to find my PurpleAir Zen outdoor air quality monitor glowing bright red. This happened over several days, and I was confused because the numbers were well over 100 and yet there wasn't an air quality alert for the area.

The annual AQI for my neighborhood is under 50—considered good air. For context, an AQI of 100 or more is unhealthy for sensitive groups, and an AQI of 150 is unhealthy for everyone. I mentioned the unhealthy air to a friend who reminded me that New York City recently installed a concrete recycling center a few blocks from my home. The literal dust-up the center caused, including failure to inform the neighborhood about its existence, might be the culprit for the recent uptick in bad air, from the concrete dust created by the recycling center. At that point the recycling center had yet to implement irrigation to mitigate the dust plumes. The data from my outdoor monitor fed into PurpleAir's crowdsourced real-time map. On the map, I could see other nearby PurpleAir monitors, and the ones closest to the concrete recycling center tended to have worse air quality.

In July, after a year of mounting protests and political pressure, the city announced that it would relocate the concrete recycling center. What would have happened if residents hadn't seen the dust clouds or noticed the gray film collecting on their cars? What if they couldn't see what was all around them? PM 2.5 is the invisible solids and liquids that are in the air. The tiniest form can enter the deepest parts of the lungs, passing into the bloodstream. There, they can cause a host of illnesses, respiratory distress, and cardiovascular disease.

In early 2024, the Biden administration strengthened the National Ambient Air Quality Health Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter, a move that set “the level of the primary (health-based) annual PM 2.5 standard at 9.0 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m3) to reflect new science on harms caused by particle pollution.” This changed the window of what is considered “good” air on the Air Quality Index.

Those EPA guidelines are almost double those of the World Health Organization guidelines, which are a stricter 5 PM 2.5. Trump's EPA is reconsidering the Biden administration's PM 2.5 standards. To quote EPA administrator Zeldin, “All Americans deserve to breathe clean air while pursuing the American dream. Under President Trump, we will ensure air quality standards for particulate matter are protective of human health and the environment while we unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.”

The Trump administration also wants to repeal greenhouse gas emissions regulations. According to a statement from the EPA, “The EPA is further proposing to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” Scientific research states otherwise. And so, as outdoor air becomes less regulated, it has the potential to get dirtier and make people sick.

This past spring, the smell of campfire filled my home. I peered out my fourth-floor window to see my neighbor's illegal fire pit three backyards over. I watched the colors on my PurpleAir Zen outdoor monitor change from green to yellow to crimson over the course of an hour. When I logged onto the crowd-sourced PurpleAir real-time map, I could see that my outdoor air quality was an unhealthy 160 PM 2.5 and that a few blocks away, air quality was good at under 30 PM 2.5. There's nothing surprising about a fire pit generating air pollution, but I didn't realize how intense and localized that air pollution could be, even though I was four stories up in a half-a-city-block-sized area. This is air quality on a microscale.

There are several relatively low-cost outdoor air quality monitors on the market. Some, like PurpleAir's Zen, feed data into a crowdsourced real-time map. On the map's upper left corner is a pull-down menu of data layers to customize your Air Quality Index measures. There's a layer for EPA guidelines, and PurpleAir told me that if the EPA updates its air quality standards, it will update the layer to reflect that. There are also WHO guidelines for PM 2.5, along with several others. My favorite layer for PM 2.5 data is in terms of numbers of cigarettes smoked per day. On the day I'm writing this, air quality in my Brooklyn neighborhood is the equivalent of smoking 0.6 cigarettes per day. Some air monitors have sensors that can measure TVOCs—total volatile organic compounds—and CO2, along with temperature and humidity.

AirGradient

AirGradient's Outdoor Air Quality Monitor and IQAir's Outdoor Monitor both use the WHO's robust air quality guidelines. AirGradient even has a dotted line on its dashboard graph to show exactly where the ambient outdoor air is falling in terms of the WHO's PM 2.5 guidelines. AirGradient also uses the EPA color codes: green for good air, yellow for moderate, orange for unhealthy, and red for very unhealthy. And the thing about outdoor air, it gets inside.

America's monitoring of air quality is fairly recent. The Donora Historical Society and Smog Museum, about 25 miles south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has a sign hanging over its front door announcing “Clean Air Started Here.” In that state, in October 1948, 20 people died and nearly 6,000 were sickened in the Donora Smog Event. The deadly air was the product of the company town's two factories and an unlucky weather inversion that created what was referred to as the “Death Smog.” The Donora Smog Event is said to have been the catalyst for the Clean Air Act.

To prevent deadly bad air from harming Americans, the Clean Air Act of 1970 required ambient air quality monitoring for particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and lead. It is credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives and preventing illness. Historically, communities of color and lower socioeconomic backgrounds live in areas with worse air quality. The added cost of an outdoor air quality monitor may not be an option for those already living with the inequitable burden of air pollution. In making a choice between an outdoor air quality monitor or an air purifier, the air purifier is the priority purchase.

Similar to the human nose, PM 2.5 air sensors measure the air inside the device. Air is pulled into the sensor by a tiny fan, where it passes through a laser beam. The particles reflect light onto the detector that measures the light pulse, and the longer the pulse, the larger the size of the particulate matter. PurpleAir's sensors work this way, and the placement of the monitor is equally important.

I emailed Shelly Miller, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado, and told her about my experience with my PurpleAir Zen outdoor air quality monitor and the local cement recycling center.

She wrote, “Air quality can be quite different spatially, especially depending on local sources—such as the cement recycling plant that you referred to in your email. In one of our prior studies, we had put a monitoring site near a cement plant, and it was consistently reading different than all of our other monitoring sites due to the local source.”

And once you register your PurpleAir monitor to the map, you aren't only providing intel on your small corner of the world; the monitor becomes part of PurpleAir's real-time air quality map. AirGradient and IQAir have crowd-sourced maps that air monitor owners can register and share their data with the map. The more people who own outdoor air monitors and link them to the crowdsourced maps, the more accurate the air quality readings will be.

The New York State Department of Environmental Protection has a network of local air quality monitors. Using its interactive map, I see both the state air quality monitors along with locations that require air pollution control permits and registrations as sources of air pollution, like auto body shops, dry cleaners, etc.

When I look at the map, I can see the brown circles with tiny wind marks indicating sources of pollution. New York City is covered in those brown circles. There are fewer blue circles scattered across the state. Those indicate air quality monitoring sites. You can also view EPA air quality monitoring sites on its interactive AirData Map. On the upper-right corner, you can click on the various layers to see the EPA monitors for PM 2.5, ozone, and lead, to name a few. And if you zoom in on that map to your location, you will see that the monitors are spread out. Even in New York City, there are only 10 PM 2.5 EPA air regulation monitoring sites on the map.

Outdoor air quality monitors, owned by regular folks, are filling the gaps in air monitoring. They can capture and monitor the micro areas around your home while providing real-time data for the greater good.

Unexpected exposure to rodenticide is turning California's wild pigs blue, state authorities say. 

“I'm not talking about a little blue,” Dan Burton, owner of a wildlife control company in Salinas, California, told The Los Angeles Times. “I'm talking about neon blue, blueberry blue.”

Burton was one of the first trappers to discover that local wild pigs had turned blue on the inside. A subsequent investigation by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) found that the pigs had consumed the anticoagulant rodenticide diphacinone, a poison used by farmers to control populations of unwanted rats, mice, squirrels, and other small animals. These substances often contain dye to identify them as poison, the CDFW reported, which likely explains how the pigs ended up with blue-colored muscle and fat.

Burton's own investigations found that the poisoned pigs seemed to be frequenting squirrel bait stations, which local farmers were using to control the squirrel populations targeting their crops. However, since the poisoned bait had tiny doses of diphacinone, the pigs, despite turning blue, weren't outwardly acting sick. 

Eating animals poisoned by this rodenticide could result in secondary exposure to the poison, the CDFW said. As such, the agency is warning hunters to not consume any wild animals with signs of blue contamination and to report any sightings of such animals to officials. Overall, the agency advised hunters to exercise extra caution around areas with rat control programs, as it is also possible that exposed animals may not necessarily be blue.

“Hunters should be aware that the meat of game animals, such as wild pig, deer, bear and geese, might be contaminated if that game animal has been exposed to rodenticides,” said Ryan Bourbor, pesticide investigations coordinator at CDFW, in the statement.

This isn't the first time that officials have identified wild pigs poisoned by rat poison. In 2018, a study by the CDFW found traces of rodenticide in about 8.3% of wild pigs spotted lurking around agricultural or residential areas with rat control programs. Other research from 2011 and 2023, respectively, found that cooking meat poisoned with diphacinone did not eliminate the contamination, and people and animals that consume the meat can exhibit signs of rodenticide poisoning, such as lethargy.

In 2024, California prohibited the use of diphacinone, with exceptions for specific instances at certified sites, as part of legislation meant to protect wildlife from unintentional poisoning. CDFW is asking anyone who encounters wild animals with blue fat or tissues to report their sightings to the agency at [email protected] or (916) 358-2790.

Some health enthusiasts swear by smartwatches as a way to monitor stress levels, but a recent study calls into question that common usage. The study, published in the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, claims that such watches display a very limited ability to actually communicate what a person's psychological state is. Sometimes, a watch may think the user is stressed when they're really just excited about something, researchers say.

The report looked at nearly 800 students who wore a Garmin Vivosmart 4 smartwatch and measured their self-reported emotional states against the metrics collected by the wearables. According to the study, the self-reports of the watch-wearers and the analyses provided by the watches bore little resemblance to one another. It notes:

We investigated the concurrent overlap between self-report and wearable sensor data measuring stress, tiredness, and sleep. For the majority of individuals in our sample, we found that self-report and physiological measures of stress show very weak to no associations. These results raise several questions about differences between data sources and potential measurement issues.

Garmin advertises a stress-tracking capability for its smartwatches on its website. “Stress levels (0–100) are estimated by the Firstbeat Analytics engine, primarily using a combination of HR and HRV data. This data is recorded by the optical heart rate sensor on the back of your device.”

However, Garmin seems to admit that the quality and character of stress can be difficult to measure: “Public speaking and running up a flight of stairs can both send your heart racing, but the underlying reasons why are fundamentally different,” its website notes. The company suggests that wearing the watch more frequently can result in better measurements. “You can improve the quality of the insight gained by wearing your device as much as possible, especially while you sleep, because that is when your stress levels will typically be lowest,” the site states. “This helps create a better understanding of the full range of stress and relaxation states that you experience.”

In an interview with The Guardian, one of the study's authors, Eiko Fried, said that the correlation between the self-reported stress scores that were collected as part of the study and the readings provided by the smartwatches was “basically zero.”

“This is no surprise to us given that the watch measures heart rate and heart rate doesn't have that much to do with the emotion you're experiencing – it also goes up for sexual arousal or joyful experiences,” he told the outlet. “The findings raise important questions about what wearable data can or can't tell us about mental states,” he continued. “Be careful and don't live by your smartwatch – these are consumer devices, not medical devices.”

The study's topic has a diverse research history. A 2023 meta-analysis of studies about wearables and stress management found that “the effect of wearable-based approaches on alleviating or reducing stress” had “not been analyzed” and that most studies up until that point had “focused on presenting overviews of wearable devices.” Another study published by researchers at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2023 found, much like the recent psychology study, that smartwatches frequently failed to distinguish between excitement and stress. Gizmodo reached out to Garmin for comment on the recent study and will update this story if it responds.

While the study claims Garmin's wearable didn't do much to measure stress, researchers found it seemed to provide decent metrics in other arenas. The report says that the watches were very good at measuring sleep, although it notes that “associations were weaker for tiredness.”

The new entry-level RDNA 3 SKU

AMD has introduced two new graphics cards based on the chipmaker's previous RDNA 3 architecture. The Radeon RX 7400 is an economical gaming graphics card targeting budget-conscious gamers, while the Radeon Pro W7400 caters to the professional and workstation markets.

The Radeon RX 7400 and Radeon Pro W7400 are based on AMD's Navi 33 (codenamed Hotpink Bonefish) silicon, which is likely the reason why the company decided to roll these out quietly without any fanfare. Navi 33 is also found in other lower-tier SKUs, including the Radeon RX 7600, Radeon RX 7600 XT, and the Radeon RX 7650 GRE. Navi 33, being the smallest silicon inside the RDNA 3 family, should be even cheaper to produce now, so it's reasonable to reuse it inside the Radeon RX 7400 and Radeon Pro W7400.

The Radeon RX 7400 features 28 RDNA 3 Compute Units (CUs), equivalent to 1,792 Stream Processors (SPs). This is 12.5% less than the Radeon RX 7600 in SPs, so the performance gap likely won't be significant. While both graphics cards' memory subsystems are similar, they're not equal.

AMD has equipped the Radeon RX 7400 with slower GDDR6 memory, clocked at 10.8 Gbps, compared to the 18 Gbps on the Radeon RX 7600. As a result, the former's memory bandwidth is 40% lower. The Radeon RX 7400 comes with DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI 2.1 support.

The Radeon RX 7400 doesn't need any external power connectors. The Navi 33-powered graphics card has a TBP (Typical Board Power) of 55W, so a 450W power supply is sufficient as a minimum. AMD hasn't confirmed whether there will be custom designs, but based on the description, the graphics card listed on AMD's website adheres to a single-slot design with a length of 6.65 inches (167mm).

Meanwhile, the Radeon Pro W7400 is the workstation variant of the Radeon RX 7400, sharing identical specifications. AMD positions the Radeon Pro W7400 under the existing Radeon Pro W7500. Examining the specifications, the first is essentially a lower-binned version of the second.

Both have the same number of CUs and memory capacity. However, the Radeon Pro W7400 has the same 10.6 Gbps memory as the Radeon RX 7400, resulting in the same bandwidth. It's 32% lower than the Radeon Pro W7500. The Radeon Pro W7500 was already an energy-efficient workstation graphics card, but the Radeon Pro W7400's compromises have allowed AMD further to reduce the TBP by 21% on the latter.

The Radeon Pro W7400 features a half-height form factor with a single-slot design, measuring 6.6 inches (168mm) in length. It has the same TBP as the Radeon RX 7400, so no external power connectors are required. As for display outputs, the Radeon Pro W7400 sports four mini DisplayPort 2.1 outputs.

AMD hasn't revealed the pricing for the Radeon RX 7400 or Radeon Pro W7400. Nonetheless, the Radeon RX 7600 and Radeon Pro W7500 launched at $269 and $429, respectively, so the new Navi 33 offerings should be more affordable.

The promise of quantum computers appears to be that they will upend modern computing as we know it. With exceptional computational power, they'll be performing feats unimaginable for any classical supercomputer.

The reality of quantum computers hasn't quite lived up to its hype, however. Claims of “quantum advantage”—problems regular computers can't solve but quantum computers can—draw criticism from both skeptics and enthusiasts in the field. Certainly, we've seen genuinely impressive advancements, both theoretical and experimental, but many have been contrived “feats” with little real-world applicability.

When Will Quantum Computers Outperform Regular Computers?

I'm inching toward becoming an enthusiast. But even for me, parsing through the—let's face it—sometimes overhyped noise feels tiresome and pointless. So let's take a step back. What will quantum technology really do for us? How far have we come? And how should we handle the flow of PR on the sixth so-called ultimate quantum breakthrough of the week? To discuss these questions (or rather, to sift through the noise), Gizmodo traveled uptown to IBM's Manhattan office to chat with Jerry Chow, director of IBM Quantum. The following conversation has been slightly edited for grammar and clarity.

Gayoung Lee, Gizmodo: Okay, imagine I'm someone who is just like, “Oh, quantum computing is a load of nonsense.” Why should I care at all about quantum advantage?

Jerry Chow: In the end, I think our goal is to bring useful quantum computing to the world. And a big part of quantum computing is that we have the opportunity to build differentiating computation over what exists today. There's a mathematical statement to that, or there are provable algorithms that really show that quantum computing can really [outperform] classical computing, like factoring large numbers for breaking encryption or simulating very complex molecular structures, the Grover's algorithm, and all that pen-and-paper provable direction. 

But another question is, what can we do with the things that people are already building? That's very far apart from saying that there's an advantage for a particular kind of problem, or it's an advantage in terms of being better than all classical techniques that you might throw at it. When you want to solve a problem, you have at your disposal the GPUs, CPUs, all the world's computers, and all the world's algorithms to throw at that problem, right? 

Quantum advantage, really, is that we can now use quantum computing plus what we have available to us—classical resources—to solve a problem cheaper, faster, or more accurately.

Gizmodo: That's quite the departure from that popular press hook that goes, “Quantum computing will change computing forever!”

Chow: I see quantum advantage more as something incremental. It's not that it necessarily changes everything that we can compute. That's also how a lot of GPUs [graphics processing units] also scaled up. Obviously they were used for games—maybe a niche area—but they really got large with national computing strategies leveraging it for clustered HPCs [high-performance computers] and for people studying molecular structure, cosmology, and high-energy physics problems that use a lot of computational capability. We expect something similar too, for quantum to now be an “augmented tool.”

Gizmodo: The idea of augmentation is really interesting, because the two—classical and quantum computers—are inherently connected, right? Confirming that quantum computers work properly requires cross-checking using classical computers. How do researchers leverage this relationship to their benefit?

Chow: That's an absolutely important part of how this all happens. Everything is interconnected with classical computing. The only way we know how to experience computation is classical—we put classical inputs in, and we take classical inputs out. Quantum computers use quantum mechanics and quantum circuits to explore some exponentially large space, but in the end we're performing measurements that turn everything back into classical outputs that we then further process or use or leverage in parts of our computation using other parts of our computational arsenal. People shouldn't fear that quantum will replace classical!

Gizmodo: IBM's clearly a big player in this field, and you've been involved with its quantum research for 15 years. What's something you're particularly proud of in the realm of realizing that approach to quantum advantage?

Chow: When I started, we had maybe eight to ten people, very much focused on just building better devices. Then around the mid-2010s, we made the decision to take what we've built and actually put it on the cloud to take things out of the physics laboratory and into a computational experience. Suddenly, we started thinking less about it as turning knobs and controlling voltages and more in terms of how to actually use this as a computational tool and computational platform. Today, most of our systems are deployed in quantum data centers around the world as well as on client locations.

And we're starting to see a lot of that engagement. For example, our collaborators from the RIKEN Institute in Japan are using quantum plus their HPC to study molecular structure. Since then we've been able to start to push that energy level [needed for calculations] down closer and closer to this hallmark level of what's best done classically, at which point we start to really be able to do these comparisons.

Gizmodo: What's an important part of IBM's strategy in this field?

Chow: Now, just building it is not enough. We need to derive quantum computers' usefulness, and a big part of that is the community. We need them to really demand the necessity for advanced computers and work with us to find quantum advantage and useful applications. That's a big part of our ecosystem strategy and why we have a quantum network of nearly 300 members. We're not the industry experts in various verticals, but the opportunity is there for health care, life sciences, oil and gas, and energy industries.

Gizmodo: So quantum computers aren't actually a thing of the future. They're already here. 

Chow: Yes. Quantum computers are real things that are usable. Obviously there's a lot of marketing, a lot of buzz out there. But also, like, literally, you can go and run quantum circuits for free on our machines over the web. There's so much to learn in terms of learning content that's out there. There's a huge community base of people to help you get started. You can tell ChatGPT to install Qiskit. People don't need to just experience it through marketing; get your hands dirty! 

Gizmodo: Okay. If quantum advantage is incremental, what, then, is the next quantum milestone? What are you most looking forward to in the next ten, maybe five years—or even in the next few months, perhaps—for quantum computing?

Chow: We're already driving towards a new device that we want to introduce to users by the end of the year, called Nighthawk. I think the next big milestone will probably be a series of milestones from the advantage point of view, where you're going to see more and more “sticks” in the ground of running more complex circuits using quantum computers, with classical tackling back, so this back-and-forth over the next year. We'll be deeply engaged with the high-performance computing community.

I hope it doesn't devolve into Intel becoming a less viable option for Linux. Intel wifi chipsets work great on Linux since they're well supported by Intel, but if that kind of support goes away, so does the future security in knowing Intel hardware will work well.

Today, open source drivers are written mainly for new entrants that are trying to undercut dominant players or incumbents in stable market niches that have largely ceased developing new products. If the current trends continue, it will take some time for any surviving components of Intel's business to settle into the latter position.

Hi, thanks as always for reading TechCrunch. We want to talk with you quickly about something important. 

We've discovered that scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. These bad actors are using our name and reputation to try to dupe unsuspecting businesses. It drives us crazy and infuriates us on your behalf.

Anecdotally, this isn't just happening to us; fraudsters are exploiting the trust that comes with established news brands to get their foot in the door with companies across the media industry.

Here's an example of the most common scheme we've been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company's products and requesting an introductory call.

Sharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don't match our real employees' credentials. But these schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters' writing styles and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. Equally troubling, victims who agree to phone interviews tell us the fraudsters use those calls to dig for even more proprietary details.

Why are they doing this? We don't know, though a reasonable guess is that these are groups looking for initial access to a network or other sensitive information.

As for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they're legitimate, please don't just take their word for it. We've made it easy for you to verify.

Start by checking our TechCrunch staff page. It's the quickest way to see if the person contacting you actually works here. If the individual's name isn't on our roster, you've got your answer right there.

If you do see someone's name on our staff page, but our employee's job description doesn't square with the request you are receiving (i.e., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business!), a bad actor may be trying to con you.

If it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask. You can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales executive, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios.

We know it's frustrating to have to double-check media inquiries, but these groups are counting on you not taking that extra step. By being vigilant about verification, you're not just protecting your own company — you're helping preserve the trust that legitimate journalists depend on to do their jobs.

Thank you.

While we can try to slow it down, human aging is something we currently can't stop from happening. However, past studies show that aging doesn't necessarily happen at the same pace throughout our life. 

Instead, there are certain ages when a person's body may experience a burst of aging. Previous studies show that the body may undergo rapid aging around the ages of 44 and 60.

And there is still much to discover about the aging process, especially when it comes to how it impacts the body's organs. 

“Aging, as a systemic, degenerative process that spans multiple organs and biological strata, remains one of the most profound unresolved questions in the life sciences,” Guang-Hui Liu, PhD, regenerative medicine researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained to Medical News Today.

“Throughout the extended human lifespan, two fundamental issues persist: Do all organ systems adhere to a unified aging rhythm? Does a molecular spatiotemporal hub exist that orchestrates organism-wide senescence? Despite their centrality to understanding the essence of aging, these questions have long lacked systematic, empirical resolution.”

Liu is the corresponding author of a new study recently published in the journal Cell that has found that by focusing on aging-related protein changes in the body, they can get a clearer picture of how the body's organs and tissues age over time, including an aging acceleration around the age of 50. 

And of these proteins, scientists found that expressions of 48 of them related to diseases — such as cardiovascular disease and fatty liver disease — increased with age. 

For this study, researchers analyzed 516 samples of 13 types of human tissues collected from 76 organ donors between the ages of 14 and 68 who had passed away from traumatic brain injury. 

The tissue samples included cardiovascular, digestive, respiratory, endocrine, and musculoskeletal samples, as well as immune system, skin, and blood samples. 

Next, researchers documented the types of proteins found in the organ and tissue samples, allowing them to create what Liu called “a proteomic aging atlas” that spans 50 years of human life. 

“Covering seven physiological systems and thirteen pivotal tissues, the atlas presents a panoramic, dynamic portrait of organismal aging from a protein-centric perspective,” Liu explained. “The more than 20,000 proteins encoded by the genome serve as the structural bedrock of cells; their dynamic networks exquisitely orchestrate physiological homeostasis and act as the principal executors of virtually every biological process.” 

“Consequently, systematically charting a panoramic, lifespan-wide atlas of proteomic dynamics and dissecting the reprogramming rules of protein networks at organ- and system-level scales are pivotal for accurately identifying the core drivers of aging and for establishing precise intervention targets,” he added. 

At the study's conclusion, researchers found that the biggest aging changes in the body's organs and tissues seems to occur around age 50. 

“Ages 45–55 are identified as a landmark inflection point: most organ proteomes undergo a ‘molecular cascade storm,' with differentially expressed proteins surging explosively, marking this interval as the critical biological transition window for systemic, multi-organ aging.” — Guang-Hui Liu, PhD

“Notably, the aortic proteome is reshaped most dramatically; its secretome and the circulating plasma proteome evolve in tight concordance, indicating that senescence-associated secreted factors (senokines) may serve as the hub mechanism broadcasting aging signals throughout the body,” Liu explained. 

Additionally, Liu and his team found that expressions of 48 of the proteins linked to diseases, including cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease, tissue fibrosis, and liver-related tumors, increased with age. 

“Organ aging is the essence of human chronic disease; each geriatric illness is merely a specific manifestation of this underlying organ aging,” Liu added. 

MNT had the opportunity to speak with Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about this study. 

“This study found that protein changes in the body associated with aging seem to accelerate roughly around age 50, depending on the type of body tissue. This is an interesting finding that helps us better understand the types of biochemical changes that underlie aging and potentially provide targets for therapy at different stages of someone's life.” — Cheng-Han Chen, MD

“Science is only beginning to understand the biological mechanisms involved in aging,” Chen said. “Studies like this help us to identify the basis of normal aging, and in turn provides insight into how deviations in normal biology lead to diseases such as cardiovascular disease and fatty liver disease. Ultimately, this will help us understand how to keep our patients healthy and aging well. It may also help us to develop new therapies for diseases that result from accelerated aging.” 

“Future research should attempt to expand on these findings in more diverse demographic groups and as well as in other important organs such as the brain and kidneys,” he added. 

MNT also talked to Manisha Parulekar, MD, chief of the Division of Geriatrics at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, about this research. 

“The idea that our cells lose the ability to maintain a healthy and functional proteome (the collection of proteins) is a cornerstone of modern aging theory. The accumulation of misfolded proteins, like amyloids, is the classic example, best known in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease. This study's finding of widespread amyloid accumulation across many tissues confirms that this isn't just a brain-specific problem but a systemic feature of aging.”— Manisha Parulekar, MD

“This research is about transforming medicine from a reactive, disease-focused model to a proactive, health-focused one,” she continued. “By understanding the what and the when of aging, we can develop the tools to compress morbidity — allowing people to live not just longer, but healthier and more vibrant lives.” 

“A longitudinal study, following the same individuals over decades will be helpful,” Parulekar added when asked what she would like to see as next steps for this research. “This would track their personal proteomic changes over time, allowing us to study genetic and lifestyle differences between people and providing additional confirmation for the ‘age 50 inflection point'.”

Rowan University and Sentrimed®, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing safer, orally dosed oncology therapies, today announced results from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded clinical trial evaluating MASL® in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The Company's lead product candidate, MASL, is a novel lectin-based therapeutic licensed from Rowan University. Results from this first-in-human Phase 1 trial, led by Dr. Gary Goldberg at the Rowan-Virtua School of Osteopathic Medicine and Dr. Mahnaz Fatahzadeh from the Rutgers School of Dental Medicine, were recently published in the Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology and demonstrated the potential of MASL to address critical unmet needs in the treatment of oral cancer. 

MASL is a first-in-class, orally administered therapeutic that targets podoplanin (PDPN), an oncogenic transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that is expressed on malignant cells in more than 75% of oral cancer patients. PDPN plays a key role in promoting tumor cell proliferation, migration, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. By targeting PDPN, MASL may disrupt key oncogenic signaling pathways that drive cancer progression and mortality. 

"Results from this study suggest that MASL can be developed to help treat patients with OSCC lesions," said Dr. Gary Goldberg, who has performed pioneering research on intercellular communication and its role in cancer progression, and is a Founder and Chief Scientific Officer at Sentrimed. "The single oral dose of MASL used in this study caused no adverse reactions or side effects in any patients. In addition, MASL appeared to stimulate an antitumor immune response in one out of three patients examined within 24 hours after dosing. This first-in-human study marks a significant milestone in the development of MASL and we look forward to expanding its investigation in larger clinical trials."

Ex-vivo studies using patient-derived tumor cells from this Phase 1 trial found that MASL consistently inhibited oral cancer cell viability and motility in culture. Moreover, studies with these cells also indicate that antibodies can target PDPN to selectively destroy human oral cancer cells using near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT). This research was supported by Rowan University, Rutgers University, the NIH, Sentrimed, and collaborators from the New Jersey Medical School, NCI, and Tohoku University.

A new study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health finds parents' workplace chemical exposure may be linked to a range of behavioral challenges and developmental delays in their children with autism.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is marked by challenges with social skills, communication struggles and repetitive behaviors. Autism traits can vary widely in how mild or strong they are.

"Past research explored the impact of environmental factors on the likelihood of a child developing autism," said Irva Hertz-Picciotto, a co-author and professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences and the UC Davis MIND Institute.

"This study is one of the first to connect parental job exposures to the severity of their child's autism based on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition" (ADOS-2)," Hertz-Picciotto said. "The ADOS-2 Calibrated Severity Score is considered the 'gold standard' diagnostic assessment of autism," Hertz-Picciotto said. 

Hertz-Picciotto directs the UC Davis Environmental Health Sciences Center and has led a large autism study, CHARGE (ChildHood Autism Risks from Genes and Environment), since 2002. The CHARGE study is funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. It includes children with autism or other developmental delays and children with typical development.

In collaboration with the UC Davis CHARGE Study team, researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) studied data from over 500 families in the CHARGE study. They focused entirely on children already diagnosed with autism.

Industrial hygienists assessed both mothers' and fathers' job histories from three months before pregnancy to birth. They estimated each parent's exposure to 16 chemicals or agents. This included plastics, car fluids, disinfectants, medicines and other chemicals.

They then matched the data with the children's autism severity scores (using the ADOS-2) and their behaviors, cognitive skills and daily living skills.

The researchers found these associations among children with autism:

"Our findings suggest that parental exposure to certain workplace chemicals during key fetal development periods may influence not just autism likelihood, but also severity and functioning outcomes for children with autism," said lead author Erin McCanlies, formerly with NIOSH's Health Effects Laboratory Division.

The authors noted important limitations to the study. The number of families may have been too small to find links for less common exposures. The exposure estimates relied on reported job histories and expert judgment, which might not reflect actual exposures. Lastly, while certain agents showed associations with certain autism traits, the study did not prove that those chemicals caused the traits.

The authors say more research is needed to understand how these exposures impact brain development. They also call for including fathers in similar studies on reproductive health and child neurodevelopment, as many associations in this study were linked to paternal exposures.

For instance, the strongest cognitive deficits for children with autism were linked to fathers' job exposures to plastics and polymers. These exposures correlated with significantly lower skills, including fine motor, visual reception, receptive language, and expressive language.

"This research shows that workplace safety isn't just about protecting the worker - it's also about protecting their future children," said Hertz-Picciotto. "We must consider how workplace chemicals might affect the next generation."

For more than 30 years, scientists have studied how the myogenic determination gene number 1 (MYOD) protein binds DNA to modify the gene expression of muscle stem cells. Similar to the instant kung fu education Keanu Reeves downloaded in "The Matrix," MYOD plugs into muscle stem cell DNA and reprograms the cells to build muscle.

MYOD also comes to the rescue when muscle tissue needs to be repaired after injury or to restore minor damage that occurs with athletic training or other physical activity. The transcription factor rallies nearby muscle stem cells to expand in number and become muscle cells capable of regenerating harmed muscle fibers.

Like Spiderman hiding in plain sight as the unassuming photojournalist Peter Parker, this activator of genes specific to muscle has been harboring a secret identity. Scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys and their international colleagues published findings August 6, 2025, in Genes and Development demonstrating that MYOD has its own Jekyll-and-Hyde twist, turning from a gene activator to a gene silencer.

"If you think of a cell like a house, then gene expression can be seen as the furniture that plays a major part in defining its unique identity," said Pier Lorenzo Puri, MD, professor in the Center for Cardiovascular and Muscular Diseases at Sanford Burnham Prebys and the senior and co-corresponding author of the study.

"We focus a lot on MYOD's traditional role of bringing in the new furniture appropriate for a muscle cell, but there is a critical first step of clearing out the old furniture to reset the cell's identity."

The research team examined MYOD binding events in human fibroblast cells during the process of MYOD reprogramming them into skeletal muscle cells. This experimental setting mimics the physiological process of muscle stem cells reprogramming into the myogenic lineage that occurs during muscle regeneration, and indeed the results were validated within the context of muscle regeneration following myotrauma in a mouse model. 

One-third of the binding events were found at the conventional MYOD binding sites (the myogenic E-box motifs) at regulatory elements of the genome, consistent with MYOD's traditional role as a gene activator. More than one-half of the binding events, however, occurred at the regulatory elements of downregulated genes, where DNA is packaged in such a way as to be less accessible to being transcribed into proteins, and coincided with the presence of DNA binding sites other than the E-box motifs. This finding challenges the dogma that historically restricts MYOD DNA binding properties to the E-box motifs.

Furthermore, the scientists observed that the MYOD binding events associated with gene repression were found at genes involved in cell growth, cell proliferation, cell-of-origin as well as alternative cell lineages. This observation fits into the proposed new role of MYOD as a driver of cell reprogramming by removing the cell's prior gene expression "furniture."

"We discovered that MYOD has the ability to promiscuously bind the DNA at previously unexpected places," said Puri. "These locations were occupied by transcription factors that were promoting the expression of the cell's origin lineage genes, so MYOD is binding there to erase the previous lineage prior to turning cells into the myogenic lineage."

Puri and the team see their findings as an opportunity to expand current ideas about how transcription factors operate.

"We have provided seminal evidence that the same transcriptional activator can also play a repressor role at the very beginning of the process of cell transdifferentiation or reprogramming," said Puri. "Transcription factors are way more versatile than we thought, and this newfound versatility is dictated by where and how they bind to DNA."

Puri says that the group's findings regarding cellular reprogramming may help advance efforts to develop regenerative medicine therapies and to better understand the process of cellular reprogramming itself.

"In regenerative medicine, we hope to treat certain medical conditions by turning one cell type into another, one pathological cell into one physiologically normal or even therapeutic cell," said Puri. "And now we know that an important task is the repression of the previous lineage's gene expression furniture."

Puri also emphasized MYOD's role in filtering out competing biochemical signals during cellular reprogramming.

"There are a variety of growth factors or regeneration cues that typically encounter these cells during the regeneration period," said Puri. "MYOD is able to be very selective in repressing most of the gene expression that would be activated by these cues in order to curate the proper program for building muscle."

Next, the research team plans to explore what happens when MYOD's repression of the cell's prior identity is incomplete. This phenomenon may help explain why some athlete's muscles recover better as they get older or why some people suffer from the age-related muscle mass deterioration and frailty known as sarcopenia at a younger age.

"It may be that small alterations in MYOD's silencing role are tolerated by the body but progressively impair muscle function," said Puri. "Better understanding this concept may have an enormous impact in terms of biomedical applications for regenerative and sports medicine for athletes and sarcopenia patients."

Puri shared that children suffering from muscular dystrophy experience a transition period called the honeymoon. For a length of time that varies with each child, their bodies can still deal with the disease by regenerating their muscle.

"If we can better understand this honeymoon period, then we may be able to use regenerative medicine approaches to extend it for as long as possible," said Puri.

Once viewed only as infectious invaders, bacteria are now understood to play an important role in overall health. For example, the gut microbiome-the community of microorganisms that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract-has garnered much attention recently as studies have explored its relationship with health and disease.

But what about the mouth? The mouth is the second most diverse human microbial system and, as the start of the digestive system, is directly and frequently exposed to the external environment. However, it has been vastly overshadowed by the focus on the gut.

Now, a collaborative team including Modupe O. Coker of Penn Dental Medicine has investigated the stability of the oral microbiome in children living with HIV and those exposed to the virus but uninfected. Their findings, published in Microbiome, challenge the conventional belief that a stable microbiome is important for overall health and offer insights into how early immune challenges shape not only oral health but also systemic health.

"Mouth microbes are central to health-they are the first to encounter food, promoting digestion and nutrient uptake," says Coker, assistant dean of clinical and translational research and co-senior author of the study. "But bacteria in the mouth don't stay in the mouth-they extend to the rest of the body, influencing system health and vice versa."

The researchers collected supragingival, or above the gum line, plaque samples across three time points from children in Nigeria. This included children living with HIV, children perinatally exposed to HIV but uninfected by the virus, and children not exposed to and therefore uninfected by the virus. All children living with HIV were receiving highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) at the time of the study.

"This population is near and dear to us all," says Coker, adding that studying these groups of children offers the opportunity to better understand how challenges to the immune system early in life affect the oral microbiome and how that, in turn, affects other measures of development like growth and cognitive function.

The research team mapped the spatial (front-to-back) distribution of the microbial communities in the mouth and determined the association of HIV status and cavity- or caries-related bacterial species and intraspecies variants. They also calculated the degree of taxonomic turnover across the three time points within each group.

"[Taxonomic turnover] is measuring the entire microbial community at one time and then [measuring] the same community at a separate time and seeing how divergent they are from each other," explains Allison E. Mann, an assistant professor of biological anthropology at the University of Wyoming and the first author on the study. "The more divergent, the higher the taxonomic turnover or volatility, and the less, the lower."

In the gut, continues Mann, taxonomic stability over time is good, "that's what you want in the gut."

But, as this study showed, the opposite was true in the mouth-children unexposed and therefore uninfected by HIV exhibited higher turnover over time than those who had been exposed to HIV, suggesting, says Mann, that the oral microbiomes of children exposed to HIV might be less able to adapt to changes in environmental conditions or "disruptions."

"The idea is that because the oral microbiome has evolved to be able to live in our mouths and is obviously just constantly being bombarded with food and the like-it's evolved a different strategy than the gut, which is relatively protected," says Mann. "It has evolved to fluctuate and adapt to changing situations."

"This seems very reasonable," says Coker. "The children in this study are in their adolescence, experiencing a lot of changes in their bodies [such as] developmental and hormonal changes, including being in a mixed dentition phase where they have primary teeth along with permanent teeth. We expect the microbiome to change, so when it doesn't, that signals impaired adaptability. The fact that [the supragingival plaque microbiome] is more stable in children living with HIV actually makes sense."

Additionally, Coker adds, lower turnover was associated with higher frequencies of those groups of bacteria that cause cavities, increasing the risk of caries in this population.

The study also showed that the microbial communities in children exposed to and infected by HIV were more homogeneous-the bacterial clusters in the front, or anterior, of the mouth were similar to those in the back, or posterior-than in children unexposed to HIV.

"In normal circumstances, there are quite distinct differences between the front and the back of the mouth," says Vincent P. Richards, an associate professor of biological sciences at Clemson University and co-senior author of the study. "And in kids living with HIV, that's destroyed."

This is important, he adds, because it gets researchers closer to understanding the mechanism underlying these changes and their outcomes. "This tells us that the virus might be differentially affecting different glands and ducts differently," he says, referring to how perinatal HIV exposure without infection as well as HIV infection and associated treatment have been linked to decreased salivary flow, and how saliva from children living with HIV presents as more acidic.

As Coker explains, these results give a clue into the broader question of how an early-life disruption to systemic health-such as prenatal exposure to HIV-can impact the oral microbiome.

"We know that oral microbes affect systemic health," she says. "But systemic health also shapes oral health, so there is a cyclical relationship. And as an epidemiologist and translational scientist, I hope we can keep looking at novel ways to use this information to understand disease and to possibly prevent or treat it."

Fighting off pathogens is a tour de force that must happen with speed and precision. A team of researchers at CeMM and MedUni Vienna led by Christoph Bock and Matthias Farlik has investigated how macrophages-immune cells that are the body's first responders-master this challenge. Their study, published in Cell Systems (DOI: 10.1016/j.cels.2025.101346), offers a time-resolved analysis of the molecular processes that unfold when these cells encounter various pathogens. They developed a new method that combines gene editing and machine learning, which identified key regulators of macrophage immune responses.

Macrophages (Greek for "big eaters") deserve their name: their job is to recognize invading pathogens such as bacteria or viruses, engulf them and break them down into their biochemical building blocks. Macrophages are also messengers: they release various signals to recruit other immune cells, trigger inflammation, and present digested fragments of pathogens on their surface, guiding the adaptive immune system to develop long-term immunity.

Macrophages encountering a pathogen are under immense pressure. If they react too late or not decisively enough, an infection may become fatal. But an overshooting immune response is equally damaging. Within a very short time, a tailored immune response must be initiated: cascades of biochemical reactions triggered, thousands of genes activated, and an arsenal of substances produced-each response tailored to the specific pathogen encountered.

To understand how macrophages coordinate this multitude of tasks, the team led by Christoph Bock (CeMM Principal Investigator and Professor at MedUni Vienna) and Matthias Farlik (Principal Investigator at the MedUni Vienna) exposed macrophages from mice to various immune stimuli that mimic bacterial or viral infections. They tracked the changes inside the cells by measuring gene activity and DNA accessibility every few hours, establishing a molecular timeline of how the regulatory programs unfold step by step.

Next, the team identified regulatory proteins that orchestrate these programs, using CRISPR genome editing to produce hundreds of gene knockouts and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the genetically perturbed cells. This innovative method uncovered a network of several dozen regulators that share the responsibility of triggering the most appropriate immune response. The identified regulators include many "usual suspects" such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, but also splicing factors and chromatin regulators whose role in immune regulation is not well understood.

It is impressive how much complexity there is in this ancient part of our immune system, which we share with sponges, jellyfish and corals. Thanks to the advances in CRISPR screening technology, we can systematically study the underlying regulatory programs."

In this review, the authors present recent findings that uncover a previously unappreciated nuclear signaling hub: the PIPn-p53 signalosome. This complex not only modulates AKT activation within the nucleus but also integrates two major oncogenic pathways-p53 dysregulation and PI3K-AKT amplification-into a unified mechanism driving cancer cell migration and invasion.

Key points of the review include:

This review highlights the nuclear PIPn-p53 signalosome as a central regulator of cancer cell motility and a promising target for metastasis therapy. The work entitled "The Nuclear Phosphoinositide-p53 Signalosome in the Regulation of Cell Motility" was published in Protein & Cell (Advance access May 26, 2025).

Manchester City midfielder Rodri will be absent until mid-September after picking up a ‘big injury' at the Club World Cup, Pep Guardiola has confirmed.

The Ballon d'Or winner, 29, missed most of last season after rupturing his ACL, returning to action with an eight-minute cameo in City's penultimate Premier League outing.

He appeared in all four of City's Club World Cup matches, starting just once, but suffered an injury setback as the Sky Blues were dumped out of the competition by Saudi outfit Al Hilal in the round of 16.

He came off the bench with 53 minutes played to replace Ilkay Gundogan, but was withdrawn again in extra time with an apparent groin injury.

Speaking from City's pre-season training camp, Guardiola said he would be out for several weeks.

"Rodri is getting better but he had a big injury in the last game against Al Hilal,” he said. 

“He has trained better in the last few days, hopefully after the international break is when he will be really fit.

"Hopefully in these games he can play some minutes but what is important is he doesn't have pain because we don't want this Rodri coming back injured.

"We try desperately to avoid that. He has been training the last two sessions with us and that's good."

Rodri joins Phil Foden, Josko Gvardiol, and Claudio Echeverri in the physio's room at City. None of the four have travelled to Italy for Saturday's friendly clash with Palermo.

Guardiola's midfield options are running thin, with Mateo Kovacic and Kalvin Phillips also both dealing with injuries. Nico O'Reilly, who signed a bumper City contract last week, has a knock, but travelled for the Palermo match.

FIFA are set to make a major change to the Club World Cup which could impact 10 different clubs.

The inaugural revamped Club World Cup took place over the summer, with Chelsea thrashing PSG 4-0 in the final.

They were classed by FIFA as the first-ever Club World Cup champions, despite the tournament having been held since 2000.

Advert

Manchester United, Liverpool, Real Madrid and AC Milan are now among the clubs who are not featured on the Club World Cup roll of honour.

Unlike in other tournaments, Chelsea were not automatically given a spot in the 2029 Club World Cup as the reigning champions.

Four clubs have already earned the right to play in the next competition, with PSG, Cruz Azul, Al Ahli and Pyramids winning their respective continental cups this year.

But according to The Times, FIFA are considering a significant change to the competition for next season.

They will consider whether to increase the maximum limit of two clubs per country that can qualify for the Club World Cup ahead of the period leading up to 2029.

Advert

That includes whether Chelsea, as reigning champions, will indeed be given an opportunity to defend their crown.

FIFA leaders are said to have been 'frustrated' that the likes of Liverpool, Barcelona and Napoli - all domestic champions - were not present in the United States this summer amid suggestions that the winners of domestic leagues in England, Spain and Italy should have been permitted to enter.

In such a scenario, it appears likely that the champions of France and Germany would also be invited in the scenario that they hadn't already qualified.

Such a rule change would likely cause an increase in teams from 32 to 48, a decision which reportedly would be opposed by UEFA.

Advert

And while that rule would affect the aforementioned six clubs, it would also impact the four clubs that have qualified in terms of the format they must plan to compete in during the 2029 competition.

The new Club World Cup received a mixed reaction from fans, with empty seats clearly visible for most matches not involving Real Madrid.

There were also question marks surrounding the scheduling of the tournament during most competing teams' summer breaks.

Advert

Unsurprisingly, FIFA president Gianni Infantino wasn't having any of that and declared the Club World Cup to be 'the most successful club competition in the world'.

He said: "The golden era of global club football has started. We can say definitely that this FIFA Club World Cup has been a huge, huge, huge success.

"Of course, there are a lot of positives, some negatives. It has been successful. We have had over 2.5 million in the stadium. We generated over $2 billion in revenue with this competition. There is no other cup competition in the world that comes close to $33m per match."

The 34-year-old, remembered as one of the defining figures of City's dominant era, was spotted walking through the Etihad Campus, exchanging warm greetings and laughter with familiar faces.

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has confirmed Rodri will miss the start of the new Premier League season as he continues to recover from the injury he suffered at the Club World Cup.

Rodri missed the majority of the 2024–25 season after suffering a gruesome knee injury in the opening weeks of the campaign. After a seven-minute cameo towards the end of the Premier League season, the Ballon d'Or winner played four times at the Club World Cup and was widely praised for offering some stability to Guardiola's side after a disappointing campaign.

Unfortunately for Rodri, he left the tournament with another injury. Brought off the bench in the last 16 against Al Hilal, he had to be removed in extra time after picking up a groin problem which Guardiola has now suggested may have been serious.

“Rodri is getting better but he had a big injury in the last game against Al Hilal,” Guardiola revealed. “He has trained better in the last few days, hopefully after the [September] international break is when he will be really fit.

“Hopefully in these games he can play some minutes but what is important is he doesn't have pain because we don't want this Rodri coming back injured.

“We try desperately to avoid that. He has been training the last two sessions with us and that's good.”

Fortunately for City, they play just three Premier League games before the season pauses for international action.

Guardiola's side open the season away to Wolverhampton Wanderers before a tough visit from Tottenham Hotspur, and they will head into the international break after an away trip to Brighton & Hove Albion.

City will be desperate to welcome Rodri back into the fold upon their return to domestic action. They host the derby against Manchester United on September 13, and a trip to Arsenal is on the calendar eight days later.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Kansas City is recruiting 6,000 volunteers to serve as ambassadors for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with roles ranging from greeting visitors at arrival points, providing directions and streetcar tips.

While people can already sign up, the official application period will open in the upcoming weeks. 

On September 15, the application portal closes. 

David Winslow is a special education teacher. He usually has the summer off, but he is excited about a chance next year to volunteer during the FIFA World Cup. 

“Wouldn't you want to be part of something in this area, especially something that may not happen again?” Winslow said. “It is going to be pretty neat. It's exciting to see it happen.”

He is among 10,000 people who have already shown interest in volunteering.

Organizers hope to recruit an additional 5,000 volunteers before the registration deadline.

Their target is to have 6,000 volunteers for next summer.

“I don't know that I want to be a parking lot attendant," Winslow said. "I'd prefer maybe guiding people to certain areas. I'm not sure.” 

According to KC 2026 CEO Pam Kramer, this is the only opportunity to sign up.

“Volunteers will really be our ambassadors to the world,” she said.

The volunteers will undergo training and background checks. 

Interviews will be conducted in October. Applicants must be at least 18 years old. 

“The chance to be part of the biggest event to ever happen in the region is worth signing up for,” Kramer said.

There are other perks — volunteers will receive an 11-piece kit from Adidas, including shoes.

They also will get meals, breaks, drinks, and additional rewards.  

“We can't host the World Cup without the volunteers, and the volunteer experience is the way for people here to engage with the World Cup,” Kramer said.

For Winslow, volunteering represents a welcome change to his routine.

"It will be a nice change before I go back to school in the fall," he said.

MASON, OH − The main draw of the Cincinnati Open continues Aug. 9 from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

After a combined four days of qualifying and first-round matches, some of the top stars from the ATP and WTA tours will be in action in Mason as the Round of 64 begins Aug. 9.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time updates on the second round from both tours.

A sold-out crowd in Mason will see some of the best players in the world Aug. 9.

Starting on Center Court, World No. 3 Iga Swiatek will face Anastasia Potapova. Swiatek lost just one set on her way to a Wimbledon singles title in July.

Fellow Wimbledon champion and World No. 1 Jannik Sinner wraps up the day session on Center Court against qualifier Daniel Elahi Galan.

Center Court will also feature reigning Cincinnati Open champion and WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka against former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.

Cincinnati native Peyton Stearns, coming off her first career main draw win at her hometown tournament, will face Anna Kalinskaya to open the night session.

American Taylor Fritz, the No. 4 seed in the men's tourney, will wrap up the night on Center Court against qualifier Emilio Nava. Amanda Anisimova, the women's Wimbledon runner-up and No. 5 seed here, will play the final match of the night in the women's draw, facing qualifier Leolia Jeanjean.

The full order of play for Aug. 9 can be found here.

Jannik Sinner, the Wimbledon champion and World No. 1, rolled over qualifier Daniel Elahi Galan, 6-1, 6-1. Sinner won 57 points only 27 for his opponent, and had 20 winners to eight for Galan as the match ended in 59 minutes. Sinner will next play the winner of today's later match between No. 30 seed Gabriel Diallo and Sebastian Baez.

Felix Auger-Aliassime, the No. 23 seed in the ATP men's draw, won his round of 64 match over Tomas Martin Etcheverry, 6-2, 7-6(3). The Frenchman, World No. 28, advanced to the quarterfinals in Mason in 2021 and 2022, and to the round of 16 last year.

Stefanos Tsitsipas, the No. 25 seed, defeated Fabian Marozsan of Hungary, 7-6(3), 6-2. Tsitsipas, 26, from Greece, was 2022 runner-up in Mason and a two-time semifinalist before that. He lost in the round of 32 last year. Tsitsipas, who has 12 career titles, plays Benjamin Bonzi in the third round.

Jessica Bouzas Maneiro upset No. 21 seed Leylah Fernandez in the round of 64, 6-3, 6-3. Maneiro, a Spaniard and World No. 42, advances to the round of 32 here for the second straight year.

American Tommy Paul, the No. 13 seed, rolled through his first match in Mason, 6-2, 6-2, over Pedro Martinez of Spain on Center Court. He will play the winner of today's later match between No. 19 seed Tomas Machac and qualifier Adrian Mannarino. Paul improved to 6-6 all-time in Mason. He lost to Carlos Alcaraz in three sets in the 2023 round of 16.

Two of the top 11 seeds were knocked off in three sets to start play in the men's draw in the round of 64.

No. 8 seed Lorenzo Musetti lost to Benjamin Bonzi of France, 5-7, 6-4, 7-6(4). Bonzi, World No. 63, lost in the first round in Mason in 2022.

No. 11 seed Casper Ruud lost to Arthur Rinderknech of France, 6-7(5), 6-4, 6-2. Rinderknech, World. 70, is making his Cincinnati debut.

American Alex Michelsen, the No. 28 seed, prevented a French sweep of seeded players in the opening set of matches. He defeated Corentin Moutet of France, also in three sets, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. Michelsen, coming off a quarterfinal appearance in Toronto, plays Holger Rune in the third round. Michelsen lost to Jannik Sinner in the round of 32 here in Mason last year.

In the start of women's doubles action, Magda Linette and Clara Tauson won in three sets over Tereza Mihalikova and Olivia Nicholls, 4-6, 6-2, 10-7.

The No. 2 seed, Gabriela Dabrowski of Canada and Erin Routliffe of New Zealand, defeated Su-Wei Hsieh and Ena Shibahara, 7-5, 7-5.

Guiliana Olmos and Aldila Sutjiadi defeated Americans Emma Navarro and Margaret Navarro, 6-2, 6-3.

The first upset of the day has happened. Aoi Ito, who reached the main draw through the qualifiers, knocked off No. 27 seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the round of 64, 6-1, 4-6, 6-4. Ito broke her opponent's serve in the last game to end the match. Ito, a 21-year old from Japan and World No. 94, has advanced to the round of 32 for the second straight tournament from the qualifiers after doing so in Montreal. She will next face the winner of today's match between No. 6 seed Madison Keys and Eva Lys.

Holger Rune, the No. 7 seed and World No. 9, outlasted Roman Safiullin in the round of 64, 7-5, 7-6(5). In the second-set tiebreak, Rune persevered after his opponent got a lucky bounce off the net to tie the break at 5-5. Rune won the next point on serve, then broke Safiullin's serve on the next point to end the match.

Rune, 22, was a semifinalist at the Cincinnati Open last year. He advances to the round of 32 where he will face the winner of the ongoing match between No. 28 seed Alex Michelsen and Corentin Moutet.

Iga Swiatek, World No. 3 and the 2025 Wimbledon champion, defeated Anastasia Potapova, 6-1, 6-4. Leading the second set 5-4 and on serve, Swiatek fought off three break points and ended the match on her second match point. Swiatek had 17 winners to only four for her opponent.

"I really wanted to be solid, but pretty intense, on the other hand," Swiatek said in an oncourt interview. "It was a little bit up and down in (the) second set, but in important moments, I got my level up. First match of the tournament is always tricky and I'm happy that I'm gonna have a chance to play another one."

Swiatek will face No. 25 seed Marta Kostyuk in the next round. They played in the round of 16 here in Mason last year, with Swiatek winning, 6-2, 6-2. Swiatek is 3-0 against Kostyuk.

Marta Kostyuk, the No. 25 seed, is the day's first player to advance to round three. She rolled past Tatjana Maria 6-0, 6-1 in the WTA round of 64.

Kostyuk, 23, from Ukraine and World No. 27, is coming off a quarterfinal appearance in Montreal. She reached the round of 16 last year in Mason, losing to Iga Swiatek. Kostyuk has a rematch with Swiatek in the next round.

The Enquirer will update this story.

Singita Serengeti House

Singita Serengeti House in the Singita Grumeti Reserve in Tanzania includes a private hard court and tennis pavilion with uninterrupted views across the surrounding plains. Wildlife frequently moves through the area, offering guests the rare experience of spotting animals while on the court. The layout allows for tennis to be worked naturally into the rhythm of the day, whether played between game drives or in the late afternoon before gathering for dinner.

Following a recent refurbishment, Serengeti House now features warm textures, natural materials, and pieces that draw from the surrounding environment, creating a calm and cohesive atmosphere throughout. The villa is designed for exclusive-use stays and includes four spacious suites with private terraces and outdoor showers, along with indoor and outdoor communal areas that include a fitness center, media room, family kitchen, and wellness treatment space.

The Reserve Grace Bay

The Reserve at Grace Bay by Beach Enclave in Turks and Caicos offers guests private hard courts just steps from Grace Bay Beach within an exclusive-use sports facility, available exclusively to guests staying at one of the Reserve's three villas. The two courts are equipped with lighting for evening play and a shaded pavilion nearby for breaks between matches. Guests can schedule lessons, use ball machines, or set up casual tournaments, with equipment available throughout their stay.

The courts are part of a larger program of activity that includes a 4,500 square foot golf-green complex, padel and pickleball courts, beach volleyball, basketball, and a 24-hour fitness center. Each of the three beachfront villas includes seven bedrooms, indoor and outdoor living areas, a rooftop terrace, and a private infinity-edge pool.

After time on the courts, recovery begins at waldSPA Health, Forsthofgut's integrative wellness center focused on preventative medicine.

Guests can book cryotherapy, osteopathy, physiotherapy, and massage therapy, with consultations available from an in-house doctor and nutritionist. Recovery continues in the waldSPA's nature-infused thermal areas, which include a Finnish sauna with panoramic mountain views, a forest-view onsen, and a heated lake pool with an indoor-outdoor connection.

Tucked along the Tuscan coast, Forte dei Marmi has long been a haven where time slows and local traditions endure. One such tradition is tennis, one of the most popular sports in Forte dei Marmi, with the town boasting the highest number of tennis courts by territorial extension in Italy. At Pensione America, Collezione Em's new adults-only retreat just steps from the beach, tennis is built into the experience.

The boutique hotel is home to Tennis Club Roma, one of Forte's most iconic and oldest clubs now protected as part of the town's cultural heritage.

Ben Shelton will aim for his first Grand Slam singles title when he competes at the US Open this year.

The 22-year-old will be full of confidence, as Shelton won his first Masters 1000 title by defeating Karen Khachanov to win the Canadian Open.

Shelton will have another chance at glory before arriving in New York, as he is set to compete at the ongoing Cincinnati Open.

But a singles title is not the only trophy Shelton can win at the US Open, as he is set to play alongside Taylor Townsend in the revamped mixed doubles competition.

For 2025 the US Open revamped their mixed doubles tournament by making some changes never seen before in the format.

It will now be held in what is known as ‘Fan Week' rather than alongside the men and women's singles and doubles events.

The size of the field will decrease from 32 to 16 teams, featuring the best ATP and WTA singles players, and during the first three rounds.

Teams will need to win four games to win a set, while the final will be played with regular six-game sets. One pairing sees Shelton team up with Townsend, and the All-American pair are looking forward to competing for the title.

“This kind of sums up what we were doing at the Open that year, which was basically Taylor putting the team on her back, hitting all the hot shots,” Shelton said via the US Open's social media accounts.

“We had some really cool celebrations, I think that's what you can expect again. It was packed every time we were playing at The Open, so I hope it's the same [[this year]. I know it's in the pre-week this year, but I think it will be a lot of fun, a lot of the same.

“It's a great player field, but whenever I have Taylor on my team I like my chances in mixed doubles. She's the best mixed doubles player in the world so I think we have got a good shot.”

Shelton and Townsend played doubles together on one previous occasion.

That took place at the 2023 US Open, when Shelton was just 20 years of age and they produced a strong start to their campaign.

Shelton and Townsend defeated the fourth seeded team of Luisa Stefani and Joe Salisbury in straight sets, before overcoming Aldila Sutjiadi and Rohan Bopanna 6-2, 7-5.

The US duo eased past Demi Schuurs and Hugo Nys to reach the semi-finals, before they lost a deciding match tiebreak to Jessica Pegula and Austin Krajicek.

Reuniting after two years, both players have developed since then and they will be one of the stronger teams heading into the new mixed doubles event at the US Open.

The coach of 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina has been cleared by the WTA Tour to return from his suspension for a potential breach of its code of conduct.

Stefano Vukov was provisionally suspended in January while the tour conducted an investigation. It announced in February that had been completed and that the ban remained in place, without saying how long it would last.

The organization said Friday that Vukov would again be permitted to receive credentials allowing him access to player areas and practice courts at its events.

“The WTA is fully committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all athletes and other participants, as set out in our WTA Code of Conduct and Safeguarding Code,” the tour said in a statement. “Any sanctions issued following a breach of these safeguarding rules are carefully considered and are subject to appeal before an independent tribunal. While case details remain confidential, we can confirm that Mr. Vukov is eligible to receive credentials at WTA events.”

The New York Times first reported that Vukov's ban had been lifted.

Rybakina announced before last year's U.S. Open that Vukov would no longer be her coach, but then said before the Australian Open that he would be rejoining her team. She insisted that he had never mistreated her during their time working together.

Rybakina, ranked No. 10 on the WTA Tour, just reached the semifinals of the National Bank Open in Montreal before losing to Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko, the eventual champion.

Today, world No. 1 Jannik Sinner will play his opening match of the Cincinnati Open after defeating Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon men's singles final on Jul. 13.

After receiving a first-round bye in Cincinnati, Sinner, who enters the tournament as the defending champion, will collide with 29-year-old Colombian standout Daniel Elahi Galan today in the Round of 64.

Ahead of the match, here are all the necessary details on how you can watch:

Tennis Channel can be accessed via live-TV streaming platforms such as Hulu TV, YouTube TV, DirecTV, FuboTV, Sling TV, and more, as well as traditional cable providers.

Interested fans can also subscribe to Tennis Channel directly via TennisChannel.com, which allows users to watch every ATP & WTA Masters 1000 tournament, as well as numerous ATP/WTA 500 and 250 tournaments.

At the time of publication, Tennis Channel is advertising monthly packages starting at $9.99/month, and an annual plan costing $109.99.

 

Heading into his opening match of the Cincinnati Open, Jannik Sinner is coming to a pivotal point in the season that will see him look to defend 3,000 ranking points.

After narrowly conceding the Roland Garros final to Carlos Alcaraz in early June, Sinner bounced back with a remarkable Wimbledon run that saw him win his first title at SW19 just weeks after tasting defeat at the French Open.

Ahead of the start of the Cincinnati Open, the world No. 1 reflected on his win over Alcaraz during a pre-tournament sit-down with Tennis TV:

“It has been an incredible journey for me. Especially what happened the tournament before, trying to understand what I did, not wrong, but king of what I could improve and I finally did it. So I'm very happy, but in another way it has been amazing to see my family there, my brother, the people I really love which I saw after the tournament. It was such a nice atmosphere, but it happened already, we are here in Cincinnati, we try to get ready.”

As Sinner went on to note, in recent weeks, the hot, humid, conditions throughout the North American hard court swing have proven to be difficult for players.

 

During Jannik Sinner's Round of 16 match against Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon, the world No. 1 took an awkward fall that saw him land directly on his elbow.

While there was initially some concern about a potential injury, and the Italian star underwent an MRI mid-tournament, he overcame any lingering pain to defeat Ben Shelton in the quarterfinals just two days later.

Following his championship run at Wimbledon, Sinner assured members of the press that his elbow is 100% ahead of his opening match in Cincinnati, explaining that his decision to wear an arm sleeve in practice has nothing to do with a lingering injury.

“The elbow is good. Today was the first time that I put a sleeve on because I liked the feeling of the sleeve. It gives a little bit more impact with the ball, it's slightly more stable. That's my point of view and I liked it in Wimbledon. I have to see how it is when it's very hot and humid, because it's a little bit different, so it's going to be something that I'm going to take into consideration, but I really love the feeling it gives of pure striking.”

You can see his comments at the 5:55 mark of the video below.

The four-time Grand Slam winner grew visibly frustrated during the lopsided third set, and appeared emotional throughout the trophy ceremony.“I don't really want to take up too much time, so I'll say thank you to everyone,” Osaka said, holding back tears. “Thank you to my team, thank you to the organizers and all the volunteers. I hope you guys had a good night.”Osaka skipped her post-match press conference, later apologizing in a WTA transcript: “I think Victoria played really well,” she said in a transcript provided by the WTA. “I completely forgot to congratulate her on court. Yeah, I mean, she did really amazing.” By then, her 16-second speech had gone viral, sparking debate online.

The four-time Grand Slam winner grew visibly frustrated during the lopsided third set, and appeared emotional throughout the trophy ceremony.“I don't really want to take up too much time, so I'll say thank you to everyone,” Osaka said, holding back tears. “Thank you to my team, thank you to the organizers and all the volunteers. I hope you guys had a good night.”Osaka skipped her post-match press conference, later apologizing in a WTA transcript: “I think Victoria played really well,” she said in a transcript provided by the WTA. “I completely forgot to congratulate her on court. Yeah, I mean, she did really amazing.” By then, her 16-second speech had gone viral, sparking debate online.

On Friday, after announcing her withdrawal from the Cincinnati Open, Osaka also took to Threads to address the incident:“Thanks Montreal it's been a really great run,” Osaka wrote. “I also want to say sorry and congratulations to Victoria. You played a great match and have an amazing career ahead!“I didn't congratulate you on court. Honestly I was in a daze and I was so focused on not having the same speech as IW 2018 finals or the Jenny/Jennifer situation (at the 2021 Australian Open) that I tried to make my speech as short as possible.“Thanks everyone for the week, see you in NY.”Osaka's post made references to her previous endearingly awkward trophy ceremony gaffes over the years. At Indian Wells in 2018, Osaka nervously rambled and giggled through what she called “the worst acceptance speech of all time” after winning her first WTA title. In 2021, after beating Jennifer Brady in the Australian Open final, she famously asked her opponent, “Do you like to be called Jenny or Jennifer?” Brady replied “Jenny”, but Osaka immediately began her speech with, "Firstly I want to congratulate Jennifer…”“Omg no,” Osaka later wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “I promise you my mind thought I called her Jenny in that moment and I was so confused why the crowd was laughing. I'm so sorry.”

Mboko, meanwhile, appeared completely unfazed by the Montreal incident.“I didn't really get a chance to speak with her after the game, but I mean, I was kind of really caught up in everything that was happening after the match,” she said in her post-match press conference.“If that was her wishes, then I respect it as well. I mean, I still think Naomi is an incredible player, and it doesn't ever change what I think of her. I think she's still a really nice girl. I still look up to her.“Nothing really changes after the match. I mean, I'm really happy that I was able to win today, but I mean, to play against her was also a really special moment for me.”

Jim Courier has admitted that he's really excited to watch one American talent play at the Cincinnati Open and beyond this year.

And, in his opinion, fans of the sport should be too.

After all, in his eyes, he has an intriguing, ‘unorthodox' play style that should capture attention regardless of whether he wins or loses.

Fortunately for the player in question, he has been winning far more often throughout 2025, finally enjoying a period of stability after his form and fitness had failed him.

Battling through suspension too, the US Open could provide the perfect platform for Jenson Brooksby to shine.

Speaking live on Tennis Channel ahead of his tough Cincinnati Open first-round match, Jim Courier was effusive in his praise for the 24-year-old.

It was soon justified, as he rallied to win in three sets against a solid opponent, Alexandre Muller.

Regardless of how the match would have gone, his claims would have remained valid, as he noted: “It's amazing. Ranked right around 100 in the world right now, already a titleist this year as a qualifier, won the title in Houston, and then qualified and made another final for good measure in Eastbourne on the grass, where Taylor Fritz stopped him. So it's been wonderful to see Jensen really get back in business. 

“The two wrist surgeries on both wrists, the unfortunate suspension, and now back, befuddling opponents with his really unorthodox game, so fun to see. 

“And there's some new wrinkles too. He's worked a lot on his service motion. We'll get into more detail on that as we go. But he's someone to cheer for, in my opinion.”

Although Courier may be excited by Brooksby, he is one of a deep pool of American talent on the ATP.

It's a testament to this depth in quality that he is the 15th-highest ranked from the US.

Naturally, the likes of Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe make up the apex of that list, with stars like Learner Tien, Brandon Nakashima and Alex Michelsen just behind them, ranked between 30th and 50th in the world.

Shelton became the youngest American since Pete Sampras to achieve a huge feat in Toronto earlier this week, as he beat Fritz, his fellow American.

Maros Giron is just outside of that, whilst Aleksandar Kovačević and Reilly Opelka are 68th and 69th, respectively.

Ethan Quinn, Sebastian Korda, Emilio Nava and Mackenzie McDonald make up the final four Americans who are all higher ranked than Brooksby.

Hopefully, that can change in the coming months.

John Isner was able to go toe-to-toe against some of the all-time greats during his career on the ATP Tour. 

Isner played and defeated each member of the ‘big three', earning victories over Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. 

The American also faced off against Grand Slam champions such as Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka, as well as some of the new generation, having had three meetings with current world number one Jannik Sinner. 

There was one ATP star, however, Isner faced several times on the tour, whose name he just hated seeing in a tournament draw. 

When asked on the ‘Nothing Major Podcast' who he hated playing against, he answered: “I am going to say two, [Jeremy] Chardy and Gilles Muller. I didn't necessarily dislike playing Chardy; he just always beat me.

“But Muller was always a nightmare because, of course, we were going to play tight matches.

“I think if I had to choose one I mean because of my record it has got to be Chardy.”

Former US player Sam Querrey responded: “For me, it was [Adrian] Mannarino early. I was 0-4 against him. But then I flipped the switch, but he was my guy.”

Though Isner didn't like playing Gilles Muller, he managed to finish his career with a winning record of 4-2 against him. 

He won their first two bouts in 2010 and 2011, which both came in Atlanta, before beating him again in Memphis the next year. 

In their first and only clash at a Grand Slam, Muller came out on top, defeating Isner at the 2015 Australian Open in straight sets to advance to the fourth round. 

The Luxembourger followed it up with a win at Queen's in 2016, before the two faced off for a final time in 2017. 

Isner emerged victorious in their last clash, overcoming Muller in the semifinal in Atlanta.

When the stars of the ATP Tour arrive at tournaments throughout the world, they often are fully focused on tennis. But at the Cincinnati Open, there has been a lot of discussion unrelated to forehands and backhands. 

Everyone is raving about the $260 million transformation of the Lindner Family Tennis Center, the home of the season's seventh ATP Masters 1000 event.

“It's amazing. I was talking with all the players and it's actually very strange for us to come to a venue where everything was new,” said Jannik Sinner, the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, in his pre-tournament roundtable. “It's amazing what they did in one year. Everything has improved so, so much, but mostly the space we have for us players.

“There are huge things inside and also outdoors. Indoors the dining area is much, much bigger and when you come from the transportation, it's like a hotel kind of, so it's amazing. Incredible. I feel very happy and honoured to have this kind of revolution because it's something great for us and our sport.”

That has been the sentiment shared by the whole locker room. Tournament organisers completely overhauled the facility, adding a new player building with state-of-the-art dining and lounge spaces, with indoor and outdoor spaces to relax, a coffee bar, giant televisions, padel courts, backyard games and plenty more.

“To be honest it's impressive,” second seed Carlos Alcaraz told the media. “The space that we have right now for women, for ourselves, I think it's great. I felt like I'm new, [like] it was my first year. I think it's what we needed and we're feeling great right now with the new everything.”

The 2019 Cincinnati Open champion, Daniil Medvedev, added to ATP Media: “Whenever any tournament makes a big improvement for players — for fans also, but I can only talk as a player — it's always a benefit.

“It's great that they try to do better and it's a great tournament. I've always loved it and now it's even better, so it's great to see.”

Andrey Rublev, a finalist at the tournament in 2021, noted that he was happy with the experience in Cincinnati to begin with. The event is just at a new level following the transformation.

“Cincinnati showed really huge improvement in one year,” Rublev told ATPTour.com. “But to be fair, for me in Cincinnati [there] were always good conditions. Even last year with everything in terms of space, in terms of lockers, in terms of some activities, lounges, I felt it was on a good level.”



World No. 144 Daniel Elahi Galan, who will take on Sinner Monday in Cincinnati, is competing in his third ATP Masters 1000 event of the season and has been “super happy” with his experience. One thing he pointed to is the abundance of practice courts — in the southern section of the venue alone there is a new block of 10 courts with seating for fans. There are 31 outdoor courts total, up from 17 in 2023.

“I hope every tournament goes this far to make changes, to improve everything, to make us feel very comfortable. Super good,” Galan said. “We have enough courts that we don't have to share… The food, I'm vegetarian and it's been very good actually, which is not normal at every tournament. That's something also to be happy about.”

A constant for players has been a smile on their faces. Whether enjoying a coffee, a game with friends or simply relaxing, many have compared the player building in particular to a hotel. French doubles player Sadio Doumbia compared it to an amusement park.

“For me, this is like Disneyland for tennis players,” Doumbia said. “You have everything you want. The food is very good, the gym is perfect and it's beautiful. We just arrived today and I'm having a blast. My coach is so excited, I'm so excited. It feels like Disneyland for me.”

World No. 144 Daniel Elahi Galan, who will take on Sinner Monday in Cincinnati, is competing in his third ATP Masters 1000 event of the season and has been “super happy” with his experience. One thing he pointed to is the abundance of practice courts — in the southern section of the venue alone there is a new block of 10 courts with seating for fans. There are 31 outdoor courts total, up from 17 in 2023.

“I hope every tournament goes this far to make changes, to improve everything, to make us feel very comfortable. Super good,” Galan said. “We have enough courts that we don't have to share… The food, I'm vegetarian and it's been very good actually, which is not normal at every tournament. That's something also to be happy about.”

A constant for players has been a smile on their faces. Whether enjoying a coffee, a game with friends or simply relaxing, many have compared the player building in particular to a hotel. French doubles player Sadio Doumbia compared it to an amusement park.

“For me, this is like Disneyland for tennis players,” Doumbia said. “You have everything you want. The food is very good, the gym is perfect and it's beautiful. We just arrived today and I'm having a blast. My coach is so excited, I'm so excited. It feels like Disneyland for me.”

The finalists of the Roland Garros Junior Series by Renault – Qualifications West and Central Asia have been determined in Almaty, Kazinform News Agency cites the Kazakhstan Tennis Federation.

In the first semifinal, Yerkezhan Zhanatayeva faced Turkmenistan's Ilima Guseynova. The Kazakh player took the opening set 6-1. In the second set, Guseynova broke early to lead 3-0, but Zhanatayeva quickly broke back, leveled the score, and turned the match in her favor to seal victory 6-3.

The second semifinal saw an all-Kazakh clash between Alissa Korolyova and Adiya Omarbek. Korolyova claimed the first set in a tiebreak 7-6 (7-3), but Omarbek fought back with determination, winning the next two sets 6-3, 6-1.

As a result, Zhanatayeva and Omarbek will meet in the tournament final. Regardless of the outcome, both players have already secured their spots in the final stage of the Roland Garros Junior Series by Renault qualifications in Japan.

As reported earlier, world No. 12 Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan has secured a spot in the semifinals of the WTA 1000 Omnium Banque Nationale in Montreal.

Emma Raducanu is scheduled for a rematch with Aryna Sabalenka following the Wimbledon drama that left the British star in tears. Up next for Raducanu is the Cincinnati Open, where she has received a bye in the first round and will face either Katie Boulter or Olga Danilovic in the second round.

Provided she passes that test, she is likely to face Sabalenka. It would be their first meeting since their thrilling, albeit controversial, third-round clash at SW19, which the world No.1 won 7-6(6) 6-4. The main moment of contention involved a Sabalenka first serve at 2-4, 15-0, which appeared to miss the line. Raducanu managed to return to the serve, only for Sabalenka to hit a forehand winner before going on to hold. Raducanu was heard asking the chair umpire: “You saw it out as well, right?”

After the match, an emotional Raducanu questioned the accuracy of Wimbledon's electronic line-calling system (ELC). She said: “That call was for sure out. It's kind of disappointing, the tournament here, that the calls can be so wrong, but for the most part they've been OK. I've had a few in my other matches, too, that have been very wrong. Hopefully they can fix that.”

The technology has become standard across the tour, with all ATP Tour events and a lot of WTA ones no longer using line judges. The same system operates at the Australian Open and the US Open, but the French Open remains an outlier, eschewing any form of electronic system.

Another moment of controversy during the Sabalenka match involved Raducanu's racket, which received needed running repairs. She explained: "In the first set as well, I was struggling with the tension [of the strings]. I felt like the ball was flying.



“I had all my rackets strung up fresh for the match, and it just felt like it was pinging completely different. It could have been a little bit because the roof was on. I sent a couple rackets to be restrung.”

Sabalenka has little sympathy, reminding her young rival that preparation was key. She said: "That's more [reason] to have an extra racket, maybe not in your bag, but your team.

"For example, my team, they always have like two extra rackets with the higher tension and two extra rackets with lower tension. They prepare it. You don't have to wait for another racket.”



Meanwhile, Raducanu has started working with Rafael Nadal's former coach, Francis Roig. The 22-year-old has been working with fellow Brit Mark Petchey on an informal basis since March and has now added Roig to her team.

The Spaniard worked alongside Nadal and his uncle Toni for the majority of his career, during which time he won 22 Grand Slams. Speaking about teaming up with Roig ahead of the Cincinnati Open, Raducanu told Sky Sports: “It's going really well, it's my second day here with him here, but I did a few days in London before I came out here.

"He's obviously got a bank of experience and I'm very excited to continue working with him and to have him on my side.” Roig joins Raducanu's coaching set-up as she continues preparations for the US Open, the tournament she won in 2021.

Tennis fans got their first glimpse of what promises to be one of the most entertaining partnerships at the US Open when Emma Navarro and Jannik Sinner crossed paths at the Cincinnati Open this week. The brief encounter between the Italian world No. 1 and American rising star offered a preview of their playful dynamic, complete with jokes about hitting partners and net play that has everyone buzzing ahead of their highly anticipated mixed doubles debut.

The interaction between Navarro and Sinner revealed their natural chemistry as they prepare for their US Open debut together. When Sinner walked onto the court to applause from the crowd, he went over to hug Navarro. The American then asked with a smile, “Are we practicing right now? They told me I am the hitting partner.”

Sinner's quick response showed both his humor and respect for his partner: “You're not my hitting partner, I am your hitting partner,” he said. Though they didn't actually practice together and simply crossed paths during their respective training sessions, the moment highlighted the mutual respect between the two champions.

The brief encounter was captured on video and quickly went viral on social media, giving fans their first look at how the pair interact off-court. The genuine warmth between them suggests their partnership could be as entertaining as it is competitive.

The pairing of Navarro and Sinner came together in an unexpected way for the revamped US Open mixed doubles event. As Sinner revealed during Wimbledon, the two had never met or texted before tournament organizers matched them up. “I just met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked or texted to each other. It's actually a funny story,” Sinner explained.

Despite their lack of prior connection, both players have embraced the partnership with enthusiasm and humor. Navarro playfully described how the collaboration started during a Wimbledon interview, joking that Sinner “was begging me to play.” She added with a grin, “He was saying, I heard about your volleys and your doubles skills. Please please, will you play with me? I said yeah, sure. I guess, I will play with you. You're not the best player, but I'll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year.”

The banter continued after Sinner's Wimbledon victory. Navarro sent him a humorous message pointing out areas for improvement in his net game. “I'm getting worried because I didn't see much net play. You did hit a tweener between your legs at the net at one point, which was kind of cool or whatever, but you missed the overhead,” she said in the video. Her playful coaching advice continued: “I need you to step up your game a little bit and sort of match my level there. Let's get to work, buddy.”

The connection between the players extends beyond tennis. Sinner was invited to the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Lindner Family Tennis Centre in Mason, Ohio, by Ben Navarro, owner of the Cincinnati Open and Emma's father. Sinner is the defending champion at Cincinnati this year, having defeated Frances Tiafoe in the finals of 2024.

The US Open mixed doubles event runs August 19-20 with a $1 million prize for the winners. The tournament features a new format with 16 teams competing in shortened matches on the main stadium courts. With their combined star power and easy chemistry, Navarro and Sinner are among the favorites to claim the title in this reimagined event.

Their partnership represents more than just a pairing of top players. It's become a showcase of personalities that could help bring new energy to mixed doubles tennis. If their Cincinnati encounter is any indication, fans are in for plenty of entertainment both on and off the court when the US Open begins.

Stefano Vukov has been cleared to return from his WTA Tour-imposed suspension.

Vukov is permitted to receive credentials allowing him access to player areas and practice courts at WTA Tour events.

He coached Elena Rybakina to the 2022 Wimbledon title.

The coach of 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina has been cleared by the WTA Tour to return from his suspension for a potential breach of its code of conduct.

Stefano Vukov was provisionally suspended in January while the WTA conducted an investigation.

The WTA announced in February the investigation had been completed and the ban remained in place, without specifying how long it would last.

Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko delights crowds in Montreal and Toronto with her Canadian Open final win over four-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka.

Vukov is now permitted to receive credentials allowing him access to player areas and practice courts at its events.

"The WTA is fully committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all athletes and other participants, as set out in our WTA code of conduct and safeguarding code," the tour said in a statement.

"Any sanctions issued following a breach of these safeguarding rules are carefully considered and are subject to appeal before an independent tribunal.

"While case details remain confidential, we can confirm that Mr Vukov is eligible to receive credentials at WTA events."

Rybakina announced before last year's US Open that Vukov would no longer be her coach.

But prior to this year's Australian Open, Rybakina said he would be rejoining her team.

She insisted he had never mistreated her during their time working together.

Rybakina, ranked number 10 on the WTA Tour, most recently reached the semifinals in Montreal before losing to Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko, the eventual champion.

Getting to know... Ollie Bearman

Iconic Jenson Button onboards

We take a look back at some of the biggest talking points over the first half of the Formula 1 season.

It's been a busy first half of the 2025 Formula 1 season, with driver changes, on-track clashes, breakthrough results and off-track dramas all featuring. As the summer break takes hold, F1.com runs through five of the craziest storylines from the year so far – and how they all came about…

Liam Lawson achieved a childhood dream when he was promoted to Red Bull Racing for 2025, taking Sergio Perez's place alongside Max Verstappen after impressing across stand-in spells with their sister team – but the New Zealander would be out of the seat just weeks later.

Following Q1 exits and no-scores at the first two rounds of the campaign in Australia and China, Red Bull made the call to send Lawson straight back to Racing Bulls for the Japanese Grand Prix and beyond, with Yuki Tsunoda going the other way.

Some backed Red Bull's decision, while others sympathised with Lawson's situation, particularly given his compromised pre-season, the fact he had been racing at new venues, and the well-documented challenge of driving recent Red Bull cars.

“I needed time, and I wasn't given it,” Lawson told F1.com in an exclusive interview last month, taking a moment to reflect on his whirlwind few months.

While Lawson still has a seat, one driver who lost theirs altogether is Jack Doohan – the Australian starting the year at Alpine but being dropped after six races in favour of 2024 Williams super-sub Franco Colapinto.

Doohan went from Alpine race driver back to a reserve after May's Miami Grand Prix weekend, which also marked the final event for team boss Ollie Oakes.

Oakes, who had joined the Enstone-based operation in July 2024, resigned with immediate effect a couple of days post-race – Alpine Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore noting that “the reasons are not related to the team and are of a personal nature”.

A couple of months later, another managerial reshuffle would send shockwaves through the paddock, with Red Bull confirming that long-time CEO and Team Principal Christian Horner had been replaced by Racing Bulls' Laurent Mekies midway through the season.

Horner, who started out as a driver before transitioning to a team boss role in Formula 3000, led Red Bull Racing into their first F1 season back in 2005 – becoming the sport's youngest team boss in the process at just 31 years of age.

“It's been a privilege being part of and leading this epic team and I am so proud of our collective accomplishments,” wrote Horner in a social media post, before Red Bull began their new era at the Belgian Grand Prix.

Horner's dismissal came amid plenty of speculation over the future of reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, who only confirmed he will be racing for Red Bull in 2026 – when new regulations come into play – last time out in Hungary.

Despite holding a contract through 2028, Verstappen had been linked with a shock move away given Red Bull's fluctuating form, a much talked about performance clause, and Mercedes boss Toto Wolff openly showing his interest in the Dutchman.

That in turn raised questions over the futures of Silver Arrows pair George Russell and rookie Kimi Antonelli, who are both out of contract at the end of 2025. “Obviously [if] you have a Russell/Verstappen line-up, that's Prost/Senna I guess, no?” Wolff said, pointing to his “far-fetched” ideas.

With Verstappen verbally pledging his immediate future to Red Bull, Russell and Antonelli look set to continue at Mercedes through 2026 – Wolff heading into the break saying “I want to stay with Kimi and George as it stands”.

This, of course, played out following Russell and Verstappen's squabble towards the end of the 2024 season, and either side of their controversial clash at this year's Spanish Grand Prix, which yielded an apology from the latter.

This year's British Grand Prix not only brought a first home win for Lando Norris, but also a surprise and very popular maiden F1 podium finish for Nico Hulkenberg – the German reaching the rostrum in his 239th start.

Hulkenberg had already made a habit of charging up the order with his new team Kick Sauber, going from 17th to seventh during a rain-hit 2025 opener in Australia, from 15th to fifth in Spain and from 20th to ninth in Austria.

Silverstone, though, brought new race-day heights, as Hulkenberg bounced back from another tricky Qualifying session to brilliantly work his way through the midfield, get into the points and then the top-three places amid wet/dry conditions.

The longer the race went on, the more onlookers started to believe that Hulkenberg would finally break his podium duck and, despite intense pressure from Lewis Hamilton, he held firm to follow the McLarens of Norris and Oscar Piastri home.

“It's been a long time coming, hasn't it?” Hulkenberg smiled after taking the chequered flag, shouting over the radio with pride and beginning to process what had just happened. “I always knew we have it in us, and I have it in me somewhere.”

The final moment on our list came just before the summer break, when 2025 Ferrari signing Hamilton responded to a disappointing Q2 exit at the Hungaroring – a week on from his Q1 elimination in Belgium – with some particularly self-critical remarks.

“I'm useless, absolutely useless,” he sighed to broadcasters, after team mate Charles Leclerc grabbed pole position. “The team, they have no problem – you've seen the car is on pole. So, they probably need to change driver.”

Put to Hamilton that his “useless” self-assessment cannot be the case, given an F1 CV that features a record-equalling seven world titles and more poles and wins than anyone else, he replied: “It clearly is. I drove terribly.”

Hamilton finished where he started on race day, crossing the line in a lapped 12th place, after which the Briton doubled down on his frustrations and commented that he was “looking forward to going away” for the summer.

How Hamilton and Ferrari progress from here remains to be seen, with Hamilton adding “there's a lot going on in the background that is not great”, but it was a weekend that triggered headlines across the globe – and beyond the world of F1.

	Although actors are often advised not to read the reviews, one critic's takedown of Freakier Friday caught Jamie Lee Curtis‘ attention.


	The Oscar winner, who reprises her role as Tess Coleman, recently called out Time critic Stephanie Zacharek for her “harsh” review of the Disney body-swap sequel to 2003's Freaky Friday.


	Quoting Zacharek's review, the outlet captioned an Instagram post on Friday, “No one, as far as we know, actually asked Disney for a sequel to 2003's buoyant, surprisingly unsyrupy generation-gap comedy Freaky Friday.”

	“SEEMS a TAD HARSH. SOME people LOVE it. Me being one,” wrote Curtis in a comment.

	











	Despite Zacharek's review, Freakier Friday is Certified Fresh with a 73% review average and 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, on track for a $30M-$32M opening.


	Curtis and Lindsay Lohan reunite in Freakier Friday, which sees Tess' daughter Anna Coleman (Lohan) facing challenges with her own blended family, 20 years after mother and daughter switched places. Now, the pair finds themselves swapped with Anna's daughter Harper (Julia Butters) and future stepdaughter Lily (Sophia Hammons).

With the Huron Station Playhouse and the latest from filmmaker Zach Cregger, the actor who has already worked with everyone from Francis Ford Coppola to Christopher Nolan is continuing to carve out a singular career.


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


	In the nascent days of the pandemic, many found themselves participating in activities that would otherwise have been deemed out-of-character (see: sourdough, jigsaw puzzles, ceramics.) Alden Ehrenreich, the actor who played a young Han Solo and has worked with everyone from the Coen Brothers to Park Chan-wook, found himself Googling Los Angeles commercial real estate.


	For years, Ehrenreich would walk into various spaces — friends' houses, restaurants, anywhere with a semi-raised platform, really — and offer the same refrain: “You could do a theater here.” The pandemic-induced downtime gave him the space to finally pursue a long-held desire to open a theater in Los Angeles. And the Google search led him to Huron Substation, a historical building in the Cypress Park neighborhood in the northeast of the city.

					'Weapons' Director Zach Cregger on Bidding Wars, Casting Re-Dos and His Personal Connection to the Film's Final Chapter		
			









	Originally built as a service station for Los Angeles's one-time Yellow trolley cars up until the 1960s, Huron has been more recently used as a wedding and event space. Four years ago, Ehrenreich became its newest owner and launched Huron Station Playhouse.


	“I think it's very hard for people in L.A. in particular and for artists, to not end up working in isolation and have the pressures of the industry and the pressures of their status that year, whatever the hell it might be, to influence their work,” says the 35-year-old. Inspired by creative collectives like American Zoetrope (Ehrenreich worked with co-founder Francis Ford Coppola on 2009 indie drama Tetro), filmmaker John Cassavetes' ensembles or Lee Strasberg's Group Theater, Ehrenreich wants to build Huron as a space for group creative experiences without the noise that can come with working in and adjacent to Hollywood.

	











	Since the beginning, he has drawn comparisons to actors of yore. Even Ehrenreich's approach to the entertainment industry — director-centric, a preference for film over television, and general wariness of perceived star power — also feels like a throwback. Says Zach Cregger, the director behind the actor's latest feature Weapons out this weekend, of an anomalous Ehrenreich: “This person feels like they were teleported from another Earth, where he's the biggest movie star on that planet.”


	Ehrenreich is quietly, methodically carving out one of the more interesting careers for an actor his age. And he is unabashed about his ambition to infuse some artistry in an increasingly corporatized Hollywood. Says Ehrenreich, “90 percent of what you hear is ‘This is the worst time for the business.' Or, ‘Things aren't like they used to be.' But things are never like they used to be, so you either bemoan that, or you find a way to go with it.”


	On a late July afternoon, Ehrenreich is walking around Huron, pointing out the vaulted ceilings and red brick that is now charred black thanks to a fire in the '80s when it was a welding operation. A Los Angeles native, Ehrenreich grew up in the Palisades going to the city's theater offerings, watching plays like All My Sons starring Laurie Metcalf at The Geffen Playhouse. The dream is that Huron will be, Ehrenreich explains, “an off-Broadway space for L.A., where the best of the last few years of theater, some of these great, smaller plays that aren't really the right fit for the Geffen or The Taper can come.”

	











	Last year, Huron Station Playhouse debuted its programming with a series of five play readings that featured actors like Dylan O'Brien and Stephanie Hsu. There are acting classes on Monday nights, and a playwrights circle every other Wednesday. Kids and teen arts classes can also be on offer.  The plan is to have full staged productions starting this spring and to bring in 92nd Street Y-style conversations series into the fold. Huron is joining a growing number of increasingly popular eastside entertainment spaces. There's Zebulon and the Lodge Room for music, Vidiots as a film revival house and The Elysian for comedy.  


	On a personal level for Ehrenreich, Huron is a creative outlet without the external pressures that can come with working in entertainment. “I have watched people lose some of their appetite to experiment, and start thinking, ‘How can I write something that's going to get me into this writer's room?” he continues. “We all have to make certain concessions, but a lot of times what happens is someone will make those concessions, and they'll put something in a drawer for so long that when they go to the drawer, it's not there anymore.”


	Ehrenreich is no stranger to the ebbs and flows of the industry. His credits have run the gamut from young adult fare (Beautiful Creatures) to auteur dramas (Blue Jasmine) and, of course, Star Wars with 2018's Solo. Han Solo is the type of character that can easily eclipse a performer, like playing Jesus Christ or Santa Claus. But in the years since, Ehrenreich has gone toe-to-toe with the likes of Robert Downey Jr. in Christopher Nolan drama Oppenheimer and with a drug-addled CG Grizzly in horror comedy Cocaine Bear.

	











	Looking at his films, he doesn't seem concerned with being at the top of the call sheet. “I have not gone after certain opportunities that would have been very beneficial from a career standpoint,” he says. Instead, he is more interested in the aggregate.  “Over the course of a whole career, I just want it to feel like me,” he says. And, as of late, he has been happy to be approached about projects that hit a little closer to home. “I've played the idealistic boyish characters for a lot longer than I felt like that. Over the last four or five years, I get to play people with some miles on them, cause that's how I feel,” he says with a laugh.


	His latest role is in Cregger's horror-thriller Weapons, in which he plays a would-be sober cop helping to investigate the strange disappearance of 17 local elementary school kids, all from the same classroom that just so happens to be taught by his ex-girlfriend and onetime drinking buddy, played by Julia Garner.


	Says Cregger, “When I saw him in Hail, Caesar!, I was just like, ‘This performance is a miracle!'” In the Coens' old Hollywood comedy, Ehrenreich plays a Western film star Hobie Doyle whom the studio is trying to mold into their next leading man, to little success but much hilarity. 


	“I've said this to his face, so I don't think he'd mind, but he's been in a couple of movies that I really don't like, but he is so great in those movies,” Cregger continues. “Even if he's got material that I think is not worthy of him, he's able to spin it into gold and never be boring.”

	











	As a moviegoer, Ehrenreich largely avoids horror. After a particularly scarring viewing of The Sixth Sense at too impressionable an age, he forewent the Ring and Saw horror titles of his youth. More recently, he appreciates the creative boon in horror filmmaking coming out of indie outfits like Neon, A24 and Mubi, but isn't in the audience for them. He explains, “The thing that some people find fun, I find disturbing.”


	Ehrenreich was sent the script for Weapons, and a couple of dozen pages in, he thought it was “one of the best I've ever read.” He liked that the movie, which is told in shifting perspectives, forgoes any exposition in favor of dropping audiences in the middle of some most distressing, comical and harrowing moments of these people's lives. Says the actor, “You don't know [the character's] backstory, but Paul's clearly in a place where he's lost control, and that's when we meet him.”


	To prep, Ehrenreich attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and spent some time with a cop.  In a movie of truly wild moments, it's notable that Cregger counts his favorite scene as the simple back-and-forth where Garner and Ehrenreich are sitting and reconnecting in a bar.  


	After Weapons' release, Ehrenreich, who directed the short film Shadow Brother Sunday in 2023, has cleared the rest of 2025 to finish writing what he hopes will be his feature directorial debut. Over the past 18 years, the actor has been squirrelling away “ways of making a film set a healthy village,” he says, noting that on the set for Weapons, Cregger had his cast and crew stretch for 15 minutes together at the start of each day.  

	











	Despite constant conversation about contraction and general Hollywood disillusionment, Ehrenreich is excited about the potential for this moment in filmmaking. He anticipates making his film independently to give him control over who is in front and behind the camera, and he is patient if not steadfast about directing aspirations. “I don't know if I'll need to make a few movies that are wonky until I make a good one, or whether I'm going to be able to make a good one right out of the gate,” he says. “But I know, no matter what, that's the place I want to go next.”


	The playhouse, Weapons and his directing ambitions are all in line with a career that he is hopeful will carry him through an always fickle industry. “Coppola said this thing that you're going to succeed and fail the same amount of times, no matter what you do. So what matters is where you're putting your emphasis,” he says. “It's not about being cool. It's all in an effort to try to keep the fire alive.”

The thing about trolling is that it's a fundamentally self-powering cycle: You piss someone off, they react; you make fun of them for reacting, it pisses them off some more. Its textbook stuff that most of us picked up on the playground (if not the early internet), literally decades ago. But dang if it isn't still interesting to see the creators of South Park run the playbook so effectively on the United States government.

As we noted earlier this week, series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone doubled down on their efforts to troll Donald Trump and his various accomplices with the second episode of the show's 27th season, focusing heavily on secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem. As is their style, Parker and Stone went scattershot with their attacks on Noem (and through her, the ICE agents that she's been aggressively lowering standards to recruit), mixing attacks on her appearance with references to her weirdly proud assertions of dog murder, layered in with jabs at her general attention-seeking behavior in service of making life harder for so many people living in America. In rising to the show's bait (on a podcast appearance, before wising up for the morning news shows), Noem skipped over all the dog-killing bits and focused on the appearance stuff—admittedly, the easiest material in the episode to dismiss—calling it “petty.” But the thing about trolls is that you really don't want to challenge them to a petty-off.

Which is to say, online observers have noted that South Park‘s social media team has been happy to take whatever free publicity the White House is willing to serve them, in this case by apparently changing the show's avatars on all its major social media accounts this week (including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) to Noem's botox-deprived Salvador-Dali-clock-shop of a face. As with the original jokes, we'd never accuse this of being particularly clever trolling. But it does have the benefit of a certain gleeful relentlessness. (Part of what's powering South Park right now is the fact that a lot of satirists have punched themselves out on mocking Trump over the last decade—or at least started calling their shots a little more carefully—so this kind of full court press feels bracing.) The question remains, as it has for the last few weeks, how long it will take the White House to actually get its staff firmly enough in line, follow basic internet survival protocol, and stop feeding the trolls. (We have our bets on “never,” given the general mentality of the folks Trump surrounds himself with, but miracles do sometimes occur.)

NBC has announced that the 51st season of “Saturday Night Live” will hit the airwaves (and Peacock, too!) October 4, a date that is still nearly two months into the future. Meanwhile, its been about three months since “SNL” has graced us with a new set of hilarious(-to-mid) sketches, and last season was one of the series' most eventful, since it was the 50th lap for the pop culture staple. During its half-centennial run, there was even a movie — about but unaffiliated to the series — about the making of its first episode.

The whole 50th ballyhoo led up to an all-star three-plus hour anniversary show that premiered Sunday (naturally), February 16. The audience was like an Oscar or Emmy night roster: Cher, Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, Zach Galifianakis, Jack Nicholson, Ayo Edebiri, Steve Martin, and Emma Stone, among many more. Meryl Streep appeared in her very first “SNL” sketch, for heaven's sake. Former cast legends like Adam Sandler, Tina Fey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tracy Morgan, Kristin Wiig… there could be an entire article just citing the names that made up the 50th, and how that all went down. Oh wait, we had one of those, right here.

One star, however, that did not enjoy the evening was former cast member Pete Davidson, who told Seth Meyers that the anniversary audience was “terrible.”

 










“It's a terrible audience 'cause it's just famous people, and famous people only like themselves,” Davidson said, admitting his own culpability. “It's true! I'm guilty of this,” he said.

One big name, however, did live up to the hype for Davidson, and it was the Oscar-winner he happened to be seated right beside. 

“Meryl rules,” he said. “In typical ‘SNL' fashion, they don't tell you anything. You don't even know what's going on. I get to my seat and I just look and I'm like, ‘This can't be right.' And it was Meryl Streep, and I just sat down and I was like like, ‘I'm so sorry… I'm so sorry that I'm sitting next to you. You're the best.' And she was very nice.”

Davidson is currently starring in “The Home,” which hit theaters on July 25. The film's director, James DeMonaco, told IndieWire that Davidson has a depth that “SNL” viewers may not fully recognize. 

“I don't want to say his public persona is so different from who he really is, but people know him as this really funny guy, and I know him more as a soulful person who experienced a lot of tragedy early in his life,” DeMonaco said. Davison lost his father, a firefighter, during the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. “I think he related to [his ‘The Home' character] Max in a way, because they both experienced trauma in their youth.”

 










Davidson, in addition to having a film currently in theaters, was recently a voice in the animated “Dog Man,” a part of the “Riff Raff” ensemble, and just premiered “The Pickup” on Amazon Prime. Of “The Pickup,” he said, “The movie we did– It's a tough one because it's an indie, so there's no budget and there's not anything glamorous about it… No one makes money, no one's comfortable, it's strictly like for the art.”

The Writers Guild Of America announced late on Friday night that it was expelling two of its high-profile members, Park Chan-wook and Don McKellar, over their conduct during the 2023 strikes, Variety reports. The Oldboy writer/director and Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould writer were both found to have broken strike rules by writing on their 2024 Robert Downey Jr. project The Sympathizer during the union-mandated stopdown.

The expulsions from the writers' union are not, to be clear, a strictly academic matter: Studios that are signatories to the WGA's collective bargaining agreement—i.e., all the major Hollywood players, including Disney, Netflix, and The Sympathizer‘s home network HBO—are required to use WGA screenwriters, so both men are pretty much cut out of American film and TV production. Park and McKellar are apparently just two of seven writers who were ultimately disciplined over their conduct during the strikes; others, like Sullivan's Crossing creator Roma Roth (unsuccessfully) appealed, making their names public, but the WGA decided this weekend to publicize the rest of the list as well. (Bates Motel co-creator Anthony Cipriano was also revealed to have been suspended from the WGA until May 2026 for writing on 2024 thriller film The Last Breath.)

The Sympathizer entered and exited the public consciousness with surprising quickness last April, despite Downey's high-profile casting as multiple antagonistic figures cropping up in the life of a Vietnam refugee (Hoa Xuande) who is secretly a double agent for the Communist faction. The show was adapted (mostly by Park and McKellar, who are credited, sometimes with a third writer, on all seven of its episodes) from a Pulitzer-winning novel by Viet Thanh Nguyen.

	Congratulations are in order for Cole Swindell and his wife, Courtney Little Swindell, who have welcomed their first child.


	The country music star and former NBA dancer became parents to a baby girl, Rainey Gail Swindell, on Thursday (Aug. 7). The couple shared the joyful news the following day through a joint Instagram post featuring a heartwarming photo of their newborn dressed in a white onesie.


	“Rainey Gail Swindell 🤍 8.7.25 our greatest blessing,” they captioned the post.

	











	The baby's name is a tribute to her father, whose middle name is Rainey.




			Trending on Billboard		







	After the birth, Courtney shared a tender photo on her Instagram Story of Cole smiling down at their newborn daughter as he gently held her.


	“This is why who you marry matters,” she wrote in text over the picture. “Best dad already to our girl. Couldn't ask for a more supportive partner! We are very lucky girls.”


	The Swindells first announced they were expecting back in early March with an Instagram carousel that included a sweet shot of the couple standing behind a clothesline adorned with a baby onesie, close-up images of sonograms, and joyful moments celebrating the news.


	“Baby Swindell 2025,” they captioned the post, alongside a heart emoji.


	Cole and Courtney tied the knot in June 2024 during a romantic ceremony in Sonoma, Calif. Earlier this year, the ACM Award winner released a special remixed, digital-only version of his top 10 Billboard Country Airplay hit, “Forever to Me,” retitled “Forever to Me (Our Version).” The accompanying music video features touching footage from their wedding day.

	As production on The Batman Part II prepares to get underway next year, James Gunn is battling more online fan speculation.


	The DC Studios boss took to social media on Friday to dispel a rumor that the Dark Knight's orphaned sidekick Robin (aka Dick Grayson) will make his debut in Matt Reeves‘ upcoming sequel.


	“Guys please stop believing this nonsense. I think six of us have read the script. No one knows anything about The Batman 2,” wrote Gunn on Threads.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“Anything you've heard about that movie is made up or a guess,” wrote Gunn in a previous post. “No one in the world knows anything about the concept for the story except four people.”

	











	Premiering last month in theaters, Gunn's Superman launched a new DCU with the ‘Gods and Monsters' phase, separate from Reeves' ‘Batman Epic Crime Saga', which includes The Batman (2022) and last year's HBO Max series spin-off The Penguin.


	After Gunn previously defended the delays on The Batman Part II, which is set to premiere on Oct. 1, 2027 following a year-long postponement, Reeves and co-writer Mattson Tomlin revealed in June that they finished the script for the sequel.


	In a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders this week, the studio confirmed that production will begin on The Batman Part II in the spring.

Unfortunately, all projects come with a few Village Idiots lurking around, mouthing off things they truly know nothing about.

This is why you hire business people to do business jobs.

Why is Gunn giving his take on Matt Reeves vision? His movie didn't flop but it's clear it won't reach the box office success of The Batman. Reeves has the box office to support his moral authority over The Batman, and frankly he would have been a better lead for DC than Gunn.

It's not Gunn's fault that by the time his vision was out superheroes were in decline but his international numbers won't ever reach man of steel, let alone the Batman, so let's keep Gunn's opinion on Reeves work away from headlines…and the entire The Batman 2 production. Let reeves do his thing, and stick to his vision. Reeves is topping Gunn in box office at DC, and that won't change during this decade, maybe ever.

Gunn's vision is actually very truthful to the comic book source material and much more so than any of the depressing and hackneyed Snyder-verse crap. The cynical people want doom and gloom and Gunn is bringing back the light, that's why his movies irk them. I love how people call Superman “woke” for saving a squirrel. I mean what is the alternative? I guess they believe that you should laugh at the squirrel and watch it suffer. I'm pretty sure Jesus would save it too, because he is the most “Woke” person ever. I guess we all know what side of the spectrum you most likely fall into. Comics are about hope, fascism is about despair. Gunn brings hope. Get used to it or go watch male on male wrestling;) Now that's depressing!

Someone's worried about Warner's elimination of redundant roles.

When 2022 “American Idol” winner Iam Tongi decided to get healthier by working with a trainer and changing his diet, he never imagined that he'd be riding a bike less than a year later. But on August 8, the 20-year-old singer shared a joyful video of himself riding a bicycle for the first time in seven years. 

“When I walked in the gym about 10 months ago,” Tongi captioned the video, “this wasn't even a possibility and I didn't think I'd ever ride a bike again so when Robert pulled out the bikes today I simply said I don't think I can.” 

Tongi, who revealed in May that he'd already shed 115 pounds, continued, “And that's why he's the trainer, he knows me better than me 🤣 and after about 10 miles and falling twice 😂 I can say today I struggled but I had so much fun hitting this milestone of riding a bike again after almost 8 years. Love you all and Yessah 🤙🏽”

Tongi, who was just 18 when he won season 21 of “American Idol,” first shared his health journey with fans in March, posting a video of one of his workouts and noting that he was “hitting the reset button” for spring with his trainer. 

The Hawaii native, who now lives in Memphis, told People in May, “We have a workout session maybe around 11, come back (home), and we go to an ice bath or sauna … or whatever it is. And then we come back, shower, and go on a walk. And I've lost 115 lbs. It feels amazing. I feel great.”

In his August 8 video, Tongi can be seen pedaling away with his song “Road to Hana” playing in the background. At one point, the season 21 winner looks at the camera and says, “Hit a milestone — first time riding a bike (in) seven years!” 

Fans and friends flooded the post with encouragement and support, including season 21 platinum ticket winner Cameron Osterloh, who wrote, “Let's gooo bro!! So proud of everything you've accomplished!!!! ❤️”

Tongi's girlfriend Leah wrote, “Yeah youuuu baby 😍” and he replied, “thank you babe ❤️❤️”

Among the more than 1,600 comments Tongi received, one fan wrote, “Love seeing this for you, and also for everyone you inspire and motivate ✨🔥”

Tongi has periodically posted videos of his workouts, including one from the July 4th weekend of him pulling a giant tire behind him for strength training and conditioning. 

In addition to achieving his health goals, Tongi has been riding a giant wave of success. In May, he contributed a track to the “Lilo & Stitch” soundtrack and a TikTok video about the making of his version of “Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride” went viral, racking up over 5 million views. 

In June, Tongi made his Grand Ole Opry debut, and he's been on the road a lot, performing for packed festivals and concert halls. In just the last week, he performed for huge crowds in Salt Lake City and Denver. 

Tongi is also working on new music, telling People he hopes to have a new album ready by October.

	Welcome to Drummergeddon 2025, when the entire music world wants to know: What the hell is going on with the drummers? There's an epidemic of high-profile bands dumping their drummers, or getting dumped by them, and nobody has any clue why. It's not just the Who or the Foo Fighters. It's not just Nine Inch Nails or Pearl Jam or Primus. It's not even just GNR or Oasis or Iron Maiden. It's a host of rock and metal bands from different genres, at different levels of fame, shuffling their rhythm sections in a full-blown global percussion crisis. How did this happen?


	The Drummerpocalypse just keeps hitting new levels, reaching a farcical peak last week when the Foo Fighters and Nine Inch Nails traded drummers. The Who's battle with ex-stickman Zak Starkey keeps raging on, after they fired, re-hired, then re-fired him this spring. Last weekend, Roger Daltrey went off in the Times, accusing Starkey of “character assassination.” Zak summed up the chaos back in May when he told Rolling Stone, “What the fuck? These guys are fuckin' insane! I've been fired more times than Keith Moon in ten days.”

	











	But this year, we're definitely seeing a vibe shift behind the kit. The Foo Fighters startled everyone in May by firing Josh Freese, one of the rock world's most dependable (and most-employed) rhythm kings. They just announced his new replacement: Ilan Rubin, from Nine Inch Nails. This is weird because Freese used to play in Nine Inch Nails—and Rubin is the guy who replaced him when he left in 2008. Now Freese has rejoined his old mates, replacing his replacement, as if Rubin were just keeping his throne warm for the past sixteen years.

	There's never been a scenario like this: two of the world's biggest rock bands switching drummers like it's a baseball trade. (Did Trent have to kick in some draft picks? Did Grohl need another left-hander for the post-season roster before the trading deadline?) There's nothing comparable in history. The closest thing to a similar swap, according to Rolling Stone's resident lore-master Andy Greene, came in 2003, after Metallica's bassist Jason Newsted quit the band. They hired Robert Trujillo away from Ozzy's band—so Ozzy replaced him with Newsted. But this is far crazier, given the drummers' linked history.

	The Freese drama is a shocker because he's the definition of a sure thing. He's played with everybody. I've seen him live with Weezer, Devo, Paramore, the Replacements, probably others. But there's also GNR (he replaced Matt Sorum), A Perfect Circle, Sublime With Rome, Lana Del Rey, Sting, Kelly Clarkson, Ween, Avril Lavigne, Katy Perry, Ricky Martin, even the Buffy musical episode. He joined the Foos in May 2023, stepping in for the late Taylor Hawkins. So everyone was stunned when he got the axe — especially Freese, who said, “In my forty years of drumming professionally, I've never been let go from a band.” 


	But these are strange days for drummers. This week, Freese hits the road with Nine Inch Nails, while Rubin gets cozy with the Foos. This situation is basically one staircase crash away from Showgirls.


	Meanwhile, the Zak Starkey melodrama has turned into the messiest Who soap opera since Lifehouse. As Ringo Starr's son, Zak grew up around Keith Moon and got drum lessons from him, then played with several million bands before spending nearly 30 years in the Who. He held the job longer than Moon ever did. But in April, they fired him for allegedly playing too loud (in the Who?), after Daltrey missed a cue in “The Song Is Over” at the Royal Albert Hall. They rehired him two weeks later (“News Flash! Who Back Zak!” Pete Townshend posted), but then Cousin Kevined him out of the band again two weeks later. It's blown up into the most notorious controversy over a dumped drummer since Zak's dad took over from Pete Best.


	If there was a tipping point for Drummergeddon, it might have been the weird moment back in 2024 when three of the world's top metal bands — Sepultura, Slipknot, and Suicidal Tendencies — rotated their tubthumpers. Jay Weinberg got kicked out of Slipknot, but signed on with S.T., whose Greyson Nekrutman quit to join Sepultura, after Eloy Casagrande left to play for Slipknot. Fans were puzzled, but as Sepultura guitarist Andreas Kisser mused, “Maybe it was better for everyone.” Suicidal Tendencies, of course, used to have Trujillo on bass, for The Art of Rebellion. And who played drums on that album? Josh Freese.

	To add extra levels of irony, Jay Weinberg's dad keeps time for a guy named Bruce Springsteen. At 74, Max Weinberg hasn't lost a drop of his superman stamina, but not even Bruce knows his secret. “Max is a human marvel,” he told Rolling Stone this summer. “So the guy comes out and plays basically for three hours straight without stopping. He stops, maybe there's 30 seconds where he gets to take a sip of water twice, two or three times during the night.”


	Look, drummers have it tough. We take them for granted. They work so hard for us, and get so little respect. They suffer so much physical and emotional torment, forever the butt of jokes. What's the difference between a drummer and a large pizza? What do you call a pretty girl on the arm of a drummer? What do you call a drummer wearing a tie? They're the musicians that bands replace most ruthlessly, the ones producers shuffle in and out at will, ever since the Beatles ditched Pete for Ringo. Or for that matter, ever since George Martin replaced Ringo with a session guy for “Love Me Do” and demoted Zak's dad to tambourine. (BTW, a large pizza will feed a family of four, a tattoo, and the defendant.)


	The drummers take the most punishment physically—as with baseball catchers, there's a ceiling on how many innings the muscles can take. When Primus drummer Tim “Herb” Alexander quit last November, he didn't mince words. “Being a drummer for almost four decades has taken its toll on my body,” he told Rolling Stone. “As I said previously, my body hurts, My hands hurt. My back hurts.”


	Drummer culture is its own tribe within the music world, with a language that's designed to be incomprehensible to outsiders. How drummers snicker when the rest of us say “in the pocket” or “sick groove,” the way Marines snicker at civilians who say “semper fi.” To normal people, “Don't Stop Believin'” is a Journey song. But for drummers, it's the sound of acclaimed jazz-fusion virtuoso Steve Smith, winner of many magazine polls, playing an intricate open-handed pattern in which he plays the hi-hat with his left hand while his right moves around the kit. (That's a direct quote, from Rolling Stone's awesome Greatest Drummers of All Time list, proudly compiled by drummers for drummers. I have no clue — don't all drummers' hands “move around the kit”? Isn't that like what a drummer freaking does?) But that's the point. Percussion heads have a certain defensive hostility when it comes to the outside world; you have no idea what they're talking about, and they like it that way.

	











	That's because the drummer has a unique place in music culture, providing the forward motion. If your stickmaster sucks, it simply does not matter how good anyone else in the band might be. You might not know the name of the drummer on “Maggie May,” “Midnight Train to Georgia,” “Just Like Heaven,” or “We Are Family,” but they're a key reason you still hear these songs on the radio. (Micky Waller, Andrew Smith, Boris Williams, and Tony Thompson.) Even at a pop show, when you go see Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, or Harry Styles, you're getting rocked by Matt Billingslea, Jordi Radnoti, or the mighty Sarah Jones. Everybody loves the story about Charlie Watts punching out Mick Jagger and telling him, “Never call me your drummer again. You're my fucking singer.” If you think Charlie was exaggerating, just listen to any of the solo records the Stones made without him. Or name one.


	Yet the drummer is the first to get blamed when things go wrong. History is full of rhythmatists who get the axe when their band hits the big time — Steven Adler, Chad Channing, Stan Lynch, Vini Lopez, replaced by iron men like Grohl or Weinberg. Nobody notices when the bassist slips up. If the singer has an off night, the show goes on. But the drummer has nowhere to hide.


	Guns N' Roses just replaced Frank Ferrer in March, nearly two decades after he played on Chinese Democracy, as did Freese. “An amicable exit,” the band called it. Axl Rose, the essence of amicable, greeted the new kid Isaac Carpenter by bitching him out onstage in Yokohama, Japan, for playing “Mr. Brownstone” when Axl was in the mood for “Bad Obsession.” Welcome to the jungle, dude.


	Iron Maiden legend Nicko McBrain quit touring in December, after recovering from a 2023 stroke. They replaced him with Simon Dawson, though McBrain remains an official member. “You may ask yourself, how do I feel about a new drummer taking my place after 42 years?” McBrain said on July 26, at a solo gig. “Well, the simple answer is, I'm still the best-looking bloke in Iron Maiden.”


	Pearl Jam's Matt Cameron quit in July, 27 years after he came in from Soundgarden to replace Jack Irons. They still haven't announced their new banger. But maybe they could snag Irons — he famously crashed their Hall of Fame induction ceremony without an invite and bumrushed the drums for their final song, which is serious Hall of Fame mojo. Umphrey's McGee jam wizard Kris Myers stepped down in May, a couple years after rotator-cuff surgery.

	











	Oasis replaced Chris Sharrock, their last pre-break-up drummer, even though he played in both Gallagher brothers' solo bands. But they hired Joey Waronker, another one of those sure-thing pros who's held down countless gigs, from Beck to R.E.M., from Neil Diamond to Paul McCartney. Bob Dylan switched Jim Keltner with Anton Fig in March. As for Primus, when Alexander quit, they brilliantly turned the audition process into a public spectacle, with their “Interstellar Drum Derby.” Even Les Claypool's pal Billy Strings made a hilarious audition video for the gig, before they finally found new guy Jack Hoffman.


	Through it all, the Who's Zakrophenia drama never ends. Starkey complained bitterly about “the weeks of mayhem of me going ‘in an out an in an out an in an out like a bleedin squeezebox.” Even Ringo, the easiest man to get along with since human beings were invented, got dragged in when Zak quoted him as saying, “I never liked the way that little man ran that band.”


	Daltrey denounced Starkey in the Times last week, saying, “It was kind of a character assassination, and it was incredibly upsetting.” He also introduced a new account of the infamous “Song Is Over” debacle that started the trouble, now blaming it all on the sound crew. The 81-year-old singer explained, “It is controlled by a guy on the side, and we had so much sub-bass on the sound of the drums that I couldn't pitch.” But as he bluntly put it, it can't be his fault, because he's the boss. “Pete and I retain the right to be the Who,” he told the Times. “Everyone else is a session player.” In other words, the IP is the shotgun that sings the song.


	That might be one reason Zak Starkey has blown up into such a cult hero for people who ordinarily don't care a thing about lineup changes in classic rock bands. The Zak saga seems to resonate with people way outside the Who's normal audience, people who can't tell Rabbit Bundrick from Pino Palladino, or “A Quick One” from “The Quiet One.” But people can relate to Zak, the hard-working creative betrayed by his corporate boomer bosses, who slip up and make him the scapegoat, tossing him aside like a discarded plectrum. It's cool to see him refuse to go quietly. Maybe that's why this tale has taken on a mythical life of its own in 2025. But it's the biggest Who buzz in decades, and the most popular save-the-drummers parable of the past 60 years. Meanwhile, Pete Best happened to announce his retirement back in April. (Hey, you don't think…)

	











	Do we even have to mention that Zak used to be in Oasis? He even texted the Gallagher brothers to let them know he suddenly was in the job market this summer, or as he put it, “Why the fuck aren't I in your band, man, helping make it the greatest rock band in the world again?” However, Noel and Liam have Waronker for their reunion tour, and they're wisely not letting him get away.

	These are definitely weird times for drummers and those of us who worship them. But the Drummergeddon chaos hits home for people who don't even like any of these bands, simply because it hits to the emotional core of music, especially live music. Percussionists do more than just keep time — they're the ones who make a band a band. The drummer represents the whole ideal of the band as a community, one nation, indivisible, with Liberty and DeVitto for all. That's why the spirit of the drum lives on in anyone who confronts a stick and a snare and asks, “What can this strange device be?” (R.I.P., Neal Peart.)


	“I've already got my gravestone,” Zak told Rolling Stone. “It says, ‘Zak Starkey, the song is over.'” Well, maybe. But he'll probably just eventually join Oasis again, so he can snag a cooler epitaph like “Where were you while we were getting high?” That's the thing about drummers: you can't keep a good one down. They get work. They move around. Every performer needs a good drummer, and everybody who's got a good one wants a better one, even if they have to steal, poach, or kill. It's too soon to tell where all this upheaval will lead. But you have to suspect the drummers will be the last ones standing. Now more than ever, it's time to give the drummer some.

Kelly Clarkson is very private about her personal life and kept her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock's battle with cancer out of the spotlight for the sake of their children. When the “American Idol” season 1 winner announced that she was postponing some of her Las Vegas concerts, she revealed it was due to Blackstock's illness.

In an August 2025 report from Us Weekly, a source told the outlet, “Even though they went through an acrimonious divorce, Kelly made a conscious decision to protect Brandon's privacy until the very end for the sake of their family.”

Clarkson never revealed her ex-husband's illness when she took a break from her daytime talk show earlier this year.

“He'd been sick for a while, but his health really took a turn for the worse earlier this year. That's why she was MIA from her talk show,” the source shared.

They added, “Out of respect, Kelly chose not to say anything publicly until it became clear this week that Brandon wasn't going to make it.”

A post shared by Kelly Clarkson (@kellyclarkson)

On August 6, Clarkson took to Instagram to share that she had to postpone some of her Las Vegas “Studio Sessions” concert dates because her ex-husband was ill.

“Unfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,” she wrote.

Clarkson continued, “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them.”

The “Idol” alum added, “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.”

Blackstock died on August 7 at age 48 after a long battle with cancer. “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,” a rep for the Blackstock family shared in a statement.

“Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,” the statement noted. “We thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family's privacy during this very difficult time.”

Clarkson and Blackstock married in October 2013 and filed for divorce in June 2020; they finalized their divorce in March 2022. She and Blackstock have two children, River Rose and Remington Alexander.

“Dancing with the Stars” alum Leah Remini, who competed on Season 17 with professional dancer Tony Dovolani, has opened up to her fans with a vulnerable post about the struggles she's been facing.

A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini)

Remini posted several photos on Instagram on August 8. The pictures are from happy times and include throwbacks to her younger years as she poses with her niece, Bri Day. Other photos show her posing with loved ones and attending a dress fitting for her niece's wedding.

In the caption, Remini revealed why she has not been active on social media but thanked fans for their continued support, saying, “sometimes silence is just part of my process.” She continued, “As most of you know, these past months have been incredibly difficult. Losing Mike Rinder. Losing Maddie. The sadness doesn't go away, and honestly, part of me holds onto it because it feels like a way to keep them close. Like if I stop being sad, I've somehow left them behind.”

“But I'm learning that grief and life can exist together, Remini shared. “That we can honor the ones we've lost by staying present for the ones still here.”

Remini tried to focus on the positives in her life, including being able to be there with her niece while she put on her wedding dress. “My little niece, who I still picture as a child sucking her little fingers, is now a beautiful, strong woman getting ready to marry the love of her life, Michael. And today is also her birthday,” Remini wrote.

Remini also commented on her sister, Nicole Remini-Wiskow, and the emotions that she felt with her in that moment. “Standing there with my sister @nicole_b_remini, her proud, beaming mother, and with our mom by our side, I couldn't help but feel how lucky we are to have each other through all of life's seasons,” she wrote. “Life continues. It demands to be lived, even when your heart aches. And I choose to celebrate. To try to show up for love, for joy, for the future.”

The actress made a shout-out to her niece, wishing her a happy birthday and showing her some love. She ended her post with an inspiring message. “Happy birthday, sweet girl. I love you endlessly. Watching you walk into this next chapter is a reminder that there is still so much beauty ahead, even in the midst of pain,” she shared.

Remini's fans have reacted with love, sharing their thoughts in the comment section of the post. 

“You are human! We've all been through times where we need space and some peace to sort through. Take your time – we love you Leah!” a comment reads. “I lost my father 2 weeks ago and understand the magnitude of your grief and sadness. Sending my condolences,” another fan shared.

Remini's sister Nicole responded to the post. “Made me cry, I love you, and I'm so grateful for my amazing family,” she wrote.

The star's niece also responded with a beautiful message that highlights their close bond. “I love you so so much and am so thankful for you!” she wrote. “We're in this life together and being your niece is a true honor. Looking at the generations of us in that room, it was clear that through everything we always have each other. Thank you for making life magical! I can't wait to continue doing life with you by my side!!!”

The grief Remini discussed is the death of her good friend, Mike Rinder, and Maddie, a beloved girl she met during the Make-A-Wish dream charity when she was filming “Kevin Can Wait,” which aired from 2016 until 2018. She announced her death in an Instagram post on July 10, 2025.

“Over the years, many of you have joined me in celebrating this truly special girl turned young woman, Maddie,” Remini wrote. “I am heartbroken to share with you that Maddie has passed away at the age 21. I'm sharing a glimpse into my friendship with Maddie because I want people to know how truly special she was.”

“Freakier Friday” is chalk full of Easter eggs for devoted fans — it's actually, essentially, a Russian nesting doll of winks and nudges, particularly when it comes to cameo returns from some of Hollywood's favorite character actors. Stephen Tobolowsky is back manning detention. Both Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong appear, too, reprising their roles from “Freaky Friday” as Chinese restaurant owners. There's a pair of “SNL” favorites, Vanessa Bayer and Chloe Fineman, in supporting parts. The hilarious Sherry Cola is an announcer at the pickleball game.

 










But the real cameo highlight is undoubtedly Elaine Hendrix as Blake Kale. In the movie, she's an editor at Rolling Stone (which, ironically, just named Shirley Halperin its first female co-editor-in-chief). Fans, however, know that she's also Meredith Blake, the supposed antagonist (there's some debate) in 1998's “The Parent Trap,” starring — ding, ding, ding — Lindsay Lohan as identical twins Annie and Hallie in her film debut.

Blake (the 1998 one) is the fiancé of Dennis Quade's Nick Parker, who stands in the way of Annie and Hallie's plot to reunite their divorced parents by switching places. “Abbott Elementary” star Lisa Ann Walter, Hendrix's best friend and date to the “Freakier Friday” premiere, also appears as the maid, Chessy.

“I love Lindsay so much, and we had such a special experience together,” Hendrix told The New York Post. “None of us could have predicted what ‘The Parent Trap‘ became. All we knew was that we were on this very beautiful, lavish movie set, playing these incredible characters in this very beloved story.”

“The Parent Trap,” which like the 2003 “Freaky Friday,” was a remake of an earlier Disney flick, was directed by Nancy Meyers and shot Lohan to stardom. In an interview with Condé Nast Traveler, Jamie Lee Curtis showered Lohan with praise over her much acclaimed performance.

“I still don't understand. How old were you? 10?” Curtis said. “I don't understand. I really don't. I don't understand how you were that facile and that able to flip-flop… it's just extraordinary… to have that complexity… It's a really impressive performance from a very young person.”

Lohan thanked Curtis and added, “If I had to pick any character that I could say, like, ‘I missed playing those… roles,' it would be Hallie and Annie.”

 










The late Natasha Richardson, who was survived by her husband Liam Neeson, portrayed Elizabeth James, Annie and Hallie's mother. Neeson — who has found love again with “The Naked Gun” co-star Pamela Anderson — will soon appear with Richardson's mother, Vanessa Redgrave, in the film “Cold Storage,” and both his and Natasha's son Daniel and Richardson's sister Joely have signaled their approval of his relationship with Anderson.

	During World War II, the United States launched a powerful military recruiting and war bonds campaign titled “Don't Let That Shadow Touch Them.” Featuring haunting images of children overshadowed by a looming swastika, it warned Americans of the grave threat fascism posed to the nation's safety and future. Today, the picture is disturbingly different. MAGA is working to make fascism cool, joking about ICE's brutal deportation tactics as washed-up celebrities like Dean Cain glorify the idea of snatching children and families off the streets of America.


	It's happening as the people who put their lives on the line for this country — veterans, federal workers, and service members — are punished, silenced, and stripped of their dignity. Meanwhile, the administration is using taxpayer dollars to polish, celebrate, and reinstall racist and authoritarian symbols.


	This week alone has offered a chilling series of examples.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Contract law is a pillar of American democracy and is codified in the Constitution. But, Trump's political appointees at the Department of Veterans Affairs terminated union contracts covering 400,000 employees — many of them veterans. These contracts didn't just protect paychecks; they safeguarded patient safety in VA hospitals, ensuring that nurses, doctors, and professional staff could speak up when staffing levels put veterans at risk. Now, the people caring for our nation's wounded warriors have fewer rights and less protection. And in case anyone missed the point, this comes after months of layoffs targeting thousands of veteran employees across the federal workforce.

	











	Then came the Air Force's move to purge transgender service members, even those within five years of earning a pension. Under Trump's reinstated ban, service members with 15–18 years of service will be forced out with no retirement benefits — in some cases having already-approved retirements rescinded. Imagine serving your country for nearly two decades, only to be shown the door with nothing. It's not just cruel; it's un-American and possibly one of the worst things I've ever seen this country do to its veterans.

	While the administration tears down real heroes, it is putting racist relics back on pedestals — literally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week announced the return of the Confederate “Reconciliation Monument” to Arlington National Cemetery. The monument, created in 1914 by a Confederate veteran, whitewashes the brutality of slavery and celebrates a rebellion that fought to keep human beings in chains. A bipartisan commission of military leaders recommended its removal in 2022, calling it “problematic from top to bottom.” Now, it will be restored for $10 million, part of a larger project to reinstall Confederate symbols and reverse military base names. 


	This is the state of things after Trump has been in office for barely half of a year. Imagine Trump's America by the time his term is ending.


	The playbook is painfully clear, and the Trump administration has been incredibly successful in executing it across the president's first seven months in office. Replace living heroes with lifeless symbols that tell a distorted version of history. Use state power to punish those who don't conform to the leader's worldview. Convince the public that this is about “pride” or “security,” while consolidating political control. 


	America looks nothing like the country I grew up in during the 1980s. Despite all its flaws back then, today feels bizarre and unrecognizable. The shadow of fascism is spreading, and you need look no further than Trump's attacks on the veteran community and their caretakers at VA.

	Instead of honoring our heroes — at a time when the U.S. military faces historic recruiting challenges — Trump would rather send his goons to recruit other goons to snatch and separate families across the country. His administration has poured billions into expanding and recruiting for its secret police forces, while lowering hiring standards — dropping age limits, scrapping college degree requirements, and even eliminating the polygraph exams that have long been a staple of federal law enforcement vetting.


	It's an age-old story: First they came for others … just hope Trump's time in office ends before they come for you.

The writer and director shares that the story features a TikToker who, "as a joke, says that we should just stop giving birth," in an environment that threatens World War III.

	Slovenian director Kukla, whose debut feature Fantasy world premiered at the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival in the Filmmakers of the Present lineup on Friday, is working on a new project that promises to bring her unique voice to a story about sex, war, TikTok, and the relationship between women and men.


	“My next film is about a potential threat of a third World War,” the writer and director tells THR. “Of course, 99 percent of the world leaders are male, and then a TikToker, as a joke, says that we should just stop giving birth to their children, and we should stop having sex. And then, women all around the world stop having sex with men, and the shit hits the fan.”

	A title or other details of the new project aren't known yet. But Kukla shares: “It's going to be quite different from Fantasy.”


	In Fantasy, a coming-of-age story full of laughs, drama, and twists that centers on three girls who are outsiders and whose lives get turned upside down when they meet a trans woman called Fantasy. The filmmaker has described the movie as a way of “inviting women to see themselves through their own lens rather than through external expectations.”


	Totem Films is handling international sales on the movie, which is a co-production between Slovenia and North Macedonia.


	Kukla, who is also a musician, developed a reputation for directing music videos before making her 2020 short film Sisters, which won the Grand Prix International honor at the Clermont-Ferrand Film Festival and the Audience Award at Premiers Plans d'Angers. She then transformed the short into the feature film Fantasy.

	











	“The process was so difficult that I was like, ‘I'm never going to do another film anymore,'” Kukla shares with THR. And after giving birth, she thought she would need a break. But her creative energy is driving her to work on the new project. Says the filmmaker: “I had this idea for my next film five years ago, and I'm already writing it.”

Tom Hanks paid tribute to Jim Lovell, the astronaut he portrayed in Apollo 13, following news of Lovell's death Friday at the age of 97.


	“There are people who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own. Jim Lovell, who for a long while had gone farther into space and for longer than any other person of our planet, was that kind of guy,” Hanks wrote on social media.

A post shared by Tom Hanks (@tomhanks)


	“His many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive – and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages.”


	Lovell, who was among the first astronauts to orbit the Moon as part of the Apollo 8 mission in 1968, was immortalized on the big screen in director Ron Howard's Best Picture Oscar-nominated 1995 film Apollo 13, which retold the story of the ship's aborted 1970 lunar mission and how Lovell — as the mission commander, played by Hanks —and his crew made their way back to Earth after an oxygen tank explosion disabled their electrical and life support systems.

	











NASA also paid tribute to Lovell, “whose life and work inspired millions of people across the decades. Jim's character and steadfast courage helped our nation reach the Moon and turned a potential tragedy into a success from which we learned an enormous amount.”

We are saddened by the passing of Jim Lovell, commander of Apollo 13 and a four-time spaceflight veteran.Lovell's life and work inspired millions. His courage under pressure helped forge our path to the Moon and beyond—a journey that continues today. https://t.co/AjT8qmxsZI pic.twitter.com/jBlxzgrmSk


	“From a pair of pioneering Gemini missions to the successes of Apollo, Jim helped our nation forge a historic path in space that carries us forward to upcoming Artemis missions to the Moon and beyond,” NASA's statement added. “As the Command Module Pilot for Apollo 8, Jim and his crewmates became the first to lift off on a Saturn V rocket and orbit the Moon, proving that the lunar landing was within our reach. As commander of the Apollo 13 mission, his calm strength under pressure helped return the crew safely to Earth and demonstrated the quick thinking and innovation that informed future NASA missions.


	Hanks' tribute concluded Friday, “On this night of a full Moon, he passes on – to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars. God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.”

The modern executive overreach of wannabe moguls has spanned media companies both traditional, like Warner Bros., and nascent, like Amazon. But no matter which fleece-vested Scrooge has decided that they know how to do someone else's job, it comes with the same exhausting, creatively bankrupt problems. For example, in Brad Stone's book Amazon Unbound: Jeff Bezos And The Invention Of A Global Empire—released in 2021 but once again making the rounds online—the author describes how the MBA version of the earthworm from James And The Giant Peach envisions a checklist-driven kind of storytelling. “Look, I know what it takes to make a great show,” Jeff Bezos reportedly told his studio head. “This should not be that hard. All of these iconic shows have basic things in common.” As a man with three IMDb acting credits to his name, he should know. Bezos then listed 12 elements “off the top of his head” that should be included in every Amazon Studios TV production—or else.

That got us thinking: Does Bezos' broad set of arbitrary buzzwords also apply to Amazon Original movies? Could one find all the half-baked ideas leaking from his AI-addled brain in any piece of the streamer's media output? Say, for example, the company's widely panned, worst-of-the-year film War Of The Worlds? As the Film Editor of The A.V. Club, I should have better things to do with 90 minutes than watch a particularly unpopular Amazon Prime commercial. And yet, for science, that's just what I did. Below are the dozen surefire ways to make a billionaire-approved piece of media, as per Jeff Bezos. Accompanying them is whether or not they can be found in War Of The Worlds, a screenlife trashterpiece where Ice Cube sits at a computer for an hour-and-a-half and whose climax depends on a successfully completed Amazon delivery.

1. A heroic protagonist who experiences growth and change

The first, and presumably most important piece of Bezos' solved equation for perfect fiction comes from playing a game of Telephone with Joseph Campbell. This pseudo-monomythical champion doesn't have A Thousand Faces in War Of The Worlds. Instead, Ice Cube, who plays Department Of Homeland Security cubicle jockey Will Radford, makes the same face the entire film. An avatar of the surveillance state, Radford has access to magical levels of technology yet is constantly Boomer-baffled by pretty much everything that dances across his screen. Almost every line is “What?” or “Damn!” and Cube maintains a permanent cringe, as if—despite what the audience sees on his screen—he's watching a feature-length compilation of people getting hit in the balls.

But let's break this down: Is Radford a hero? War Of The Worlds makes this extremely clear, ending with—and this is not a joke—this universe's version of Joe Rogan tweeting out a YouTube video entitled “Heroes for privacy rights save humanity,” which features Radford in the thumbnail. Not just a hero for saving humanity, but a hero for privacy rights to boot. Take that, the government.

Does he experience growth and change? Radford begins the film as the most surveillance-happy guy on the planet. He's tracking everything and everyone. He's keeping tabs on his daughter's heart rate and eating habits (creepy) and watching whatever's on his teen son's monitor (playing with fire). He's even got eyes on his daughter's boyfriend, who just happens to be an Amazon delivery driver. (This latter character is also a hero, completing a literal Prime order via miraculous drone flight.) By the end of the paranoid film, though, Radford realizes that he needs to loosen his grip on his kids a little, and to stop spying on random civilians for fun. Sure, he comes to this conclusion thanks to a cataclysmic intergalactic force, lured to Earth by a technofascist conspiracy lurking within America's own security forces, but at least he gets there.

A final note regarding growth: As Radford gets longer and longer speeches, he sounds like he's just learning how to read, with Cube's off-screen delivery moving with the shaky cadence of someone following the script's words with their finger.

2. A compelling antagonist

War Of The Worlds understands the simple economics of tech execs: Two villains are twice as good as one. First, there's the onslaught of robotic aliens who “eat data.” Then, the film tries to one-up the ugly tripods with Clark Gregg, the traitorous Director Of The Department Of Homeland Security, who presumably does not eat data. Him not eating data is a critical error, as this is the best and funniest thing about the towering aliens. The ghost of H.G. Wells is admitting creative defeat; he may have dreamed up these marauding beasts, but he could've never imagined that they came to our planet in order to eat Ice Cube's old Facebook photos.

Though the destruction wreaked by these monsters is contained to amateurish CGI and ludicrous news infographics charting the mounting casualties, nothing is more engaging than the idea that they're munching on JPEGs. “Data is food for the superior intelligence that invaded Earth,” is said with almost the same cadence as “The bones are the skeleton's money.” At one point the tripods go into “hyper download.” Trying to parse whatever is meant by this is infinitely more compelling than Gregg FaceTiming in from his home gym to confirm that his character is evil.

3. Wish fulfillment (e.g., the protagonist has hidden abilities, such as superpowers or magic)

Despite what his daughter tells him, Radford does have an incredible amount of power. His single-monitor desktop, with its dozens of tabs and windows, boasts some of the best and strangest movie technology ever put to screen. Radford can type pretty much anything into a nebulous and omnipotent search function, with hyper-specific keywords like “Domestic Terror Suspect Watchlist” and “David Radford's Location” and “WAR map” all immediately granting him what he wants to see. He can also right click anywhere on his screen and find an amazing amount of specific options in a dropdown menu, like “commandeer drone” and “show sensitive government targets.” He can highlight TikTok screenshots of aliens and analyze them with the same program he uses to remotely hijack a Tesla—DHS has some incredible software. In this world, computers are like the genies that tech bros imagine AI to be. Technology is whatever you need it to be, all a single click away.

4. Moral choices

How much surveillance is too much surveillance? This libertarian nightmare can't quite decide, though this is the central ethical question lurking amid the alien-driven destruction. An anonymous hacker named Disrupter helps nudge Radford in the right direction here, moving him away from the privacy-invading ways of the government and towards a white-hat ethos summed up by an incredible image of Ice Cube Photoshopped into a kind of digital hooded cloak, above the words “Join the Rebellion.”

5. Diverse world-building (different geographic landscapes)

Technically, War Of The Worlds takes place entirely on a single computer screen. We're effectively looking at Ice Cube, having a bad day at the office and watching War Of The Worlds on his laptop while doing three or four other things. This is how streamers assume everyone watches movies now anyway, so this film figured it'd cut out the middle man. But, thanks to a little movie magic and endless amounts of stock footage, War Of The Worlds escapes its COVID Zoom-movie confines and travels across the world. It's not at Fake Blockbuster levels of tourism, but, as reported over Microsoft Teams by Eva Longoria, who plays a woman known as Sandra NASA, the attack had “Global impacts! Every country hit.” To reemphasize this very specific and silly point, a childlike news report claims that “The world's governments have finally put aside their differences in an effort to protect the home planet.”

6. Urgency to watch next episode (cliffhangers)

This one is a bit tricky considering the parameters of the experiment. War Of The Worlds isn't a TV show and therefore lacks episodes. And yet, because each story beat is so detached from logic, there is a level of urgency because one truly is never sure what to expect next. While TV episodes must break their plotlines down into connected questions and answers, each new sentence in War Of The Worlds offers unpredictable suspense.

7. Civilizational high stakes (a global thread to humanity like an alien invasion or a devastating pandemic)

This is pretty much right down the middle for Bezos: H.G. Wells' War Of The Worlds is perhaps the most famous alien invasion story ever told, inspiring Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg to greatness. In Rich Lee, the first-time feature director who helmed the music video for Michael Bublé's “Haven't Met You Yet,” it inspires almost total stillness. As Radford watches a “live update” of the war's progression—his mystical DHS program tracking worldwide “units in deployment,” “hostiles defeated,” and more—he deadpans “That's a lot” when confronted with the mounting casualties. And the point can't be made clearly enough: These aliens are here to eat our data, which the film reminds its audience is humanity's “most precious resource.”

8. Humor

I laughed more during the first 20 minutes of this film than I did through the entirety of the new Naked Gun.

9. Betrayal

Again, the film demonstrates that one example of each of these traits is far less potent than two. Not only is Radford's aforementioned DHS boss actually a baddie, somehow activating even more surveillance than exists at his employees' fingertips (“We now have the ability to predict every person's thoughts and movements,” he claims), but that Anonymous-like hacker The Disruptor is revealed to be…Radford's own son! How he hid that from his unscrupulous creep of a dad is unclear, but it's a necessary treachery that eventually gets Radford away from the government. 

10. Positive emotions (love, joy, hope)

While much of the film rests on Cube's nearly emotionless face, Radford has two main expressions of joy: One is when he shouts “Touchdown!” after he logs back into his computer after briefly being locked out, and the other is when he repeatedly presses a “That was easy” button.

11. Negative emotions (loss, sorrow)

As one may expect from a sci-fi disaster movie—even one playing out in a series of computer windows—negativity reins for much of the film. The aliens aren't just wiping out thousands of people (including a whole school of kids, as one news report briefly notes), but slurping up all the memories we've foolishly uploaded online. Radford watches photos of his children vanish before his eyes, the final voice memo from his dead wife disappearing from his Facebook message history. While the film feints at a global shutdown driven by our dependence on now-useless machines, it never quite sees it through. Things start working again whenever the script wants them too, which makes it seem like the aliens specifically targeted Radford to inflict emotional pain upon.

12. Violence

While there aren't a lot of fights outside of the random stock footage of military men hup-hup-hupping around, War Of The Worlds does have its fair share of blood, mostly pouring out of Radford's daughter's leg after she's injured by some debris. There are also a handful of explosions (a group of hackers are targeted like a webcam version of Star Wars‘ Order 66), including a few caused by drone-fired missiles in support of a climactic commercial for Prime Air. This sequence literally walks us through Radford placing an order on Amazon for an overpriced 128GB flash drive, with an AI slop description, sold by a third party, and which is available at a lower price from other sellers. Though entirely bloodless, this is perhaps the part of the movie that most clearly chooses violence.

Apologies to the haters and critics, but this airtight analysis clearly demonstrates that War Of The Worlds checks all the boxes. As far as the man signing the checks is concerned, the film is Citizen Kane, which is the only movie guys like him know is supposed to be good. This Jeff Bezosian fever dream, in which his company's exploited delivery drivers rescue hapless federal employees—and the entire world—from the overstepping follies of Big Government, is also an essential demonstration of a tech executives' idea of art. Not only does its ridiculously cliched script pay lip service to each of these spreadsheet-ready categories, but it does so by overpromising and misunderstanding basic functions of computers and phones. That's Silicon Valley 101, and so-bad-it's-good perfection.

The British star also discussed her days doing stand-up to “get rid of herpes and Margaret Thatcher” during a Locarno Film Festival talk after receiving an award and world premiering 'Dead of Winter.'


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


Emma Thompson discussed her career, including getting a call from Donald Trump asking her on a date, her days doing stand-up comedy, including jokes about herpes and Margaret Thatcher, Sense and Sensibility, and the Monica Lewinsky scandal playing out during the Primary Colors shoot in Locarno, Switzerland on Saturday.


	She appeared in front of a huge and hugely excited crowd after, on Friday evening, joining the likes of Faye Dunaway, Mia Farrow, Andy García, Adrien Brody, Meg Ryan, Hilary Swank, Daisy Edgar-Jones, and Irène Jacob as a recipient of the Locarno Film Festival‘s Leopard Club Award on the Swiss town's picturesque Piazza Grande. The Friday evening world premiere and awards ceremony was such a hot ticket in town that security had to turn people away when the square reached capacity.

	At Saturday's talk, all seats were filled well ahead of the event, with more people crowding around outside the seating area to catch a glimpse of the star.


	The Monica Lewinsky scandal happened while she made Primary Colors. “Poor Monica,” she said, explaining the atmosphere on set this way: “The thing that we're making a film about is happening in real life. So that was very, very strange.”


	Staying with the topic of U.S. politics, Thompson said, “It feels like a long time ago now, doesn't it? Oh, if only we could just have a nice sex scandal and not all this stuff.“ The audience broke into laughter about the joke that was widely understood as a reference to U.S. President Donald Trump.


	Speaking of Trump: Thompson next recalled getting a call from him. “I was in my trailer one day while we were making that movie [Primary Colors], and the phone rang, and it was Donald Trump,” the actress recalled. “I didn't know the number of the phone. No one had rung me on it before, and I said, ‘Hello.' ‘Hi, this is Donald Trump here,' and I thought it was a joke. And then I said, ‘How can I help you?,' thinking maybe he needed directions.”

	











	Thompson said Trump responded by saying: “I'd love you to come and stay at one of my beautiful places. Maybe we could have dinner.” Her response: “Well, that's very sweet. Thank you so much. I'll get back to you.” Continued Thompson: “And then I realized that on that day, my divorce, my divorce decree, you know, the final papers of my divorce had come through. And I thought I bet he's got people looking for suitable people he could take out on his arm, you know, a nice divorcee. That's what he was looking for, and he found the number in my trailer. I mean, that's stalking!” 


	Concluded Thompson: “But I could have gone on a date with Donald Trump, and then I would have a story to tell. I could have changed the course of American history.”


	The star's work in the Harry Potter films also came up, of course. “This is not really an important part of my creative endeavor,” she said, highlighting that she would typically only come in for a few days of shoots rather than being part of the whole production. “I'm really sorry. I don't mean to be rude to those of you who like Harry Potter, but you know, I really came in, did a bit with glasses and hair, and then left, having been quite well paid.” She added: “I'm very grateful to them.”


	Laughs ensued yet again. Speaking of laughter, Thompson recalled her comedy days, including her time doing stand-up.


	“I used to say that herpes and Margaret Thatcher were both very difficult to get rid of, which is a joke that still stands to this day,” she said.

	











	“When I was a comedian, I wrote a television series, which was a series of comedy sketches,” Thompson also recalled on Saturday. ”One of the sketches was about a Victorian woman who comes home to see her mother, and she's asking her mother about a problem she's got with her husband, who appears to have a small creature attached to his body, and she doesn't know what it is… Of course, he's talking about his penis, and she has no education at all, she doesn't know what sex is.”


	Concluded Thompson: “It's about sexual ignorance, but it's funny. So the producer of Sense and Sensibility saw this sketch and thought, this woman can adapt Jane Austen.” After the audience broke into laughter, the star added: “I think it is a very interesting sort of connection that I wrote a comedy sketch about somebody's very unfortunate sex life, and that led to Sense and Sensibility. That's so weird.”


	After the British star received the honor, her new film, action-thriller Dead of Winter, directed by Brian Kirk, world premiered on the third evening of the 78th edition of the fest. Written by Nicholas Jacobson-Larson and Dalton Leeb, the film also stars Judy Greer, Marc Menchaca, Thompson's daughter Gaia Wise, Lloyd Hutchinson, and Brían F. O'Byrne. Thompson is also an executive producer on it.


	Thompson plays a widowed fisherwoman who travels alone through snowbound northern Minnesota and interrupts the kidnapping of a teenage girl. “Hours from the nearest town and with no phone service, she realizes that she is the young girl's only hope,” reads a synopsis.

	











	On Saturday, Thompson Most women I know are incredibly heroic” and have to be “living in a patriarchy,” she said.


	“The one thing that really scared me, genuinely scared me, was not running about, although I did pull every single muscle in my body,” Thompson had told a press conference on Friday. Her biggest fear had to do with going under water, she shared.


	The Leopard Club, the supporting association of the Locarno Film Festival, presents the Leopard Club Award each year to “an individual whose work in the film industry has left its mark on the collective imagination.”


	In unveiling Thompson as this year's recipient in June, Locarno organizers emphasized: “She is the only person in the history of the Academy Awards to have won for both acting and screenwriting. Thompson's willingness to take risks with her roles has meant that she has remained a vital force on stage and screen for four decades, a testament to the depth of affection multiple generations of fans hold for her.”


	During her Friday evening Leopard Club Award acceptance speech, Thompson said she was “a little bit overwhelmed” and charmed the crowd with her Italian, as you can see in the video below. Her daughter Gaia also shared some thoughts on her experience on Dead of Winter. The Locarno festival runs through Aug. 16.

Emma Thompson told an intriguing story this morning at the Locarno Film Festival, where this year she is a guest of honor, that featured what she described as a creepy encounter with the 47th President, Donald Trump. 


	Speaking to a packed audience for a career Q&A, Thompson was asked about shooting the 1998 Mike Nichols feature Primary Colors. One day on the film's set, Thompson said she was sitting in her trailer when the phone rang. 


	“It was Donald Trump. He said, ‘Hello, this is Donald Trump?'. I thought it was a joke and asked, ‘How can I help you? Maybe he needed directions from someone,” Thompson joked.

	The veteran British actress continued: “And then he said, ‘I'd love you to come and stay at one of my beautiful places. Maybe we could have dinner.' I said, well, that's very sweet. Thank you so much. I'll get back to you.” 




			Watch on Deadline		







	Imitating Trump's unique speaking voice, Thompson said she was initially confused why the former Apprentice host called her or how he found the number to her trailer phone. But she quickly connected the dots. 


	“I realized that on that day, my divorce decree had come through,” Thompson said. “And I bet he's got people looking for suitable people he could take out on his arm. You know, a nice divorcee, that's what he was looking for. And he found the number in my trailer. I mean, that's stalking.” 


	Thompson added: “I could have gone on a date with Donald Trump, and then I would have a story to tell. I could have changed the course of American history.” 


	Elsewhere during the session, Thompson spoke about multiple titles in her filmography, including Richard Curtis' Love Actually. Thompson said she is continually confused by the film's popularity because of its formal peculiarities.


	“I mean, it's honestly a constant source of astonishment to me that that film lasted, not that I don't like the film. I like it very much, but it's weird,” she said. Pointing to the now-viral moment in the film when her character finds out that her partner had been unfaithful, Thompson said he believes it “touched a nerve because we get a heartbreak, especially women, we have to hide it because we don't want people to see it.”  

	











	“So really, what moves you is not her crying. It's her covering it up afterwards and then tidying the bed and going downstairs and being cheerful,” Thompson said. 


	When quizzed on her role in Harry Potter, however, Thompson was less interested in her analyzing performance. 


	“It's not really an important part of my creative endeavors. I'm really sorry. I don't even be rude to those of you who like Harry Potter, but you know, I came in, did a bit with glasses and a lot of hair, and then left having been quite well paid,” she said to loud laughs from the Locarno audience. 


	Thompson was handed the Leopard Club Award for career achievement last night in Locarno. The festival runs until August 16.

Elsa Kremser and Levin Peter's drama about a model and a mysterious loner relied on the improvisation of its two stars, Marya Imbro and Mikhail Senkov. 


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


	It all started with a visit to a morgue in Belarus. (Just in case you're wondering: No, the writer of these lines has never started an article with those words.) White Snail, the new movie from directors Elsa Kremser and Levin Peter, which world premiered in competition at the 78th edition of the Locarno Film Festival on Friday, is different, to say the least.“A Belarusian model dreaming of a career in China finds herself drawn to a mysterious loner who works the night shift at a morgue,” reads a synopsis of the movie, which stars Marya Imbro and Mikhail Senkov as Masha and Misha, respectively. “Their encounter unsettles her sense of body, beauty and mortality.” The film promises ”the fragile love story of two outsiders who turn each other's worlds upside down and discover that they are not alone.”

	Kremser and Peter, in a directors' statement, also describe the story as “a turning point in two young lives in Belarus — a moment of defiance against stigma and exclusion.” And they add: “Open questions about a future not yet decipherable arise, like something smoldering in the haze of sultry summer nights.”

	Intramovies is handling international sales on the Austrian-German co-production from producersLixi Frank and David Bohun of Panama Film, and Kremser and Peter of RaumZeitFilm.


	Key members of the White Snail team, its stars, who spoke via a translator, its directors, and its producers, met the press and the Locarno audience in two sessions on Friday, sharing the genesis and journey of the movie, which also gives viewers a rare look inside life in Belarus.

	











	Ten years ago, Kremser met the Senkov as an artist when attending the Minsk Film Festival. “He invited us to the morgue,” she recalled. “For the first time in my life, I saw a dead body. And 10 minutes after this encounter, which was already very impressive and special, he showed me his apartment, which, as you see in the movie, was full of huge paintings. And one of them was of a girl who tried to [die] by suicide and survived.”


	Peter said he was fascinated when he heard about the meeting with Senkov. “I wanted to see his perspective,” he shared. “I wanted to see what this man sees.” 


	Then Imbro joined the mix after the directors looked, including on social media, for a young woman in Belarus who they found interesting and engaging. “We found Masha, and again, a whole new universe appeared to us from this moment on,” Peter explained. “We spent time with both of them, seeing a lot of their life, what is around them, and took a lot of time to build the [story] and the script.”


	That story for the romantic drama was developed based on the lives and experiences of the two stars. 


	Asked about being an actor, Senkov shared that opening up about his life on screen wasn't difficult for him. “It didn't require any particular courage, because in this story, there is nothing that is not me,” he said. “It's just me on screen.”


	The experience was very different for Imbro. “It was a difficult task for me, because I was asked to show myself, which took quite a lot of energy and a lot of trust,” she explained. “In regular life, I don't show my emotions, but this time, I had to sort of show what I am.”

	











	The directors surprised the audience by revealing the film had no script, and was largely improvised. “All the dialogs, all the content spoken in the film is really Masha and Misha's,” Kremser said. “There was no scripted dialog. It was all improvised. They met on the first joint shooting day. That was their real first encounter.”


	As if there weren't enough challenges, Bohun pointed out how the lack of direct plane access to Belarus created logistical headaches. “You have to enter the country by car, where a three-hour car ride is [needed between] two cities, and the [whole trip] can take up to 18 hours because of all the procedures. So, from a producer's perspective, yeah, it was a high-risk production. We had Plan A, Plan B, Plan C.”


	Kremser said the film's title came about late in the process: “The snail idea really comes from Masha's life. Her real mother was buying snails” as a skincare treatment, just like in the movie. Masha was telling us that she, one time, used this as a treatment, but then she didn't like it anymore. So yeah, they found their way and were really crawling into this film.” Added Peter: “Snails are so vulnerable in general, but a white snail even more so.”


	Speaking of vulnerability, how was the first meeting between the two stars? “The first encounter was very brief. I just blinked,” Imbro recalled. “We almost didn't talk,” Senkov shared. “We just looked at each other, and I saw that we were profoundly different, and yet there was something profound we had in common, and so I understood that we would click.”

	As Dems attempt to mount a comeback for 2028, Stephen A. Smith is still flirting with the idea of a presidential campaign.


	While appearing on Real Time with Bill Maher, the NBA analyst admitted that although he “can't imagine” running for president, it remains a “possible” option for him after previous talks of a pivot to public office. 


	“Listen, life is good, man. I mean, I leave the door open,” he told Maher. “I can't imagine myself doing it, but I haven't ruled it out, because I'm disgusted with what I'm seeing on the left.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Smith added, “I look at the national voice for the Democratic Party, it is non-existent. As far I'm concerned, a damn construction worker could win the Democratic nomination right now, as bad as it is for the Democratic party. They better get their act together. And excuse my language, but they are in for an ass-kicking if they don't get their act together. The party is in disarray. New leadership.”

	











	In April, Smith shared an article about speculation of his political plans, confirming he is “officially leaving all doors open” for a 2028 run. “Time to stop messing around,” he wrote in part. “Hate the thought of being a politician. But sick of this mess.”


	Smith later told Deadline he has “no intentions” of running for president. “I'm leaving my options open, but in the same breath, I have no desire to be a politician at all,” he said in May.


	“I'm living a pretty good life. I just signed a new contract with ESPN. I'm acting on General Hospital now. I'm acting on Law & Order,” Smith continued. “My life is pretty damn good. Why would I ruin it by being a politician? So that's my initial response. But, in the end, you never know what God has planned for you, so you just leave your options open, and that's what I'm doing.”


	The interview came after Deadline reported in March that he signed a five-year $100 million deal with ESPN. In June, he also signed on to host two new shows for SiriusXM.

New York mayor, Stephen. Become the mayor of New York if you're looking to do some good.

I guess we now know that the “A” stands for.

Just what the country needs, another unqualified big mouth.

Disgusted by the Dems but what? The fascist GOP looks so inviting? Why does it seem like part of the Bill Maher schtick now — guests or host — is to just bash Dems to be contrary?

The same Stephen A. Smith who gave Candace Owens airtime twiceto push conspiracy theories without meaningful pushback? Spare me the presidential talk. He's not running on integrity, he's running on brand expansion.

This isn't leadership, it's a grift dressed up as political playmaking.
And let's not forget: Bob Iger handed him a $100 million platform on ESPN while laying off workers across Disney to help fund it.

This is what passes for “serious voices” in media now? No thanks.

I couldn't believe his lack of response to Smith's claim that Trump has helped to end three wars. As far as I can tell, Trump wants Ukraine to surrender, and he told Netanyahu to commit genocide. His illegal attack on Iran may have worked but we don't know for sure. We do know that he didn't bother to even consult with the eight members of Congress that he's required to notify before taking such an action, which makes me very nervous. His King complex seems to be growing into a God complex. If he starts to think that military action is going to get him a third term, we're in deeper shit internationally than we are domestically.

The Summer Of Pedro Pascal may finally have broken, as the Eddington—and Fantastic Four—and Materialists—star has finally relented in his need to be in all movies, at all times. Sure, 2026 has the potential to be just as heavy, what with The Mandalorian And Grogu in May and Avengers: Doomsday at the end of the year. But there's at least a bit of a lull now in Pascal's campaign to be as many different forms of cinematically charming as it's possible for a man to be.

Or is there?! Deadline reports that the cinematic tyrant has now cruelly started lining up new movies to fill the Hollywood schedule with, and specifically a new movie from Andor showrunner Tony Gilroy. This is Behemoth!, which Gilroy recently landed at Disney's Searchlight Pictures—right around the same time that certain sites were reporting that Oscar Isaac had dropped out of the project due to scheduling issues. Pascal has now apparently slid into the conversation to star as the film's lead, reportedly a cellist who begins working on music for movies, and thus beginning the cycle of “Pedro Pascal Is In Goddamned Everything” all over again.

Gilroy is running on a nice head of steam at the moment, fresh off making something genuinely fascinating out of what could have been a simple piece of Star Wars backstory. It has, admittedly, been more than a decade since he last directed a film—The Bourne Legacy, his third, after Duplicity and Michael Clayton—but he's clearly got enough clout with Disney to make sense out of the company giving the nod to return to the writer/director chair. Normally we'd suggest that pairing up with a known quantity like Pascal could only help those efforts, but the man might genuinely be on the verge of going from “known quantity” to “literally actually in everything,” which might spread out the merits of getting him on board just a little bit.

Malcolm-Jamal Warner's heartbroken mother is finally speaking out about her son's tragic death last month.

Warner drowned during a family vacation in Costa Rica July 20 when he was caught in a rip tide.

Now, nearly three weeks later, his mother Pamela Warner has summoned the strength to speak out about his passing. And she's doing it by honoring her son.

In an Instagram post, Pamela announced the “Malcolm-Jamal Warner Living Legacy” Instagram account. There she writes, “This is the official account honoring Malcolm-Jamal Warner, lovingly run by his mother, Pamela Warner.”

The first post on the account shows a picture of her late son smiling widely. Beside it, Pamela wrote, “In the weeks and months ahead, we'll be sharing updates on the work being done in his memory. Thank you for being here and staying connected.”

The description of the new Instagram account honoring Malcolm-Jamal Warner says, “Official account honoring Malcolm-Jamal Warner. A space dedicated to celebrating his legacy and sharing updates on upcoming initiatives in his name.”

In her second post, mom Pamela put up a touching tribute to her 54-year-old son that reads, “He was a kind, loving man with a huge heart for humanity. He wanted all to be aware of their inner strength and that they could succeed, accomplish and transform. This was his latest mission and work, transformation, in order for you to be fully present in your life.”

In the post, Pamela called her son an “exceptional husband, father, and son — a man deeply in love with life, his wife, and his daughter.”

His mom went on, “He was not only my son, but also my teacher, coach, confidant, business partner, and best friend. He was the son that his father was immensely proud of and loved fiercely and unconditionally.” Pamela continued, “He was in love with the magic of being an actor, always studying and honing his craft. Though he began his musical journey a little later in life, at 26, he excelled as a bassist and formed his own band, Miles Long.”

“A poet as well as a musician, he released four albums — two Grammy-nominations and one Grammy award. At eight years old, after his first stage performance, he declared that being on stage was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. It became a self-fulfilling prophesy,” she continued.

“Malcolm left an indelible mark on the world and on countless hearts. All who met him, however briefly, were better for the encounter.”

In a second slide in her tribute to her son, Pamela turns her attention to those grieving her son's loss along with her. 

She writes, “”As his mother, there is so much that I can say. It would fill volumes. But what I will say, is that I am so very blessed that he chose me to be his mother, to come into the world through the waters of my womb. It is an honor and blessing that will be with me all the days of my life.”

“For those of you who are at a loss, pained by the suddenness of his departure, ache for his presence or just to hear his voice one more time, to see his beatific smile one more time, be comforted that he was at peace and more importantly, he did not suffer. Malcolm was birthed through water and transitioned through water. This was his time. His mission on earth had been completed.”

“Hold close to whatever part of Malcolm's life that touched yours. In keeping it near, you keep his spirit alive — nourishing you with the peace, love, joy and light that embodied Malcolm-Jamal Warner,”

Fans and friends were quick to comment, honoring “The Cosby Show” star.

Yvette Nicole Brown commented, “Ms. Warner, thank you for creating and sharing this page and your amazing son with the world. I'm sure I speak for so many when I say we can't even FATHOM the profound loss you, his father, his wife and dear daughter are feeling. Those of us who are fans or were blessed to call him friend will never be the same. 💔 Thanks for creating a space for us all to remember and speak his name and share in order to continue to honor that great, kind, brilliantly talented man. ❤️ Sending all the love and respect a heart can hold to you and your family.”

A fan wrote, “What a beautiful post. He was a very kind and humble human being and im sure it was because he had parents like you and his father. My heart aches for both of you as well as his wife and daughter and the rest if his family and friends. I still feel a heaviness/sadness. Your beautiful post will help us to move on with some peace knowing he did not suffer.”

	Although he didn't make the final cut of I Know What You Did Last Summer, perhaps Nicholas Alexander Chavez will live to see another sequel.


	Following his and Lola Tung‘s scene getting cut from writer/director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson‘s requel to the 1997 teen slasher film, the Emmy winner shared his reaction and whether he'd return for a future installment.


	“I mean, Jennifer is a good friend,” he told Us Weekly. “She's really, really cool people, and, you know, me and Lola had a really, really good time. But, like, look — that's filmmaking.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Chavez added, “All I could think about was my time that I spent in Australia, which was hanging out with kangaroos, going on hot air balloon adventures over the plains at sunrise, going cherry picking with my girlfriend. That's actually all I remember when I think about that movie.”

	











	When asked which character he played in the deleted scene, Chavez said, “That's left to other people!”


	And with the possibility of a sequel heavily hinted in the final scenes, the actor sounds open to giving the horror franchise another go.


	“You know, ask me tomorrow, I'll have a million different answers for you,” said Chavez. “The only thing that matters at this point in my career is just doing good material with people who I love and people who I believe in and who believe in me.”


	After Deadline exclusively reported Chavez and Tung's casting in IKWYDLS, Robinson recently explained why their characters didn't end up on the screen.

	











	“In every movie, it's best laid plans, and then you edit the movie and you put it together and you go, ‘I love this in a vacuum. This is a fantastic scene. But it doesn't fit in the movie,'” she told People. “It was just one of those situations where it had nothing to do with Lola and Nicholas — they are both so fantastic. I really would love to work with them again. I loved working with them. They did a fabulous job. But in the larger tapestry of the film, it just didn't fit.”


	Robinson said the decision “sucks because you don't want to do that to those actors,” adding: “And it sucks when you love something as a scene but that scene just doesn't work in the final cut of the film.”

	Although Eddie Murphy worked with Beyoncé and Jennifer Hudson in the aughts, he might have been his own favorite leading lady.


	The Oscar nominee recently defended his 2007 comedy Norbit as a “funny” movie, following theories that the Brian Robbins-directed movie cost him the golden statuette for Dreamgirls (2006).


	“I love Norbit. Norbit came out right after I got that Oscar nomination. There were articles like, ‘How can he get an Oscar, he did this?' They're two different movies,” he explained to Complex.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“I wrote Norbit with my brother, Charlie [Murphy], and we think Norbit is funny,” added Murphy. “Here's the thing with Norbit; it came out and they gave me Razzie Awards for worst actress, worst actor and worst actor of the decade. And I was like, ‘Come on now, shit ain't that bad.' I like Norbit. To this day, I like Norbit. There's stuff in Norbit that makes me laugh.”

	











Norbit starred Murphy as the titular mild-mannered pushover who rekindles a romance with his childhood sweetheart Kate (Thandiwe Newton) after he's forced to marry the overbearing Rasputia (also Murphy). In addition to the aforementioned Razzies, Murphy also won Worst Supporting Actor for his performance as Chinese orphanage owner Mr. Wong.


	And despite the movie's 9% Tomatometer rating on Rotten Tomatoes, Norbit opened at the top of the box office and surpassed $159 million worldwide. Murphy's Rasputia and Mr. Wong transformations also earned the movie an Oscar nomination for Best Makeup.


	Playing James ‘Thunder' Early in the Bill Condon-helmed movie musical adaptation of Broadway's Dreamgirls, Murphy earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, which was ultimately awarded to Alan Arkin for Little Miss Sunshine.

That's the problem with Hollywood. It takes itself WAY too seriously while the adults in the room can't be bothered.

I still enjoy Norbit and have seen it often in the top 10 of whichever streaming service it goes to.

Yeah I don't know why the interviewer brought up Norbit. Norbit was well-liked by audiences at release. Eddie mentioned Pluto Nash and Holy Man as being his worst but those aren't bad either. It's easy to point at Pluto Nash because of it's box office failure but it's a pretty enjoyable film. Holy Man is fun for the behind the scenes of a QVC-like  network. As a huge Eddie Murphy fan my choice for the worst is Imagine That, it's like a mean-spirited Daddy Day Care.

Meet Dave and 1000 Words aren't great either.

Brian Wilson loved Norbit, and that's good enough for me.

First of all, if it is true that is not fair and should be another nail in the coffin of the academy awards reputation, the people voting are supposed to judge the nominated films, if an actor, director, producer makes another film that is garbage why should they be punished for that?

New Line's Final Destination franchise seemed to be pretty revitalized by its 14-year power nap: May's Final Destination: Bloodlines, which woke Death and its various Rube Goldberg murder machinations up after a decade-plus break, turned out to be the most successful installment of the series to date, making $285 million off of a measly $50 million budget. And while it can be difficult to predict what combination of ostensibly safe home consumer goods Death will choose to strike its hapless victims with next, the plans of major movie studios are a lot easier to predict. Because that's sequel money, baby.

This is according to THR, which reports that New Line's owners, Warner Bros., have now officially greenlit a Final Destination 7. That includes tapping Lori Evans Taylor, who co-wrote Bloodlines with Scream and Ready Or Not writer Gary Busick, to write the script for the new movie, presumably lining up a whole new batch of cattle for the thresher. There's no word yet on casting, but that, of course, is part of the appeal of the Destination films: Outside Tony Todd (who passed away shortly after filming his part for Bloodlines) the franchise has such a relentlessly high bodycount that finding return passengers isn't ever really a problem. You just need a writer capable of crafting enough ludicrous ways for people to get themselves killed in supposedly safe situations—and a few ultimately futile ways for the flies to struggle in their web of destiny—and Taylor has pretty clearly shown a knack for devising those.

Although it's never been the biggest of the long-running horror franchises, Final Destination has managed to truck along pretty well over the years: It's currently sitting at a combined total of $983 million at the global box office, meaning one more film should push it—like so many loose timbers being nudged off the back of a poorly secured truck—over the billion-dollar mark.

The former ‘Superman' actor recently criticized James Gunn's adaptation after he said “Superman is the story of America … an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country.”


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



John Leguizamo is slamming Dean Cain after the actor said he's going to become an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent.


	“What kind of loser volunteers to be an ICE officer?” the Moulin Rouge! star said in a Friday Instagram video. “What a moron. Dean Cain, your pronouns are has/been.”




	Cain previously starred as Clark Kent/Superman in the 1990s TV show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. The actor revealed on Wednesday that he was planning to be “sworn in as an ICE agent, ASAP” on Fox News' Jesse Watters Primetime.

	“I put out a recruitment video yesterday — I'm actually a sworn deputy sheriff and a reserve police officer — I wasn't part of ICE, but once I put that out there and you put a little blurb on your show, it went crazy,” he said on the show. “So now I've spoken with some officials over at ICE, and I will be sworn in as an ICE agent, ASAP.”

	Cain continued, “We have a broken immigration system. Congress needs to fix it, but in the interim, President Trump ran on this. He is delivering on this. This is what people voted for. It's what I voted for, and he's going to see it through, and I'll do my part and help make sure it happens.”


	The former Superman lead recently criticized James Gunn's adaptation of the iconic superhero, pointing to the director's comments noting that “Superman is the story of America … an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country.” 

	











	“How woke is Hollywood going to make this character?” Cain asked in an interview with TMZ. “How much is Disney going to change their Snow White? Why are they going to change these characters to exist for the times?”


	Leguizamo is a longtime advocate for diversity and representation in the entertainment industry. At the 2024 Emmys, the actor celebrated the diverse slate of nominees while also calling for additional change. 


	“I'm one of Hollywood's DEI hires. That's right, DEI. The ‘D' is for diligence, the ‘E' is for excellence, the ‘I' is for imagination,” he said. “And everyone in this room tonight has dedicated their lives to diligence, excellence and imagination, so we are all DEI hires. What a beautiful diverse group this is tonight.”


	The actor later added, “For years I didn't complain about the limited roles my people were offered… Turns out not complaining doesn't change anything. So for the past few years, I've been complaining.”

The Irish rap trio went after the Norwegian government over its investments, which are currently under scrutiny, at Øyafestivalen.

	Irish rap group Kneecap – which has drawn a storm of criticism, support, attention and legal action over the past half-year – continued to speak out about the war in Gaza during an afternoon set at the Øyafestivalen in Oslo, Norway, on Friday (Aug. 8).


	Right before the trio of Mo Chara, Móglaí Bap and DJ Próvaí took the stage, an English-language white-text-on-black-background message played on a video screen, accusing the Norwegian government of “enabling” the “genocide” against the Palestinian people via investments held in the county's sovereign wealth fund (referenced as “oil pension fund” in the message). “Over 80,000 people have been murdered by Israel in 21 months,” the band's message continued. “Free Palestine.” The message was greeted readily by a cheering audience. Most estimates (including those from health officials in the area) place the Palestinian death toll at more than 60,000. That number does not distinguish between civilians and Hamas militants. An estimated 18,500 of those killed were children.

	











	While conflict between Israel and Palestinian territory has been ongoing for decades, the conflict escalated on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants entered Israel and killed 1,200 people, more than 800 of whom were civilians, and took 251 hostages, at least 40 of whom have been killed; around 50 hostages, both dead and alive, remain unreleased. Israel's ensuing invasion of Gaza has killed an estimated 60,000 and led to an ongoing humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced and facing starvation. Gaza health authorities have reported that almost 200 people have died of hunger since the conflict began and the United Nations has estimated that some 1300 were killed while seeking food, though Israel has frequently disputed the UN's figures. Israel's security cabinet recently approved a plan to take complete control of Gaza City and forcibly relocate at least 600,000 Palestinians, a move decried by many world leaders.

	











	The Norwegian government's connection to the war in Gaza is complicated. While Norway has broken with the United States and Israel by recognizing Palestine as a state, the Government Pension Fund of Norway – which invests surplus revenues from the country's petroleum industry and has more than $1.9 trillion in assets – is under scrutiny after a recent piece by Aftenposten, Norway's largest printed newspaper, reported that the sovereign wealth fund invested around $15.2 million in Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd., a jet engines parts manufacturer supplying the Israeli military, between 2023-2024. While Norway's Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg has ruled out wholesale divestment of Israeli companies, the newspaper's revelation spurred the government to launch a review of the sovereign wealth portfolio to ensure that it was not investing in Israeli companies contributing to the war in Gaza.


	Halfway through the Belfast group's hour-long performance, they offered up more detailed thoughts on Norway's purported connection to the conflict. “I don't have to lecture you people,” said Kneecap's Mo Chara, wearing a keffiyeh. “I can understand there's people here like, ‘All right, we get it, I'm sick of yous going on.' I wish I didn't have to talk about this, I wish I didn't have to get on stage every gig and talk about this. The fact is, as long as we're on stage and as long as nothing is changing, Kneecap will always use this platform and this stage to call out the genocide and the war criminals. I don't need to lecture you people when your oil fund is being used to fund the genocide.” The majority of Kneecap's massive crowd greeted his speech with cheers and applause; many waved Palestinian flags as he spoke. The Israeli government has flatly denied committing genocide against Palestinians, and the term remains hotly debated. Some say those who accuse Israel of genocide are motivated by antisemitism, though two Israel-based human rights organizations recently began adopting the word with regards to the war in Gaza.

	











	Mo Chara gave a “quick shout-out” to Øyafestivalen for “standing by Kneecap” despite calls for its removal from the lineup, but added that he thinks “it's a disgrace and a shame that KKR” – a global investment firm that owns Superstruct Entertainment, which runs Øyafestivalen, among many other international music festivals – “is behind all these festivals. No company investing in Israel while they commit war crimes should be involved in and taking part in music festivals,” he concluded, with the crowd voicing its agreement.


	Criticism of KKR wasn't limited to Kneecap's set. Outside the festival entrance on Friday, a small but vocal group of protestors gathered to urge people to boycott Øyafestivalen over KKR. At a different stage, more than an hour later Kneecap wrapped, Irish rockers D.C. Fontaines flashed an onscreen message of “Free Palestine,” which was also greeted enthusiastically by the crowd.


	Mo Chara is currently facing a terrorism charge from the British government over purportedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in November 2024, where the group allegedly said “up Hezbollah, up Hamas.” Since then, the punk-leaning rap group released a statement declaring “we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah” and described video footage as “deliberately taken out of context.” Mo Chara alluded to the charges during the show, saying, “we love the English people, it's the English government we don't like.” Not long after Kneecap first hit the Øyafestivalen stage, they urged the audience to give them more of a response: “For f—k sake, we're up in court on terrorism charges – give me a bit of energy.”

	











	In July, Kneecap were banned from performing in Hungary over what a Hungarian politician described as “antisemitism and glorifying terror,” calling them a “national security threat.”


	“The authoritarian government of Viktor Orban say we ‘pose a national security threat,'” the group wrote in a statement after the ban. “There is no legal basis for his actions, no member of Kneecap has ever been convicted of any crime in any country. We stand against all hate crimes and Kneecap champions love and solidarity as well as calling out injustices where we see it…. It's clear this is political distraction and a further attempt to silence those who call out genocide against the Palestinian people.”

The movie adaptation of Aleshea Harris' award-winning stage play is from Amazon MGM's prestige label and stars Kara Young, Mallori Johnson, Sterling K. Brown, Vivica A. Fox and Janelle Monáe.


							By

Is God Is has landed an early summer release date from Orion Pictures, a division of Amazon MGM Studios.


	Playwright Aleshea Harris is directing the big screen adaptation of her acclaimed, award-winning stage play of the same name will open in cinemas May 15, 2026. That's just around the time of the Cannes Film Festival, although there's no word yet as to whether the movie will make an awards play, although Orion is known as a home for prestige fare.




Is God Is marks Harris' feature directorial debut, and stars Kara Young (Virgo) and Mallori Johnson (Kindred) as twin African-American sisters who were burned badly as babies in a fire that left them with permanent, disfiguring scars. Now 21 years old, they embark on an epic quest for revenge and, and along the way, confront a charged family history that will push them to extraordinary lengths.

	Janelle Monáe, Erika Alexander, Mykelti Williamson and Josiah Cross co-star, with Vivica A. Fox and Sterling K. Brown also helping to round out the cast.

	Producers include Viva Maude's Tessa Thompson and Kishori Rajan, Lindens' Riva Marker, CYRK's Janicza Bravo alongside Harris. Stacy O'Neil, Nicole King and Kenneth Yu are executive producing.


	Harris wrote the adapted script. The story opens as the twins are living a meager life  in the Northeast. Everything changes when they learn their mother — who is known as “She” or “God” — is actually alive. They travel to her home in the South, when she tells them her father is responsible for the fire that caused both their burns and her own injuries. The mother dispatches them to the California desert to find him and seek retribution.

	











Is God Is, which premiered Off-Broadway in 2018 at the Soho Rep, won multiple Obie awards and quickly caught the attention of top movie producers, such as Thompson. At one point, Scott Rudin and A24 were also interested in pursuing a movie adaptation. 


	It's hardly a surprise why the interest. Two years earlier, Is God Is — still unproduced at that time — won the American Playwriting Foundation's Relentless Award, established in honor of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Harris was praised for her unique take on the revenge genre, and given a cash prize of $45,000, which allowed her to have stage readings across the country.

Matt Rife's status as the new owner of an occult museum has paranormal experts concerned about his plans. 

Critics subtly hinted that the media personality should stick to comedy instead of diving headfirst into a world he knows nothing about. The comedian sparked worries about fans' safety after declaring he would open Ed and Lorraine Warren's infamous Connecticut home to the public.

Matt Rife announced he purchased the home and occult museum with his close pal Elton Castee days earlier. The news followed the shocking death of paranormal investigator Dan Rivera, who had been touring with the terrifying Annabelle doll.

Horror and paranormal fans know the story behind the Warrens' home and occult museum, which houses several terrifying items, including the infamous Annabelle doll. The couple, whose lives and case studies have influenced numerous movies, were reportedly against publicizing their collection.

Chris McKinnell, a paranormal researcher and the grandson of Ed and Lorraine Warren, claimed Rife's plans to open the property for exploration did not align with his late grandparents' goals. 

He stressed that their home “was never meant to be a public attraction” but a “controlled environment ... for education, spiritual research and protection.”

McKinnell implored Rife to consult paranormal experts like himself before moving forward with his public exploration plans, noting he would endanger lives by exposing them to dark forces without adequate protection. He told TMZ:

“We're dealing with forces we don't fully understand. That demands more than curiosity. It demands context, caution, and spiritual responsibility.

McKinnell noted his warning was not to be dismissed, as he foresaw bad things happening when the late Rivera took Annabelle on tour. He had warned the paranormal investigator and fans about the negative impacts of having the doll on the road weeks before Rivera's death.

According to McKinnell, Annabelle warranted caution because the doll has “negative energy attached to it, and it can be deadly.” As Rife is the new owner of the doll and other occult objects in the Warrens' collections, he stressed that the comedian shouldn't underestimate the evil attached to these items.

Philip Siracusa, the former owner of the infamous home, echoed similar sentiments about the dark forces at play. He suspected Rife and his pal were chosen to become the property's new owners for a reason and hoped the pair “will get through this alive.”

Siracusa, like McKinnell, stressed that the Warrens kept their home private for a long time for a good reason. He claimed their collection of occult items wasn't to be trifled with, as they contained a “dark force” that could attach itself to people.

On that note, Siracusa argued that Rife was endangering the public by allowing them to explore the property. He claimed these dark forces could follow people even after leaving the home and feared the worst might happen, saying, “People are going to get hurt. It's a recipe for disaster.”

Rife announced he and his pal, Castee, had purchased the Warrens' home and occult museum early this month. The Blast covered the story, reporting that he planned to open the property for “overnight stays and museum tours” so fans could “experience and learn all the haunted history surrounding this amazing place."

Rife became the new legal guardian of the Warrens' home and occult museum months after silencing the plastic surgery rumors. The Blast shared that he addressed the speculations in his memoir, "Your Mom's Gonna Love Me."

In the book, Rife stressed that he never went under the knife to achieve his chiseled face; instead, his looks stemmed from delayed puberty. He explained that he went from looking like "a 13-year-old" to looking "an actual grown-ish man" within a few months.

In addition to delayed puberty, Rife credited his toned and muscular physique to lifting weights. He claimed he started each day at the gym, revealing fellow comedian Dane Cook as his workout partner. Besides helping him stay fit, Rife noted lifting weights improved his mental health.

Hitting the gym didn't just help Rife obtain excellent physical and mental health, as it seemed to have improved his A-game. The comedian made waves for dating fitness influencer Mariah Morse after they were spotted at a Rhode Island club.

The pair, per TMZ, were seen holding hands as they entered the establishment for what appeared to be a group date. Morse shared pictures from the outing on her Instagram page, capturing her posing next to Rife and their other pals.

Morse also implied her relationship with Rife was serious by sharing a picture with his dog, Hammer, and captioned the cute post, "besties." The blossoming relationship between the pair came months after Rife ended his romance with Jessica Lord last summer.

Is Matt Rife biting off more than he can chew with his paranormal public exploration?

From nearly half thousand attempts to kill Fidel Castro to psychic spy ops from astral projection to feline spies. These are 19 CIA operations that look like scripts for Netflix TV shows. 

A morale-damaging psychological ops idea: drop extra-large condoms labelled “small” into the USSR to suggest physical inferiority.

Poisoned cigars, fungus-infested scuba suits, explosive sea shells, a fake lover to poison, and a ballpoint pen with a tiny poisonous needle were some of the attempts to kill the Cuban communist dictator. These schemes sound like slapstick spy comedy

The Hard Drive retrieved from Bin Laden's safe house had a few licensed movies, anime, and games, all of which were uploaded on the CIA website for anyone who wants to see.

A toy figure of Osama Bin Laden, whose face, when heated, peeled away to reveal a demonic visage. The CIA made three prototypes of these toy; the intention was to scare children to dissuade support

A secret agent, a cat, was trained with a microphone and transmitter within it and then released towards the USSR embassy to spy on them. Tragically, the cat was hit by a car while crossing the road.

CIA brought former Nazi scientists like Wernher von Braun to beat Soviet Russia in the space race.

CIA tried to test the capability of the US against bioweapons by spraying live bacteria over Sanfrancisco without public consent

The US granted immunity to Japanese war criminals in exchange for Japanese human experimentation data.

Allen W. Dulles oversaw a CIA programme which involved mind control experiments using LSD, hypnosis, and sensory deprivation, without any consent, pioneering the psychological horror.

In the 1960s, the CIA started to notice that most of the artists were socialist, communists, and they started funding art galleries and purchasing art at exorbitant prices, thus to prevent them from poverty and romanticising communism/socialism.

The CIA started an operation to recover a Soviet submarine that sank in the North Pacific. Soviets continued to patrol that area, making it difficult. Henry Kissinger asked the CIA to collaborate with Howard Hughes via the Hughes Glomar Explorer, a deep-sea mining vessel. CIA and DoD believed that a salvage operation had the potential to retrieve nuclear submarine-launched ballistic missiles, nuclear torpedoes, code books, and cryptographic gear. But media leaks informed the Soviets of the operation only half was recovered.

This is not declassified, but leaked- including every government the United States has ever tried to replace via terror funding or coup, shaping our modern view of the CIA.

A chilling proposal to stage terrorist acts in the U.S. and blame Cuba, approved by military officials but not the President.

Covert prisons existed across the globe—used for the interrogation of terror suspects in extreme, undisclosed conditions.

In the 1950s CIA conducted research to find out the superstitions of the Philippines, and it was found to be the fear of the Vampire. A murder was staged to look like a vampire attack to terrify villagers and influence elections.

A WWII-era OSS guide describing how to bureaucratically sabotage enemy organisations, from delaying tasks to confusing managers.  

Declassified doc from 1983 detailing the CIA's usage of 'harmonic resonance' to gain access to the astral plane and attempts to talk to God—blurring the lines between mysticism and intelligence. 

A ‘psychic' was brought in, and an envelope was given to him with coordinates and a timeframe on it. They asked him to describe what he saw. He described a dying planet where people had left to discover a new place they could populate. Straight from the DC Comics Superman plot.

In the Vietnam War, CIA helicopters broadcast ghostly voices and eerie sounds, including Buddhist chants, to terrify the Viet Cong.

A paranormal investigator has a chilling concern for Matt Rife after he and his business partner Elton Castee purchased Ed and Lorraine Warren's home and Occult Museum -- he hopes they make it out alive.

TMZ caught up with Philip Siracusa, the former owner of the infamously haunted Horsefly Chronicles home, and he warns that dark energy has a way of manipulating people and feels Matt and Elton were chosen by the home for a reason.

In our clip, he says the Warrens kept the pieces in their home private for so long for good measure ... and simply hopes Matt and Elton "will get through this alive."

He also has worries about allowing the public to stay at the Monroe, Connecticut home, reasoning it's a "risk" to have so many so close to a "dark force" that can attach to humans even after they've exited the property. He warns ... "People are going to get hurt. It's a recipe for disaster."

Chris McKinnell, a paranormal researcher and the grandson of Ed and Lorraine, shares a similar caution about Matt's plan to open the home and Occult Museum to overnight stays and museum tours ... telling TMZ the space "was never meant to be a public attraction" and instead was a "controlled environment ... for education, spiritual research and protection."

He strongly suggests the 'Lucid' comedian consult with paranormal experts like himself to be as prepared as possible, seeing as Matt's the new guardian of the pieces within the museum. He reasons ... "We're dealing with forces we don't fully understand. That demands more than curiosity. It demands context, caution, and spiritual responsibility."

Chris -- who runs The Warren Legacy Foundation for Paranormal Research -- says he feels no ill will towards Matt, and his "intention is to warn the public that the energies in this place can be deadly."

Remember ... these stark warnings come after Dan Rivera -- one of the investigators touring with the infamous Annabelle doll died suddenly last month after wrapping up an appearance in Pennsylvania.

Chris -- who's currently living in Paraguay, making a documentary about his work with Ed and Lorraine -- had been warning folks about the dangers of taking Annabelle on the road for weeks before Dan's death. He told TMZ after Dan's sudden passing there's "negative energy attached to it, and it can be deadly."

Matt is now the guardian of Annabelle ... and he told TMZ after he announced the purchase of the Occult Museum he "will take care of this property and the artifacts within the museum with the utmost care."

GOBEKLI TEPE, Turkey — Tour guide Sabahattin Alkan herds curious tourists through the scorching afternoon heat, luring them with the promise of something far stranger than your typical vacation snap.

"Over here on the right, you see a spaceship landed recently," he says with a grin.

He's joking. Mostly. But more on that in a minute.

We're in the Urfa plain, a dry, dusty stretch about 25 miles from the Turkish-Syrian border.

That "spaceship" is actually just a curved roof. But what lies beneath the dome has sparked decades of mystery, curiosity — and conspiracy.

"It's quite an interesting place, actually," Alkan assures his audience.

He's talking about Gobekli Tepe, one of the oldest known archaeological sites on Earth, dating back nearly 12,000 years.

Alkan points to T-shaped limestone pillars carved with human arms, hands resting on stomachs, and wild animals: lions, foxes, boars, scorpions and birds among them.

Klaus Schmidt, the German archaeologist who led the site's first major excavations in the 1990s, called Gobekli Tepe "the world's oldest temple," theorizing that it brought together nomadic hunter-gatherers from across the Middle East.

Today, that view has shifted. Some now interpret it as a ceremonial gathering site, while others suggest it functioned as a social hub where rituals helped bind together early communities.

Emilie Salvesen, a tour operator visiting the site, says the question of whether there was a spiritual component to the site still fascinates her.

"Did they experience the divine in the way that we might think of it today?" she asks, gesturing toward one of the inscribed pillars. "I imagine it was much more existential."

The truth? Still mostly a mystery.

Scientists are regularly adjusting their hypotheses about the site's intended purpose. And it's not an easy investigation.

"Whatever we tell now, I don't know if it will be accurate information or not, because maybe our idea will change in another 50 years," Alkan says. "We're trying to predict 12,000 years ago."

But that uncertainty has thrown the door wide open for one specific group looking for answers: conspiracy theorists.

Graham Hancock, a British journalist and star of the controversial Netflix series Ancient Apocalypse, has theorized — without empirical evidence — that Gobekli Tepe was built by a "lost civilization" wiped out by an Ice Age cataclysm.

Once confined to the fringes, theories like Hancock's have gained mainstream traction — thanks in large part to Joe Rogan, whose massively popular podcast has become a platform for alternative takes on science and history.

In November 2024, another Gobekli Tepe conspiracy theorist, Jimmy Corsetti, a YouTuber and self-described "ancient history investigator," appeared on Rogan's podcast, bringing with him a slew of speculations and wild theories about the site.

Among them, Corsetti accused archaeologists of intentionally dragging their feet and hiding key discoveries about the site.

"We're talking about pillars buried in dirt. It's 2024. Don't tell me we don't have the technology!" Corsetti told Rogan.

Corsetti accused archaeologists of moving slowly on purpose, perhaps to preserve the mystery and keep the curious tourists coming.

Only a small percentage of the site has been dug up since excavations began in the mid-1990s. And with Rogan's platform behind them, theorists like Corsetti have helped turn that slow progress into a source of global suspicion.

Lee Clare, an archaeologist who has led the excavation site for over a decade, has heard it all — including the outlandish theories.

Speaking from his office in Istanbul, with the Bosporus glinting behind him, Clare shrugs off the conspiracists.

"Some of these guys go to the site for half an hour and think they can explain the whole site," he says of the budding conspiracy theorists.

When it comes to Gobekli Tepe, Clare says archaeologists aren't hiding anything. They're trying to protect it.

"You can't just bulldoze a site to get everything out. That's the wrong approach," he says.

In other words, archaeology moves slowly for a reason. Every layer tells part of the story. And once you dig through each layer, it's gone for good, as are its secrets.

"Why would I be so selfish as to dig the entire site … and take these possibilities away from future generations of archaeologists?"

Clare says he grew up playing with toy dinosaurs and always wanted to be an archaeologist. He never expected to end up the target of conspiracy theories. But here we are.

"It goes onto the personal level as well," he says, which is why he deleted his social media accounts.

"I want to stay sane in this situation."

The real danger here isn't just misinformation, according to Clare. It's that these competing narratives risk drowning out the real story, the one scientists have spent decades trying to properly decode.

"There are a lot of narratives out there about Gobekli Tepe. The question is, whose narrative is correct? And I think we'll never know."

One of the few things scientists do know for sure?

Gobekli Tepe is proof that humans have been storytellers dating back at least 12,000 years.

The carvings on the T-shaped pillars — the lions, foxes and hands — they're all stories.

We just don't know what they say. Gobekli Tepe may be the first place humans come together to share meaning.

And like all good stories, this one's still open to interpretation.

Michael Ramsey 

(NewsNation) — The Havard University professor who has raised questions about an interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS — namely, that it may be some sort of alien tech — has some advice for the international community: Figure out a plan on dealing with UFOs.

“I believe that we need an international organization that will make policy decisions about such an object,” theoretical physicist Avi Loeb told “Banfield” on Friday. “We are worried about existential threats from artificial intelligence, from global climate change, from an asteroid impact, but we never discuss alien technology.”

In scientific circles, 3I/ATLAS is thought to be a comet. But Loeb said the object from outside our solar system seems to be unusually large, doesn't appear to have a typical comet's tail and has a puzzling trajectory.

“The response has to depend on its properties and its intent — what is it doing as it comes closer to us?” Loeb said. “And it's just like having a visitor in your back yard. You can't decide on the policy for all visitors. It really depends on the intent of the visitor, and it's just next door.”

NASA says 3I/ATLAS is not on a collision course with Earth.

Bizarre conspiracies are circulating online about the real reason Leonardo DiCaprio always covers his face while out in public. 

The Hollywood star, 50, is known for donning odd face coverings in public - sporting everything from masks to umbrellas in a vain attempt to hide his identity. 

Following his recent appearance at Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos' and extravagant Venice wedding - during which he oddly covered his face beneath a baseball cap - some fans have begun questioning whether the man in the photos is Leonardo at all. 

'[That] is not him. It's a double. I bet,' one fan commented on Instagram beneath a picture of Leonardo at the A-list wedding. 

'I guess that is his doppelganger,' another speculated, as someone else wrote: 'Are you sure that's him? I mean, he's hiding his face. Maybe it's someone else.' 

Others have speculated that the Titanic actor may be concealing recent plastic surgery, with one commenting: 'What's he hiding? A bad facelift perhaps?' 

Another questioned whether the Revenant star was recovering from a secret hair transplant. 

Despite these wild theories, the most likely reason for Leonardo's secrecy is that he was trying to evade photographers and maintain a low profile.

He may have also wanted to avoid attention given the backlash he'd been receiving for attending the wedding in the first place. 

Leo, a longtime vocal climate activist, was roundly mocked online as a 'hypocrite' for attending the extravaganza, in light of not only Amazon's general environmental impact but also the fact that an estimated 90 private jets had transported the glitterati guest list to Venice for the opulent marriage ceremony.

Leonardo has tried out a number of unusual methods to hide from paparazzi over the years. 

In 2004, Leonardo attempted to hide from photographers by wearing a puffer jacket pulled up over his head, paired with a baseball cap. 

He went deep undercover again in 2013 by sporting a traditional Venetian mask while strolling around Venice with a slice of pizza. 

Then, in 2015, he utilised an umbrella to shield himself from public view as he arrived at the US Open in New York City. 

 

On many occasions, he's tried to cover his face by using various hats, sunglasses, his hands and even mobile phones. 

While Leonardo has never spoken about why he constantly covers his face, he did previously discuss the pitfalls of fame in an interview with Esquire. 

‘Look, if you're not careful about [fame], it can develop into a social anxiety. It's like, what's going to happen, what photographer is going to jump out where, what kind of thing am I being set up for? You try to talk yourself out of it, but you're never used to it,' he lamented. 

Of late, Leo has gone back to wearing his favourite disguise - a face mask - akin to those worn at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.

Just last week he was seen wearing one of his beloved masks as he, along with his girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, took a stroll along the beach in Ibiza.

The couple joined Jeff and Lauren for a double date for a contemporary Mediterranean stylish dinner at Amalur Ibiza.

As always, Leo covered his face with a medical mask as he sported an all-black outfit.

Meanwhile, model Vittoria caught the eye in a slinky black skirt and a matching vest top.
