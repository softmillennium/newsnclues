                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Matt Rife's status as the new owner of an occult museum has paranormal experts concerned about his plans. Critics subtly hinted that the media personality should stick to comedy instead of diving headfirst into a world he knows nothing about. The comedian sparked worries about fans' safety after declaring he would open Ed and Lorraine Warren's infamous Connecticut home to the public. Matt Rife announced he purchased the home and occult museum with his close pal Elton Castee days earlier. The couple, whose lives and case studies have influenced numerous movies, were reportedly against publicizing their collection. Chris McKinnell, a paranormal researcher and the grandson of Ed and Lorraine Warren, claimed Rife's plans to open the property for exploration did not align with his late grandparents' goals. He stressed that their home “was never meant to be a public attraction” but a “controlled environment ... for education, spiritual research and protection.” McKinnell implored Rife to consult paranormal experts like himself before moving forward with his public exploration plans, noting he would endanger lives by exposing them to dark forces without adequate protection. McKinnell noted his warning was not to be dismissed, as he foresaw bad things happening when the late Rivera took Annabelle on tour. He suspected Rife and his pal were chosen to become the property's new owners for a reason and hoped the pair “will get through this alive.” Siracusa, like McKinnell, stressed that the Warrens kept their home private for a long time for a good reason. He claimed their collection of occult items wasn't to be trifled with, as they contained a “dark force” that could attach itself to people. He claimed these dark forces could follow people even after leaving the home and feared the worst might happen, saying, “People are going to get hurt. In the book, Rife stressed that he never went under the knife to achieve his chiseled face; instead, his looks stemmed from delayed puberty. He explained that he went from looking like "a 13-year-old" to looking "an actual grown-ish man" within a few months. Besides helping him stay fit, Rife noted lifting weights improved his mental health. Hitting the gym didn't just help Rife obtain excellent physical and mental health, as it seemed to have improved his A-game. The comedian made waves for dating fitness influencer Mariah Morse after they were spotted at a Rhode Island club. The pair, per TMZ, were seen holding hands as they entered the establishment for what appeared to be a group date. Morse shared pictures from the outing on her Instagram page, capturing her posing next to Rife and their other pals. Morse also implied her relationship with Rife was serious by sharing a picture with his dog, Hammer, and captioned the cute post, "besties." Is Matt Rife biting off more than he can chew with his paranormal public exploration?</p>

A morale-damaging psychological ops idea: drop extra-large condoms labelled “small” into the USSR to suggest physical inferiority. Poisoned cigars, fungus-infested scuba suits, explosive sea shells, a fake lover to poison, and a ballpoint pen with a tiny poisonous needle were some of the attempts to kill the Cuban communist dictator. The Hard Drive retrieved from Bin Laden's safe house had a few licensed movies, anime, and games, all of which were uploaded on the CIA website for anyone who wants to see. A toy figure of Osama Bin Laden, whose face, when heated, peeled away to reveal a demonic visage. CIA brought former Nazi scientists like Wernher von Braun to beat Soviet Russia in the space race. CIA tried to test the capability of the US against bioweapons by spraying live bacteria over Sanfrancisco without public consent Allen W. Dulles oversaw a CIA programme which involved mind control experiments using LSD, hypnosis, and sensory deprivation, without any consent, pioneering the psychological horror. In the 1960s, the CIA started to notice that most of the artists were socialist, communists, and they started funding art galleries and purchasing art at exorbitant prices, thus to prevent them from poverty and romanticising communism/socialism. Soviets continued to patrol that area, making it difficult. Henry Kissinger asked the CIA to collaborate with Howard Hughes via the Hughes Glomar Explorer, a deep-sea mining vessel. CIA and DoD believed that a salvage operation had the potential to retrieve nuclear submarine-launched ballistic missiles, nuclear torpedoes, code books, and cryptographic gear. This is not declassified, but leaked- including every government the United States has ever tried to replace via terror funding or coup, shaping our modern view of the CIA. A chilling proposal to stage terrorist acts in the U.S. and blame Cuba, approved by military officials but not the President. A ‘psychic' was brought in, and an envelope was given to him with coordinates and a timeframe on it. They asked him to describe what he saw. In the Vietnam War, CIA helicopters broadcast ghostly voices and eerie sounds, including Buddhist chants, to terrify the Viet Cong.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A paranormal investigator has a chilling concern for Matt Rife after he and his business partner Elton Castee purchased Ed and Lorraine Warren's home and Occult Museum -- he hopes they make it out alive. TMZ caught up with Philip Siracusa, the former owner of the infamously haunted Horsefly Chronicles home, and he warns that dark energy has a way of manipulating people and feels Matt and Elton were chosen by the home for a reason. In our clip, he says the Warrens kept the pieces in their home private for so long for good measure ... and simply hopes Matt and Elton "will get through this alive." He also has worries about allowing the public to stay at the Monroe, Connecticut home, reasoning it's a "risk" to have so many so close to a "dark force" that can attach to humans even after they've exited the property. He warns ... "People are going to get hurt. It demands context, caution, and spiritual responsibility." Chris -- who runs The Warren Legacy Foundation for Paranormal Research -- says he feels no ill will towards Matt, and his "intention is to warn the public that the energies in this place can be deadly." Remember ... these stark warnings come after Dan Rivera -- one of the investigators touring with the infamous Annabelle doll died suddenly last month after wrapping up an appearance in Pennsylvania. Chris -- who's currently living in Paraguay, making a documentary about his work with Ed and Lorraine -- had been warning folks about the dangers of taking Annabelle on the road for weeks before Dan's death. He told TMZ after Dan's sudden passing there's "negative energy attached to it, and it can be deadly." By subscribing, I agree to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A view of the ancient site of Gobekli Tepe, known as the world's oldest temple, in Sanliurfa, Turkey, on Feb. 17. GOBEKLI TEPE, Turkey — Tour guide Sabahattin Alkan herds curious tourists through the scorching afternoon heat, luring them with the promise of something far stranger than your typical vacation snap. But more on that in a minute. That "spaceship" is actually just a curved roof. But what lies beneath the dome has sparked decades of mystery, curiosity — and conspiracy. "It's quite an interesting place, actually," Alkan assures his audience. He's talking about Gobekli Tepe, one of the oldest known archaeological sites on Earth, dating back nearly 12,000 years. Alkan points to T-shaped limestone pillars carved with human arms, hands resting on stomachs, and wild animals: lions, foxes, boars, scorpions and birds among them. German archaeologist Klaus Schmidt, who pioneered excavations at the ancient site of Gobekli Tepe, carries out research in Sanliurfa, Turkey, on May 18, 2008. Some now interpret it as a ceremonial gathering site, while others suggest it functioned as a social hub where rituals helped bind together early communities. she asks, gesturing toward one of the inscribed pillars. "I imagine it was much more existential." Scientists are regularly adjusting their hypotheses about the site's intended purpose. "Whatever we tell now, I don't know if it will be accurate information or not, because maybe our idea will change in another 50 years," Alkan says. But that uncertainty has thrown the door wide open for one specific group looking for answers: conspiracy theorists. Graham Hancock, a British journalist and star of the controversial Netflix series Ancient Apocalypse, has theorized — without empirical evidence — that Gobekli Tepe was built by a "lost civilization" wiped out by an Ice Age cataclysm. Once confined to the fringes, theories like Hancock's have gained mainstream traction — thanks in large part to Joe Rogan, whose massively popular podcast has become a platform for alternative takes on science and history. In November 2024, another Gobekli Tepe conspiracy theorist, Jimmy Corsetti, a YouTuber and self-described "ancient history investigator," appeared on Rogan's podcast, bringing with him a slew of speculations and wild theories about the site. Among them, Corsetti accused archaeologists of intentionally dragging their feet and hiding key discoveries about the site. "We're talking about pillars buried in dirt. An aerial view shows archaeologists and workers at Gobekli Tepe on May 18, 2022. Corsetti accused archaeologists of moving slowly on purpose, perhaps to preserve the mystery and keep the curious tourists coming. And with Rogan's platform behind them, theorists like Corsetti have helped turn that slow progress into a source of global suspicion. Lee Clare, an archaeologist who has led the excavation site for over a decade, has heard it all — including the outlandish theories. Archaeologist Lee Clare, photographed at his office in Istanbul, has overseen the Gobekli Tepe archaeological site for over a decade. "Some of these guys go to the site for half an hour and think they can explain the whole site," he says of the budding conspiracy theorists. When it comes to Gobekli Tepe, Clare says archaeologists aren't hiding anything. "You can't just bulldoze a site to get everything out. In other words, archaeology moves slowly for a reason. Every layer tells part of the story. And once you dig through each layer, it's gone for good, as are its secrets. "Why would I be so selfish as to dig the entire site … and take these possibilities away from future generations of archaeologists?" Clare says he grew up playing with toy dinosaurs and always wanted to be an archaeologist. He never expected to end up the target of conspiracy theories. "It goes onto the personal level as well," he says, which is why he deleted his social media accounts. "I want to stay sane in this situation." The real danger here isn't just misinformation, according to Clare. It's that these competing narratives risk drowning out the real story, the one scientists have spent decades trying to properly decode. One of the few things scientists do know for sure? Gobekli Tepe is proof that humans have been storytellers dating back at least 12,000 years. We just don't know what they say. Gobekli Tepe may be the first place humans come together to share meaning. And like all good stories, this one's still open to interpretation.</p>

Michael Ramsey 

(NewsNation) — The Havard University professor who has raised questions about an interstellar object known as 3I/ATLAS — namely, that it may be some sort of alien tech — has some advice for the international community: Figure out a plan on dealing with UFOs.

“I believe that we need an international organization that will make policy decisions about such an object,” theoretical physicist Avi Loeb told “Banfield” on Friday. “We are worried about existential threats from artificial intelligence, from global climate change, from an asteroid impact, but we never discuss alien technology.”

In scientific circles, 3I/ATLAS is thought to be a comet. But Loeb said the object from outside our solar system seems to be unusually large, doesn't appear to have a typical comet's tail and has a puzzling trajectory.

“The response has to depend on its properties and its intent — what is it doing as it comes closer to us?” Loeb said. “And it's just like having a visitor in your back yard. You can't decide on the policy for all visitors. It really depends on the intent of the visitor, and it's just next door.”

NASA says 3I/ATLAS is not on a collision course with Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bizarre conspiracies are circulating online about the real reason Leonardo DiCaprio always covers his face while out in public. The Hollywood star, 50, is known for donning odd face coverings in public - sporting everything from masks to umbrellas in a vain attempt to hide his identity. Following his recent appearance at Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos' and extravagant Venice wedding - during which he oddly covered his face beneath a baseball cap - some fans have begun questioning whether the man in the photos is Leonardo at all. I bet,' one fan commented on Instagram beneath a picture of Leonardo at the A-list wedding. Others have speculated that the Titanic actor may be concealing recent plastic surgery, with one commenting: 'What's he hiding? Another questioned whether the Revenant star was recovering from a secret hair transplant. Despite these wild theories, the most likely reason for Leonardo's secrecy is that he was trying to evade photographers and maintain a low profile. Leo, a longtime vocal climate activist, was roundly mocked online as a 'hypocrite' for attending the extravaganza, in light of not only Amazon's general environmental impact but also the fact that an estimated 90 private jets had transported the glitterati guest list to Venice for the opulent marriage ceremony. Leonardo has tried out a number of unusual methods to hide from paparazzi over the years. In 2004, Leonardo attempted to hide from photographers by wearing a puffer jacket pulled up over his head, paired with a baseball cap. He went deep undercover again in 2013 by sporting a traditional Venetian mask while strolling around Venice with a slice of pizza. Then, in 2015, he utilised an umbrella to shield himself from public view as he arrived at the US Open in New York City. On many occasions, he's tried to cover his face by using various hats, sunglasses, his hands and even mobile phones. While Leonardo has never spoken about why he constantly covers his face, he did previously discuss the pitfalls of fame in an interview with Esquire. ‘Look, if you're not careful about [fame], it can develop into a social anxiety. Of late, Leo has gone back to wearing his favourite disguise - a face mask - akin to those worn at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Just last week he was seen wearing one of his beloved masks as he, along with his girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, took a stroll along the beach in Ibiza.</p>
