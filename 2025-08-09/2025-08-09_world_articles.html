                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian and European officials rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for Kyiv to cede its eastern territories to Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Aug. 9. The EU and Ukrainian officials instead offered a counterproposal to U.S. officials ahead of a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin on Aug. 15 in Alaska. Putin told U.S. envoy Wikoff during a meeting on Aug. 6 that Russia would agree to a full ceasefire if Kyiv withdrew its forces from Donetsk Oblast, giving Moscow full control of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, as well as Crimea. President Volodymyr Zelensky firmly rejected on Aug. 9 the idea of ceding any Ukrainian territory to end Russia's war, with talks on the proposal beginning in the U.K. with U.S., Ukrainian, and EU officials on Aug. 9. Two European officials familiar with the talks told WSJ that Europe aims to draw a unified red line with Ukraine, instituting that that EU officials should be involved in any potential peace negotiation with Russia and reiterating that Ukraine's future cannot be discussed without Kyiv's participation. The development comes as Trump has suggested he will include Ukraine in future negotiations only after an initial meeting with Putin. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg and Witkoff, also demands that a ceasefire be enacted before further steps are taken, adding that territory can only be exchanged in a reciprocal manner, the news agency reported. The New York Times reported on Aug. 9, citing two EU officials, that European leaders are increasingly concerned Trump and Putin will formulate an agreement that will then be imposed upon Ukraine. "You can't start a process by ceding territory in the middle of fighting," one European negotiator told WSJ, amid Trump's comments on Aug. 8 that Moscow and Kyiv would likely include "some swapping of territories." "Well you're looking at territory that's been fought over for three-and-a-half years... So we're looking at that, but we're actually looking to get some back," Trump said during a press conference alongside the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. In a post on X, French President Emmanuel Macron stressed that "the future of Ukraine cannot be decided without the Ukrainians who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now," adding "Europeans will also necessarily be part of the solution, as it concerns their security." A senior European official said told WSJ that any agreement reached in Alaska between the U.S. and Russia would not hold much weight without the participation of European leaders. Russia has repeatedly espoused maximalist demands to end its war in Ukraine publicly demanded that Kyiv forgo NATO membership and withdraw troops from all four regions as preconditions for peace. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. European leaders reiterated their support for Ukraine's territorial integrity on Aug. 9 after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed to the U.S. a ceasefire plan that involves halting hostilities in exchange for Kyiv ceding its eastern territories to Russia. As a result of the attack, five people were hospitalized with shrapnel wounds. Ukrainian and European officials rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for Kyiv to cede its eastern territories to Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Aug. 9. Flight delays lasted for several hours, leading to large crowds forming at Sochi Airport. Canada will lower the price cap on Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. The Russian strike took place at approximately 8:00 a.m. local time, resulting in the hospitalization of 16 people, two of whom suffered serious injuries. The Yenisei radar station is used not only in Russia's S-500 air defense system but also as part of the S-400 system. Russian forces launched 47 Shahed-type drones and decoys, as well as two Iskander-K missiles against Ukraine overnight, according to Ukraine's Air Force. The day before, Donald Trump claimed that peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv would likely involve "some swapping of territories." Ukrainian, U.S., and European senior officials are set to meet in the U.K. ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week, Axios reported on Aug. 8, citing three sources with knowledge of the plans.</p>

Co-founded by president's eldest sons, Eric and Don Jr, World Liberty has earned the family $500m since its launch

World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture backed by Donald Trump and the US president's family, is sounding out investors for a $1.5bn fundraising round meant to set up a public company that will hold its WLFI tokens, Bloomberg News reported on Friday.

The structure of the deal is yet to be finalized, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter, adding that large investors in the crypto and tech space had been approached for the venture.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. World Liberty did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

World Liberty – a “decentralized platform” which counts Trump and his sons Eric and Donald Jr as co-founders, according to its website – has earned the family $500m since its launch, according to Reuters' calculations.

World Liberty tokens, known as $WLFI, are not classified as securities by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and are hence not subject to the same level of scrutiny as investments such as stocks.

Economists who follow crypto and some key Senate Democrats have voiced multiple concerns about Trump's glaring conflicts of interest in the crypto sector and the broader economic threats that his administration's ongoing deregulatory efforts pose.

“Trump and his family are clearly eager to establish a broad foothold in the sector prior to further regulatory actions that are likely to boost crypto asset valuations,” Cornell economist and crypto watcher Eswar Prasad told the Guardian in an article published in April. “Such investments by the Trump family take potential conflicts of interest to an altogether new level.”

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in London in June, 2025.Jaimi Joy/Reuters

British foreign minister David Lammy and U.S. Vice President JD Vance will meet Ukrainian and European allies in Britain on Saturday to discuss President Donald Trump's push for peace in Ukraine, a spokesperson for Downing Street said.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ahead of the security meeting, the spokesperson said. 

Starmer and Zelensky discussed Trump's proposals for ending the war in Ukraine ahead of talks with his Russian counterpart on August 15 in Alaska.

Trump says he will meet with Putin in Alaska next week to discuss war in Ukraine

“The Prime Minister spoke to President Zelensky of Ukraine this morning. They looked ahead to the meeting of National Security Advisers from Europe, Ukraine and the United States taking place today, hosted by the U.K. Foreign Secretary and U.S. Vice President,” the spokesperson said. 

“They agreed this would be a vital forum to discuss progress towards securing a just and lasting peace.”

Now a small number of food banks around the world have recently started tracking their operations and quantifying how many emissions they're avoiding — with the goal of using that data to better aid decarbonization efforts as well as to sell  carbon credits. These carbon credits could help open up new avenues to raise money for food banks at a time when other sources of funding, like foreign aid from wealthy to developing countries, are threatened, according to the Global FoodBanking Network, or GFN. The nonprofit organization has piloted this carbon credit program in Mexico and Ecuador and is working to bring food banks in 12 other countries onboard. Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox every day. But the carbon markets where such credits are traded have been heavily criticized for rampant fraud; the harshest critics say that purchasing credits representing avoided would-be emissions amounts to greenwashing. The rollout of GFN's program for calculating food banks' carbon footprint raises the question of whether nonprofits with social and environmental missions should make use of these controversial accounting instruments to stay afloat and further their impact. Carbon markets are marketed as a way for big polluters (think: airlines, large corporations, even national governments) to minimize their impact on the environment without fundamentally changing the way they operate. In theory, buyers can emit carbon into the atmosphere and then purchase credits — which represent emission reductions — to make up for it, allowing them to claim their operations are carbon neutral. Socially driven and environmentally conscious nonprofits have experimented with selling carbon credits. For example, conservation programs have long offered offsets on carbon markets based on the idea that protected ecosystems sequester emissions, said Khaled Diab, communications director at Carbon Market Watch, a nonprofit watchdog organization that studies various carbon pricing programs. These groups can fall victim to overestimating just how much their work reduces emissions: For instance, a Bloomberg investigation in 2020 into The Nature Conservancy's forest-based carbon credits program found that many of its emissions reductions were likely bogus. The Nature Conservancy has not stopped selling credits but launched a review of its own practices and canceled one project the organization said did not meet its newly developed internal criteria. In April, Carbon Market Watch released a report on programs that give gas or electric stoves to families in poor countries who would otherwise chop down and burn wood to cook food. These programs sold carbon credits based on the reduction in emissions that came from families going from burning wood to using a cleaner source of fuel. So when GFN was researching how to quantify how many emissions it saves by diverting food from landfills, the organization was focused on ensuring “what we are reporting is real,” said Suarez Peña. This involved getting specific about what counts as an avoided emission. In this case, participating food banks are comparing the emissions they run up by transporting rescued food, refrigerating it, and potentially losing some edible food to spoilage to a scenario where grocers and retailers dispose of their food in a way that doesn't end up feeding people — i.e., sending it to a landfill or to be made into compost or animal feed. The FRAME methodology only looks at food intended for human consumption that would otherwise arrive at one of these destinations but is then diverted by food banks and given to people who will eat it. For one, it assumes that if shops don't donate the leftover food, then the food will inevitably end up going to waste, said Marc Roston, a senior research scholar at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. That ignores a scenario where shops could get rid of leftover food by selling it at a discount — perhaps even directly to the food bank. The idea is that by selling credits, organizations can prevent even more carbon emissions than they were preventing before. Suarez Peña said that member food banks ensure they're capturing accurate data by tracking operations-related emissions in real time and submitting quarterly reports to GFN. Most food banks within GFN operate with a budget of $1 million or less, according to the organization — meaning that even relatively small losses in funding can have a big impact on its ability to stay open. As the Trump administration retracts billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid, European countries are also reconsidering how much money they spend abroad. That means that food banks in the Global South, whose budgets are typically dependent on receiving funding from wealthier nations, are newly interested in exploring alternative sources of funding. Asked what BAMX learned from the experience, BAMX head Mariana Jiménez said in an interview in Spanish that the organization has a greater awareness of its environmental impact. But critics like Roston argue that unless credits represent actual carbon removed from the atmosphere — for example, by turning food scraps into biochar and then using the biochar to store carbon — they are unlikely to represent real permanent emissions reductions. Suarez Peña, however, sees value in food banks auditing their own operations and sharing that data extending far beyond carbon markets. “I think in the coming years, having better, accurate, and robust data will be the way to demonstrate how everyone is contributing” to climate targets, she said. As countries prepare to report on their climate progress at the annual United Nations climate summit later this year, data on food waste will be extremely valuable, she argued — even though most countries' accounting methods do not yet make the connection between food waste and emissions. Suarez Peña hopes food banks can help “connect both in just one conversation.” As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Witnesses say disabled death-row man was in distress upon gurney, while lawyer calls execution ‘100% botched' Black was locked on to a gurney with crisscrossing black straps over his chest, stomach and legs, and Henry saw blood ooze from the injection site. The IVs would be used to inject a lethal quantity of pentobarbital, a sedative, into Black, a 69-year-old wheelchair user with lifelong intellectual disabilities, dementia, brain damage, kidney failure, severe heart failure and prostate cancer. Black eventually became still and was pronounced dead at 10.43am, roughly 10 minutes after he had cried in pain. Tennessee had argued that Black would not consciously experience drawn-out pain. But outside the chamber, seven reporters shared similar accounts suggesting that was exactly what had occurred, the final journalist saying: “It was unanimous among all of us that we saw him in distress.” “Something went horribly, horribly wrong, and I don't know what it is yet, and all I could do was take notes and watch,” Henry, who represented Black for 25 years, told the Guardian on Thursday. “For him to lift his head up several times and say it hurts, I really wasn't prepared. The execution – which Henry said she considered “100% botched” and amounted to “torture” – appears to be the latest in a long line of troubled state killings. Despite historically low public support for the death penalty, a handful of conservative states have continued to aggressively pursue executions, maintaining the US's status as a global leader in capital punishment. Donald Trump, who oversaw 13 federal executions in his first term, has pledged to revive capital punishment, reversing Joe Biden's moratorium on federal killings. Reports of botched executions include a 2024 Idaho execution halted after eight failed attempts to find a vein for lethal injection; an Alabama killing using an experimental nitrogen gas method that caused “violent” shaking last year; and a 2021 lethal injection in Oklahoma that caused vomiting and convulsing. A Guardian report in May revealed that South Carolina appeared to botch an execution by firing squad, a rarely used method now making a comeback, with autopsy records suggesting shooters missed the target area on the man's heart. A spokesperson for the Tennessee governor, Bill Lee, did not respond to an email. Black filed a dozen separate legal challenges to avoid his sentence. Black spent 35 years on death row after he was convicted of the 1988 homicides of Angela Clay, his 29-year-old girlfriend, and her two daughters, Latoya, nine, and Lakeisha, six. Black has maintained his innocence, though the critical courtroom battles have revolved around his intellectual disability, according to the Nashville Banner, which reported that Black's attorney in 1989 had argued he was incompetent to stand trial. Black suffered from prenatal alcohol exposure and was exposed to toxic lead as a toddler, contributing to lifelong cognitive and developmental impairments, his attorneys said. He struggled throughout school, endured traumatic brain injuries from playing football and was never able to live independently, having difficulties performing basic chores as an adult. When Henry first met Black in 2000, she was pregnant with her second son, and they bonded over conversations about family: “Getting to know Byron is getting to know his family. He always wanted to talk about his family's reunions, which are just legendary.” She learned about how he had relatives in all 50 states, tracing their roots to ancestors enslaved by President James Polk. Talking to him was like sitting on the front porch having a glass of iced tea,” she said, recalling how he wrote down everyone's birthday in a makeshift calendar and never missed them. “I would give him updates, and his response was always, thank you so much. I never had a visit where he didn't say, ‘God bless you, I appreciate you,' including up until the very last moment.” Henry, a federal public defender, watched as Black's physical and mental health deteriorated over two decades on death row. For years, he struggled to walk, but staff at the prison would wheel him into his legal visits on an office chair, before eventually giving him a wheelchair, she said. When prostate cancer surgery went wrong, he nearly died, she said. “Still, he never said a negative word about the doctor.” The Tennessee legislature had amended statutes in 2021 to align its definitions of intellectual disabilities with contemporary medical standards. It's a procedural loophole that torments Henry, who said she feels responsible for what happened since it was her original claim that was rejected 20 years ago. “Every execution takes a piece of your heart,” said Henry, who has represented 13 people who were executed, three of which she witnessed. Henry said initial evaluation of the device after his death showed that it did not shock him. Black's lawyers now hope that the autopsy, which will take weeks to complete, will help make clear what did go wrong. The drug may have failed to flow properly due to the tight straps constraining his body, which also could have masked convulsions indicating pain. He may have endured pulmonary edema, a condition seen in others executed by injection, where the lungs fill with fluid, causing a sensation akin to suffocation and drowning. The state's attorneys have argued that the pentobarbital should make people unresponsive and unable to perceive pain, but Black's repeated lifting of his head while groaning in agony suggested otherwise, she said. He also condemned the criticisms of the drug, saying that in previous litigation, Black's lawyers had argued that pentobarbital had lower risk of pain compared to other lethal injection drugs. The two wept, she recalled: “He grabbed me and held me really, really tight and said, ‘I want you to know that what you did mattered. Black made no final statement in the execution chamber. After Black was pronounced dead, Henry stood at a podium in front of television cameras and condemned the state for executing “a gentle, kind, fragile, intellectually disabled man in violation of the laws of our country simply because they could”. He said: “What happened here was the result of pure, unbridled bloodlust and cowardice. It was the brutal and unchecked abuse of government power. It was the result of a failed criminal legal system.” It was my pleasure in meeting everybody and the way we connected with each other,” she read, through tears.</p>

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. The minutes released by Channel 13 show that army and intelligence officials argued for concluding the ceasefire deal, while cabinet ministers opposed it. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. “Let's get everyone back first, then resume the fight,” he reportedly said. He was backed by Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs, Ron Dermer, who reportedly said that Israel was “not prepared to end the war while Hamas remains in power.” Dermer, who supports Netanyahu's hardline position on Gaza, was named by the Prime Minister as head of the negotiating team in the ceasefire talks. Also backing Netanyahu's refusal was hardline Finance Minister Bezelel Smotrich, who lashed out at military and intelligence officials, insisting that they were “misleading the public” into thinking Israel could “stop the war and return to it later,” which Smotrich regarded as “ignorance.” For his part, Israeli Defense Minister, Israel Katz, supported a partial deal, saying that, “If Hamas returns even a number of hostages — less than half — that's excellent.” UNICEF has called the deaths of Palestinian children due to starvation “unconscionable”. The centers have been described as “death traps” that use aid as “bait” to lure Palestinians into southern Gaza. There, the Israeli army opens fire on aid-seekers, resulting in numerous recorded “aid massacres.” As of the time of writing, 1,561 people have been killed at GHF sites or while waiting for aid trucks in the north, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. According to the Health Ministry, some 160 Palestinians, including 90 children, have died due to malnutrition brought on by starvation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon (right) and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese hold a joint press conference in Queenstown, New Zealand on Saturday.The Associated Press The leaders of New Zealand and Australia on Saturday discussed closer cooperation between their expanding militaries against the backdrop of a recent extraordinary Chinese live-fire exercise near their shores. New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon hosted his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese at the tourist city of Queenstown for their second annual bilateral leaders' meeting. “A big focus for us has been interoperability with Australia. We want to be a force multiplier,” Luxon told reporters. “We want to be one, sort of, essential Anzac force essentially operating within our region,” he added, referring to the Australian New Zealand Army Corps in which the two nations' soldiers first fought together during World War I. The summit follows a Chinese naval flotilla firing weapons in February in the Tasman Sea, which separates Australia and New Zealand. The Chinese navy rarely ventures so far south and the mission that partially circumnavigated Australia was seen as a demonstration of China's growing military reach. Xi replied that Australia also engaged in exercises, referring to freedom of navigation missions conducted by Australian military in the disputed South China Sea. “Of course, the geostrategic competition, in particular between the great powers, is something that countries like Australia and New Zealand do discuss together and we cooperate politically,” Albanese said. Luxon said “both countries have followed pretty much the same playbook” in their bilateral dealings with China. Good partners should be not afraid to talk about those things,” Luxon added. Luxon announced in April a plan to make the New Zealand Defense Force more combat capable that would double defense spending to more than 2 per cent of GDP. Australia announced this week Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries will build a fleet of 11 Australian naval frigates with a contract expected to be worth US$6.5-billion. Australia's most expensive defense expansion is a submarine deal with the United States and Britain that is expected to cost up to $245-billion. Under the trilateral partnership known by the acronym AUKUS, Australia will acquire a fleet of eight submarines powered by U.S. nuclear technology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These ancient viruses lie in sections of our DNA called transposable elements, or TEs, also known as “jumping genes” due to their ability to copy and paste themselves throughout the genome. TEs, which account for nearly half of our genetic material, were once waved off as “junk” DNA, sequences that appear to have no biological function. Now, a new study offers support for the hypothesis that these ancient viral remnants play a key role in the early stages of human development and may have been implicated in our evolution. By sequencing TEs, an international team of researchers identified hidden patterns that could be crucial for gene regulation, the process of turning genes on and off. The first genome sequenced from ancient Egypt reveals surprising ancestry, scientists say There are many benefits to studying how TEs activate gene expression. It could help scientists understand the role that the sequences play in human evolution, reveal possible links between TEs and human diseases, or teach researchers how to target functional TEs in gene therapy, said lead researcher Dr. Xun Chen, a computational biologist and principal investigator at Shanghai Institute of Immunity and Infection of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. With more research, “we hope to uncover how TEs, particularly ERVs (endogenous retroviruses, or ancient viral DNA), make us human,” Chen added in an email. When our primate ancestors were infected with viruses, sequences of viral genetic information would replicate and insert themselves in various locations in the host's chromosomes. Our genome has developed numerous mechanisms to control these ancient viruses, and to eliminate their potential detrimental effects,” said Dr. Lin He, a molecular biologist and the Thomas and Stacey Siebel Distinguished Chair professor in stem cell research at the University of California, Berkeley, in an email. For the most part, these ancient viruses are inactive and are not a cause of concern, but in recent years, research has shown that some of the transposable elements may play important roles in human diseases. A July 2024 study explored the possibility of silencing certain TEs to make cancer treatment more effective. “Over the course of evolution, some viruses are degenerated or eliminated, some are largely repressed in expression in normal development and physiology, and some are domesticated to serve the human genome,” said He, who was not involved with the new study. “While perceived as solely harmful, some ancient viruses can become part of us, providing raw materials for genome innovation.” But because of their repetitive nature, transposable elements are notoriously difficult to study and organize. The new study focused on a group of TE sequences called MER11 found within primate genomes. The most recently integrated sequence, named MER11_G4, was found to have a strong ability to activate gene expression in human stem cells and early-stage neural cells. The finding indicates that this TE subfamily plays a role in early human development and can “dramatically influence how genes respond to developmental signals or environmental cues,” according to a statement from Kyoto University. The research also suggests that viral TEs  had a part in shaping human evolution. Exactly how these TEs were implicated in the evolutionary process is still unclear, Chen said. Gene that protected humans 5,000 years ago may be linked to debilitating modern disease The research also “underscores how much more there is to learn from a type of DNA once slandered as a molecular freeloader,” he added in an email. While primate genomes are different from those of a shark, “the study provides further evidence for the potential impact of TEs on genome regulation” and “is a message with relevance for all genome researchers,” Hoffmann said. “Taking these sequences into account is often critical to understanding, e.g., why humans develop diseases that certain animals don't,” Hoffmann said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three people were wounded during a shooting at New York City's iconic Times Square, police said Saturday. One person was held in custody and questioned over the shooting, the New York Police Department said. No charges have been pressed yet. Video on social media showed people running away from the scene, police surrounding a vehicle and attending to the wounded lying on the ground. Several have been hospitalized, but their injuries are not life-threatening, the police said. The shooting took place at 1:20 a.m. No details have been released so far on how it unfolded. New York City has seen a remarkable drop in gun violence this year. Through August 3, it has seen its fewest shootings in decades, down 23% so far since last year. New York bans firearms from certain so-called sensitive locations such as public transportation, hospitals, schools and Times Square, and requires that handgun owners prove “good moral character.” The US Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge to the state's gun laws in April.

The three-time Olympic champion secured victory with her final attempt, throwing 70.94 metres. The mark is the best ever recorded in her age category.

In other Polish performances, Anna Gryc finished second in the women's 400 metres hurdles, clocking a personal best of 55.05 seconds — the fifth-fastest time in Polish athletics history, according to the national federation.

Angelika Sarna was also runner-up in the 800 metres, setting a lifetime best of 1:59.19. Both Gryc and Sarna collected valuable points towards qualification for the world championships in Tokyo in September.

MOSCOW, August 9. /TASS/. Russian servicemen destroyed 60% of the enemy's assault group in the Novokonstantinovka and Yablonovka areas of the Sumy Region during three unsuccessful Ukrainian attacks, security forces told TASS.

"The enemy made three unsuccessful attempts to attack the positions of the North battlegroup's marines and paratroopers, and all three attempts were thwarted: two were in the Novokonstantinovka area, and one was in the Yablonovka area. As a result of the firefight, 60% of the enemy's assault groups, one T-64BV tank, and one D-20 howitzer were destroyed," the sources said.

Earlier, security forces reported the transfer of more than 40 Ukrainian army brigades and regiments from various sections of the front to the Sumy and Kharkov areas. The security forces also reported that the Ukrainian military had reduced the intensity of their counterattacks, though they were still attempting to break through the right flank of the North battlegroup in Novokonstantinovka.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a joint declaration for peace and bilateral economic agreements with Washington in a ceremony hosted by U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House on Aug. 8. "For more than 35 years, Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought a bitter conflict that resulted in tremendous suffering for both nations… Many tried to find a resolution… and they were unsuccessful. With this accord, we've finally succeeded in making peace," Trump said. Armenia and Azerbaijan have fought two wars over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, primarily populated by ethnic Armenians, but internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory. "Today, we have reached a significant milestone in Armenian and Azerbaijani relations. This breakthrough would simply not have been possible without President Trump's personal engagement and his resolute commitment to peace," Pashinyan said. A transportation corridor between the two countries will be created and will connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave located west of southern Armenia. Following the signing of the peace deal in Washington, Aliyev and Pashinyan are both expected to nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize. "Who, if not President Trump, deserves the Nobel Peace Prize? ... we will agree to issue a joint letter," Aliyev said. Trump has previously expressed that his mediation efforts in various conflicts deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. Volodymyr Ivanyshyn is a news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography.

Ukrainian and European officials rejected Russian President Vladimir Putin's proposal for a ceasefire in exchange for Kyiv to cede its eastern territories to Russia, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported on Aug. 9. Flight delays lasted for several hours, leading to large crowds forming at Sochi Airport. Canada will lower the price cap on Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel. The day before, Donald Trump claimed that peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv would likely involve "some swapping of territories." Ukrainian, U.S., and European senior officials are set to meet in the U.K. ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's planned summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week, Axios reported on Aug. 8, citing three sources with knowledge of the plans.
