                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This narrative is beginning to feel even more organic due to the strong performances of the largest altcoins, ETH and XRP, in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the price of XRP has returned above $3, surging by more than 10% in the past week. However, the latest on-chain observation points that the altcoin season might only just be warming up and has not kicked in full gear just yet. Last True Altcoin Season Was In Early 2024: Analyst The rationale behind this Darkfost's theory is based on the performance of various asset classes relative to Bitcoin over the last few months. Rapid market cap growth is witnessed when the short-term moving average (30-day MA) rises faster than the long-term moving average (365-day MA), while a lagging 30-day moving average indicates slow growth momentum. In their post on X, Darkfost noted that the altcoin market is having its weakest performance in this cycle relative to the premier cryptocurrency. Nevertheless, Darkfost noted that the strongest action, which resembled a “true” altseason, happened back in the first quarter of 2024. As of this writing, the altcoin market is valued at over $1.55 trillion, reflecting an over 12% increase in the past seven days. Select reference data provided by FactSet.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This is a technical analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. XRP XRP$3.2670, the payments-focused cryptocurrency, surged 11% on Thursday, reportedly breaking out of a bull flag pattern to suggest renewed upward momentum. However, it's not yet clear, as prices remain well below the crucial $3.65 level, where a bearish "tweezer top" candlestick pattern occurred last month. The tweezer top is a bearish reversal pattern, comprising two candles with identical highs that represent a clear rejection point, in this case $3.65. It's as if the market tried to climb to a new level twice and was met with a brick wall of selling pressure at the same spot, a sign that the upward momentum has completely stalled. However, this may be easier said than done, as on-chain data suggests that holders are sitting on substantial profits and have a strong incentive to sell at current valuations. "The [XRP] Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) remains at elevated levels not seen since the 2021 peak, reaching similar levels to those observed in 2018. These high values indicate that the market still carries significant unrealized profits, which historically represents zones of potential distribution and price correction," research firm Alphractal said on x. Bitcoin's (BTC) recent pullback is currently taking the shape of a descending channel (white lines) within its primary uptrend (yellow lines). Ether has rallied to over $4,200, reaching levels last seen four years ago. The cryptocurrency has broken out of a prolonged symmetrical triangle that contained its price since the all-time high in late 2021, which is a major bullish signal.

The Central Bank of Brazil speeds Drex CBDC rollout, shifting to a centralized design while balancing privacy, regulation, and future blockchain use. This acceleration comes after the bank faced repeated difficulties in creating privacy solutions that could fully meet Brazil's strict financial secrecy and security requirements. At first, Drex was projected to be running on blockchain technology intensively. The initial vision involved decentralized networks, programmable money, and peer-to-peer lending. These aspects were supposed to enable novel services without conventional intermediaries. Since July 2023, 16 consortia have tried out how Drex might be used. These involve the tokenized sale of property, trade finance, and cross-border payments. The trials involve such large companies as Microsoft, Chainlink, and Banco Inter. An example is the testing of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) that enables delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP) systems. These operations are being supported by Microsoft through the provision of cloud infrastructure. A large number of use cases that were tested in the pilot might now not operate as intended since the new architecture does not have sophisticated programmability. He further described that the implementation will occur in two stages. The initial stage, which is going to be implemented next year, will not feature decentralization elements. The second step will start to experiment and optimize blockchain-based aspects.

Similar projects in certain nations have been halted or slowed by political opposition. The bank says Pix's instant payments show that practical innovation drives adoption. Drex is an ambitious project as Brazil continues its move forward. It aims to achieve speed, security, and scalability even though the blockchain will be used less. The world will be interested in whether this moderate approach can provide a CBDC that will be able to satisfy the Brazilian needs and act as a role model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to data from Cryptoquant, altcoins have recorded the highest altcoin inflows in 10 months. Notably, altcoin inflows have skyrocketed on Binance to levels not seen since last November. This new uptick suggests that Altcoins might be preparing for yet another altcoin rally. Key implications of increased altcoin inflows suggest an upsurge in positive sentiments in the altcoin market, which is often driven by positive news, project developments, and broader crypto market trends. Increased price inflows and an increase in market liquidity are also key bullish implications. Another key technical factor fueling the bullish sentiment has been spotted. 🚨BREAKING: ALTCOINS JUST HIT THE GOLDEN CROSS!Last time it happened, altcoins surged by 4,646% in 1-2 months$1k porftolio will be around $150k-$170k at the end of 2025I scanned over ~1,000 alts: Here are 10 alts with huge upside for the upcoming altseason🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/VLyoyPD0Dt Remarkably, altcoins soared by 4.646% within a 1-2-month period when this trend was last observed. Leading altcoins include Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), DOGECOIN (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) with gains sustained over the last 24 hours hitting 5.37%, 2.42%, 5.81% and 4.11% respectively. The near-term outlook remains largely bullish for altcoins with momentum sustained over time, suggesting heightened demand.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Participation will require at least 88 MOCA tokens, setting a clear token-based eligibility threshold that traders can factor into positioning ahead of the announcement window (source: @ysiu on X, Aug 9, 2025). According to Yat Siu, a prominent figure in the Web3 space, he has personally purchased 15 NFTs from Mocaverse and Cool Cats to celebrate this partnership and International Cats Day. Traders should note that participants in the upcoming giveaway, announced for tomorrow, must hold at least 88 $MOCA tokens, which could spur short-term buying pressure and increase trading volume in this asset. From a trading perspective, this announcement by Yat Siu on August 9, 2025, comes at a time when the crypto market is increasingly focused on community-driven events and NFT integrations. The requirement of holding 88 $MOCA tokens for giveaway eligibility acts as a clever mechanism to boost token utility and demand. Without real-time data, we can still project potential scenarios: if $MOCA is trading around its recent support levels, this could provide a catalyst for breaking resistance points. Traders might consider monitoring on-chain metrics, such as wallet activity and token transfers on platforms like Etherscan, to gauge accumulation trends. Moreover, the collaboration with Cool Cats, known for its vibrant NFT community, could enhance $MOCA's visibility, attracting institutional flows from investors interested in meme-inspired tokens and digital collectibles. For those looking to capitalize on this news, a strategic approach involves scalping opportunities around the giveaway announcement. Assume $MOCA's 24-hour trading volume spikes as participants rush to acquire the required tokens; this could create volatile price swings ideal for day traders using tools like RSI (Relative Strength Index) to identify overbought or oversold conditions. Long-term holders might view this as a bullish signal for $MOCA's ecosystem growth, especially if the giveaway leads to sustained user adoption. Cross-market correlations are key here; if BTC experiences a dip, it might drag altcoins like $MOCA lower, regardless of the hype. Savvy traders should set stop-loss orders below key support levels, perhaps at 5-10% below entry points, to mitigate downside risks while targeting upside potentials from increased liquidity. For example, if traditional stocks in gaming or tech sectors show sympathy moves, it might open arbitrage opportunities between crypto and equities. Investors should watch for on-chain data points, such as the number of unique holders increasing post-giveaway, which could validate long-term value. Overall, this collaboration and giveaway represent a prime example of how community events can drive trading momentum, offering both short-term gains and insights into the evolving crypto landscape.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amin Ayan is a crypto journalist with over four years of experience in the industry. He has contributed to leading publications such as Cryptonews, Investing.com, 99Bitcoins, and 24/7 Wall St. Swiss digital asset bank Sygnum is expanding regulated institutional access to the Sui blockchain with a suite of new products, including custody, trading, and lending services for its professional clients. Staking services are set to roll out in the coming weeks, while SUI collateral-backed Lombard loans are scheduled for launch in the fourth quarter. Partnering with the Sui Foundation, the bank aims to tap demand from banks, asset managers, and high-net-worth individuals seeking secure and regulated access to blockchain ecosystems. Sygnum CEO Mathias Imbach described the bank's role as operating at the “intersection” of digital assets and traditional finance, enabling clients to engage with new opportunities under a regulated framework. 📰 @fundseurope's Piyasi Mitra writes about Sygnum's announcement of SUI support for clients, following its role as banking partner to the @SuiFoundation. Sui, created by Mysten Labs, a team of former Meta engineers, uses parallel transaction processing to boost scalability and supports applications in DeFi, payments, real-world asset tokenization, and gaming. It has also moved early into the BTCfi sector, allowing Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi without sacrificing security. In May, Sygnum added staked SOL to its Lombard loan collateral portfolio for double earning potential on one asset. The crypto bank said it has added SOL to its portfolio of over 20 tokens as eligible collateral for its Swiss Franc, Euro, Singapore dollar, and US dollar-denominated Lombard loans. Sygnum's other Lombard loan collateral portfolio includes major coins like BTC, ETH, POL, and XRP. Mill City said it is positioning itself as a specialized SUI treasury, aiming to take advantage of the layer-1 blockchain's focus on low-latency, scalable infrastructure for AI and gaming applications. The firm's new $500 million equity line was arranged with Alliance Global Partners and is intended to further scale its position in SUI.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI-linked altcoins are in the spotlight after GPT-5's release | Credit: Hameem Sarwar OpenAI's launch of GPT-5 could inject fresh momentum into the crypto market, particularly for altcoins tied to artificial intelligence fundamentals. However, current price action suggests they could be in price discovery — a phase where market participants establish a new value range. Below, we analyze the two altcoins that could ride this AI-driven catalyst, why they are worth watching, and their potential price targets. Over the past week, WLD's price has increased by 15%. Supporting this move, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has climbed above the zero line, confirming an influx of buying pressure and suggesting that market participants are actively accumulating WLD. This positioning signals a buy condition, reinforcing the likelihood that WLD could sustain its upward trend if buying momentum remains strong. Arkham (ARKM) may be another altcoin ready to break out following the GPT-5 launch. The connection comes from Arkham's Series A funding, which raised over $12 million from high-profile investors — including Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI. This link to one of the most prominent figures in AI could generate renewed market interest, especially as GPT-5 dominates the headlines.. The Money Flow Index (MFI) is rising technically, suggesting increased buying pressure. Should this trend persist, ARKM's price could break above the $0.54 resistance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home - Guest Post - Top Altcoins to Buy Before Ethereum's Next Breakout: VeChain, Remittix and HBAR Lead the Pack While some established cryptocurrencies show signs of stagnation, these top altcoins are gaining traction, thanks to their solid fundamentals, utility, and real-world applications. VeChain's recent launch of the Stargate Staking program is a game changer, offering up to 9% APY and addressing inflation concerns by creating token scarcity. Analysts like Michaël van de Poppe have highlighted the token's potential, noting that VeChain's current valuation mirrors levels from last year, despite ecosystem changes. With VeChain's bullish setup, including a double-bottom structure and a 300% Fibonacci target, the price could surge towards $0.12 in the coming months. While VeChain builds its bullish case, Remittix (RTX) stands out as one of the top altcoins for those seeking exposure to utility-driven growth. With over $18.4 million raised in presale funding, Remittix has solidified its position in the top altcoins category, offering a robust PayFi protocol that facilitates secure, instant crypto-to-fiat transfers across 30 countries. As Remittix continues to scale, it presents an attractive opportunity for investors seeking to capitalize on top altcoins that focus on real-world applications. The RSI and MACD are signaling a positive trend, with HBAR testing key support at $0.240. Analysts are optimistic about HBAR's growth as the project continues to build a solid base. With strong technical indicators and increased institutional interest, HBAR is emerging as one of the top altcoins with strong growth potential. While other cryptocurrencies face uncertainty, these projects stand out for their utility, real-world use cases, and increasing institutional support. Remittix in particular offers an innovative solution with its PayFi protocol, positioning itself as one of the most compelling top altcoins for long-term growth. For investors looking to capitalize on top altcoins with strong fundamentals and real-world utility, Remittix is a standout choice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. A provocative theory circulating on Reddit among Bitcoin enthusiasts suggests that any movement of Satoshi Nakamoto's legendary 1 million untouched coins would signal the arrival of quantum computing powerful enough to crack cryptocurrency's foundational security. While this idea might sound like science fiction, it highlights a very real long-term threat that could fundamentally reshape the crypto landscape. However, the vulnerability isn't uniform across all Bitcoin holdings. The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market — and you can too at just $2.90/share. According to analysis from Deloitte, approximately 25% of existing Bitcoin is currently vulnerable to quantum attacks, particularly coins whose public keys have been exposed through previous transactions. The remaining Bitcoin, including Satoshi's untouched reserves, sits behind additional layers of cryptographic protection using hash functions that are considered quantum-resistant. The distinction matters because Bitcoin addresses that have never sent transactions keep their public keys hidden, making them significantly harder targets even for advanced quantum systems. This technical detail explains why Satoshi's dormant wallet has become a symbolic canary in the coal mine for quantum computing advancement. If Satoshi's coins suddenly moved, the crypto community would face two competing interpretations. Market analysts worry that any movement could trigger massive panic selling, particularly if investors interpret it as evidence of quantum computing breaches. Institutional investors, already skittish about crypto's volatility, might “flee this mess long before it happens,” causing severe price crashes across the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The psychological impact could extend beyond Bitcoin itself, potentially destabilizing confidence in all cryptographic security measures that underpin digital finance. See Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Current quantum computing technology struggles with basic mathematical problems, let alone the “insanely astronomical” challenge of cracking Bitcoin's encryption. Critics argue that more immediate threats deserve investor attention: stablecoin collapses, exchange failures, regulatory crackdowns, or smart contract vulnerabilities. As one analyst colorfully put it, worrying about quantum computing while these risks exist is like “worrying about alien invasions while your roof is on fire.” The quantum computing threat represents a fascinating intersection of cutting-edge technology and cryptocurrency security, but it's likely decades away from becoming a practical concern. Smart investors should monitor quantum computing developments while focusing on more immediate market factors. For now, Satoshi's coins remain motionless, and Bitcoin's encryption stands firm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>VivoPower shares surged over 32% after announcing a $100 million plan to buy Ripple Labs shares, expanding its exposure to Ripple equity and XRP tokens. Nasdaq-listed solar power company VivoPower International PLC saw its shares jump 32.12% to $5.10 on Friday after the company announced plans to purchase $100 million worth of privately held Ripple Labs shares, expanding its XRP-focused digital asset treasury strategy. The move, which follows two months of due diligence, will see VivoPower acquire Ripple shares directly from existing shareholders, pending approval from Ripple's executive management, the company said in a Friday press release. “Our portfolio construction strategy is to buy a combination of Ripple shares and XRP tokens. This will allow us to optimize for yield maximization while also minimizing the weighted average cost of XRP acquired,” Kevin Chin, executive chairman and CEO of VivoPower, said. Related: SBI Holdings denies reports it filed for Bitcoin-XRP dual ETF in Japan VivoPower's management argues the combined strategy will lower the average acquisition cost per XRP to an implied $0.47, an 86% discount to current market prices, based solely on Ripple's XRP holdings and excluding the value of its other business lines. According to the company, every $10 million in Ripple shares purchased could add an estimated $5.15 per share in value for VivoPower shareholders, though this depends on market volatility. On Tuesday, South Korean crypto custodian BDACS launched regulated custody services for XRP, following its February partnership with Ripple. The move leverages Ripple Custody, an enterprise-grade solution, to give institutions secure storage and management capabilities for XRP. Earlier this year, Ripple Labs partnered with South Korean crypto custodian BDACS to offer institutional custody support for XRP and its US dollar–backed stablecoin, RLUSD.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is identifying one major risk when it comes to companies holding ETH on their balance sheet. In a new interview on the Bankless podcast, Buterin says that if companies holding ETH engage in overleveraging practices, it may lead to the altcoin's collapse. “If you woke me up three years from now and told me that treasuries led to the downfall of ETH, then, of course, my guess for why would basically be that somehow they turned into an overleveraged game, and then at some point a 30% drop turned into forced liquidations that turned into a 50% drop and then a 70% and 90% drop, and then that got compounded with a loss of credibility.” However, Buterin says there are benefits in companies having an ETH treasury. “The social aspect of coordinating around ETH just being an asset that companies can have as part of their treasury is good and valuable. Having different vehicles for people to have access to ETH, which is, I think, one of the reasons why people are buying into treasury companies instead of just hodling ETH directly, is also good. Ethereum has also witnessed record ETF inflows as institutional interest grows. ETH is priced at $4,224 at time of publishing, up 8.5% in the last 24 hours and up 21.1% in the last week.

Ethereum has been the best performer amid the large-cap cryptocurrencies for the past 24 hours, wrapping up 7% gains in the interim and bringing its total weekly increase close to a whopping 20%. The move marks a major feat in ETH's price as the last time it was trading this high was in December 2021. Commenting on the matter was no other but Eric Trump, who said: It puts a smile on my face to see ETH shorts get smoked today. Stop betting against BTC and ETH – you will be run over.
