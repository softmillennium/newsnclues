                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton will aim for his first Grand Slam singles title when he competes at the US Open this year. The 22-year-old will be full of confidence, as Shelton won his first Masters 1000 title by defeating Karen Khachanov to win the Canadian Open. Shelton will have another chance at glory before arriving in New York, as he is set to compete at the ongoing Cincinnati Open. It will now be held in what is known as ‘Fan Week' rather than alongside the men and women's singles and doubles events. Teams will need to win four games to win a set, while the final will be played with regular six-game sets. One pairing sees Shelton team up with Townsend, and the All-American pair are looking forward to competing for the title. “We had some really cool celebrations, I think that's what you can expect again. I know it's in the pre-week this year, but I think it will be a lot of fun, a lot of the same. “It's a great player field, but whenever I have Taylor on my team I like my chances in mixed doubles. Shelton and Townsend played doubles together on one previous occasion. That took place at the 2023 US Open, when Shelton was just 20 years of age and they produced a strong start to their campaign. The US duo eased past Demi Schuurs and Hugo Nys to reach the semi-finals, before they lost a deciding match tiebreak to Jessica Pegula and Austin Krajicek.</p>

It announced in February that had been completed and that the ban remained in place, without saying how long it would last. The organization said Friday that Vukov would again be permitted to receive credentials allowing him access to player areas and practice courts at its events. “The WTA is fully committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all athletes and other participants, as set out in our WTA Code of Conduct and Safeguarding Code,” the tour said in a statement. While case details remain confidential, we can confirm that Mr. Vukov is eligible to receive credentials at WTA events.” The New York Times first reported that Vukov's ban had been lifted. Rybakina announced before last year's U.S. Open that Vukov would no longer be her coach, but then said before the Australian Open that he would be rejoining her team. She insisted that he had never mistreated her during their time working together.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Jannik Sinner will play his opening match of the Cincinnati Open after defeating Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon men's singles final on Jul. After receiving a first-round bye in Cincinnati, Sinner, who enters the tournament as the defending champion, will collide with 29-year-old Colombian standout Daniel Elahi Galan today in the Round of 64. Interested fans can also subscribe to Tennis Channel directly via TennisChannel.com, which allows users to watch every ATP & WTA Masters 1000 tournament, as well as numerous ATP/WTA 500 and 250 tournaments. Heading into his opening match of the Cincinnati Open, Jannik Sinner is coming to a pivotal point in the season that will see him look to defend 3,000 ranking points. After narrowly conceding the Roland Garros final to Carlos Alcaraz in early June, Sinner bounced back with a remarkable Wimbledon run that saw him win his first title at SW19 just weeks after tasting defeat at the French Open. 1 reflected on his win over Alcaraz during a pre-tournament sit-down with Tennis TV: “It has been an incredible journey for me. So I'm very happy, but in another way it has been amazing to see my family there, my brother, the people I really love which I saw after the tournament. It was such a nice atmosphere, but it happened already, we are here in Cincinnati, we try to get ready.” As Sinner went on to note, in recent weeks, the hot, humid, conditions throughout the North American hard court swing have proven to be difficult for players. During Jannik Sinner's Round of 16 match against Grigor Dimitrov at Wimbledon, the world No. 1 took an awkward fall that saw him land directly on his elbow. While there was initially some concern about a potential injury, and the Italian star underwent an MRI mid-tournament, he overcame any lingering pain to defeat Ben Shelton in the quarterfinals just two days later. Following his championship run at Wimbledon, Sinner assured members of the press that his elbow is 100% ahead of his opening match in Cincinnati, explaining that his decision to wear an arm sleeve in practice has nothing to do with a lingering injury. That's my point of view and I liked it in Wimbledon. He has been covering the UFC since 2011, with bylines dating back to before the UFC implemented its own rankings in 2013.</p>

Honestly I was in a daze and I was so focused on not having the same speech as IW 2018 finals or the Jenny/Jennifer situation (at the 2021 Australian Open) that I tried to make my speech as short as possible.“Thanks everyone for the week, see you in NY.”Osaka's post made references to her previous endearingly awkward trophy ceremony gaffes over the years. At Indian Wells in 2018, Osaka nervously rambled and giggled through what she called “the worst acceptance speech of all time” after winning her first WTA title. In 2021, after beating Jennifer Brady in the Australian Open final, she famously asked her opponent, “Do you like to be called Jenny or Jennifer?” Brady replied “Jenny”, but Osaka immediately began her speech with, "Firstly I want to congratulate Jennifer…”“Omg no,” Osaka later wrote on X, formerly Twitter. “Thanks Montreal it's been a really great run,” Osaka wrote.

Mboko, meanwhile, appeared completely unfazed by the Montreal incident.“I didn't really get a chance to speak with her after the game, but I mean, I was kind of really caught up in everything that was happening after the match,” she said in her post-match press conference.“If that was her wishes, then I respect it as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jim Courier has admitted that he's really excited to watch one American talent play at the Cincinnati Open and beyond this year. And, in his opinion, fans of the sport should be too. After all, in his eyes, he has an intriguing, ‘unorthodox' play style that should capture attention regardless of whether he wins or loses. Fortunately for the player in question, he has been winning far more often throughout 2025, finally enjoying a period of stability after his form and fitness had failed him. It was soon justified, as he rallied to win in three sets against a solid opponent, Alexandre Muller. Stream every match live on the Tennis Channel App 📲 #CincyTennis pic.twitter.com/5Ux5GQZY4B Ranked right around 100 in the world right now, already a titleist this year as a qualifier, won the title in Houston, and then qualified and made another final for good measure in Eastbourne on the grass, where Taylor Fritz stopped him. So it's been wonderful to see Jensen really get back in business. “The two wrist surgeries on both wrists, the unfortunate suspension, and now back, befuddling opponents with his really unorthodox game, so fun to see. But he's someone to cheer for, in my opinion.” Naturally, the likes of Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe make up the apex of that list, with stars like Learner Tien, Brandon Nakashima and Alex Michelsen just behind them, ranked between 30th and 50th in the world. Shelton became the youngest American since Pete Sampras to achieve a huge feat in Toronto earlier this week, as he beat Fritz, his fellow American. Ethan Quinn, Sebastian Korda, Emilio Nava and Mackenzie McDonald make up the final four Americans who are all higher ranked than Brooksby.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But at the Cincinnati Open, there has been a lot of discussion unrelated to forehands and backhands. I was talking with all the players and it's actually very strange for us to come to a venue where everything was new,” said Jannik Sinner, the No. “It's amazing what they did in one year. Everything has improved so, so much, but mostly the space we have for us players. “There are huge things inside and also outdoors. Indoors the dining area is much, much bigger and when you come from the transportation, it's like a hotel kind of, so it's amazing. I feel very happy and honoured to have this kind of revolution because it's something great for us and our sport.” Tournament organisers completely overhauled the facility, adding a new player building with state-of-the-art dining and lounge spaces, with indoor and outdoor spaces to relax, a coffee bar, giant televisions, padel courts, backyard games and plenty more. “To be honest it's impressive,” second seed Carlos Alcaraz told the media. I think it's what we needed and we're feeling great right now with the new everything.” The 2019 Cincinnati Open champion, Daniil Medvedev, added to ATP Media: “Whenever any tournament makes a big improvement for players — for fans also, but I can only talk as a player — it's always a benefit. Andrey Rublev, a finalist at the tournament in 2021, noted that he was happy with the experience in Cincinnati to begin with. “Cincinnati showed really huge improvement in one year,” Rublev told ATPTour.com. “But to be fair, for me in Cincinnati [there] were always good conditions. Even last year with everything in terms of space, in terms of lockers, in terms of some activities, lounges, I felt it was on a good level.” 144 Daniel Elahi Galan, who will take on Sinner Monday in Cincinnati, is competing in his third ATP Masters 1000 event of the season and has been “super happy” with his experience. One thing he pointed to is the abundance of practice courts — in the southern section of the venue alone there is a new block of 10 courts with seating for fans. There are 31 outdoor courts total, up from 17 in 2023. “We have enough courts that we don't have to share… The food, I'm vegetarian and it's been very good actually, which is not normal at every tournament. That's something also to be happy about.” French doubles player Sadio Doumbia compared it to an amusement park. We just arrived today and I'm having a blast.

In the first semifinal, Yerkezhan Zhanatayeva faced Turkmenistan's Ilima Guseynova.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu is scheduled for a rematch with Aryna Sabalenka following the Wimbledon drama that left the British star in tears. Raducanu was heard asking the chair umpire: “You saw it out as well, right?” She said: “That call was for sure out. I've had a few in my other matches, too, that have been very wrong. The technology has become standard across the tour, with all ATP Tour events and a lot of WTA ones no longer using line judges. Another moment of controversy during the Sabalenka match involved Raducanu's racket, which received needed running repairs. “I had all my rackets strung up fresh for the match, and it just felt like it was pinging completely different. It could have been a little bit because the roof was on. I sent a couple rackets to be restrung.” Sabalenka has little sympathy, reminding her young rival that preparation was key. "For example, my team, they always have like two extra rackets with the higher tension and two extra rackets with lower tension. You don't have to wait for another racket.” Meanwhile, Raducanu has started working with Rafael Nadal's former coach, Francis Roig. The 22-year-old has been working with fellow Brit Mark Petchey on an informal basis since March and has now added Roig to her team. The Spaniard worked alongside Nadal and his uncle Toni for the majority of his career, during which time he won 22 Grand Slams. Speaking about teaming up with Roig ahead of the Cincinnati Open, Raducanu told Sky Sports: “It's going really well, it's my second day here with him here, but I did a few days in London before I came out here. "He's obviously got a bank of experience and I'm very excited to continue working with him and to have him on my side.” Roig joins Raducanu's coaching set-up as she continues preparations for the US Open, the tournament she won in 2021.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tennis fans got their first glimpse of what promises to be one of the most entertaining partnerships at the US Open when Emma Navarro and Jannik Sinner crossed paths at the Cincinnati Open this week. 1 and American rising star offered a preview of their playful dynamic, complete with jokes about hitting partners and net play that has everyone buzzing ahead of their highly anticipated mixed doubles debut. The interaction between Navarro and Sinner revealed their natural chemistry as they prepare for their US Open debut together. When Sinner walked onto the court to applause from the crowd, he went over to hug Navarro. The American then asked with a smile, “Are we practicing right now? They told me I am the hitting partner.” The brief encounter was captured on video and quickly went viral on social media, giving fans their first look at how the pair interact off-court. The pairing of Navarro and Sinner came together in an unexpected way for the revamped US Open mixed doubles event. As Sinner revealed during Wimbledon, the two had never met or texted before tournament organizers matched them up. “I just met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked or texted to each other. Despite their lack of prior connection, both players have embraced the partnership with enthusiasm and humor. Navarro playfully described how the collaboration started during a Wimbledon interview, joking that Sinner “was begging me to play.” She added with a grin, “He was saying, I heard about your volleys and your doubles skills. You're not the best player, but I'll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year.” Navarro sent him a humorous message pointing out areas for improvement in his net game. You did hit a tweener between your legs at the net at one point, which was kind of cool or whatever, but you missed the overhead,” she said in the video. Her playful coaching advice continued: “I need you to step up your game a little bit and sort of match my level there. With their combined star power and easy chemistry, Navarro and Sinner are among the favorites to claim the title in this reimagined event. Their partnership represents more than just a pairing of top players. It's become a showcase of personalities that could help bring new energy to mixed doubles tennis. If their Cincinnati encounter is any indication, fans are in for plenty of entertainment both on and off the court when the US Open begins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stefano Vukov (left), pictured with Elena Rybakina at the 2024 Australian Open, has had his ban lifted. Stefano Vukov has been cleared to return from his WTA Tour-imposed suspension. Stefano Vukov was provisionally suspended in January while the WTA conducted an investigation. Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko delights crowds in Montreal and Toronto with her Canadian Open final win over four-time grand slam winner Naomi Osaka. "The WTA is fully committed to providing a safe and respectful environment for all athletes and other participants, as set out in our WTA code of conduct and safeguarding code," the tour said in a statement. "Any sanctions issued following a breach of these safeguarding rules are carefully considered and are subject to appeal before an independent tribunal. "While case details remain confidential, we can confirm that Mr Vukov is eligible to receive credentials at WTA events." Rybakina announced before last year's US Open that Vukov would no longer be her coach. But prior to this year's Australian Open, Rybakina said he would be rejoining her team. She insisted he had never mistreated her during their time working together.
