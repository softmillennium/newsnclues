                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jim Acosta, former senior White House correspondent for CNN, spent President Donald Trump's first term making himself the story. An ultimate example of this behavior was when he lectured Stephen Miller on Trump's call for immigrants to learn English. It doesn't say anything about speaking English,” Acosta piously said in what was supposed to be a question in 2017. “I am shocked at your statement that you think only people from Great Britain and Australia would know English,” Miller retorted. “It reveals your cosmopolitan bias to a shocking degree. This is an amazing moment — that you think only people from Great Britain or Australia would speak English is so insulting to millions of hardworking immigrants who do speak English from all over the world. That is one of the most outrageous, insulting, ignorant, and foolish things you have ever said.” And he's right: 125 million people speak English in India alone. Acosta would later go on CNN that night to make himself the victim for asking a ridiculous question. “People often ask me if the highlight of my career at CNN was at the White House covering Donald Trump,” he said during his last broadcast. The tyrant in Acosta's mind, of course, is Trump. As for holding the powerful to account, it's worth noting Acosta couldn't leave his position of White House correspondent fast enough after Biden's victory in 2020 because that would mean holding a Democrat administration accountable and that simply was not going to happen. Since leaving CNN, Acosta has launched a podcast that involves only interviewing Democrats. It couldn't be any more tedious since the conversation is two people agreeing with each other the entire time. With barely anyone watching these online interviews (his last one on Thursday generated a whopping 5,700 viewers on his YouTube channel), the host decided to do the unthinkable: Interview an AI-generated avatar of a dead teenager, Joaquin Oliver, who was murdered during that horrific school shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018 that left 17 dead. “A show you don't want to miss at 4p ET / 1p PT. But his parents have created an AI version of their son to deliver a powerful message on gun violence,” a shameless Acosta posted on X while turning replies off. I believe in a mix of stronger gun control laws, mental health support, and community engagement. “It's about building a culture of kindness and understanding. “I think that's a great idea, Joaquin,” Acosta responded while acting as if this were an interview with an actual person. It can't be underscored enough just how sick and unethical this is. For starters, we have zero idea what Joaquin's views were on gun control or if he had an opinion on the matter at all. In this case, the AI version was obviously pre-programmed to agree with Acosta on gun control. And since this drew attention, thought mostly negative, Acosta will likely do something this again to satisfy his constant need for attention. What is so telling in 2025 is how much those who claimed to be serious, objective journalists have completely exposed themselves for who they've been all along: Lefty activists with a microphone. In the past few months alone, we've heard ex-ABC White House correspondent Terry Moran argue that it's “not reporter's job to be objective” while calling Trump's immigration policy “a terror campaign.” Don Lemon, another ex-CNNer, argued that “no rational Black person” could support Trump (after Trump got the highest share of the Black vote in more than 50 years in 2024), while ex-MSNBCer Joy Reid has compared Trump's immigration centers to “concentration camps” designed to round up “brown people.” Because no sane person would ever greenlight such an obvious, and pathetic, publicity stunt.</p>

Detroit Lions players stand on the field after safety Morice Norris was injured during the second half of an NFL preseason football game against the Atlanta Falcons Friday, Aug. 8, 2025, in Atlanta. Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris (26) is hit in the helmet by Atlanta Falcons running back Nathan Carter (38) during the second half of an NFL preseason football game Friday, Aug. 8, 2025, in Atlanta. Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions players stand on the field hand in hand together after Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris was injured during the second half of an NFL preseason football game Friday, Aug. 8, 2025, in Atlanta. DETROIT (AP) — Detroit Lions safety Morice Norris shared a social post Saturday, saying he's OK and thanking people for their support after he was taken off the field in an ambulance late in a preseason game against the Atlanta Falcons. Norris was in stable condition late Friday night after he was attended to for about 20 minutes by medical personnel and taken to an Atlanta hospital. He hit Carter with his facemask facing the running back's midsection and his head snapped back after assisting on the tackle. “Usually you see a couple trainers out there,” Lions quarterback Kyle Allen said. “It's never good when they bring out the stretchers.” “Raheem Morris is a class act,” Campbell said. We agreed it just didn't feel right to finish that game.” Norris, a former Fresno State standout, played in eight games last season after earning a spot on the team as an undrafted rookie. NFL preseason games ended early in consecutive weeks two years ago. New England's game at Green Bay in Week 2 of the 2023 preseason was called off when Patriots cornerback Isaiah Bolden was carted off in the fourth quarter. Bolden was taken to a hospital and released the next day. A week later, a game between Miami and Jacksonville was not completed after Dolphins receiver Daewood Davis was carted off in the fourth quarter. Davis was released from the hospital a day later. The two frightening injuries happened some eight months after Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest and had to be resuscitated on the field during a regular-season game at Cincinnati in January 2023. Hamlin has enjoyed a remarkable recovery and resumed football the following season and spent last year as a Bills starter. “You never think something like that is going to happen. We may be on 32 different teams but we've all played football our whole lives and had our own injuries and been through it.” AP Sports Writers Charles Odum and John Wawrow contributed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House has announced an increased federal law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C., for at least the next week to combat crime. Mayor of the District of Columbia Muriel Bowser speaks as U.S. Attorney Jeanine Ferris Pirro, left, listens during a news conference in Washington, May 22, 2025. Pamela Smith, Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, speaks during a briefing, June 9, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Around 2 a.m., noisy revelers emerging from clubs and bars packed the sidewalks of U Street in Washington, many of them seeking a late-night slice or falafel. At other late-night hot spots, nearly identical scenes unfolded. What wasn't apparent in Friday's earliest hours: any sort of security lockdown by a multiagency flood of uniformed federal law enforcement officers. That's what President Donald Trump had promised Thursday, starting at midnight, in the administration's latest move to impose its will on the nation's capital. In short, that law enforcement surge to take control of the District of Columbia's streets did not appear to unfold on schedule. A two-hour city tour, starting around 1 a.m. Friday, revealed no overt or visible law enforcement presence other than members of the Metropolitan Police Department, the city's police force. That still might change in the coming evenings as Trump puts into action his long-standing plans to “take over” a capital city he has repeatedly slammed as unsafe, filthy and badly run. On Friday night, a White House official said Thursday night's operations included arrests for possession of two stolen firearms, suspected fentanyl and marijuana. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Marshals Service — were to be on duty Friday night, upping the complement of federal officers involved. Mayor Muriel Bowser, who publicly faced off against Trump in 2020 when he called in a massive federal law enforcement response to disperse crowds of protesters, has not said a public word since Trump's declaration. Trump quickly renewed his calls for the federal government to seize control. “If D.C. doesn't get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they're not going to get away with it anymore,” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. He later told reporters he was considering everything from repealing Washington's limited “home rule” autonomy to “bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly.” The threats come at a time when Bowser's government can legitimately claim to have reduced the number of homicides and carjackings, both of which spiked in 2023. The number of carjackings overall dropped significantly the following year in 2024, from 957 to just under 500, and is on track to decline again this year, with less than 200 recorded so far more than halfway through the year. The portion of juveniles arrested for carjacking, though, has remained above 50%, and Bowser's government has taken steps to reign in a new phenomenon of rowdy teenagers causing disarray and disturbances in public spaces. Emergency legislation passed by the D.C. Council this summer imposed tighter youth curfew restrictions and empowered Police Chief Pamela Smith to declare temporary juvenile curfew zones for four days at a time. Trump is within his powers in deploying federal law enforcement assets on D.C. streets. Further steps, including taking over the police department, would require a declaration of emergency. Legal experts believe that would most likely be challenged in court. Such an approach would fit the general pattern of Trump's second term in office, when he has declared states of emergency on issues ranging from border protection to economic tariffs. In many cases, he moved forward while the courts sorted it out. It's a step that Trump said lawyers are examining. That law was specific to Washington, not other communities in the United States that have their own home rule powers but generally retain representation in their state legislatures, said Monica Hopkins, executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia. Signed into law by President Richard Nixon, the measure allowed D.C. residents to elect their own mayor, council and local commissioners.

Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Fox News Flash top headlines are here. A co-owner of a Trump-branded burger chain in Texas is facing deportation as officials allege that the Lebanese national overstayed his visa, engaged in "sham" marriages and has a criminal record that includes an assault charge. The 28-year-old restaurateur, Roland Mehrez Beainy, entered the United States in 2019 as a non-immigrant visitor and remained in the country illegally when his visa expired in February 2024, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) told Fox News Digital on Saturday. Beainy – who currently operates Trump Burger locations in Houston, Bellville, Flatonia and Kemah – opened the first restaurant in Bellville in 2020 but was never authorized to use the Trump name or branding, according to local reports. Officials said Beainy's political leanings won't shield him from President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. People line up to order food at Trump Burger on July 28, 2022, in Bellville, Texas. "Despite false claims to the contrary, Roland Mehrez Beainy does not have any immigration benefits that prevented his arrest or removal from the United States," an ICE spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Saturday. "Under the current administration, ICE is committed to restore integrity to our nation's immigration system by holding all individuals accountable who illegally enter the country or overstay the terms of their admission. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said officials revoked Beainy's petition for immigration status after members of his own family admitted that his marriage was "a sham designed to game the system." "The Department of Homeland Security has zero tolerance for immigration fraud, and this individual's claims are baseless," a DHS spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement Saturday. "This person has no Green Card, a history of illegal marriages, and an assault charge. DHS is actively pursuing all legal avenues to address this flagrant abuse of our immigration laws." A customer picks up her cheeseburgers branded with "Trump" at Trump Burger on Thursday, July 28, 2022, in Bellville, Texas. The restaurateur was arrested by ICE in May and placed into immigration proceedings, but was granted bond in June, the agency said, adding that his deportation case will continue to proceed through the courts. People walk out of Trump Burger on Thursday, July 28, 2022, in Bellville, Texas. Beainy's burger chain has been embroiled in branding conflicts and other business disputes this year. In February, attorneys for the Trump Organization sent Trump Burger a cease-and-desist letter accusing it of "misleading the public into falsely believing that your business is affiliated with the Trump Organization or endorsed by our clients," according to The Fayette County Record. "We were surprised to learn that you have been flagrantly infringing upon the Trump Organization's valuable and well-established intellectual property right by operating at least three restaurants under the Trump name and brand," the letter read. In a separate matter in June, the restaurant sued its Kemah, Texas, landlord, Archie Patterson, who allegedly forced staff out and took control of the location, according to the Houston Chronicle. Patterson responded with his own lawsuit accusing Beainy of unpaid debts, the outlet added. The Trump Organization and the attorney representing Beainy, Geoffrey S. Binney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Saturday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Zelensky defiant: Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky says his country “will not give land to the occupier” after US President Donald Trump said there could be some “swapping of territories” to end the war in Ukraine. • Vance attending UK meeting: US Vice President JD Vance and the UK's Foreign Minister David Lammy are hosting a summit later today in Britain with Ukrainian and European allies. Location matters, former real estate mogul US President Donald Trump said. The conditions around Friday's summit so wildly favor Moscow, it is obvious why Putin leapt at the chance, after months of fake-negotiation, and it is hard to see how a deal emerges from the bilateral that does not eviscerate Ukraine. Read our full analysis here and watch more from CNN's Nick Paton Walsh in Kyiv below: President Donald Trump said he'll be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss a potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine that could include “some swapping of territories.” But as CNN's Nick Paton Walsh explains, the conditions around Friday's summit so wildly favor Moscow, it's hard to see how a deal emerges that does not eviscerate Ukraine. #cnn #news #ukraine #russia #zelensky #putin #alaska #trump #analysis #war #peace US officials have said a plan offered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt the war in Ukraine would include significant territorial concessions by Kyiv, according to Western officials briefed on the matter. The plan, which Putin presented to US President Donald Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff in a meeting in Moscow on Wednesday, would require Ukraine to cede the eastern Donbas region — the majority of which is currently occupied by Russia — as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has quashed the idea of any territory concessions, saying his country “will not give land to the occupier.” Those who have lived in and studied the region describe it as an independent and gritty center of industry that has remained suspicious of outside forces for decades. Shortly before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Putin issued a decree recognizing the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics. It comes just ahead of a quickly-arranged meeting in England, featuring US Vice President JD Vance, UK foreign minister David Lammy and European officials. French President Emmanuel Macron wrote in a post on X that he had a discussion with Zelensky as well as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “The future of Ukraine cannot be decided without the Ukrainians who have been fighting for their freedom and security for over three years now.” Ukrainians in Kyiv have been giving us their reaction to the upcoming meeting between US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska next Friday. Speaking to CNN in the capital city, Artem, 33, said the meeting is “just for show,” and described Trump as a “spineless windbag.” Trump indicated Friday there could be “some swapping of territories” between Russia and Ukraine as part of a negotiation to end the war. How many people are waiting for us under occupation, who unfortunately do not have the opportunity to leave. And they are waiting for Ukraine under the threat of death,” she said. Svitlana, 57, said she believes Putin has no intention of halting his offensive, and offered a bleak outlook on Ukraine's prospects for victory. We can't take back our territory with drones. “We'll wait until Putin is carried out dead, maybe then the situation will change,” she added. We can give you more now on the backdrop to today's quickly arranged meeting in England, featuring US Vice President JD Vance and UK foreign minister David Lammy. European leaders have been scrambling since Wednesday to gain a better read on what Putin told Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Moscow on Wednesday. Witkoff was expected to participate in Saturday's meeting virtually, the officials said. Vance was already in England on holiday with his family, and the meeting was added to his schedule, which had already included a meeting with the British foreign secretary on Friday. That has left European leaders urgently working to both ascertain more details, but also to stress the importance of Ukraine having a say in the final plan. When Russian President Vladimir Putin travels to Alaska next week to meet with President Donald Trump, he will be able do so with confidence that he won't be arrested. Putin has been careful with his travel itineraries since the warrant was issued. But, a year later, he did make his way to China and North Korea, neither of which is signed up to the court. In 2023, Putin did travel to Mongolia, which is a signatory. Mongolia asserted that under Article 98 of the Rome Statute, a state cannot “act inconsistently with its obligations under international law with respect to the (…) diplomatic immunity of a person.” A panel of judges said member states “are duty-bound to arrest and surrender individuals subject to ICC warrants, regardless of official position or nationality.” Not only has the US never been a signatory to the Rome Statute, but in February Trump ordered sanctions against the court after it issued an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant. After a Russian assault left all three of his fellow soldiers dead and himself wounded, Andriy, stationed near Siversk, Ukraine, thought his life was over. But back at his command bunker, they hatched a plan. National security advisors, including those from the US, Ukraine and Europe, are gathering in Britain later today for a meeting hosted by US Vice President JD Vance and UK foreign minister David Lammy. Earlier, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky insisted his country “will not give land to the occupier” after US President Donald Trump – who is due to meet Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday – said there could be some “swapping of territories” to end the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us, below are the latest developments: We reported earlier on the phone call between UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. We know now US Vice President JD Vance and the UK's Foreign Minister David Lammy are hosting a meeting later today in Britain, with Ukrainian and European allies. According to Downing Street, the meeting is taking place in Kent at the request of the US and comes ahead of an expected meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, as we've also been reporting. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just said he held a phone call with the UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer earlier today. A UK government spokesperson added they looked ahead to the meeting of National Security Advisers from Europe, Ukraine and the United States taking place today, hosted by the UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and US Vice President JD Vance. Away from developments on next week's US and Russia summit in Alaska now, and a memo written by the Pentagon's policy chief last month gives the Defense Department the option to divert certain weapons and equipment intended for Ukraine back into US stockpiles, according to four people who have read it. This is a dramatic shift that could see billions of dollars previously earmarked for the war-torn country go toward replenishing dwindling American supplies. Even as Trump has greenlit a plan to sell US weapons to Ukraine through NATO, there remain deep concerns inside the Pentagon over arming Kyiv in its war with Russia at the expense of US stockpiles. That is particularly true of highly sought-after items that remain in short supply, such as interceptor missiles, air defense systems and artillery ammunition. We can bring you Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky's video address following US President Donald Trump's announcement of a summit in Alaska involving the US and Russia. Former CNN Moscow Bureau chief Jill Dougherty has been reacting to the confirmation of next Friday's summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. She told CNN's Isabel Rosales on CNN This Morning the fact the summit is taking place on US soil makes for an “amazingly complex and fascinating moment,” when it comes to relations between Russia and the US. “There's a lot of history here, Alaska used to be part of Russia until the US bought it and at this moment, there are nationalists in Russia saying we “want it back”. “I would say there's a new wrinkle, though, the Russians now are saying that maybe because all of this is so complicated, we need a second summit…the first one hasn't even taken place. “Now they're talking about another one in Moscow, and they're also talking about what I would say is kind of luring President Trump with the idea that the Arctic, of course, up near Alaska, is a place that could be developed and there could be all sorts of deals.” Ukraine's security service, the SBU, said today it had struck a Russian logistical hub storing Iranian-made Shahed drones in Russia's east-central region of Tatarstan. “Each such successful special operation reduces the enemy's ability to wage a war of aggression against Ukraine.” The incremental Russian gains come as Russian President Vladimir Putin proposes a plan to the US that would require Ukraine to cede the eastern Donbas region — most of which is currently occupied — as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, according to US officials. The Russians have been trying to take Pokrovsk for more than a year. Ukrainian defenses have held, but Moscow's advances to the north and southwest of the town are threatening to cut off Ukrainian supply routes. For context: According to the Belfer Center at Harvard University, Russian forces gained 226 square miles (585 sq kms) of Ukrainian territory between July 8 and August 5, up from 190 square miles the previous month. US officials have briefed European leaders and Ukrainian officials on a plan offered by Putin to halt the war in Ukraine in exchange for significant territorial concessions by Kyiv, according to Western officials briefed on the matter. The plan, which Putin presented to Trump's foreign envoy Steve Witkoff in a meeting in Moscow on Wednesday, would require Ukraine to cede the eastern Donbas region — the majority of which is currently occupied by Russia — as well as Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014. It alarmed some European officials, who voiced concern it was Putin's attempt to avoid Trump's threatened sanctions, which were supposed to come due Friday, while offering little in return. But the plan appeared to be the impetus for which Trump put in motion plans for a summit meeting with Putin as soon as next week. Witkoff spoke with several European officials on Friday to lay out additional details of the plan. It wasn't clear what the plan would mean for two other regions in Ukraine — Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — where Russia controls some territory, beyond Russia stopping its offensive there. Back now to the summit itself, and Russia has confirmed President Vladimir Putin is to meet US counterpart Donald Trump in Alaska next Friday, August 15. Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov described the two countries as “close neighbors, so it is quite logical that the leaders' summit will take place in Alaska,” Russian state news agency TASS reported. “Born as Russian America – Orthodox roots, forts, fur trade – Alaska echoes those ties and makes the US an Arctic nation,” Dmitriev said in a post on X. A Trump-Putin meeting has been floated by both sides for some time. When the two men do meet on August 15, one apparent American objective is a trilateral summit with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss an end to the war. It's improbable that Putin would agree to a ceasefire in which the front lines stay as they are – the United States, Europe and Ukraine already demanded such a pause in May, under the threat of sanctions, and Russia rejected it. Catastrophe for Ukraine and NATO - Putin could correctly see the cracks in Western unity after a summit with Trump that improves US-Russian relations but leaves Ukraine to fend for itself. Disaster for Putin: a repeat of the Soviets in Afghanistan - Russia could blunder on, expending thousands of soldiers' lives a week, for relatively small gains, and seeing sanctions erode his alliance with China, and revenue from India. More reaction now from Ukraine to the meeting between Trump and Putin next week in Alaska. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has said in a post on X that Ukraine deserves a peace based on “respect for our territorial integrity and borders defined by our Constitution.” “Russia must not be rewarded for starting this war,” he added. “Despite tireless efforts by the United States and Ukraine's continued willingness to seek a fair peace, Russia continues its terror against civilians, ignores deadlines, and shows no genuine interest in ending the war. Sybiha added that Ukraine stands “ready to work with the United States and all our international partners” to achieve a “just and lasting peace.” As we've been reporting, President Donald Trump said he'll be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska after previewing terms of a potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine that could include “some swapping of territories.” CNN anchor and chief White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins has this report:</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky rejected any peace deal that would involve Ukraine ceding territory, setting up a major barrier for President Donald Trump's peace summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Hopes of a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine are high in Washington, D.C., with Trump announcing on Friday that he would be meeting Putin on U.S. soil to discuss a lasting peace to end fighting over Ukraine. His statement took on a much more stern tone with the United States than in previous weeks. “Ukraine is ready for real decisions that can bring peace. He appeared to dismiss the Alaska peace talks, saying it was “Very far away from this war, which is raging on our land, against our people, and which anyway can't be ended without us, without Ukraine.” The Ukrainian president repeatedly stressed that Ukraine would only accept a “dignified peace,” which he defined as not ceding any territory to Russia. Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,” Zelensky said. His readout of the call with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen elaborated on his objections to Russia's peace overtures. I spoke with the Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen @Statsmin. These days, diplomatic activity is extremely high.However, we see no changes in… Ukraine has been on the back foot against Russia for over a year and a half, with most hopes of an outright military victory over Moscow largely disappearing following Kyiv's disastrous summer counteroffensive in the Zaporizhzhia oblast in 2023. While Kyiv had ceased outright saying that the only acceptable end to the war would be the restoration of Ukraine's 1991 borders, a position it voiced throughout 2022 and 2023, Zelensky's newest comments appear to show that, despite military defeats, Ukraine hasn't changed its position. Russia solidified its annexation of Donetsk, Lugansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts in September 2022, and has repeatedly stressed that it considers the areas fully Russian territory and would not accept any peace deal that involves ceding its land. The irreconcilable differences have sunk all previous attempts at peace talks, and could very well sink any breakthroughs made in Alaska on Friday. The exact details of Russia's latest peace proposal are murky. A report from the Wall Street Journal, based on talks with European and Ukrainian officials, said Moscow offered to halt fighting if Ukrainian forces completely withdrew from Donetsk Oblast, which would then be followed by a lasting peace deal. Analysts argued the deal would be a nonstarter even before Zelensky's public denunciation of any territorial concessions. Donetsk is the location of Ukraine's most heavily fortified positions, leaving it more vulnerable if the ceasefire breaks down. The anonymous U.S. official speaking with the Washington Post said that Putin was acting “like Hitler who received some lands and wanted more.” Friday's planned meeting in Alaska will be Putin's first visit to the U.S. since 2015. Putin last met with a U.S. president when he sat down with former President Joe Biden in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2021. Direct communication between Moscow and Washington was cut off following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which saw Biden rally behind Ukraine. Trump opened up direct dialogue with Putin shortly after beginning his second term in an effort to serve as a neutral mediator, but a face-to-face meeting on U.S. soil is another major step. The sudden turnaround came after months of deteriorating relations between Washington and Moscow, with Trump growing frustrated by Russia's continued offensive in Donetsk and constant missile and drone attacks throughout Ukraine. Trump had softened his position on Kyiv over the past few weeks, committing to more military aid for Ukraine. Despite Ukraine's stalwart defense, Russia has gained the upper hand on nearly every front, slowly grinding away the Ukrainian armed forces while hopes of a Russian economic collapse remain elusive.</p>

Ron Wyden, D-Ore., pauses while speaking during an interview with the Associated Press after he held a town hall meeting Friday, July 25, 2025, in Wasco, Ore. (AP Photo/Jenny Kane) After a recent town hall in Wasco in conservative Sherman County, Wyden said questions about age are “fair game for debate” but that he is still up to the job and the fight against Republican President Donald Trump's policies. “I believe you ought to be held accountable,” he told The Associated Press in an interview. Many Democrats have lingering anguish about Joe Biden's decision to seek a second White House term despite persistent concerns about whether he was up to the job at age 81. He dropped out in July 2024 and Trump went on to defeat then-Vice President Kamala Harris. “I've consistently called for all elected officials over the age of 70 to make this their final term — to step down with dignity and make room for the next generation of leaders,” said Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a group that supports progressive young candidates. Multiple Democratic senators have announced this year that they won't seek reelection, including 80-year-old Dick Durbin of Illinois. Litman said she hopes another Democrat emerges to challenge Wyden. Wyden continues to travel across his state engaging with voters of all political stripes. Some 20 people gathered at a former grade school nestled among wheat fields and wind turbines. “Every Oregonian counts, no matter where they live,” Wyden told them. As other Democrats grapple over strategy, the senator says the old-school town hall tradition has become a key communication tool in an era of deepening division. The National Republican Campaign Committee recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to promote the new tax breaks and spending cuts law, but in smaller settings they can control. Yet the small town hall gathering stood out for its civility, compared with the raucous crowds faced recently by other members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans. While some pressed Wyden, they waited to be called on and thanked him for coming. Charlie Hogue, 71, asked a question that went to the heart of Democratic concerns that leaders aren't pushing back hard enough against Trump. “I thought we had checks and balances in this country, and I'm beginning to lose hope because the current administration ignores court orders,” he said. Wyden cited examples of how he had challenged Trump: a recent trip to Canada, where the senator spoke with the prime minister about trade, and discussions with Oregon wheat farmers about tariffs. Fassbender, 76, wondered why it seems that Democrats support immigrants who entered the country illegally. Wyden responded that he believed the immigration system was “broken” and noted that a bipartisan border bill collapsed in the Senate last year after then-candidate Trump came out against it. “If somebody has committed a crime, for example, I don't think that should be something that is protected as part of legislation,” Wyden said. “What's been going on, unfortunately, is we have some government agencies coming and swooping up people who've done nothing wrong.” “I believe that legal immigration makes our country better and stronger,” he said. Recently, Wyden has emerged as a leading Democratic voice in pressing for more information on the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking case. He isn't new to the effort, which has become a political crisis for Trump. The Justice Department and FBI recently said there was no Epstein “client list,” walking back a notion that the administration had previously promoted. “And we're going to stay at it until the facts come out.” Wyden said Democrats agonizing over low voter morale and party strategy should hold more meetings in conservative areas, where they might learn something from the people they represent.</p>

CINCINNATI, OHIO - Southwest Ohio residents are expressing outrage at local leadership after a viral street fight in their backyard that captured the nation's attention. The Saturday night violence in downtown Cincinnati on July 26, which left a woman knocked unconscious on the street at the hands of a male assailant, was the result of a city that wasn't "prepared" due to political ideology, Price Hill native Adam Koehler told Fox News Digital. "Leadership comes out and says, 'Hey, we've got a problem. Here's my solution to fix it,'" Koehler said. "But instead, they want to be cowardly and hide the fact that crime is actually happening." Cincinnati's mayor and other local officials have faced heated criticism in recent days over the perception they are not taking crime seriously. One elected Democrat, Councilwoman Victoria Parks, posted on social media saying that the victims of the fight "begged for that beatdown." Fox News Digital spoke to Cincinnati resident Adam Koehler about crime in the city. "This is a Democrat monopoly they've got here," Koehler, an entrepreneur and former candidate for Hamilton County commissioner, told Fox News Digital. And luckily there are some city council members that denounced the words that Victoria Parks said, which is great, but you've got other people that just want to stoke the flames." Holly, the woman brutally knocked out and bruised in the attack, told Fox News this week she is yet to receive a phone call from the mayor or top officials "just apologizing for what happened and for letting these thugs and criminals run the streets when they should have been in jail to begin with." Koehler told Fox News Digital that Democrats running the city "have an agenda" and "want to look a certain way" and "ignore the problem." "Every generation thinks they figured something out about crime and they're soft-hearted people, they wanted to do things, but, you know, policies like what Giuliani did in New York, those kind of things work." (L-R) Jermaine Matthews, Dominique Kittle, DeKyra Vernon, Montianez Merriweather and Patrick Rosemond are facing various charges for their alleged roles in the viral beatdown in Cincinnati, Ohio, on July 26, 2025. Koehler, who was speaking to Fox News Digital outside a GOP gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy town hall event on Cincinnati's west side, said figures like Ramaswamy, Sen. Bernie Moreno, and Ohio native VP JD Vance are reasons to be optimistic about addressing the crime spike downtown. "I mean you start throwing the DOJ down here and start investigating some of the things that are happening, why wasn't there more police there?" Koehler added, "I mean there's a lot of grifting that goes on whenever you have a one-party monopoly in any city. Moreno said this week he is introducing "Holly's Act," a move aimed at ending what he calls the justice system's revolving door for repeat offenders. "Let's be honest, because a lot of times you guys are qualifying this as a brawl," Moreno told reporters. "This was attempted murder of an innocent woman. Nobody who has that rap sheet should be walking the streets of any Ohio city free." Fox News Digital's Julia Bonavita and Peter D'Abrosca contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roy Cooper announced his plans to run for Senate, a group backing Republicans released an ad with an echo of last year's presidential campaign. Republicans are reprising a key attack line from last year's presidential race for elections this year and next, betting that anti-trans messaging will help them counter Democrats running on GOP-led cuts to Medicaid and other parts of Trump's policy megabill. Trump allies spent tens of millions of dollars airing an ad highlighting 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris' one-time commitment that detained immigrants would have access to treatment associated with gender transition as was required by federal law, including surgical care. Trans and gender identity issues have also come up in this year's race for Virginia governor. One ad attacking Sen. Jon Ossoff aired during a basketball game and referenced the broadcast. Chris LaCivita, Trump's 2024 co-campaign manager and an architect of the “Kamala is for they/them” ads, said it made sense for Republicans to bring back messaging they see as driving a wedge between Democrats and key voting blocs. “That's what is playing out right now across the country, in Senate, House and gubernatorial races.” Democrats argue that Republicans are using the issue as a distraction. “Republicans have given in to the most extreme fringes of their party by abandoning pocketbook issues in favor of an anti-freedom agenda that is obsessed with letting politicians make decisions that should be left to parents and doctors,” said Viet Shelton, a spokesperson for the Democrats' House campaign arm, in a statement. “Rather than getting involved in personal matters, House Republicans should perhaps spend their time expanding the middle class, lowering costs, and protecting freedoms.” The White House often promotes its actions against trans-friendly policies, posting Wednesday about a move to restrict visas for trans female athletes competing in women's sports. Trans people make up less than 0.6% of the United States population ages 13 and older, according to the Williams Institute, a public policy research center focused on sexual orientation and gender identity at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law. North Carolina and Georgia host US Senate elections that are expected to rank among the most competitive contests of next year's midterms. In both races, Republicans are launching transgender-focused attacks against Democrats, centered on policies governing youth sports participation and bathroom access. The North Carolina GOP issued a statement slamming Cooper, saying that he “championed radical transgender ideology” and “vetoed bills to keep men out of women's sports.” In another statement, the Senate Leadership Fund criticized Cooper's “vetoes that allowed boys in girls' sports.” Ossoff campaign spokesperson Ellie Dougherty said that “National Republicans are scrambling to hide from Trump's budget law after facing intense backlash in Georgia for gutting Medicaid and defunding hospitals.” Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor in Virginia, has also been regularly targeting Democratic opponent Abigail Spanberger with attacks focused on transgender policies, as Republicans look for an opening in the challenging off-year race. Earle-Sears wrote on social media last week that Spanberger and Ghazala Hashmi, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, “think your daughter should compete and share a locker room with biological men.” Sam Newton, communications director for the Democratic Governors Association, argued that party leaders at the state level had successfully navigated similar attacks from Republicans in recent elections. “In battleground and red-state races for governor in 2022, 2023 and 2024, voters consistently rejected Republicans who made clear they only cared about stoking division with culture wars in favor of Democratic candidates who won by staying laser-focused on addressing the biggest issues impacting working families every single day. Gavin Newsom, a potential candidate for the Democratic nomination in 2028, told conservative influencer Charlie Kirk on his podcast in March that transgender athletes competing in women's sports was “deeply unfair.” And Pete Buttigieg, another potential 2028 contender, also voiced sympathy for conservative complaints about transgender sports policies in an interview on NPR this week. “I think most reasonable people would recognize that there are serious fairness issues if you just treat this as not mattering when a trans athlete wants to compete in women's sports,” Buttigieg said. The Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBTQ rights organization, is planning a series of town halls in red-state cities over the summer aimed at supporting LGBTQ individuals and policies. When the American people get to know who we are, and not who Donald Trump says we are, everything changes: hearts and minds first, policy and politics next,” HRC spokesperson Brandon Wolf said about the tour. Another effort is underway in the Christopher Street Project, a PAC formed earlier this month to endorse and raise funds for candidates that advocate for pro-transgender policies. The group released a list of 16 initial endorsees including Rep. Sarah McBride, the first transgender member of Congress, and prominent Democrats such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Pramila Jayapal, Katherine Clark, and Jamie Raskin. During an interview last month at the Center for American Progress, Minnesota Gov. One minor Democratic candidate for California governor, meanwhile, tried to turn the tables on Trump and Republicans with their own line.

Attorney Mehek Cooke joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss her take on judges stifling President Donald Trump's immigration agenda and what to expect with the Sean 'Diddy' Combs trial as jury selection is expected to kick off. On July 15, President Trump nominated my friend and former Gorsuch clerk colleague Eric Tung to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. If confirmed, Tung will succeed Judge Sandra Ikuta, who recently assumed senior status after a distinguished tenure. Judge Ikuta leaves behind a strong legacy, one Tung is more than equipped to uphold and extend. He earned a philosophy degree from Yale in 2006 and graduated with high honors from the University of Chicago Law School in 2010. Eric Tung, a partner at Jones Day who clerked for both Antonin Scalia and Neil Gorsuch, appears at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. Tung is President Trump's nominee to fill an open seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Following law school, Tung clerked for two of the most respected jurists in America: then-Judge Neil Gorsuch on the Tenth Circuit and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. These clerkships are offered only to the legal elite. Tung's brilliance, ethics, and temperament have earned him bipartisan respect. A letter supporting his nomination was signed by fellow Supreme Court clerks from across the ideological spectrum, from Justice Ginsburg's to Justice Thomas'. That level of cross-aisle support is rare and speaks volumes. One signer, Danielle Sassoon, a former federal prosecutor who has publicly disagreed with the Trump administration, went out of her way to endorse Tung. Her support underscores how widely admired he is for his intellect and integrity, regardless of politics. Ultimately, what really matters is Tung's record, and it's unimpeachable. He served in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Policy, where he helped vet judicial nominees, giving him a firsthand look at what makes a good judge. As an Assistant U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, he prosecuted serious criminal cases, gaining invaluable courtroom experience. Although President Trump made inroads during his first term in balancing out the nation's most liberal federal appeals court outside of Washington, D.C., of the 29 active judges, 16 were Democratic nominees. Tung replacing Ikuta won't change that balance, but it will ensure the vacated seat remains in the hands of a strong constitutionalist. Committee chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., speaks during a hearing of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, prodded Tung to condemn things he had not even said. Despite this impeccable record, Tung's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was marred by partisan theatrics. Several Democrat senators ignored his qualifications and fixated instead on social media posts I had written. Tung, noting the canons of judicial ethics, rightly declined to weigh in, clarifying that my opinions are not necessarily his. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., followed suit, hitting Tung over a post where I had labeled certain Democrats "evil Marxists." Booker then attempted to cast himself as a model of bipartisan civility, citing his friendship with Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., conveniently omitting that he once claimed supporters of Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court were "complicit in evil." Again, Tung refused to be drawn into political grandstanding, displaying the restraint and poise we should expect from a federal judge. This guilt-by-association line of attack is dishonest and irrelevant. Rather than engage with his legal merits, some senators tried to hijack yet another Judiciary Committee  hearing to score cheap political points. His nomination also highlights the double standard in how judicial diversity is treated. As the son of Chinese immigrants and a fluent Mandarin speaker, one would think Democrats would celebrate Tung at least for their sacred metrics of representation and diversity on the federal bench. But because he's a conservative, his background is downplayed, or even used against him. The selective celebration of diversity and identity politics in judicial nominations is glaring. Ultimately, what really matters is Tung's record, and it's unimpeachable. His combination of courtroom experience, academic rigor, and ethical clarity makes him an ideal appellate judge. The Senate should rise above political posturing and confirm Eric Tung without delay. Eric Tung is exactly the kind of judge Americans want: sharp, steady, and scrupulously fair. The Senate must act upon its return and confirm him in September. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump recently nominated one of his economic advisers to the Federal Reserve's top ranks, but his next choice will be far more consequential. Plans for picking the next Fed chair are already taking shape. Trump on Thursday nominated White House economist Stephen Miran to temporarily fill a vacant seat on the Fed's Board of Governors, though he still needs to be confirmed by the Senate. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has also been interviewing candidates for an even more powerful role: Fed chair. Just this past week, Trump's search for who will steer the world's most powerful central bank next year took various twists and turns. It shows Trump is leaving no stone unturned, especially considering he has repeatedly said he's regretful of his nomination of Powell. Trump said he is no longer considering Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent for the job. Meanwhile, Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, unexpectedly gained ground with the president's inner circle, according to people familiar with the matter. It's also possible that Miran, if he's confirmed, ends up impressing the president so much that he is elevated to lead the Fed. The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that Trump expanded his list of potential picks for Fed chair, now including former St. Louis Fed president James Bullard. “It'll be interesting to see how this all plays out because the two Kevins are certainly quite viable, but Waller might be the one that the market forces as a choice,” said Derek Tang, an economist at research and consulting firm LH Meyer/Monetary Policy Analytics. Waller was appointed to the Fed's board by Trump in 2020, and until recently, he had built a reputation for being a key messenger on the Fed's policy moves. After the Fed hiked interest rates aggressively to tame inflation in 2022 and 2023, investors listened closely to Waller's speeches for clues on when central bankers might finally begin lowering rates instead. Fed officials have a tradition of giving Wall Street a heads-up on what they plan to do with rates through their public engagements, known as “forward guidance.” In recent months, Waller has chosen to set himself apart from the rest of the Fed's rate-setting committee of 12 voting members. Last month, Waller was one of two Fed governors who dissented on the Fed's latest decision to hold borrowing costs steady for the fifth consecutive time, instead backing a rate cut. In a statement explaining his dissent, Waller said that “tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary increase” and that the Fed should step in with a rate cut to prevent the labor market from falling off a cliff. When Trump was threatening to sack Powell in the spring, Kevin Warsh quickly emerged as a potential replacement. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett eventually joined him on the list of potential Fed chairs. Warsh, a longtime Trump ally, has said the president's expansive tariffs won't stoke inflation — a stance that's at odds with the general consensus among economists. During a speech in Stanford, California, in May, Warsh said the Fed would be to blame if it can't combat the persistent impacts of tariff-induced inflation. “The president clearly trusts Kevin Warsh and thinks highly of him, and as I understand it, his in-laws are close with the Trump family, so there's a personal connection there,” said Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at investment firm Stifel. Warsh was previously under consideration for Fed chair during Trump's first term, but Powell was ultimately chosen on advice from then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. But before Waller's dissent drove up his stock with Trump, Hassett was seen as a front-runner for Fed chair. For example, Hassett — like Warsh — has vehemently defended Trump's tariffs. In early April, when Trump unveiled massive tariffs hikes, Hassett told ABC News: “I don't think that you're going to see a big effect on the consumer in the US,” because countries will be negotiating trade deals with the administration. “People assume Hassett is eventually going to be nominated because he's at the White House and he definitely scores very highly on loyalty, having been with Trump since his first administration,” Tang said. Both Warsh and Hassett have said the Fed should remain independent. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

A bronze statue of former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady is unveiled in Patriot Place Plaza before an NFL preseason football game between the Washington Commanders and the New England Patriots Friday, Aug. 8, 2025, in Foxborough, Mass. Former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady speaks after a bronze statue of himself was unveiled in Patriot Place Plaza before an NFL preseason football game between the Washington Commanders and the New England Patriots Friday, Aug. 8, 2025, in Foxborough, Mass. For a player who was too slow and immobile coming out of college to merit more than a No. 199 draft pick, that seems just about right. I never dreamed I'll be standing here two and a half decades later, made of bronze and frozen in time,” Brady said Friday night at a ceremony to unveil the statue before the Patriots' exhibition opener against the Washington Commanders. A three-time NFL Most Valuable Player, five-time Super Bowl MVP and seven-time NFL champion — he won one after defecting to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers — Brady retired in 2023 as the league's most-decorated player ever, holding records in dozens of categories that include most wins, yards passing, and passing touchdowns — for both the regular season and playoffs. The Patriots inducted him into their Hall of Fame last year, waiving the usual four-year waiting period, and retired his No. The work by sculptor lifelong Patriots fan Jeff Buccacio unveiled Friday on the plaza outside the team's Pro Shop and Hall of Fame features a hexagonal granite base and a 12-foot Brady, honoring Brady's uniform number and making good on Kraft's wish for it to be larger than life. It is 17 feet in all, representing the 17 AFC East titles the Patriots won in Brady's 19 seasons. In his remarks, Brady pretended to be interrupted by a call from former coach Bill Belichick giving his opinion of the statue. Several members of the Commanders entourage also came by, including general manager Adam Peters and ex-Patriot and current Washington defensive end Deatrich Wise. “It was always important for me to be out there,” Vrabel said after the 48-18 victory over the Commanders. Glad I could be part of it a little bit.” In addition to the self-deprecating comments and the shot at Belichick, Brady said he didn't think a statue was appropriate until he was “really old,” like Vrabel. But he saved his best for the rival New York Jets. “This statue isn't just for Pats fans. It'll also give all the Jets fans something to throw their beers at as they leave the stadium every year,” Brady said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), along with congressional and state leaders from California, held a press conference on Friday to provide further details on California's redistricting plan and offer support to the Texas Democrats who left the state last weekend. It came just hours after the Texas state Legislature once again did not have a quorum or the attendance needed to conduct business for its scheduled session on Friday. State Speaker Dustin Burrows gave absent Democrats a deadline to return by Friday, but none came. In response, Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit to vacate the seats of 13 Texas House seats held by Democrats on the grounds of “continued unlawful absences.” Burrows said he is also ending direct deposits of the checks for lawmakers, noting he doesn't have the power to withhold Democrats' money, but he can require in-person paycheck pickup. During the press conference in California, Texas state Democrats insisted they are “running from nothing.” Texas Democrats who fled the state are facing threats to return from GOP Gov. “We had 700 calls on this bill proposing a new map that hasn't even been out a week for the public to see. The rest were all in support of my breaking quorum,” state Rep. Gina Hinojosa said. “I'm doing exactly what my constituents want, and it is shameful for our governor or for our attorney general to try to remove a duly elected representative of the people from office.” State leaders from the California legislature echoed this plan, noting they predict the new maps will be released for public viewing as early as next week. California's countermove has spurred legislation from Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-CA), one of the five GOP incumbents whose districts would suffer from the new maps. But California leaders are brushing off the argument that “two wrongs don't make a right.” Pelosi echoed Newsom, arguing California's redistricting decision is “self-defense for our democracy.” Abbott has said he will call “special session after special session” until the congressional maps are passed, “regardless of how long the Democrats hold out in these leftist states.” Like many Democrats this week, Johnson said she wouldn't be deterred by threats of prosecution, job loss, and daily $500 fines. “We are now facing threats, the threat that we're going to lose our jobs, the threat of financial ruin, the threat that we will be hunted down as our colleagues sit on their hands and remain silent,” Johnson said, adding that those most concerned about keeping their jobs “are not worthy of public service.”</p>
