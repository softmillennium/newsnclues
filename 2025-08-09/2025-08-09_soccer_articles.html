                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City midfielder Rodri will be absent until mid-September after picking up a ‘big injury' at the Club World Cup, Pep Guardiola has confirmed. The Ballon d'Or winner, 29, missed most of last season after rupturing his ACL, returning to action with an eight-minute cameo in City's penultimate Premier League outing. Speaking from City's pre-season training camp, Guardiola said he would be out for several weeks. "Hopefully in these games he can play some minutes but what is important is he doesn't have pain because we don't want this Rodri coming back injured. He has been training the last two sessions with us and that's good." New defender 'a priority' for Maresca as Colwill set to miss months Rodri joins Phil Foden, Josko Gvardiol, and Claudio Echeverri in the physio's room at City. None of the four have travelled to Italy for Saturday's friendly clash with Palermo.

Manchester United, Liverpool, Real Madrid and AC Milan are now among the clubs who are not featured on the Club World Cup roll of honour. Unlike in other tournaments, Chelsea were not automatically given a spot in the 2029 Club World Cup as the reigning champions. Four clubs have already earned the right to play in the next competition, with PSG, Cruz Azul, Al Ahli and Pyramids winning their respective continental cups this year. That includes whether Chelsea, as reigning champions, will indeed be given an opportunity to defend their crown. FIFA leaders are said to have been 'frustrated' that the likes of Liverpool, Barcelona and Napoli - all domestic champions - were not present in the United States this summer amid suggestions that the winners of domestic leagues in England, Spain and Italy should have been permitted to enter. In such a scenario, it appears likely that the champions of France and Germany would also be invited in the scenario that they hadn't already qualified. Such a rule change would likely cause an increase in teams from 32 to 48, a decision which reportedly would be opposed by UEFA. The new Club World Cup received a mixed reaction from fans, with empty seats clearly visible for most matches not involving Real Madrid. Unsurprisingly, FIFA president Gianni Infantino wasn't having any of that and declared the Club World Cup to be 'the most successful club competition in the world'. He said: "The golden era of global club football has started. We have had over 2.5 million in the stadium. We generated over $2 billion in revenue with this competition. There is no other cup competition in the world that comes close to $33m per match."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a seven-minute cameo towards the end of the Premier League season, the Ballon d'Or winner played four times at the Club World Cup and was widely praised for offering some stability to Guardiola's side after a disappointing campaign. Unfortunately for Rodri, he left the tournament with another injury. Brought off the bench in the last 16 against Al Hilal, he had to be removed in extra time after picking up a groin problem which Guardiola has now suggested may have been serious. “Rodri is getting better but he had a big injury in the last game against Al Hilal,” Guardiola revealed. “He has trained better in the last few days, hopefully after the [September] international break is when he will be really fit. “Hopefully in these games he can play some minutes but what is important is he doesn't have pain because we don't want this Rodri coming back injured. He has been training the last two sessions with us and that's good.” Guardiola's side open the season away to Wolverhampton Wanderers before a tough visit from Tottenham Hotspur, and they will head into the international break after an away trip to Brighton & Hove Albion. City will be desperate to welcome Rodri back into the fold upon their return to domestic action. They host the derby against Manchester United on September 13, and a trip to Arsenal is on the calendar eight days later. Tom Gott is a writer, reporter and editor for Sports Illustrated FC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>— Kansas City is recruiting 6,000 volunteers to serve as ambassadors for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with roles ranging from greeting visitors at arrival points, providing directions and streetcar tips. David Winslow is a special education teacher. He usually has the summer off, but he is excited about a chance next year to volunteer during the FIFA World Cup. “Wouldn't you want to be part of something in this area, especially something that may not happen again?” Winslow said. He is among 10,000 people who have already shown interest in volunteering. Organizers hope to recruit an additional 5,000 volunteers before the registration deadline. Their target is to have 6,000 volunteers for next summer. "I'd prefer maybe guiding people to certain areas. “Volunteers will really be our ambassadors to the world,” she said. The volunteers will undergo training and background checks. Applicants must be at least 18 years old. There are other perks — volunteers will receive an 11-piece kit from Adidas, including shoes. They also will get meals, breaks, drinks, and additional rewards. For Winslow, volunteering represents a welcome change to his routine. "It will be a nice change before I go back to school in the fall," he said.</p>
