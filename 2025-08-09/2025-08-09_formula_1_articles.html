                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's been a busy first half of the 2025 Formula 1 season, with driver changes, on-track clashes, breakthrough results and off-track dramas all featuring. Liam Lawson achieved a childhood dream when he was promoted to Red Bull Racing for 2025, taking Sergio Perez's place alongside Max Verstappen after impressing across stand-in spells with their sister team – but the New Zealander would be out of the seat just weeks later. Some backed Red Bull's decision, while others sympathised with Lawson's situation, particularly given his compromised pre-season, the fact he had been racing at new venues, and the well-documented challenge of driving recent Red Bull cars. “I needed time, and I wasn't given it,” Lawson told F1.com in an exclusive interview last month, taking a moment to reflect on his whirlwind few months. While Lawson still has a seat, one driver who lost theirs altogether is Jack Doohan – the Australian starting the year at Alpine but being dropped after six races in favour of 2024 Williams super-sub Franco Colapinto. Doohan went from Alpine race driver back to a reserve after May's Miami Grand Prix weekend, which also marked the final event for team boss Ollie Oakes. Oakes, who had joined the Enstone-based operation in July 2024, resigned with immediate effect a couple of days post-race – Alpine Executive Advisor Flavio Briatore noting that “the reasons are not related to the team and are of a personal nature”. A couple of months later, another managerial reshuffle would send shockwaves through the paddock, with Red Bull confirming that long-time CEO and Team Principal Christian Horner had been replaced by Racing Bulls' Laurent Mekies midway through the season. Horner, who started out as a driver before transitioning to a team boss role in Formula 3000, led Red Bull Racing into their first F1 season back in 2005 – becoming the sport's youngest team boss in the process at just 31 years of age. “It's been a privilege being part of and leading this epic team and I am so proud of our collective accomplishments,” wrote Horner in a social media post, before Red Bull began their new era at the Belgian Grand Prix. Horner's dismissal came amid plenty of speculation over the future of reigning four-time World Champion Max Verstappen, who only confirmed he will be racing for Red Bull in 2026 – when new regulations come into play – last time out in Hungary. “Obviously [if] you have a Russell/Verstappen line-up, that's Prost/Senna I guess, no?” Wolff said, pointing to his “far-fetched” ideas. This, of course, played out following Russell and Verstappen's squabble towards the end of the 2024 season, and either side of their controversial clash at this year's Spanish Grand Prix, which yielded an apology from the latter. This year's British Grand Prix not only brought a first home win for Lando Norris, but also a surprise and very popular maiden F1 podium finish for Nico Hulkenberg – the German reaching the rostrum in his 239th start. Hulkenberg had already made a habit of charging up the order with his new team Kick Sauber, going from 17th to seventh during a rain-hit 2025 opener in Australia, from 15th to fifth in Spain and from 20th to ninth in Austria. “It's been a long time coming, hasn't it?” Hulkenberg smiled after taking the chequered flag, shouting over the radio with pride and beginning to process what had just happened. Put to Hamilton that his “useless” self-assessment cannot be the case, given an F1 CV that features a record-equalling seven world titles and more poles and wins than anyone else, he replied: “It clearly is. How Hamilton and Ferrari progress from here remains to be seen, with Hamilton adding “there's a lot going on in the background that is not great”, but it was a weekend that triggered headlines across the globe – and beyond the world of F1.</p>
