                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to the FTC's complaint, Assurance's telemarketers followed company scripts that overstated coverage, promised steep “repricing” discounts without substantiation, and enrolled customers in supplemental products without clear disclosure or consent. The startup flew under-the-radar in the Seattle region and never raised any outside capital as it quietly reached unicorn status as a $1 billion company. Prudential shut down Assurance last year after missed financial targets and government inquiries. It laid off 112 workers in Seattle, according to a state filing. Under a stipulated court order, Prudential — as Assurance's parent company — will guarantee payment and compliance with the settlement terms. The FTC's action, filed this week in federal court in Seattle, is part of a broader $145 million settlement that also includes Los Angeles-based MediaAlpha, accused of misleading consumers through deceptive lead generation practices and robocalls.

Lawrence Klein, who's based in Southern California, filed a complaint against Microsoft in the San Diego Superior Court over its plan to discontinue support for Windows 10 by October 14, 2025. According to the Courthouse News Service, Klein owns two Windows 10 laptops, both of which will become obsolete come October. He asserts that Microsoft is making this move “to force its customers to purchase new devices optimized to run Microsoft's suite of generative artificial intelligence (AI) software such as Copilot, which comes bundled with Windows 11 by default.” Upgrading to Windows 11 from Windows 10 is currently free, but millions of devices are barred from doing this because they lack one crucial requirement — TPM 2.0. Microsoft states that this is a non-negotiable requirement for all future Windows versions, so devices that do not have these installed aren't eligible for upgrade. You can extend support by one year if you're an individual through a one-time $30 purchase under the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, but it requires a Microsoft Account. Therefore, the ESU program will likely also be a no-go for them. Klein is requesting that Microsoft be compelled to support Windows 10 at no additional cost until its market share falls below 10% of all Windows users. After all, even though Microsoft launched the latest version of Windows almost four years ago, it wasn't until this year that it overtook Windows 10 — probably because of the impending demise of the latter. With only a couple of months left until Microsoft sunsets Windows 10, we likely would not see the outcome of this case before then. Moreover, the company will likely fight this to the Supreme Court, utilizing its nearly limitless funds and armies of lawyers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company plans to make a big announcement on August 11 about its electric vehicle future, an event it is hyping as a “Model T moment.” A new clue, uncovered by the site Ford Authority, suggests that Ford's futuristic revolution will be powered by a ghost from its past. Just days before its big announcement, Ford has filed a new trademark for the name “Ranchero,” specifically for use on “Electric vehicles,” namely “pick-up trucks.” The company has mastered the art of raiding its own archives, using beloved, gas-guzzling names from its history to sell a radically new electric future. They did it with the Mustang Mach-E, weathering a storm of outrage from purists to turn it into a best-selling electric SUV. And with the Maverick, they revived another classic name to win over a new generation of buyers. The Ranchero trademark filing signals that Ford is about to do it again. But this time, the stakes are even higher. The company is promising “breakthrough electric vehicles” made in America. That strategy could give Ford a weapon in the fight for EV affordability, a challenge even Tesla hasn't fully solved. The Ranchero nameplate hasn't been seen on U.S. roads since 1979, but its history is unlike anything else in Ford's lineup. It quickly found a following among farmers, tradespeople, and California surfers alike. It competed head-to-head with Chevrolet's El Camino, part of a wave of so-called “car-truck hybrids” that traced their lineage back to Australian “utes” of the 1930s, multipurpose vehicles that could haul hay bales in the morning and churchgoers in the afternoon. Born in secrecy on the third floor of Ford's Piquette Plant, the Model T was designed to be universal: affordable, repairable, and adaptable for everything from climbing Pike's Peak to serving as a snowmobile. Ford says it wants to recreate that breakthrough, this time with EVs. “Now Ford is going back to its roots for another Model T moment,” the company wrote. “Ford leaders will share more about our plans to design and assemble breakthrough electric vehicles in America.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A team of researchers from the University of Maryland, Georgia Tech, and the University of Notre Dame created a new 3D printing method for building PCBs that can use fully recyclable materials. According to the paper (via ResearchGate), this technique, called DissolvPCB, utilizes polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a printing filament to form a substrate with hollow channels, where eutectic gallium-indium (EGaIn) liquid metal is injected. This technique is particularly for experimentation and prototyping, as you don't have to order or print multiple PCBs for every iteration. These often require a complex, multi-stage process that involves manual dismantling, shredding, and crushing, as well as the use of hazardous chemicals and high temperatures for treatment. The team also developed a FreeCAD plugin that enables the conversion of KiCad PCB designs into a compatible format for FDM 3D printing. This means you don't have to manually convert your PCB design to make it compatible with the PVA and liquid metal used in this technique. It also supports through-hole and surface-mounted components, ensuring you can use DissolvPCB on a variety of circuit designs. It also works with high-frequency signals up to 10 MHz, allowing you to use it for synchronizing and testing devices reliably. You would likely not use this PCB building technique in durable electronics, such as phones or computers. However, they're great for engineering labs and makerspaces that frequently experiment with different circuits. Aside from reducing e-waste, it will also likely help engineers and researchers save money, as they no longer have to order new materials for every prototype they build.

According to u/AcordeonPhx, they fished out the system with a broom and then thoroughly disinfected it inside and out, including using compressed air to blow out all the dust and then bathing it in alcohol after spending an unknown amount of time in the trash. The PC itself is powered by an Intel Core i5-6600, launched in September 2015, with 8GB of RAM, and an AMD Radeon R9 380 from the same era. The system boots up to Windows 11 IoT Enterprise, which was installed in July of last year. The IoT Enterprise version of Windows 11 is designed for use on embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Given that it has a rather decent GPU for its time, this PC is unlikely to be used as just a simple POS terminal or record-keeping station. Nevertheless, its former owner has thrown it out, likely because they've upgraded their system and have no longer use for it. Although it won't run the latest AAA games today, it's still capable of handling some older titles and casual gaming. And if you don't want to deal with Windows' shenanigans, you can simply install Bazzite into it, maybe add an extra 8GB of RAM, and give it another 10 years as a Linux gaming machine in your living room. In the end, the Redditor said they gave it to their brother after upgrading it with an AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a new SSD, as well as replacing the CPU fan.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. There are real health benefits to owning an air quality monitor. Each US state is responsible for developing its own monitoring plan. Even in densely populated urban areas, outdoor air monitors owned by federal, state, and local jurisdictions might be geographically spread out, leaving monitoring gaps that don't accurately capture the air quality beyond one's front door. Outdoor air quality monitors are not just for understanding the air quality when the odor of smoke fills your home—an outdoor monitor can keep you informed. America has been in the air quality monitoring business for less than a century. In the not-so-distant past, citizens died due to unregulated and unchecked air. Once more, Trump's EPA is seeking to weaken current Air Quality Index standards, the numbers that decide what is good, moderate, or unhealthy air, along with repealing the regulations on emissions of greenhouse gases. Those actions will lead to dirtier air and less reliable data. Like face masks and air purifiers, an outdoor air quality monitor is no longer a niche appliance but an electronic canary in the modern coal mine of a bad-air world. Back in January, I woke up to find my PurpleAir Zen outdoor air quality monitor glowing bright red. This happened over several days, and I was confused because the numbers were well over 100 and yet there wasn't an air quality alert for the area. The annual AQI for my neighborhood is under 50—considered good air. The data from my outdoor monitor fed into PurpleAir's crowdsourced real-time map. In July, after a year of mounting protests and political pressure, the city announced that it would relocate the concrete recycling center. What would have happened if residents hadn't seen the dust clouds or noticed the gray film collecting on their cars? There, they can cause a host of illnesses, respiratory distress, and cardiovascular disease. Those EPA guidelines are almost double those of the World Health Organization guidelines, which are a stricter 5 PM 2.5. Trump's EPA is reconsidering the Biden administration's PM 2.5 standards. Under President Trump, we will ensure air quality standards for particulate matter are protective of human health and the environment while we unleash the Golden Age of American prosperity.” The Trump administration also wants to repeal greenhouse gas emissions regulations. According to a statement from the EPA, “The EPA is further proposing to make a finding that GHG emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” Scientific research states otherwise. This past spring, the smell of campfire filled my home. I watched the colors on my PurpleAir Zen outdoor monitor change from green to yellow to crimson over the course of an hour. When I logged onto the crowd-sourced PurpleAir real-time map, I could see that my outdoor air quality was an unhealthy 160 PM 2.5 and that a few blocks away, air quality was good at under 30 PM 2.5. There's nothing surprising about a fire pit generating air pollution, but I didn't realize how intense and localized that air pollution could be, even though I was four stories up in a half-a-city-block-sized area. There are several relatively low-cost outdoor air quality monitors on the market. Some, like PurpleAir's Zen, feed data into a crowdsourced real-time map. On the map's upper left corner is a pull-down menu of data layers to customize your Air Quality Index measures. There's a layer for EPA guidelines, and PurpleAir told me that if the EPA updates its air quality standards, it will update the layer to reflect that. There are also WHO guidelines for PM 2.5, along with several others. On the day I'm writing this, air quality in my Brooklyn neighborhood is the equivalent of smoking 0.6 cigarettes per day. Some air monitors have sensors that can measure TVOCs—total volatile organic compounds—and CO2, along with temperature and humidity. AirGradient even has a dotted line on its dashboard graph to show exactly where the ambient outdoor air is falling in terms of the WHO's PM 2.5 guidelines. And the thing about outdoor air, it gets inside. America's monitoring of air quality is fairly recent. The Donora Historical Society and Smog Museum, about 25 miles south of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has a sign hanging over its front door announcing “Clean Air Started Here.” In that state, in October 1948, 20 people died and nearly 6,000 were sickened in the Donora Smog Event. Historically, communities of color and lower socioeconomic backgrounds live in areas with worse air quality. The added cost of an outdoor air quality monitor may not be an option for those already living with the inequitable burden of air pollution. I emailed Shelly Miller, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Colorado, and told her about my experience with my PurpleAir Zen outdoor air quality monitor and the local cement recycling center. She wrote, “Air quality can be quite different spatially, especially depending on local sources—such as the cement recycling plant that you referred to in your email. In one of our prior studies, we had put a monitoring site near a cement plant, and it was consistently reading different than all of our other monitoring sites due to the local source.” And once you register your PurpleAir monitor to the map, you aren't only providing intel on your small corner of the world; the monitor becomes part of PurpleAir's real-time air quality map. Using its interactive map, I see both the state air quality monitors along with locations that require air pollution control permits and registrations as sources of air pollution, like auto body shops, dry cleaners, etc. When I look at the map, I can see the brown circles with tiny wind marks indicating sources of pollution. New York City is covered in those brown circles. There are fewer blue circles scattered across the state. You can also view EPA air quality monitoring sites on its interactive AirData Map. And if you zoom in on that map to your location, you will see that the monitors are spread out. Even in New York City, there are only 10 PM 2.5 EPA air regulation monitoring sites on the map. They can capture and monitor the micro areas around your home while providing real-time data for the greater good.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unexpected exposure to rodenticide is turning California's wild pigs blue, state authorities say. “I'm not talking about a little blue,” Dan Burton, owner of a wildlife control company in Salinas, California, told The Los Angeles Times. A subsequent investigation by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) found that the pigs had consumed the anticoagulant rodenticide diphacinone, a poison used by farmers to control populations of unwanted rats, mice, squirrels, and other small animals. These substances often contain dye to identify them as poison, the CDFW reported, which likely explains how the pigs ended up with blue-colored muscle and fat. Burton's own investigations found that the poisoned pigs seemed to be frequenting squirrel bait stations, which local farmers were using to control the squirrel populations targeting their crops. Overall, the agency advised hunters to exercise extra caution around areas with rat control programs, as it is also possible that exposed animals may not necessarily be blue. “Hunters should be aware that the meat of game animals, such as wild pig, deer, bear and geese, might be contaminated if that game animal has been exposed to rodenticides,” said Ryan Bourbor, pesticide investigations coordinator at CDFW, in the statement. This isn't the first time that officials have identified wild pigs poisoned by rat poison. In 2018, a study by the CDFW found traces of rodenticide in about 8.3% of wild pigs spotted lurking around agricultural or residential areas with rat control programs. In 2024, California prohibited the use of diphacinone, with exceptions for specific instances at certified sites, as part of legislation meant to protect wildlife from unintentional poisoning. CDFW is asking anyone who encounters wild animals with blue fat or tissues to report their sightings to the agency at [email protected] or (916) 358-2790.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some health enthusiasts swear by smartwatches as a way to monitor stress levels, but a recent study calls into question that common usage. The study, published in the Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science, claims that such watches display a very limited ability to actually communicate what a person's psychological state is. Sometimes, a watch may think the user is stressed when they're really just excited about something, researchers say. For the majority of individuals in our sample, we found that self-report and physiological measures of stress show very weak to no associations. These results raise several questions about differences between data sources and potential measurement issues. “Stress levels (0–100) are estimated by the Firstbeat Analytics engine, primarily using a combination of HR and HRV data. However, Garmin seems to admit that the quality and character of stress can be difficult to measure: “Public speaking and running up a flight of stairs can both send your heart racing, but the underlying reasons why are fundamentally different,” its website notes. “You can improve the quality of the insight gained by wearing your device as much as possible, especially while you sleep, because that is when your stress levels will typically be lowest,” the site states. “This is no surprise to us given that the watch measures heart rate and heart rate doesn't have that much to do with the emotion you're experiencing – it also goes up for sexual arousal or joyful experiences,” he told the outlet. “The findings raise important questions about what wearable data can or can't tell us about mental states,” he continued. A 2023 meta-analysis of studies about wearables and stress management found that “the effect of wearable-based approaches on alleviating or reducing stress” had “not been analyzed” and that most studies up until that point had “focused on presenting overviews of wearable devices.” Another study published by researchers at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in 2023 found, much like the recent psychology study, that smartwatches frequently failed to distinguish between excitement and stress. Gizmodo reached out to Garmin for comment on the recent study and will update this story if it responds. While the study claims Garmin's wearable didn't do much to measure stress, researchers found it seemed to provide decent metrics in other arenas. The report says that the watches were very good at measuring sleep, although it notes that “associations were weaker for tiredness.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

I hope it doesn't devolve into Intel becoming a less viable option for Linux. Intel wifi chipsets work great on Linux since they're well supported by Intel, but if that kind of support goes away, so does the future security in knowing Intel hardware will work well.

Today, open source drivers are written mainly for new entrants that are trying to undercut dominant players or incumbents in stable market niches that have largely ceased developing new products. If the current trends continue, it will take some time for any surviving components of Intel's business to settle into the latter position.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We want to talk with you quickly about something important. We've discovered that scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. Here's an example of the most common scheme we've been tracking: Impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company's products and requesting an introductory call. Sharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don't match our real employees' credentials. But these schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters' writing styles and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. As for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they're legitimate, please don't just take their word for it. If the individual's name isn't on our roster, you've got your answer right there. If you do see someone's name on our staff page, but our employee's job description doesn't square with the request you are receiving (i.e., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business! If it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask. You can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales executive, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios.
