                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although actors are often advised not to read the reviews, one critic's takedown of Freakier Friday caught Jamie Lee Curtis‘ attention. The Oscar winner, who reprises her role as Tess Coleman, recently called out Time critic Stephanie Zacharek for her “harsh” review of the Disney body-swap sequel to 2003's Freaky Friday. Quoting Zacharek's review, the outlet captioned an Instagram post on Friday, “No one, as far as we know, actually asked Disney for a sequel to 2003's buoyant, surprisingly unsyrupy generation-gap comedy Freaky Friday.” Me being one,” wrote Curtis in a comment. Despite Zacharek's review, Freakier Friday is Certified Fresh with a 73% review average and 94% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, on track for a $30M-$32M opening. Curtis and Lindsay Lohan reunite in Freakier Friday, which sees Tess' daughter Anna Coleman (Lohan) facing challenges with her own blended family, 20 years after mother and daughter switched places. Now, the pair finds themselves swapped with Anna's daughter Harper (Julia Butters) and future stepdaughter Lily (Sophia Hammons). Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the nascent days of the pandemic, many found themselves participating in activities that would otherwise have been deemed out-of-character (see: sourdough, jigsaw puzzles, ceramics.) Alden Ehrenreich, the actor who played a young Han Solo and has worked with everyone from the Coen Brothers to Park Chan-wook, found himself Googling Los Angeles commercial real estate. 'Weapons' Director Zach Cregger on Bidding Wars, Casting Re-Dos and His Personal Connection to the Film's Final Chapter Originally built as a service station for Los Angeles's one-time Yellow trolley cars up until the 1960s, Huron has been more recently used as a wedding and event space. Four years ago, Ehrenreich became its newest owner and launched Huron Station Playhouse. Inspired by creative collectives like American Zoetrope (Ehrenreich worked with co-founder Francis Ford Coppola on 2009 indie drama Tetro), filmmaker John Cassavetes' ensembles or Lee Strasberg's Group Theater, Ehrenreich wants to build Huron as a space for group creative experiences without the noise that can come with working in and adjacent to Hollywood. Since the beginning, he has drawn comparisons to actors of yore. Even Ehrenreich's approach to the entertainment industry — director-centric, a preference for film over television, and general wariness of perceived star power — also feels like a throwback. Ehrenreich is quietly, methodically carving out one of the more interesting careers for an actor his age. And he is unabashed about his ambition to infuse some artistry in an increasingly corporatized Hollywood. Last year, Huron Station Playhouse debuted its programming with a series of five play readings that featured actors like Dylan O'Brien and Stephanie Hsu. There are acting classes on Monday nights, and a playwrights circle every other Wednesday. Kids and teen arts classes can also be on offer. Huron is joining a growing number of increasingly popular eastside entertainment spaces. “I have watched people lose some of their appetite to experiment, and start thinking, ‘How can I write something that's going to get me into this writer's room?” he continues. “We all have to make certain concessions, but a lot of times what happens is someone will make those concessions, and they'll put something in a drawer for so long that when they go to the drawer, it's not there anymore.” His credits have run the gamut from young adult fare (Beautiful Creatures) to auteur dramas (Blue Jasmine) and, of course, Star Wars with 2018's Solo. Han Solo is the type of character that can easily eclipse a performer, like playing Jesus Christ or Santa Claus. “Over the course of a whole career, I just want it to feel like me,” he says. Over the last four or five years, I get to play people with some miles on them, cause that's how I feel,” he says with a laugh. His latest role is in Cregger's horror-thriller Weapons, in which he plays a would-be sober cop helping to investigate the strange disappearance of 17 local elementary school kids, all from the same classroom that just so happens to be taught by his ex-girlfriend and onetime drinking buddy, played by Julia Garner. '” In the Coens' old Hollywood comedy, Ehrenreich plays a Western film star Hobie Doyle whom the studio is trying to mold into their next leading man, to little success but much hilarity. “I've said this to his face, so I don't think he'd mind, but he's been in a couple of movies that I really don't like, but he is so great in those movies,” Cregger continues. After a particularly scarring viewing of The Sixth Sense at too impressionable an age, he forewent the Ring and Saw horror titles of his youth. More recently, he appreciates the creative boon in horror filmmaking coming out of indie outfits like Neon, A24 and Mubi, but isn't in the audience for them. Says the actor, “You don't know [the character's] backstory, but Paul's clearly in a place where he's lost control, and that's when we meet him.” To prep, Ehrenreich attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and spent some time with a cop. In a movie of truly wild moments, it's notable that Cregger counts his favorite scene as the simple back-and-forth where Garner and Ehrenreich are sitting and reconnecting in a bar. After Weapons' release, Ehrenreich, who directed the short film Shadow Brother Sunday in 2023, has cleared the rest of 2025 to finish writing what he hopes will be his feature directorial debut. He anticipates making his film independently to give him control over who is in front and behind the camera, and he is patient if not steadfast about directing aspirations. The playhouse, Weapons and his directing ambitions are all in line with a career that he is hopeful will carry him through an always fickle industry. So what matters is where you're putting your emphasis,” he says. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The thing about trolling is that it's a fundamentally self-powering cycle: You piss someone off, they react; you make fun of them for reacting, it pisses them off some more. As we noted earlier this week, series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone doubled down on their efforts to troll Donald Trump and his various accomplices with the second episode of the show's 27th season, focusing heavily on secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem. As is their style, Parker and Stone went scattershot with their attacks on Noem (and through her, the ICE agents that she's been aggressively lowering standards to recruit), mixing attacks on her appearance with references to her weirdly proud assertions of dog murder, layered in with jabs at her general attention-seeking behavior in service of making life harder for so many people living in America. Which is to say, online observers have noted that South Park‘s social media team has been happy to take whatever free publicity the White House is willing to serve them, in this case by apparently changing the show's avatars on all its major social media accounts this week (including Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) to Noem's botox-deprived Salvador-Dali-clock-shop of a face. As with the original jokes, we'd never accuse this of being particularly clever trolling. But it does have the benefit of a certain gleeful relentlessness.

October 4, a date that is still nearly two months into the future. Meanwhile, its been about three months since “SNL” has graced us with a new set of hilarious(-to-mid) sketches, and last season was one of the series' most eventful, since it was the 50th lap for the pop culture staple. During its half-centennial run, there was even a movie — about but unaffiliated to the series — about the making of its first episode. The whole 50th ballyhoo led up to an all-star three-plus hour anniversary show that premiered Sunday (naturally), February 16. The audience was like an Oscar or Emmy night roster: Cher, Robert De Niro, Alec Baldwin, Scarlett Johansson, Zach Galifianakis, Jack Nicholson, Ayo Edebiri, Steve Martin, and Emma Stone, among many more. Meryl Streep appeared in her very first “SNL” sketch, for heaven's sake. Former cast legends like Adam Sandler, Tina Fey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tracy Morgan, Kristin Wiig… there could be an entire article just citing the names that made up the 50th, and how that all went down. Oh wait, we had one of those, right here. One star, however, that did not enjoy the evening was former cast member Pete Davidson, who told Seth Meyers that the anniversary audience was “terrible.” “It's a terrible audience 'cause it's just famous people, and famous people only like themselves,” Davidson said, admitting his own culpability. One big name, however, did live up to the hype for Davidson, and it was the Oscar-winner he happened to be seated right beside. “In typical ‘SNL' fashion, they don't tell you anything. Davidson is currently starring in “The Home,” which hit theaters on July 25. “I don't want to say his public persona is so different from who he really is, but people know him as this really funny guy, and I know him more as a soulful person who experienced a lot of tragedy early in his life,” DeMonaco said. Davidson, in addition to having a film currently in theaters, was recently a voice in the animated “Dog Man,” a part of the “Riff Raff” ensemble, and just premiered “The Pickup” on Amazon Prime. Of “The Pickup,” he said, “The movie we did– It's a tough one because it's an indie, so there's no budget and there's not anything glamorous about it… No one makes money, no one's comfortable, it's strictly like for the art.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

The Writers Guild Of America announced late on Friday night that it was expelling two of its high-profile members, Park Chan-wook and Don McKellar, over their conduct during the 2023 strikes, Variety reports. The Oldboy writer/director and Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould writer were both found to have broken strike rules by writing on their 2024 Robert Downey Jr. project The Sympathizer during the union-mandated stopdown.

The expulsions from the writers' union are not, to be clear, a strictly academic matter: Studios that are signatories to the WGA's collective bargaining agreement—i.e., all the major Hollywood players, including Disney, Netflix, and The Sympathizer‘s home network HBO—are required to use WGA screenwriters, so both men are pretty much cut out of American film and TV production. Park and McKellar are apparently just two of seven writers who were ultimately disciplined over their conduct during the strikes; others, like Sullivan's Crossing creator Roma Roth (unsuccessfully) appealed, making their names public, but the WGA decided this weekend to publicize the rest of the list as well. (Bates Motel co-creator Anthony Cipriano was also revealed to have been suspended from the WGA until May 2026 for writing on 2024 thriller film The Last Breath.)

The Sympathizer entered and exited the public consciousness with surprising quickness last April, despite Downey's high-profile casting as multiple antagonistic figures cropping up in the life of a Vietnam refugee (Hoa Xuande) who is secretly a double agent for the Communist faction. The show was adapted (mostly by Park and McKellar, who are credited, sometimes with a third writer, on all seven of its episodes) from a Pulitzer-winning novel by Viet Thanh Nguyen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As production on The Batman Part II prepares to get underway next year, James Gunn is battling more online fan speculation. The DC Studios boss took to social media on Friday to dispel a rumor that the Dark Knight's orphaned sidekick Robin (aka Dick Grayson) will make his debut in Matt Reeves‘ upcoming sequel. I think six of us have read the script. No one knows anything about The Batman 2,” wrote Gunn on Threads. “Anything you've heard about that movie is made up or a guess,” wrote Gunn in a previous post. Premiering last month in theaters, Gunn's Superman launched a new DCU with the ‘Gods and Monsters' phase, separate from Reeves' ‘Batman Epic Crime Saga', which includes The Batman (2022) and last year's HBO Max series spin-off The Penguin. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. Unfortunately, all projects come with a few Village Idiots lurking around, mouthing off things they truly know nothing about. Why is Gunn giving his take on Matt Reeves vision? His movie didn't flop but it's clear it won't reach the box office success of The Batman. Reeves has the box office to support his moral authority over The Batman, and frankly he would have been a better lead for DC than Gunn. It's not Gunn's fault that by the time his vision was out superheroes were in decline but his international numbers won't ever reach man of steel, let alone the Batman, so let's keep Gunn's opinion on Reeves work away from headlines…and the entire The Batman 2 production. Reeves is topping Gunn in box office at DC, and that won't change during this decade, maybe ever. Gunn's vision is actually very truthful to the comic book source material and much more so than any of the depressing and hackneyed Snyder-verse crap. The cynical people want doom and gloom and Gunn is bringing back the light, that's why his movies irk them. I love how people call Superman “woke” for saving a squirrel. I guess they believe that you should laugh at the squirrel and watch it suffer. I'm pretty sure Jesus would save it too, because he is the most “Woke” person ever. I guess we all know what side of the spectrum you most likely fall into. Someone's worried about Warner's elimination of redundant roles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tongi, who revealed in May that he'd already shed 115 pounds, continued, “And that's why he's the trainer, he knows me better than me 🤣 and after about 10 miles and falling twice 😂 I can say today I struggled but I had so much fun hitting this milestone of riding a bike again after almost 8 years. Tongi, who was just 18 when he won season 21 of “American Idol,” first shared his health journey with fans in March, posting a video of one of his workouts and noting that he was “hitting the reset button” for spring with his trainer. The Hawaii native, who now lives in Memphis, told People in May, “We have a workout session maybe around 11, come back (home), and we go to an ice bath or sauna … or whatever it is. At one point, the season 21 winner looks at the camera and says, “Hit a milestone — first time riding a bike (in) seven years!” Fans and friends flooded the post with encouragement and support, including season 21 platinum ticket winner Cameron Osterloh, who wrote, “Let's gooo bro!! Tongi's girlfriend Leah wrote, “Yeah youuuu baby 😍” and he replied, “thank you babe ❤️❤️” Among the more than 1,600 comments Tongi received, one fan wrote, “Love seeing this for you, and also for everyone you inspire and motivate ✨🔥” Tongi has periodically posted videos of his workouts, including one from the July 4th weekend of him pulling a giant tire behind him for strength training and conditioning. In addition to achieving his health goals, Tongi has been riding a giant wave of success. In May, he contributed a track to the “Lilo & Stitch” soundtrack and a TikTok video about the making of his version of “Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride” went viral, racking up over 5 million views. In June, Tongi made his Grand Ole Opry debut, and he's been on the road a lot, performing for packed festivals and concert halls.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's an epidemic of high-profile bands dumping their drummers, or getting dumped by them, and nobody has any clue why. It's a host of rock and metal bands from different genres, at different levels of fame, shuffling their rhythm sections in a full-blown global percussion crisis. The Drummerpocalypse just keeps hitting new levels, reaching a farcical peak last week when the Foo Fighters and Nine Inch Nails traded drummers. The Who's battle with ex-stickman Zak Starkey keeps raging on, after they fired, re-hired, then re-fired him this spring. I've been fired more times than Keith Moon in ten days.” But this year, we're definitely seeing a vibe shift behind the kit. The Foo Fighters startled everyone in May by firing Josh Freese, one of the rock world's most dependable (and most-employed) rhythm kings. They just announced his new replacement: Ilan Rubin, from Nine Inch Nails. This is weird because Freese used to play in Nine Inch Nails—and Rubin is the guy who replaced him when he left in 2008. There's never been a scenario like this: two of the world's biggest rock bands switching drummers like it's a baseball trade. (Did Trent have to kick in some draft picks? The closest thing to a similar swap, according to Rolling Stone's resident lore-master Andy Greene, came in 2003, after Metallica's bassist Jason Newsted quit the band. But this is far crazier, given the drummers' linked history. I've seen him live with Weezer, Devo, Paramore, the Replacements, probably others. But there's also GNR (he replaced Matt Sorum), A Perfect Circle, Sublime With Rome, Lana Del Rey, Sting, Kelly Clarkson, Ween, Avril Lavigne, Katy Perry, Ricky Martin, even the Buffy musical episode. So everyone was stunned when he got the axe — especially Freese, who said, “In my forty years of drumming professionally, I've never been let go from a band.” This situation is basically one staircase crash away from Showgirls. As Ringo Starr's son, Zak grew up around Keith Moon and got drum lessons from him, then played with several million bands before spending nearly 30 years in the Who. He held the job longer than Moon ever did. They rehired him two weeks later (“News Flash! Who Back Zak!” Pete Townshend posted), but then Cousin Kevined him out of the band again two weeks later. It's blown up into the most notorious controversy over a dumped drummer since Zak's dad took over from Pete Best. If there was a tipping point for Drummergeddon, it might have been the weird moment back in 2024 when three of the world's top metal bands — Sepultura, Slipknot, and Suicidal Tendencies — rotated their tubthumpers. Jay Weinberg got kicked out of Slipknot, but signed on with S.T., whose Greyson Nekrutman quit to join Sepultura, after Eloy Casagrande left to play for Slipknot. Fans were puzzled, but as Sepultura guitarist Andreas Kisser mused, “Maybe it was better for everyone.” Suicidal Tendencies, of course, used to have Trujillo on bass, for The Art of Rebellion. Watch Gracie Abrams Cover Taylor Swift's ‘All Too Well' During L.A. Concert Kelly Clarkson Says Ex-Husband Is Ill, Postpones Las Vegas Shows To add extra levels of irony, Jay Weinberg's dad keeps time for a guy named Bruce Springsteen. “Max is a human marvel,” he told Rolling Stone this summer. “So the guy comes out and plays basically for three hours straight without stopping. He stops, maybe there's 30 seconds where he gets to take a sip of water twice, two or three times during the night.” They suffer so much physical and emotional torment, forever the butt of jokes. Or for that matter, ever since George Martin replaced Ringo with a session guy for “Love Me Do” and demoted Zak's dad to tambourine. When Primus drummer Tim “Herb” Alexander quit last November, he didn't mince words. “Being a drummer for almost four decades has taken its toll on my body,” he told Rolling Stone. Drummer culture is its own tribe within the music world, with a language that's designed to be incomprehensible to outsiders. How drummers snicker when the rest of us say “in the pocket” or “sick groove,” the way Marines snicker at civilians who say “semper fi.” To normal people, “Don't Stop Believin'” is a Journey song. But for drummers, it's the sound of acclaimed jazz-fusion virtuoso Steve Smith, winner of many magazine polls, playing an intricate open-handed pattern in which he plays the hi-hat with his left hand while his right moves around the kit. I have no clue — don't all drummers' hands “move around the kit”? Isn't that like what a drummer freaking does?) Percussion heads have a certain defensive hostility when it comes to the outside world; you have no idea what they're talking about, and they like it that way. If your stickmaster sucks, it simply does not matter how good anyone else in the band might be. You might not know the name of the drummer on “Maggie May,” “Midnight Train to Georgia,” “Just Like Heaven,” or “We Are Family,” but they're a key reason you still hear these songs on the radio. (Micky Waller, Andrew Smith, Boris Williams, and Tony Thompson.) Even at a pop show, when you go see Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, or Harry Styles, you're getting rocked by Matt Billingslea, Jordi Radnoti, or the mighty Sarah Jones. Everybody loves the story about Charlie Watts punching out Mick Jagger and telling him, “Never call me your drummer again. You're my fucking singer.” If you think Charlie was exaggerating, just listen to any of the solo records the Stones made without him. History is full of rhythmatists who get the axe when their band hits the big time — Steven Adler, Chad Channing, Stan Lynch, Vini Lopez, replaced by iron men like Grohl or Weinberg. Guns N' Roses just replaced Frank Ferrer in March, nearly two decades after he played on Chinese Democracy, as did Freese. Axl Rose, the essence of amicable, greeted the new kid Isaac Carpenter by bitching him out onstage in Yokohama, Japan, for playing “Mr. Iron Maiden legend Nicko McBrain quit touring in December, after recovering from a 2023 stroke. They replaced him with Simon Dawson, though McBrain remains an official member. “You may ask yourself, how do I feel about a new drummer taking my place after 42 years?” McBrain said on July 26, at a solo gig. They still haven't announced their new banger. But maybe they could snag Irons — he famously crashed their Hall of Fame induction ceremony without an invite and bumrushed the drums for their final song, which is serious Hall of Fame mojo. Umphrey's McGee jam wizard Kris Myers stepped down in May, a couple years after rotator-cuff surgery. Oasis replaced Chris Sharrock, their last pre-break-up drummer, even though he played in both Gallagher brothers' solo bands. But they hired Joey Waronker, another one of those sure-thing pros who's held down countless gigs, from Beck to R.E.M., from Neil Diamond to Paul McCartney. Bob Dylan switched Jim Keltner with Anton Fig in March. As for Primus, when Alexander quit, they brilliantly turned the audition process into a public spectacle, with their “Interstellar Drum Derby.” Even Les Claypool's pal Billy Strings made a hilarious audition video for the gig, before they finally found new guy Jack Hoffman. Through it all, the Who's Zakrophenia drama never ends. Starkey complained bitterly about “the weeks of mayhem of me going ‘in an out an in an out an in an out like a bleedin squeezebox.” Even Ringo, the easiest man to get along with since human beings were invented, got dragged in when Zak quoted him as saying, “I never liked the way that little man ran that band.” Daltrey denounced Starkey in the Times last week, saying, “It was kind of a character assassination, and it was incredibly upsetting.” He also introduced a new account of the infamous “Song Is Over” debacle that started the trouble, now blaming it all on the sound crew. That might be one reason Zak Starkey has blown up into such a cult hero for people who ordinarily don't care a thing about lineup changes in classic rock bands. The Zak saga seems to resonate with people way outside the Who's normal audience, people who can't tell Rabbit Bundrick from Pino Palladino, or “A Quick One” from “The Quiet One.” But people can relate to Zak, the hard-working creative betrayed by his corporate boomer bosses, who slip up and make him the scapegoat, tossing him aside like a discarded plectrum. Maybe that's why this tale has taken on a mythical life of its own in 2025. Meanwhile, Pete Best happened to announce his retirement back in April. He even texted the Gallagher brothers to let them know he suddenly was in the job market this summer, or as he put it, “Why the fuck aren't I in your band, man, helping make it the greatest rock band in the world again?” However, Noel and Liam have Waronker for their reunion tour, and they're wisely not letting him get away. A Complete Timeline of the Right Claiming Sydney Sweeney MGK Details Rehab Stay, Split From Megan Fox on New Album: ‘There Could Have Been Zero Drama' These are definitely weird times for drummers and those of us who worship them. But the Drummergeddon chaos hits home for people who don't even like any of these bands, simply because it hits to the emotional core of music, especially live music. That's why the spirit of the drum lives on in anyone who confronts a stick and a snare and asks, “What can this strange device be?” (R.I.P., Neal Peart.) “I've already got my gravestone,” Zak told Rolling Stone. “It says, ‘Zak Starkey, the song is over. But he'll probably just eventually join Oasis again, so he can snag a cooler epitaph like “Where were you while we were getting high?” That's the thing about drummers: you can't keep a good one down. It's too soon to tell where all this upheaval will lead. Now more than ever, it's time to give the drummer some. Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kelly Clarkson is very private about her personal life and kept her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock's battle with cancer out of the spotlight for the sake of their children. When the “American Idol” season 1 winner announced that she was postponing some of her Las Vegas concerts, she revealed it was due to Blackstock's illness. In an August 2025 report from Us Weekly, a source told the outlet, “Even though they went through an acrimonious divorce, Kelly made a conscious decision to protect Brandon's privacy until the very end for the sake of their family.” That's why she was MIA from her talk show,” the source shared. They added, “Out of respect, Kelly chose not to say anything publicly until it became clear this week that Brandon wasn't going to make it.” Clarkson continued, “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them.” The “Idol” alum added, “I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.” Blackstock died on August 7 at age 48 after a long battle with cancer. “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away,” a rep for the Blackstock family shared in a statement. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,” the statement noted.</p>

Both Rosalind Chao and Lucille Soong appear, too, reprising their roles from “Freaky Friday” as Chinese restaurant owners. There's a pair of “SNL” favorites, Vanessa Bayer and Chloe Fineman, in supporting parts. But the real cameo highlight is undoubtedly Elaine Hendrix as Blake Kale. In the movie, she's an editor at Rolling Stone (which, ironically, just named Shirley Halperin its first female co-editor-in-chief). Fans, however, know that she's also Meredith Blake, the supposed antagonist (there's some debate) in 1998's “The Parent Trap,” starring — ding, ding, ding — Lindsay Lohan as identical twins Annie and Hallie in her film debut.

All we knew was that we were on this very beautiful, lavish movie set, playing these incredible characters in this very beloved story.” “The Parent Trap,” which like the 2003 “Freaky Friday,” was a remake of an earlier Disney flick, was directed by Nancy Meyers and shot Lohan to stardom. In an interview with Condé Nast Traveler, Jamie Lee Curtis showered Lohan with praise over her much acclaimed performance. The late Natasha Richardson, who was survived by her husband Liam Neeson, portrayed Elizabeth James, Annie and Hallie's mother. Neeson — who has found love again with “The Naked Gun” co-star Pamela Anderson — will soon appear with Richardson's mother, Vanessa Redgrave, in the film “Cold Storage,” and both his and Natasha's son Daniel and Richardson's sister Joely have signaled their approval of his relationship with Anderson.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During World War II, the United States launched a powerful military recruiting and war bonds campaign titled “Don't Let That Shadow Touch Them.” Featuring haunting images of children overshadowed by a looming swastika, it warned Americans of the grave threat fascism posed to the nation's safety and future. MAGA is working to make fascism cool, joking about ICE's brutal deportation tactics as washed-up celebrities like Dean Cain glorify the idea of snatching children and families off the streets of America. It's happening as the people who put their lives on the line for this country — veterans, federal workers, and service members — are punished, silenced, and stripped of their dignity. This week alone has offered a chilling series of examples. These contracts didn't just protect paychecks; they safeguarded patient safety in VA hospitals, ensuring that nurses, doctors, and professional staff could speak up when staffing levels put veterans at risk. Now, the people caring for our nation's wounded warriors have fewer rights and less protection. And in case anyone missed the point, this comes after months of layoffs targeting thousands of veteran employees across the federal workforce. Then came the Air Force's move to purge transgender service members, even those within five years of earning a pension. Under Trump's reinstated ban, service members with 15–18 years of service will be forced out with no retirement benefits — in some cases having already-approved retirements rescinded. Imagine serving your country for nearly two decades, only to be shown the door with nothing. While the administration tears down real heroes, it is putting racist relics back on pedestals — literally. The monument, created in 1914 by a Confederate veteran, whitewashes the brutality of slavery and celebrates a rebellion that fought to keep human beings in chains. A bipartisan commission of military leaders recommended its removal in 2022, calling it “problematic from top to bottom.” Now, it will be restored for $10 million, part of a larger project to reinstall Confederate symbols and reverse military base names. Imagine Trump's America by the time his term is ending. Replace living heroes with lifeless symbols that tell a distorted version of history. Convince the public that this is about “pride” or “security,” while consolidating political control. Despite all its flaws back then, today feels bizarre and unrecognizable. The shadow of fascism is spreading, and you need look no further than Trump's attacks on the veteran community and their caretakers at VA. A Complete Timeline of the Right Claiming Sydney Sweeney MGK Details Rehab Stay, Split From Megan Fox on New Album: ‘There Could Have Been Zero Drama' Instead of honoring our heroes — at a time when the U.S. military faces historic recruiting challenges — Trump would rather send his goons to recruit other goons to snatch and separate families across the country. His administration has poured billions into expanding and recruiting for its secret police forces, while lowering hiring standards — dropping age limits, scrapping college degree requirements, and even eliminating the polygraph exams that have long been a staple of federal law enforcement vetting.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Irish rap group Kneecap – which has drawn a storm of criticism, support, attention and legal action over the past half-year – continued to speak out about the war in Gaza during an afternoon set at the Øyafestivalen in Oslo, Norway, on Friday (Aug. 8). “Over 80,000 people have been murdered by Israel in 21 months,” the band's message continued. “Free Palestine.” The message was greeted readily by a cheering audience. That number does not distinguish between civilians and Hamas militants. While conflict between Israel and Palestinian territory has been ongoing for decades, the conflict escalated on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas militants entered Israel and killed 1,200 people, more than 800 of whom were civilians, and took 251 hostages, at least 40 of whom have been killed; around 50 hostages, both dead and alive, remain unreleased. Gaza health authorities have reported that almost 200 people have died of hunger since the conflict began and the United Nations has estimated that some 1300 were killed while seeking food, though Israel has frequently disputed the UN's figures. Israel's security cabinet recently approved a plan to take complete control of Gaza City and forcibly relocate at least 600,000 Palestinians, a move decried by many world leaders. While Norway has broken with the United States and Israel by recognizing Palestine as a state, the Government Pension Fund of Norway – which invests surplus revenues from the country's petroleum industry and has more than $1.9 trillion in assets – is under scrutiny after a recent piece by Aftenposten, Norway's largest printed newspaper, reported that the sovereign wealth fund invested around $15.2 million in Bet Shemesh Engines Ltd., a jet engines parts manufacturer supplying the Israeli military, between 2023-2024. “I don't have to lecture you people,” said Kneecap's Mo Chara, wearing a keffiyeh. I don't need to lecture you people when your oil fund is being used to fund the genocide.” The majority of Kneecap's massive crowd greeted his speech with cheers and applause; many waved Palestinian flags as he spoke. Some say those who accuse Israel of genocide are motivated by antisemitism, though two Israel-based human rights organizations recently began adopting the word with regards to the war in Gaza. Mo Chara gave a “quick shout-out” to Øyafestivalen for “standing by Kneecap” despite calls for its removal from the lineup, but added that he thinks “it's a disgrace and a shame that KKR” – a global investment firm that owns Superstruct Entertainment, which runs Øyafestivalen, among many other international music festivals – “is behind all these festivals. Criticism of KKR wasn't limited to Kneecap's set. Outside the festival entrance on Friday, a small but vocal group of protestors gathered to urge people to boycott Øyafestivalen over KKR. At a different stage, more than an hour later Kneecap wrapped, Irish rockers D.C. Fontaines flashed an onscreen message of “Free Palestine,” which was also greeted enthusiastically by the crowd. Mo Chara is currently facing a terrorism charge from the British government over purportedly waving a Hezbollah flag at a concert in November 2024, where the group allegedly said “up Hezbollah, up Hamas.” Since then, the punk-leaning rap group released a statement declaring “we do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah” and described video footage as “deliberately taken out of context.” Mo Chara alluded to the charges during the show, saying, “we love the English people, it's the English government we don't like.” Not long after Kneecap first hit the Øyafestivalen stage, they urged the audience to give them more of a response: “For f—k sake, we're up in court on terrorism charges – give me a bit of energy.” In July, Kneecap were banned from performing in Hungary over what a Hungarian politician described as “antisemitism and glorifying terror,” calling them a “national security threat.” “There is no legal basis for his actions, no member of Kneecap has ever been convicted of any crime in any country. We stand against all hate crimes and Kneecap champions love and solidarity as well as calling out injustices where we see it…. It's clear this is political distraction and a further attempt to silence those who call out genocide against the Palestinian people.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>
