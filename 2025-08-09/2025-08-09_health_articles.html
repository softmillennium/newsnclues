                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, past studies show that aging doesn't necessarily happen at the same pace throughout our life. “Aging, as a systemic, degenerative process that spans multiple organs and biological strata, remains one of the most profound unresolved questions in the life sciences,” Guang-Hui Liu, PhD, regenerative medicine researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained to Medical News Today. “Throughout the extended human lifespan, two fundamental issues persist: Do all organ systems adhere to a unified aging rhythm? Despite their centrality to understanding the essence of aging, these questions have long lacked systematic, empirical resolution.” Next, researchers documented the types of proteins found in the organ and tissue samples, allowing them to create what Liu called “a proteomic aging atlas” that spans 50 years of human life. “Consequently, systematically charting a panoramic, lifespan-wide atlas of proteomic dynamics and dissecting the reprogramming rules of protein networks at organ- and system-level scales are pivotal for accurately identifying the core drivers of aging and for establishing precise intervention targets,” he added. “Ages 45–55 are identified as a landmark inflection point: most organ proteomes undergo a ‘molecular cascade storm,' with differentially expressed proteins surging explosively, marking this interval as the critical biological transition window for systemic, multi-organ aging.” — Guang-Hui Liu, PhD Additionally, Liu and his team found that expressions of 48 of the proteins linked to diseases, including cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease, tissue fibrosis, and liver-related tumors, increased with age. “Organ aging is the essence of human chronic disease; each geriatric illness is merely a specific manifestation of this underlying organ aging,” Liu added. MNT had the opportunity to speak with Cheng-Han Chen, MD, a board certified interventional cardiologist and medical director of the Structural Heart Program at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, CA, about this study. “This study found that protein changes in the body associated with aging seem to accelerate roughly around age 50, depending on the type of body tissue. This is an interesting finding that helps us better understand the types of biochemical changes that underlie aging and potentially provide targets for therapy at different stages of someone's life.” — Cheng-Han Chen, MD “Science is only beginning to understand the biological mechanisms involved in aging,” Chen said. “Studies like this help us to identify the basis of normal aging, and in turn provides insight into how deviations in normal biology lead to diseases such as cardiovascular disease and fatty liver disease. Ultimately, this will help us understand how to keep our patients healthy and aging well. It may also help us to develop new therapies for diseases that result from accelerated aging.” This study's finding of widespread amyloid accumulation across many tissues confirms that this isn't just a brain-specific problem but a systemic feature of aging.”— Manisha Parulekar, MD “A longitudinal study, following the same individuals over decades will be helpful,” Parulekar added when asked what she would like to see as next steps for this research. “This would track their personal proteomic changes over time, allowing us to study genetic and lifestyle differences between people and providing additional confirmation for the ‘age 50 inflection point'.” As part of our series addressing medical myths, we turn our attention to the many myths that surround the "inevitable" decline associated with aging.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rowan University and Sentrimed®, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing safer, orally dosed oncology therapies, today announced results from a National Cancer Institute (NCI) funded clinical trial evaluating MASL® in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The Company's lead product candidate, MASL, is a novel lectin-based therapeutic licensed from Rowan University. MASL is a first-in-class, orally administered therapeutic that targets podoplanin (PDPN), an oncogenic transmembrane glycoprotein receptor that is expressed on malignant cells in more than 75% of oral cancer patients. PDPN plays a key role in promoting tumor cell proliferation, migration, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. By targeting PDPN, MASL may disrupt key oncogenic signaling pathways that drive cancer progression and mortality. "Results from this study suggest that MASL can be developed to help treat patients with OSCC lesions," said Dr. Gary Goldberg, who has performed pioneering research on intercellular communication and its role in cancer progression, and is a Founder and Chief Scientific Officer at Sentrimed. This first-in-human study marks a significant milestone in the development of MASL and we look forward to expanding its investigation in larger clinical trials." Ex-vivo studies using patient-derived tumor cells from this Phase 1 trial found that MASL consistently inhibited oral cancer cell viability and motility in culture. Moreover, studies with these cells also indicate that antibodies can target PDPN to selectively destroy human oral cancer cells using near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health finds parents' workplace chemical exposure may be linked to a range of behavioral challenges and developmental delays in their children with autism. Autism traits can vary widely in how mild or strong they are. "This study is one of the first to connect parental job exposures to the severity of their child's autism based on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd edition" (ADOS-2)," Hertz-Picciotto said. Hertz-Picciotto directs the UC Davis Environmental Health Sciences Center and has led a large autism study, CHARGE (ChildHood Autism Risks from Genes and Environment), since 2002. In collaboration with the UC Davis CHARGE Study team, researchers from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) studied data from over 500 families in the CHARGE study. They focused entirely on children already diagnosed with autism. Industrial hygienists assessed both mothers' and fathers' job histories from three months before pregnancy to birth. They estimated each parent's exposure to 16 chemicals or agents. This included plastics, car fluids, disinfectants, medicines and other chemicals. The researchers found these associations among children with autism: "Our findings suggest that parental exposure to certain workplace chemicals during key fetal development periods may influence not just autism likelihood, but also severity and functioning outcomes for children with autism," said lead author Erin McCanlies, formerly with NIOSH's Health Effects Laboratory Division. The number of families may have been too small to find links for less common exposures. The exposure estimates relied on reported job histories and expert judgment, which might not reflect actual exposures. Lastly, while certain agents showed associations with certain autism traits, the study did not prove that those chemicals caused the traits. The authors say more research is needed to understand how these exposures impact brain development. They also call for including fathers in similar studies on reproductive health and child neurodevelopment, as many associations in this study were linked to paternal exposures. For instance, the strongest cognitive deficits for children with autism were linked to fathers' job exposures to plastics and polymers. "This research shows that workplace safety isn't just about protecting the worker - it's also about protecting their future children," said Hertz-Picciotto. "We must consider how workplace chemicals might affect the next generation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For more than 30 years, scientists have studied how the myogenic determination gene number 1 (MYOD) protein binds DNA to modify the gene expression of muscle stem cells. Like Spiderman hiding in plain sight as the unassuming photojournalist Peter Parker, this activator of genes specific to muscle has been harboring a secret identity. Scientists at Sanford Burnham Prebys and their international colleagues published findings August 6, 2025, in Genes and Development demonstrating that MYOD has its own Jekyll-and-Hyde twist, turning from a gene activator to a gene silencer. "If you think of a cell like a house, then gene expression can be seen as the furniture that plays a major part in defining its unique identity," said Pier Lorenzo Puri, MD, professor in the Center for Cardiovascular and Muscular Diseases at Sanford Burnham Prebys and the senior and co-corresponding author of the study. "We focus a lot on MYOD's traditional role of bringing in the new furniture appropriate for a muscle cell, but there is a critical first step of clearing out the old furniture to reset the cell's identity." The research team examined MYOD binding events in human fibroblast cells during the process of MYOD reprogramming them into skeletal muscle cells. More than one-half of the binding events, however, occurred at the regulatory elements of downregulated genes, where DNA is packaged in such a way as to be less accessible to being transcribed into proteins, and coincided with the presence of DNA binding sites other than the E-box motifs. Furthermore, the scientists observed that the MYOD binding events associated with gene repression were found at genes involved in cell growth, cell proliferation, cell-of-origin as well as alternative cell lineages. This observation fits into the proposed new role of MYOD as a driver of cell reprogramming by removing the cell's prior gene expression "furniture." Puri and the team see their findings as an opportunity to expand current ideas about how transcription factors operate. "We have provided seminal evidence that the same transcriptional activator can also play a repressor role at the very beginning of the process of cell transdifferentiation or reprogramming," said Puri. "Transcription factors are way more versatile than we thought, and this newfound versatility is dictated by where and how they bind to DNA." Puri says that the group's findings regarding cellular reprogramming may help advance efforts to develop regenerative medicine therapies and to better understand the process of cellular reprogramming itself. "In regenerative medicine, we hope to treat certain medical conditions by turning one cell type into another, one pathological cell into one physiologically normal or even therapeutic cell," said Puri. Puri also emphasized MYOD's role in filtering out competing biochemical signals during cellular reprogramming. "There are a variety of growth factors or regeneration cues that typically encounter these cells during the regeneration period," said Puri. "MYOD is able to be very selective in repressing most of the gene expression that would be activated by these cues in order to curate the proper program for building muscle." Next, the research team plans to explore what happens when MYOD's repression of the cell's prior identity is incomplete. This phenomenon may help explain why some athlete's muscles recover better as they get older or why some people suffer from the age-related muscle mass deterioration and frailty known as sarcopenia at a younger age. "It may be that small alterations in MYOD's silencing role are tolerated by the body but progressively impair muscle function," said Puri. "Better understanding this concept may have an enormous impact in terms of biomedical applications for regenerative and sports medicine for athletes and sarcopenia patients." Puri shared that children suffering from muscular dystrophy experience a transition period called the honeymoon. For a length of time that varies with each child, their bodies can still deal with the disease by regenerating their muscle. "If we can better understand this honeymoon period, then we may be able to use regenerative medicine approaches to extend it for as long as possible," said Puri.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Once viewed only as infectious invaders, bacteria are now understood to play an important role in overall health. For example, the gut microbiome-the community of microorganisms that inhabit the human gastrointestinal tract-has garnered much attention recently as studies have explored its relationship with health and disease. Now, a collaborative team including Modupe O. Coker of Penn Dental Medicine has investigated the stability of the oral microbiome in children living with HIV and those exposed to the virus but uninfected. Their findings, published in Microbiome, challenge the conventional belief that a stable microbiome is important for overall health and offer insights into how early immune challenges shape not only oral health but also systemic health. "Mouth microbes are central to health-they are the first to encounter food, promoting digestion and nutrient uptake," says Coker, assistant dean of clinical and translational research and co-senior author of the study. The researchers collected supragingival, or above the gum line, plaque samples across three time points from children in Nigeria. This included children living with HIV, children perinatally exposed to HIV but uninfected by the virus, and children not exposed to and therefore uninfected by the virus. All children living with HIV were receiving highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) at the time of the study. "This population is near and dear to us all," says Coker, adding that studying these groups of children offers the opportunity to better understand how challenges to the immune system early in life affect the oral microbiome and how that, in turn, affects other measures of development like growth and cognitive function. "[Taxonomic turnover] is measuring the entire microbial community at one time and then [measuring] the same community at a separate time and seeing how divergent they are from each other," explains Allison E. Mann, an assistant professor of biological anthropology at the University of Wyoming and the first author on the study. In the gut, continues Mann, taxonomic stability over time is good, "that's what you want in the gut." But, as this study showed, the opposite was true in the mouth-children unexposed and therefore uninfected by HIV exhibited higher turnover over time than those who had been exposed to HIV, suggesting, says Mann, that the oral microbiomes of children exposed to HIV might be less able to adapt to changes in environmental conditions or "disruptions." "The idea is that because the oral microbiome has evolved to be able to live in our mouths and is obviously just constantly being bombarded with food and the like-it's evolved a different strategy than the gut, which is relatively protected," says Mann. "The children in this study are in their adolescence, experiencing a lot of changes in their bodies [such as] developmental and hormonal changes, including being in a mixed dentition phase where they have primary teeth along with permanent teeth. We expect the microbiome to change, so when it doesn't, that signals impaired adaptability. The fact that [the supragingival plaque microbiome] is more stable in children living with HIV actually makes sense." "And in kids living with HIV, that's destroyed." This is important, he adds, because it gets researchers closer to understanding the mechanism underlying these changes and their outcomes. "This tells us that the virus might be differentially affecting different glands and ducts differently," he says, referring to how perinatal HIV exposure without infection as well as HIV infection and associated treatment have been linked to decreased salivary flow, and how saliva from children living with HIV presents as more acidic. As Coker explains, these results give a clue into the broader question of how an early-life disruption to systemic health-such as prenatal exposure to HIV-can impact the oral microbiome. "We know that oral microbes affect systemic health," she says. And as an epidemiologist and translational scientist, I hope we can keep looking at novel ways to use this information to understand disease and to possibly prevent or treat it." HIV infection and exposure is associated with increased cariogenic taxa, reduced taxonomic turnover, and homogenized spatial differentiation for the supragingival microbiome.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fighting off pathogens is a tour de force that must happen with speed and precision. A team of researchers at CeMM and MedUni Vienna led by Christoph Bock and Matthias Farlik has investigated how macrophages-immune cells that are the body's first responders-master this challenge. Their study, published in Cell Systems (DOI: 10.1016/j.cels.2025.101346), offers a time-resolved analysis of the molecular processes that unfold when these cells encounter various pathogens. They developed a new method that combines gene editing and machine learning, which identified key regulators of macrophage immune responses. Macrophages are also messengers: they release various signals to recruit other immune cells, trigger inflammation, and present digested fragments of pathogens on their surface, guiding the adaptive immune system to develop long-term immunity. If they react too late or not decisively enough, an infection may become fatal. But an overshooting immune response is equally damaging. Within a very short time, a tailored immune response must be initiated: cascades of biochemical reactions triggered, thousands of genes activated, and an arsenal of substances produced-each response tailored to the specific pathogen encountered. To understand how macrophages coordinate this multitude of tasks, the team led by Christoph Bock (CeMM Principal Investigator and Professor at MedUni Vienna) and Matthias Farlik (Principal Investigator at the MedUni Vienna) exposed macrophages from mice to various immune stimuli that mimic bacterial or viral infections. Next, the team identified regulatory proteins that orchestrate these programs, using CRISPR genome editing to produce hundreds of gene knockouts and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize the genetically perturbed cells. This innovative method uncovered a network of several dozen regulators that share the responsibility of triggering the most appropriate immune response. The identified regulators include many "usual suspects" such as the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, but also splicing factors and chromatin regulators whose role in immune regulation is not well understood. It is impressive how much complexity there is in this ancient part of our immune system, which we share with sponges, jellyfish and corals. Integrated time-series analysis and high-content CRISPR screening delineate the dynamics of macrophage immune regulation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this review, the authors present recent findings that uncover a previously unappreciated nuclear signaling hub: the PIPn-p53 signalosome. This complex not only modulates AKT activation within the nucleus but also integrates two major oncogenic pathways-p53 dysregulation and PI3K-AKT amplification-into a unified mechanism driving cancer cell migration and invasion. Key points of the review include: This review highlights the nuclear PIPn-p53 signalosome as a central regulator of cancer cell motility and a promising target for metastasis therapy.
