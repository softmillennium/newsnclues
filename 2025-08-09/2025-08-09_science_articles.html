                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Body coverings such as hair and feathers have played a central role in evolution. They enabled warm-bloodedness by insulating the body, and were used for courtship, display, deterrence of enemies and, in the case of feathers, flight. Their structure is characterised by longer and more complex skin outgrowths that differ significantly from the simple and flat scales of reptiles. An international team led by palaeontologists Dr Stephan Spiekman and Prof Dr Rainer Schoch from the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, Germany, describes a previously unknown tree-dwelling reptile from the early Middle Triassic in a recent study published in the prestigious journal Nature. The 247-million-year-old reptile 'Mirasaura grauvogeli', whose name means 'Grauvogel's Wonder Reptile', had a dorsal crest with previously unknown, structurally complex appendages growing from its skin with some similarities to feathers. The find shows that complex skin structures are not only found in birds and their closest relatives but may predate modern reptiles. This important discovery forces us to reconsider our understanding of reptile evolution. The crest of the rather small Mirasaura consists of individual, densely overlapping appendages that each possess a feather-like contour with a narrow central ridge. 'The fact that we have discovered such complex skin appendages in such an ancient group of reptiles sheds a new light on their evolution. Mirasaura is even older than the dinosaurs and not closely related to them. Mirasaura provides the first direct evidence that such structures actually did form early on in reptile evolution, in groups not closely related to birds and extinct dinosaurs,' says Dr Stephan Spiekman, lead author of the paper and scientist at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart. This image changed when research started to show that many dinosaurs were much more bird-like than previously thought. 'Mirasaura grauvogeli shows us how surprising evolution can be and what potential it holds. Mirasaura developed an alternative to feathers very early in Earth's history, long before the dinosaurs, which we did not expect and which will stimulate discussion and research,' says Prof. Dr. Rainer Schoch, reptile expert and head of the Palaeontology Department at the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart. The snout was probably used to extract insects from narrow tree holes. They had long, barrel-shaped bodies, a long, prehensile tail, and hands that allowed them to grab onto branches like monkeys. Some species even had a hook-shaped claw at the tip of their tail for hanging from branches. The dorsal crest with a novel skin structure in Mirasaura adds to the range of remarkable adaptations that make this group of reptiles so unique,' says palaeontologist Prof Dr Hans Sues from the National Museum of Natural History, Washington DC, USA who participated in the new research. A thin, brown film was partially preserved on the crest of Mirasaura. Analyses confirmed the presence of melanosomes, tiny organelles that contain melanin pigments. They are found in most animals, including humans. 'We know that in modern animals, melanosomes have specific morphologies linked to the tissue where they are found' says Dr Valentina Rossi, a co-author of the study from University College Cork, Ireland, and an expert on fossil melanosome research. In 2019, the collection was transferred to the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, where Mirasaura was discovered during further preparation. The fossils he found dated back to the Middle Triassic period, around 247 million years ago, and consisted mainly of plants, insects and other invertebrates. Dr. Grauvogel-Stamm is also involved in the study as a co-author. In 2019, the State Museum of Natural History Stuttgart, Germany, agreed with Dr Lea Grauvogel-Stamm to transfer the extensive collection to Stuttgart. There it will be available for research purposes and will also be on display to the public in future exhibitions. During the preparation of fossils from the Grauvogel Collection in Stuttgart, an unusual small reptile with a crest was discovered and further researched. In honour of its discoverer, Louis Grauvogel, the animal was named Mirasaura grauvogeli -- 'Grauvogel's Wonder Reptile'. An interdisciplinary team of palaeontologists wants to further investigate the site where Mirasaura grauvogeli was found to clarify why the skin outgrowths are so well preserved here. Future research will also focus on the ecology, biology and environment of Mirasaura, as well as its interactions with other animals. Note: Content may be edited for style and length.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki doesn't subscribe to the Bermuda Triangle's supernatural reputation. Neither does the United States' own National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). Both have been saying for years that there's really no Bermuda Triangle mystery. And since 2017, Kruszelnicki has been saying the same thing. NOAA says environmental considerations can explain away most of the Bermuda Triangle disappearances, highlighting the Gulf Stream's tendency towards violent changes in weather, the number of islands in the Caribbean Sea offering a complicated navigation adventure, and evidence that suggests the Bermuda Triangle may cause a magnetic compass to point to true north instead of magnetic north, causing for confusion in wayfinding. “The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard contend that there are no supernatural explanations for disasters at sea,” NOAA says. Even with some high-profile disappearances—such as Flight 19, a group of five U.S. Navy TBM Avenger torpedo bombers lost in 1945—pushing the theory into popular culture, Kruszelnicki points out that every instance contains a degree of poor weather or likely human error (or both, as in the case of Flight 19) as the true culprit. But culture clings to Bermuda Triangle conspiracy theories. It sure does sound more exciting than poor weather and mathematical probabilities, anyway, even if the “boring” story holds more water.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For a wide variety of earthquake scenarios in Alaska, an earthquake early warning (EEW) system could provide at least 10 seconds of warning time for hazardous shaking, according to a new report. "So we wanted a similar kind of science up here with numbers that are Alaska specific." For earthquakes along well-known faults in southcentral and southeast coastal Alaska, Fozkos and West estimated potential warning times of 10 to 120 seconds for magnitude 8.3 scenarios. And for a set of magnitude 7.8 earthquake scenarios along the dip of the subducting slab beneath Alaska, estimated warning times ranged from 0 to 73 seconds. "I was expecting decent warning times along the coast and for most of the subduction zone events," said Fozkos, because there is dense seismic station coverage in these areas. The researchers' models estimated how many seconds after an earthquake's origin the quake could be detected, how many seconds after origin time an alert could be available, and minimum and maximum warning times at a location. This definition differs from a more common definition used in EEW systems, which ties warning time to the arrival of the initial S-wave or shear wave of an earthquake. The initial S-wave may not always cause significant ground motion, and strong shaking can arrive tens of seconds after the initial S-wave in large earthquakes, they explain. The potential lag time in transmitting data and sharing an alert with the public "could be a big challenge for Alaska, but I don't think it's going to be insurmountable," he added. The harsh Alaskan winters and wilderness locations of some seismic stations could also be challenging for an early warning system, if stations go down and can't be repaired quickly. Ocean-bottom seismometers (OBS) and more earthquake detection via distributed acoustic sensing or DAS would also be welcome additions to a warning system, he added. "Coupled with the fact that some of our biggest earthquakes are going to be offshore, tsunamigenic threats, I think OBS and DAS are probably big targets for the future." “Magic” Cleaning Sponges Found to Release Trillions of Microplastic Fibers After 50 Years, a Neutrino Detector Finally Catches Elusive Ghost Particles Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.
