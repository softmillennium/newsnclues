                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Saturday that he will hold a press availability at the White House next week to address violent crime in Washington, D.C., days after the White House announced it was increasing federal law enforcement across the city. "On Monday a Press Conference will be held at the White House which will, essentially, stop violent crime in Washington, D.C," he wrote on social media. Trump, who has frequently criticized the Democratic-led city, claimed that D.C. will "soon be one of the safest cities," even as data shows that violent crime in the nation's capital has been decreasing. Trump this week ramped up his rhetoric about crime in the district, after a former member of the Department of Government Efficiency was assaulted in an attempted carjacking. We're going to do something about it," Trump said Wednesday. Trump also threatened to federalize Washington, D.C., if local officials don't "get [their] act together, and quickly." On Thursday, the White House said it was launching a seven-day effort to crack down on crime in the city. "Washington, D.C. is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long," White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, according to NBC Washington. "President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C." Local officials condemned Trump's order and warned that he is encroaching on "home rule," the decades-old act that allows D.C. residents to elect their own mayor and council members. "Even if crime in D.C. weren't at a historic low point, President Trump's comments would be misguided and offensive to the more than 700,000 people who live permanently in the nation's capital," Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D.C.'s nonvoting delegate, said in a statement. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pooja Tripathi might not have become a successful comedian if she hadn't quit her corporate marketing job in the middle of a meeting in 2018. By then, Tripathi had spent five years working in the fashion industry, but felt defeated after dealing with a toxic boss, she says. "Having a job everyone thinks sounds cool … [then] feeling like you can't reach any goals day-to-day is not easy," Tripathi, 32, says. The second act of Tripathi's career is more authentic, fulfilling and twice as lucrative, she says. Tripathi started her most popular project, Brooklyn Coffee Shop, in June 2023. In the short videos posted to TikTok and Instagram, she plays a dry, uninterested barista who interacts with and often rejects a cast of stereotypical Brooklyn customers — a Pilates instructor, a guy who loves crypto — who try to order drinks like an unsweetened collagen lattes with unpasteurized goat's milk. Some episodes of the series are viewed over 3 million times. The series is also starting to take on its own brand deals, she adds. She took on a roommate in her one-bedroom New York apartment to save money and worked part-time marketing jobs to cover the bills while she built a social media following in her spare time, she says. "My mom would call me and remind me I wouldn't have health-insurance [once I turned 26] … I think there's a fear in the core of all Americans that if we don't perform, if we don't make money, we can't go to the doctor." Juggling multiple jobs while trying to succeed in an uncertain career path was mentally exhausting — but coming up with Brooklyn Coffee Shop felt natural, Tripathi says. In 2023, she spent 30 minutes discussing alternative dairy products, like water buffalo milk, with a friend and barista in a café. She went home, set up her iPhone on a tripod and filmed herself acting out the conversation — playing both the barista and customer — in front of a makeshift greenscreen in her apartment, she says. That first installment of the series got over 1 million views, she says. Another friend adds in special effects, like kiosk screens that prompt fictional customers to tip over 200%. Comedians like Kyle Gordon, Grace Reiter and Gianmarco Soresi now guest star as customers, too. "Working with the guests [and crew] has been probably the single most rewarding thing about my entire career so far." Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plenty of kids would rather sit in front of their phone screen than play a sport, pick up an instrument or read a book. They might be modeling that behavior from their parents, bestselling author and podcast host Mel Robbins said during a panel discussion hosted by Verizon on Wednesday. She spoke from personal experience, she added: Robbins would lose herself in her iPhone for extended periods of time, and then look up to see her kids buried in their own devices. Kids typically have a different relationship with phones than adults do: They have a higher tendency to overuse social media and watch videos for hours on end, according to Michael Robb, head of research at Common Sense Media. This can cause problems with their sleep, physical and mental health, and shorten their attention spans — all making them less likely to develop into happy, successful adults, Yale University psychologist Laurie Santos told CNBC Make It in October 2023. At first, Robbins would demand that her kids to put their phones away or scold them for being plugged in all the time, she said. Then, she realized her kids were mirroring her behavior, she said — seeking connection through social media, and texting friends to make up for the lack of in-person interaction. DON'T MISS: How to build a standout personal brand—online, in person and at work Thirty-one percent of U.S. adults struggle with mindlessly reaching for their phones throughout the day, according to a 2024 Morning Consult survey. Changing your habit means making a conscious effort — first to put your phone down when you've just picked it up, and then to avoid picking it up at all, Robbins said. You can start trying to catch yourself "immediately," she noted. "You cannot yell at your kids or expect your kids to police themselves [and] have balance if you're not modeling it." Specifically, Robbins stopped keeping her phone on her person after work, while walking around the house and while sleeping, she said. The physical distance helped her curb the urge to check one last email or send a text that could probably wait until later. Maybe they were texting their friends, for example — theoretically a better use of technology than mindlessly scrolling through social media, which can damage your brain's "executive function," psychologist Gloria Mark said in April. "When we're overwhelmed with processing so much information, our cognitive resources drain. When they drain, our mind gets fatigued," said Mark. "There's a part of the mind that's called executive function, and that has the job of keeping us on track. It helps us with decision making, filtering out distractions and sticking to goals. When the mind gets fatigued, executive function just can't do its job." Understanding why your kids use their phones the way they do can help you build stronger connections with them, noted Robbins.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To be considered wealthy in the U.S., Americans say you need a net worth of $2.3 million in 2025 — but that number can be even higher depending on where you live. It's down from $2.5 million last year, according to Charles Schwab's latest Modern Wealth Survey, which polled 2,000 adults nationwide between April 24 and May 23. While the wealth benchmark has decreased, nearly two-thirds of respondents say it feels harder to reach. Inflation, high interest rates and broader economic uncertainty were the most commonly cited reasons. Here's how much Americans say you need to be considered wealthy, by region: You need the highest net worth to be considered rich in Western states, including California, Washington and Colorado. However, many Americans have a broader view of what it takes to be rich. That helps explain why many Americans say they already feel wealthy in non-financial ways. As with wealth, a comfortable net worth varies by region: Schwab's data suggests that financial comfort feels more within reach than wealth. Nearly half of respondents say they're already financially comfortable or on the path to get there. Another 25% say it's possible, but only with lifestyle changes, which could include reducing spending or increasing income. Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo The once-prospering mall, like many, has faced hard times with increased vacancies, exacerbated by the closing of two anchors, Sears and Bon Ton, in 2018. As a result, the mall was put into receivership, where it remains. "But Crossroads has a huge following, and they are so community driven that I think any mall in the world would be lucky to have a partner like that." "People were asking, is chaining yourself to a mall wise?" The church, part of an eight-church network based in Cincinnati, celebrated its first services on this year's Easter Sunday and has drawn thousands to the once moribund mall. Of course, Claire's bankruptcy filing this week is one more sign of how the hard times for long-time mall tenants are not going away. But filling old anchors with new, niche businesses or destinations, like in the case of the Dayton Mall with its new church tenant, is precisely the type of "cross-shopping" mall landlords are seeking. While a church is the unconventional salvation of the Dayton Mall, other malls are also finding out-of-the-box suitors to fill big empty spaces. Enclosed malls with anchor stores, a bustling food court, and a stable of trendy fashion retailers sandwiched between were the centerpiece of post-WWII suburbia for generations. But recent data and industry executives suggest that the enclosed mall could be positioned for a rebirth. These projects to backfill anchors don't happen overnight," Lebovitz said. "It has taken several years to recover from anchor closings in 2017-2018," Lebovitz said, referring to a wave of anchors that closed that year. The past decade has seen traditional anchors like Macy's, JCPenney, and Sears shutter. Lebovitz said the key to success is subdividing formerly sprawling anchor stores into niche players that all draw in their cross-shopping constituencies. There are former Sears' locations in the CBL portfolio that were generating $7 million to $8 million a year, with newly filled, subdivided ones bringing in a combined five to six times that amount, according to Lebovitz. Lebovitz said that mall developers are also trying to add more experiential categories, such as games, bowling, and laser tag. Other mall owners are taking it even a step further, converting old stores into things like apartments or large food courts. Brookfield Properties, another major mall landlord, is seeing similar success from the same playbook. Brookfield's mall portfolio is more upscale, insulating it from some of the retail turmoil, but they've still had to repurpose some anchors (or "reprogram the box" in industry parlance). "People are seeing the shopping center as a community space," Lee said. That has helped to increase the amount of crossover shopping, Lee said, with customers who may hit the lanes for some games of bowling and then go look for a new shirt. Recent data from Placer.ai shows that the positive mall vibes from owners are more than just corporate cheerleading, with a tangible increase in traditional enclosed mall traffic. R.J. Hottovy, head of analytical research at Placer.ai, agrees with mall owners that the changes made to anchors over the past few years are finally taking hold. "It takes time," Hottovy said, adding that open-air "lifestyle centers" were the first to adopt mixed-use strategies successfully. "Now we are starting to see enclosed malls do it." For the 2024 holiday season, mall visits were ahead of retailers, Hottovy said. People were going to malls for reasons other than shopping, including seasonal events, restaurants, and movie theaters. At the Coronado Center mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Barnes & Noble accounted for 7.9% of visits to the mall in 2024, outperforming both Macy's and JCPenney. Barnes & Noble has approximately 660 stores throughout the United States, with 107 of them located in traditional enclosed malls. "Malls are absolutely places we are interested in being a part of," said Jason Stryker, head of real estate and development for Barnes & Noble, which has been lauded for its turnaround. The company is considering adding 10 more enclosed mall locations this year and is actively exploring approximately a dozen now-vacant Forever 21 sites, which are often sprawling and sometimes two stories high, making it a good fit for a Barnes & Noble layout, Stryker said. Stryker says the bookseller aims for a store in the 18,000 to 22,000 square foot range so that an old anchor is often carved up among niche retailers. "We like to be around stores where people will cross-shop," Stryker said, adding that Barnes & Noble can be especially appealing to malls because "We really don't compete with any other retailer there." "Most Gen X and millennials spent their adolescent years making memories in malls – going to the food court with their friends, smelling all the lotions or perfumes at a store, or just generally hanging out chatting," said Dr. Vassilia Binensztok, a Florida-based licensed mental health counselor and the founder of Juno Counseling and Wellness, a group psychotherapy practice. "For many people, going to the mall can make them feel more like themselves as it evokes memories of those younger days," Binensztok said. Meanwhile, the coffee and free WiFi will continue to flow at Crossroads Church at the Dayton Mall while other malls look to unconventional anchor tenants. "We want life, business, money, and energy to surge back into the mall," said Castleman. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Restaurant chains are joining in on the protein frenzy, hoping to encourage diners to pay more for extra macronutrients during a time when many consumers aren't spending as much. From "gym bros" to users of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, many Americans are trying to add more protein to their diets, with the goal of building or maintaining their muscle mass and feeling more satiated after meals. "A lot of younger consumers are more proactive about their health habits, so they're looking for ways to support health now but also to support their health in the future," said Julia Mills, a food and drink analyst for market research firm Mintel. Roughly a third of consumers said they loved high protein in the second quarter of 2025, up from 24% three years ago, according to Datassential, which tracks restaurant menus and consumer preferences. The coffee giant said in late July that it will roll out a cold foam packed with 15 grams of protein later this year; the regular cold foam add-on typically costs customers an extra $1.25 per drink. Rival Dutch Bros launched a protein coffee in early 2024 and charges customers an extra $1 for the customization. Eateries are seeking to attract diners like Jared Hutkowski, a 42-year-old director of brokerage in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He works out six days a week and tries to hit his daily protein goal to improve his physique and overall health. "The biggest factor is what I am in the mood for that day, and then I normally try and select a meal that has a least a serving of some type of protein in it," Hutkowski said. This year, 28.4% of U.S. restaurant menus call out "protein," up from 5.9% a decade ago, according to Datassential. And the trend looks like it has staying power. Datassential predicts that by 2029, more than 40% of eateries will highlight protein on their menus. "Protein is one of those things that's never been vilified, because no one's ever said that eating too much protein can be bad for you," Mintel's Mills said. In the short term, consuming more protein than your body needs likely won't cause health issues, but in the long term, it could cause kidney problems, according to Diane Han, a registered dietitian based in San Francisco and the founder of Woking Balance Wellness. For restaurants, protein's step change happened several years ago. In 2021, protein only had a menu penetration of 11.5%; by 2022, more than a quarter of restaurant menus used the term, based on Datassential data. That year, Dine Brands' IHOP, for example, introduced pancakes with 18 grams of protein per flapjack. Fast-casual salad chain Sweetgreen introduced a line of "protein plates" in late 2023 as part of an effort to introduce more hearty options for dinner customers. Many restaurants are also leaning into U.S. consumers' desire for convenience. Accessibility may be why Datassential found that consumers tend to prefer protein-packed beverages. For Smoothie King, protein has been a menu staple since its founding more than 50 years ago. But in October,  the chain took one step further, launching a menu aimed at consumers who take GLP-1 drugs for weight loss or diabetes. "It's a convenient, on-the-go way to get in your protein that you're looking for in your diet," said Lori Primavera, Smoothie King's vice president of research and development and product marketing. For example, Panda Express introduced its own protein plates earlier this year. The line, created in partnership with a registered dietitian, includes pre-existing menu items but packages them as a balanced meal, highlighting protein and fiber content. Chipotle Mexican Grill employed a similar strategy back in 2019 when it introduced "lifestyle bowls," marketed to fit different dietary goals, like the paleo diet or offering double protein. Likewise, in July, Chick-fil-A put the spotlight on its own high-protein options in a company blog, highlighting its grilled nuggets and the Cool Wrap, which features a grilled chicken breast, cheese and lettuce in a tortilla. But for the eateries that want to add new menu items, nachos with a choice of protein, restaurant-made protein bars and egg dishes that highlight high protein content are all increasingly popular options, according to Datassential trendologist Claire Conaghan. Eggs are one reason why breakfast, brunch and lunch eatery First Watch has always been "protein forward," CEO Chris Tomasso told CNBC. The chain hasn't adjusted its menu specifically to address consumers' demand for more protein, but TikTok influencers have highlighted how to order a high-protein meal when visiting its restaurants. Of course, protein isn't the only way to win over health-conscious consumers. Hutkowski said his primary issue with eating at restaurants is that most of the food is cooked in oils, butter and heavy greases that rapidly add to his intake of fats for the day.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Business: Viasat is a global communications and defense technology company that operates at the intersection of secure communications, global connectivity, as well as aerospace and defense technology. Activist Commentary: Carronade Capital is a multi-strategy investment firm that focuses on process-driven investments in catalyst-rich situations. Carronade was founded in 2019 by Dan Gropper as primarily a credit investor. But, four people on the firm's seven-person investment team, including Gropper, have spent considerable time working at Elliott Management: They have experience with shareholder activism and are not afraid to use it. On July 31, Carronade sent a letter calling on Viasat to separate its Defense and Advanced Technologies ("DAT") business through a spin-off or initial public offering. Communications is Viasat's legacy satellite business, with offerings of fixed broadband, government, maritime and inflight communications (IFC). This is a newer but rapidly growing business, with high to mid-teens revenue growth. Despite the company's strong strategic positioning, prior to Carronade's engagement, Viasat's share price had significantly underperformed, down 21.12%, 51.56%, and 57.98% over the past 1-,3-, and 5-year periods, respectively. As Carronade describes in its letter, this is a "materially misunderstood" business. Carronade believes that the reason why this company is trading down is simple: Viasat has been treated by the market as a small-cap legacy satellite company that has been marked for death due to new high-profile entrants like Starlink. This narrative is two pronged: (i) that Starlink and similar entrants will make Viasat's Broadband business obsolete and (ii) that they are encroaching on Viasat's IFC market dominance. The Communications segment also has three other businesses: (i) Government, which is growing approximately 25% year over year; (ii) IFC, with 22% growth; and (iii) Maritime, which is growing at 11%. Viasat's IFC business is not going anywhere. The company's customers have long-term contracts (five to 10 years) and face high switching costs as they would need to replace their entire connectivity systems. Viasat presently has customers with 4,120 planes and a backlog of another 1,600 planes from just those existing customers. And this is a very nascent market with only approximately one third of airplanes globally having Wi-Fi, so there is a huge untapped market, which Viasat should get a large piece of despite competition from Starlink and other competitors. Additionally, Viasat is aware of the Broadband drag and is actively pivoting out of it to double down on the growth businesses with better margins. Exiting the broadband business over time while the other businesses continue to grow could be a plus for the company as it will no longer be viewed as a sleepy broadband communications business. But that isn't even the biggest misunderstanding of Viasat's business. DAT is a hidden gem, with best-in-class EBITDA margins of 28%, double-digit revenue growth, and significant exposure to hot button next-generation defense and dual-use technologies such as the Golden Dome, next-generation encryption, drones, device-to-device (D2D) and low Earth orbit. While Carronade highlights how each of these translates into promising growth avenues, perhaps the best illustration of DAT's mis-valuation lies in its D2D platform services, which is designed to enable global connectivity directly to unmodified smartphones and other Internet of Things devices. The peer comps to DAT – companies like AeroVironment, Kratos, Mercury Systems and Redwire all have lower margins and weaker growth profiles, yet trade at multiples ranging between the mid-20s to above 80-times EBITDA. Viasat currently trades at approximately six-times EBITDA. Carronade models 20-times to 51-times (comp median) valuations for this business giving it a value of $6.3 billion to $16.2 billion, versus a present enterprise value for the entire company of approximately $8 billion. Applying a conservative 4-times value to this business creates another $4.9 billion of value, and there is another $1 billion of value from the upfront and long-term annual payments pursuant to a recent legal settlement with Ligado Networks. Carronade is a multi-strategy firm that focuses on investing in non-traditional, undervalued debt instruments. Viasat is highly levered, and its investment base is filled with creditors, so we imagine Carronade likely entered its position (currently approximately 2.6% of shares outstanding) in a similar fashion. The firm's analysis almost seems too good to be true, but there is not a lot of focus on small-cap companies in today's market and this lack of focus is exacerbated when you have companies like Starlink greatly winning the PR battle against companies like Viasat. Fortunately for Viasat shareholders, Carronade's involvement should help bring the market's attention to this strong value case. Moreover, management has already signaled that they have been considering selling some of the DAT business, suggesting that they may already recognize Carronade's value proposition and are headed in the right direction.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Texas Department of Licensing & Regulation's (TDLR) website showed a new listing for a license granted to "Tesla Robotaxi LLC." However, the permit doesn't mean that Tesla's robotaxi is officially classified as an autonomous vehicle. The TDLR spokesperson told BI that the permit only allows a company to use automated motor vehicles for a commercial ride-hailing service. Tesla Robotaxi will have to seek authorization from the state Department of Motor Vehicles to be classified as an autonomous vehicle, Mange wrote. Spokespeople for Tesla and the Texas DMV did not respond to a request for comment sent outside of business hours. The requirement to seek authorization from the DMV is part of a new state bill, SB 2807, which will become effective on September 1. The bill establishes a statewide legal framework for autonomous vehicle commercial services. It also includes requirements for the driverless vehicle operator to be compliant with federal motor vehicle safety standards, and for the vehicles to be equipped with a data recording device, among other stipulations. The Texas Department of Licensing & Regulation only regulates rules around ride-hailing services, Mange said. Technology companies, including Alphabet's Waymo, have flocked to the Lone Star state because its laws regarding driverless vehicle operations are less stringent than those in states like California. In the San Francisco Bay Area, Tesla has deployed a ride-hailing service with a human safety monitor behind the wheel as it awaits regulatory approval for its robotaxis.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Treatonomics" — a consumer trend that covers spending on 'everyday luxuries' to larger, life-affirming experiences — is booming as people look for a mood boost in ongoing unsettling economic times. Spending on small-item 'pick-me-ups' is a well-established recession-resistant trend, with consumers often turning to purchases of modest personal items such as make-up, perfume and candles — or even collectible rubber ducks or Labubu dolls — for a morale boost when times are hard or uncertain. It's no wonder then, that the consumer trend has long been seen as a bellwether for how consumers feel about the wider economic backdrop, which is currently typified by inflationary pressures, persistently high interest rates and concerns over growth and jobs. "The lipstick effect means basically, buying yourself small treats when you're under financial pressure," John Stevenson, retail analyst at Peel Hunt, told CNBC Tuesday. You can't redecorate the house, but you can get a new tablecloth," he said, noting this was why the homewares retail category is "much more resilient than people imagine." The Covid-19 pandemic, and a re-evaluation of personal wellbeing and what makes for an enriching and memorable life, has spurred the trend of treatonomics with consumers willing to make everyday sacrifices in order to have "experiences," particularly one-off events such as spending $200 or more for a ticket to a Taylor Swift concert or the Oasis reunion tour. "Treatonomics is almost another step further [than the lipstick effect] where you are cutting back on on everyday living costs, you're cutting back on basics, maybe you're buying more own brands in the supermarket, but by the same token, you'll go and do an Oasis concert for the weekend and spend £500-£1000 (up to $1330)," Stevenson said. Economists agree that the treatonomics trend has been able to flourish in an era of economic uncertainty and shaky consumer confidence. "This rise of 'Treatonomics' — also called 'Little Treat Culture' by Gen Z on TikTok — is less about 'guilty pleasures' and instead about injecting moments of guilt-free joy into life," Meredith Smith, senior director at retail analysis firm Kantar told CNBC Tuesday. "It's like the 'Lipstick Effect' on steroids, because consumers have this heightened sense of uncertainty coupled with more options and access than ever before to turn life's everyday decisions into an opportunity for a treat. As a result, people are romanticising their water intake, how they dress and decorate their homes, buying themselves treats as a 'mental health' boost and more – all to inject joy into fraught times." Smith said life's traditional milestones, such as marriage, home ownership, workplace achievement and retirement, looked different now for "nearly every living generation" and were being reinvented or disappearing, "out of desire or because they're no longer attainable." "For those without a partner or children, instead of celebrating weddings and baby showers, they are throwing their energy into breakup parties, dog birthdays, high-effort wellbeing-driven treating routines and more. We've seen a rise in 'Resignation Parties' in China, 'Divorce Parties' in the U.S. and Europe, and people treating themselves to cakes or even diamonds after a breakup or when they don't get a promotion at work," he noted. On a similar note, Millennials and Gen Z have turned to 'Kidulting' – enjoying adult versions of joys from childhood -- which has "catapulted LEGO's adult offering, seeing some spend up to $1,000 on kits," Smith added. In the U.K., GfK's Consumer Confidence Index measures a range of consumer attitudes, including forward expectations of the general economic situation and households' financial positions, and views on making major household purchases. It fell to -19 in July 2025, down by one point from June. Overall, however, consumer confidence levels remain subdued "below last year's heady levels," Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of Global Indicators at The Conference Board, which produces the consumer confidence data, noted in a statement last week. That lingering pessimism feeds into the treatonomics trend, economists say, meaning that more affordable and perhaps more gratifying purchases and experiences, will remain attractive. Kantar's Global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, a measure of the degree of uncertainty surrounding economic policy at a global level, "has declared the current era as one of 'Great Uncertainty', relative to the last 40 years. The volatility and uncertainty we are experiencing are not likely to dissipate for the next five to eight years, Kantar predicts. "This gives us a strong indication that treatonomics will persist for at least another three to five years – though we can expect to see trends in 'Little Treat Culture' to move faster and become more fragmented by geography and cultural niches.
