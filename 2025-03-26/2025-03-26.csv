White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is answering questions about the Signal group chat leak at the daily briefing, which you can watch live at the top of this page

Leavitt slams Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg who was apparently inadvertently added to the chat as an ""anti-Trump hater"" 

She also repeats there was no classified information in the leaked Signal group chat messages 

Messages from the group chat newly published by the Atlantic appear to show Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing information about US air strikes on Yemen earlier this month

One message from Hegseth says, in part, ""Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch"" and ""14:15: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP""

Earlier, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told a House committee that adding a journalist to a high-level chat about air strike plans was ""a mistake""

As expected, Leavitt is being pressed by reporters about the White House's description of the Signal group chat conversation. 

One reporter notes that the text messaging thread detailed the exact time of the planned attacks before they occurred as well as some of the military assets that were to be used. 

He asks Leavitt, what would you call this discussion if not war plans? 

Leavitt responds that the texts contained ""sensitive policy discussions"", but she adds, that the conversation should reassure the American people of Trump's ""dynamic"" military and intelligence team. 

Leavitt again states that ""no war plans"" were discussed, and that ""no classified materials"" were sent in the group chat.

Leavitt has finished her opening remarks and is now taking questions from reporters, including one who asks how ""comfortable"" President Trump was with the conversations shared on the Signal messaging thread by some of his top officials.

Leavitt says Trump's response to the situation has remained the same. She says he himself has wanted to address the scandal. 

Leavitt says Trump told her he will ""tackle this story"". 

Leavitt also says that Signal is an ""approved app"" that the Department of Defense and CIA have loaded onto government phones because it is ""secure"". 

After a lengthy criticism of the journalist who was inadvertently invited to a group chat with top US officials on Signal, Leavitt then pivots to attacking former President Joe Biden.

She claims the reason why Trump approved attacks on Houthis in Yemen in the first place was ""because of Joe Biden's incompetence and pathetic weakness on the world stage"".  

Leavitt says the Houthis grew emboldened ""immediately"" after Biden took office in 2021. 

""President Trump's strength and resolve eliminated those terrorists,"" Leavitt says.

In keeping with what has become standard practice, today's briefing begins with Karoline Leavitt touting what the administration sees as its most notable achievements of the last several days. 

She then quickly pivots to attacking the media for coverage of ""Signalgate"". 

""There were certainly no war plans discussed,"" Leavitt says, echoing a talking point she shared on social media earlier. 

She directly attacks The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg as an ""anti-Trump hater"" and registered Democrat. She also criticises his career as a reporter, including during the Iraq War and the 2016 electoral campaign. 

""The real story here is the overwhelming success of decisive military action against Houthi terrorists,"" Leavitt continues.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has a briefing planned to begin shortly.

Reporters are filing into the room. 

Those without assigned seats are crowding the aisles, jostling for spaces they believe will give them a higher chance of being called on. 

Briefings are relatively infrequent in Trump's administration so far, with only one or two happening each week. 

They are often crowded - but today promises to be particularly well-attended by the US and global media that covers Washington as the Signal group chat story continues to develop. 

Without even the slightest exaggeration, I've not heard anything else being discussed among reporters since I arrived here several hours ago. 

You can watch the briefing by clicking ""watch live"" at the top of this window.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

I've been exchanging messages with Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East and a retired CIA paramilitary officer, who since yesterday has been expressing concern with how the information in the Signal chat was being handled.

Of particular concern, Mulroy tells me, are the messages which depict a ""real time order of battle sequence of an ongoing operation"". 

""It is highly classified and protected,"" he says. ""Disclosure would compromise the operation and put lives at risk. Next to nuclear and covert operations, this information is the most protected."" 

Mulroy also pushed back on the assertion, from White House officials, that the contents of the group chat do not constitute ""war plans"". 

The primary difference between ""war"" and ""attack"" plans - which are both sensitive and classified - is one of scale. 

""War plans are generally the plan to conduct an entire conflict,"" he adds. ""Attack plans stem from that and go down to the individual unit level and are very detailed."" 

""One could actually make the argument that attack plans are more sensitive, because they are more detailed and specific on time, place and manner.""

In one part of the newly published Signal chat, CIA Director John Ratcliffe notes that the US is ""mobilising assets"" to help a strike, but that a delay would ""not negatively impact"" the agency's work in Yemen.

Ratcliffe has said there was no classified information discussed in the chat. 

The House Intelligence Committee has just wrapped up the public part of its session - it's now moving to closed questioning of the intelligence chiefs to talk about more secretive information that won't be broadcast. Here's what we learned:

Whether or not the information US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared is classified is at the core of Signal-gate. 

Here are some of the details of the mission he wrote to officials - and a reporter who was inadvertently added to the Signal group chat, according to Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg: 

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has hit back after the Atlantic, external published new details from the Signal group chat on a Yemen attack that its editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to, doubling down that there was ""no classified information"" in the message thread.

""The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods,"" he said in a post on X.

""This only proves one thing: Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an 'attack plan' (as he now calls it). Not even close.

""We will continue to do our job, while the media does what it does best: peddle hoaxes,"" he adds.

Hegseth's posts in the chat as released by the Atlantic include details about how the attacks would be carried out, their timing and military hardware that would be used. 

There's a heated exchange between Democrat Jimmy Gomez and CIA Director John Ratcliffe over the disclosures by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Signal thread, which included military plans. 

Gomez asks both Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard: ""Do you know whether Pete Hegesth had been drinking before he leaked classified information?""

Media reports about Hegseth's alcohol use dogged his confirmation hearings before he was eventually approved to his post. 

Gabbard says she has no knowledge of Hegseth's ""personal habits"", while Ratcliffe takes issue with the question, calling it an ""offensive line of questioning"".

Both Gomez and Ratcliffe talk over one another, with Gomez defending himself and Ratcliffe saying the lawmaker doesn't want to ""focus on the good work that the CIA is doing"".

Gomez say he has a ""huge respect"" for the CIA, but Americans need to know whether the defence secretary's ""performance is compromised"".

Back on Capitol Hill as the House hearing continues with intelligence officials, Democrat Chrissy Houlahan says she finds it ""offensive for [CIA Director John Ratcliffe] to accuse me as a Democrat of not caring about national threats"".

Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, says she ""had wanted to talk about those"" global threats - which was the topic that brought these officials to the hearing - but now ""I don't have time to ask those questions because the threat is in the House"".

""When I served in the military.... if this happened to me I would have walked my resignation"" in straight away, Houlahan says of the leaked military plans. 

She presses Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, on whether she would investigate the leaked military plans. 

""This was a chat among a great variety of people,"" Houlahan argued, saying Gabbard had an ""obligation"" to probe any significant leak. ""Do you not think it's important to do such a thing?"" 

Gabbard pointed to the Defense Department having authority over the classification of the information discussed in the Signal chat and said the National Security Council, not her agency, was examining the leak. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

As the morning in Washington grinds on, the White House's strategy for dealing with the fall-out of what has now been dubbed ""Signal-gate"" is becoming more clear. 

In the hours since the Atlantic published the contents of the messages, various White House officials - including Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Communications Director Steven Cheung and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - have contested that the shared messages constituted a ""war plan"". 

""The Atlantic has conceded: these were not ""war plans"","" Leavitt wrote earlier. ""This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin."" 

The semantics argument is unlikely to hold much weight with national security professionals, who have noted that the messages included specific attack plans and timetables that could have allowed the Houthis to prepare, if the messages had fallen into the wrong hands. 

There is about an hour until today's news briefing is due to begin at the White House, and, for now, it appears as if this argument is likely to form a key part of Leavitt's answers to questions from the news media. 

A lot has happened with this story today, so let's take a look at how we got here. 

We started our coverage this morning US time after the Atlantic, external journalist who was added to a Signal group chat with top US security officials released new details from that message thread on Wednesday.

Some of the new details include specific timings of the airstrikes and, hours before the attack, confirmation from Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth saying: ""We are a GO for mission launch"".

Some of those who were on the Signal message thread are continuing to testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. 

The CIA Director testified the reports from the Atlantic were ""misleading"" and he never transmitted classified information"". Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers there would be an ""in-depth review"" by the National Security Council about the mishap and also denied there was any classified information discussed. 

Democratic lawmakers like Senator Mike Warner have called for the resignation of Hegseth and others involved in the chat. Warner also said that the new information was ""obviously classified"", posing legal risks.

The White House on Wednesday dismissed the Atlantic story as ""another hoax"" and said the details of the chat were not war plans, though Trump did say in an interview today that someone on his team may have ""screwed up"". 

Vice-President JD Vance says that Atlantic journalist ""oversold what he had"".

Soon, we're expecting to hear more from the White House in a news briefing where Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is set to take questions from reporters. 

Ruth ComerfordLive reporter

One of the big questions
in this latest leak of messages from the Atlantic is whether they are classified and whether they ever were.

The White House and members of the group chat, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who laid out the military plans over Signal, have denied the messages are classified. 

But former senior military intelligence expert Philip Ingram said these messages are likely very classified. He says the most recent leak posted by the Atlantic ""falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret"".

There is a huge amount of detail about what is being launched and when, he says. ""You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from.""

""There are likely to be other messages before and after this, and anyone with a bit of military knowledge - well this is plain speak to them.""

Here's what some of the military jargon means.

A ""package"" refers to a set of aircraft that will be carrying different weapon systems and intelligence gathering devices.

A ""trigger"" means the set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before an airstrike or missile is deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up.

We've been talking a lot about Signal, the app that was used to discuss war plans.

It's a free, open-source encrypted messaging app that was launched in 2014.

Conversations within the app are end-to-end encrypted - meaning they can only be read or heard by the recipients.

It is often used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and the ability to send disappearing messages.

Here's more about the app, how it was used here and a look at how secure it truly is. 

Democrat Jason Crow

At the hearing, Democrat Jason Crow is focusing on the security of the Signal app itself.

He asks National Security Agency (NSA) Director Timothy Haugh if the agency has recently warned its employees not to use the app, which has been reported in the media. 

Haugh says they have put out advisories related to how the use Signal and other encrypted applications.

Crow asks if that was because there are risks to using the app. ""There are,"" Haugh replies.

Crow also asks Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jeffrey Kruse whether the Department of Defense has also recently issued a warning about the vulnerability of the app.

""That's correct,"" Kruse says.

A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement the additional messages released by the Atlantic on Wednesday contained ""no classified materials or war plans"". 

""The Secretary was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway and had already been briefed through official channels,"" spokesmen Sean Parnell said of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 

""The American people see through the Atlantic's pathetic attempts to distract from President Trump's national security agenda.""

New details from the Signal chat show specific times for airstrikes in Yemen and the types of weapons used. 

Rep Krishnamoorthi had a large poster with the Signal messages displayed at today's hearing

Senior Democrats have been highly critical of the way messages about attacks on the Houthis were shared on Signal and that a journalist was added to the group. 

Some have now gone further, calling for Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation on the grounds that he texted sensitive and classified information on the chat.

At the ongoing House Intelligence Committee hearing, where several members of the Signal group are testifying before lawmakers, Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi says Hegseth ""needs to resign immediately"".

He displayed large print-out screenshots of the messages during the hearing, which he says should have been classified.

Others have piled on with similar thoughts. Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego, who is a former US Marine, said on X that ""the incompetence and cover-up is embarrassing"".

""This could have gotten our men and women killed!"" he wrote. ""Strike times, when planes are taking off, what weapons are being used all shared in unsafe manner.@SecDef, external needs to resign."" 

""I cannot believe Hegseth would recklessly text info that could put a target on our pilots and service members,"" wrote New Jersey Senator Andy Kim on X. ""He needs to resign.""

Arizona's Mark Kelly, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, agreed: “This is what happens when you put unqualified people in important jobs where lives are on the line.”

And Michael Bennet, Colorado senator and another committee member, said National Security Adviser Mike Waltz should also go, adding that their continued denial of wrongdoing was making things worse.

President Donald Trump is so far today continuing his claims that nothing in the encrypted chat that was leaked could have ""compromised"" the attack plans in Yemen, though he did say that a member of his team may have ""screwed up"". 

Speaking over the phone on the conservative Vince Show, Trump said: “There weren't details, and there was nothing in there that compromised and it had no impact on the attack, which was very successful.""

But, he added: “Somebody in my group either screwed up, or it's a bad signal,” he said.

Trump has so far stood by his officials and has claimed the incident has been blown out of proportion.

Watch: What to know about the Spring Statement...in 58 seconds

Edited by Andrew Humphrey and Owen Amos

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has finished a news conference explaining her Spring Statement on the government's plans for the UK economy.

In case you missed it, read a breakdown of the main takeaways from her appearance in Parliament earlier.

Afterwards, she took questions from reporters at Downing Street. Here are the main points:

Fiscal rules are non-negotiable, Chancellor Rachel Reeves says, as she addresses reporters at the news conference in Downing Street.

""People should have no doubt about my commitment and how seriously I take the fiscal rules, as I said today they are non-negotiable,"" the chancellor says.

As a reminder, some people - including some MPs in her own party - say Reeves should loosen her self-imposed rules, in order to give herself room to avoid spending cuts.

Before ending the news conference, Reeves is asked about taxes. The chancellor says she had to ask businesses to pay more in tax back in October, during the Budget, which was necessary to repair public services.

The chancellor goes on to say the previous government did not respect taxpayers' money. She says for ""too long"" people's money that's paid into taxes has not been respected.

The Financial Times now asks Reeves about the possibility of US tariffs and how ""damaging"" a ""full scale global trade war"" would be for the UK. 

The chancellor says the OBR today set out some different scenarios - adding that everyone was ""very pleased"" when the prime minister went to Washington recently for initial meetings. 

Referring to Trump's previous term, Reeves says trade and investment flows between the UK and the US ""increased"". 

""We'll continue to make the case for free and open trade.""

Rachel Reeves is then asked by Bloomberg about IFS comments that the government's headroom is limited, meaning taxes may need to be increased in future - as our business reporter explains. 

Reeves responds that she inherited the lowest headroom a chancellor has ever been faced with. 

She says that she managed to increase this headroom by around 50% in Autumn last year. 

Since then, higher government borrowing costs have eroded much of that progress. But Reeves adds that today she has restored this headroom in full.

The chancellor says this proves people should have no doubt about her commitment to the fiscal rules and the need for stability.

Reeves is asked by a journalist from The Sun if the National Insurance increase (she announced in October) is actually a tax on working people. 

Reeves replies that wages are rising at twice the rate of inflation. The national living wage is going up and inflation is coming down, Reeves says. People are starting to see extra money in their pay packets and living standards are going up, she claims. 

The next question is from the ITV, who asks the chancellor whether her fiscal plans and self-imposed rules are punishing the most vulnerable.

In response, the chancellor says there is ""nothing progressive and nothing Labour"" about losing control of the public finances - which she says is what the previous Tory government did.

Markets impose discipline, Reeves adds, saying it's important to provide an anchor.

Reeves says today the government is spending £105bn per year on debt interest costs - which is more than the government spends on defence, the ministry of justice and the home office combined. 

""This government wants to reduce debt, and reduce the deficit,"" she adds.

The BBC's Economics editor Faisal Islam about the OBR's assessment that many will be pushed into poverty as a result of the welfare cuts. 

Reeves responds that the OBR set out that they haven't accounted for those who currently receive benefits but who will go into work. 

Faisal then asks second question on speculation that the Digital Services Tax could be abolished and could she justify a ""tax giveaway"" for the biggest tech multinationals. 

The chancellor says the Digital Service Tax was supposed to be temporary until there was a global agreement. 

She underlines that the government believes companies should pay tax in the countries they operate - and the views on that ""have not changed"".

Rachel Reeves begins by setting out the government's mission and touts some of its achievements, including increasing breakfast club numbers and raising the minimum wage.

She observes, though, that global instability is hampering growth across the world, and admits that the cost of living crisis is ""still very real"" in the UK. 

In this climate, Reeves notes that the country needs to spend more on defence, and repeats her refrain that Labour is ""going further and faster"" on this. 

The chancellor's statement is only brief, as she reiterates some of the figures behind the government's new measures - such as plans to build 1.5 million new homes - which she set out earlier on today.

We'll bring you key lines from the chancellor's news conference very shortly - stay tuned.

You can follow along by clicking watch live at the top of the page.

Dearbail JordanBusiness reporter

One of the most important points in today's Spring Statement is that the chancellor has restored the government's £9.9bn headroom.

This is basically spare cash the government is forecast to have in its annual budget in five years' time, taking into account its tax and spending plans.

It might sound like a lot but, as the OBR points out, that £9.9bn buffer is actually ""a very small margin"", especially considering that the official forecaster expects tax revenues and spending to reach £1.5 trillion each over the period to 2029-30. 

The OBR reckons that Reeves has just over a 50% chance of meeting her own borrowing and debt rules by the end of the decade.

Compared to other chancellors since 2010, especially the likes of George Osborne, Reeves' room for manoeuvre is miniscule. 

Just the merest puff of a headwind - such as Donald Trump's tariffs sparking a global trade war or higher borrowing costs - could knock the government's finances off course.

It means attention will now turn to the Budget and whether tax rises are on the horizon.

Kevin PeacheyCost of living correspondent

It appears the chancellor's news conference is slightly delayed - we'll update you as soon as we have a clearer idea on timings.

While we wait, here's a look at how the Spring Statement could affect you:

1. Benefit changes

If you are on benefits, you could be directly affected.

The sweeping changes to the benefits system, first announced a week ago, will see some people lose support from late 2026, although universal credit payments are set to rise.

2. Living standards and household bills

No major government statements come in isolation and increases in water bills, energy prices, council tax and more will kick in on 1 April.

However, overall living standards, measured by real household disposable income, are expected to improve.

Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.

3. Jobs and services cut or created

Jobs could be affected and, for example, any cuts to local government funding could have a direct impact on services. Theoretically, that could lead, for example, to councils considering what to charge for local services.

On the flipside, investment by the government - such as with defence projects - could create new jobs.

We're about to hear from Rachel Reeves for the second time today. 

She's due to address a news conference in Downing Street after her Spring Statement earlier.

When she speaks, we'll bring you all the key lines right here. You can follow along yourself by clicking watch live at the top of the page.

Earlier the chancellor and OBR confirmed the government is on course to have around £10bn worth of headroom - in short, leeway to spend more or cut taxes - by the end of the decade.

Rachel Reeves billed that as a successful outcome of her policies. But Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) - an economics think tank - said it is a ""tiny, tiny"" amount of wiggle room.

He tells the BBC that any small negative change in the economic outlook could ""require some action"" and politicians and analysts alike may ""spend the next six months speculating about tax rises"".

Johnson says there is ""an incredible degree of fiscal fine-tuning going on"" in the chancellor's plans.

He says the government has ""ended up with precisely the same numbers for headroom and borrowing for 2029/30 as they had at the beginning"".

Changes to the economic picture, especially the rising cost of borrowing money, led to the Treasury being forecast to have £14bn less than they had previously expected to have by the general election.

Johnson says the chancellor ""made up every penny to the one decimal place"" in this Spring Statement. 

Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice has been speaking to BBC Radio 5Live outside the Palace of Westminster.

He is strongly critical of the independent OBR, describing their forecast as ""delusional"".

""We can't keep spending more than we're earning,"" he tells Matt Chorley. ""I'm afraid we're heading to a very difficult place, led by the R-word – recession.""

Tice says voters didn't elect the OBR and that Labour shouldn't be relying so much on their advice.

Reacting to the Spring Statement, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accuses the government of creating economic ""chaos"".

Badenoch says the statement ""was all smoke and mirrors"", and again calls it ""an emergency budget"".

The Tory leader says Reeves needed to deliver it ""because of mess she made at the last budget"", which took place last Autumn.

We can now bring you some reaction from the Liberal Democrats to the chancellor's Spring Statement.

""The slashing of growth is a hammer blow to the Chancellor's economic credibility,"" Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper says.

She adds that the Labour government is ""simply fiddling while Rome burns instead of fixing our trading relationship with Europe"".

Cooper says Reeves must ""immediately launch negotiations for a new UK-EU customs union,"" which she says will ""kickstart growth, boost small businesses, and secure the vital revenue that our public services desperately need"".

We've encountered a whirlwind of figures - and a variety of opinions on those figures - during and after Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement today. 

So here's our political correspondent Henry Zeffman with a tight summary of what it all means:

This video can not be played

Spring Statement: Henry Zeffman explains what Rachel Reeves's statement means

Back at the OBR news conference, committee member Prof David Miles addresses a question about whether tax rises for employers announced by Labour in October - which are due to come into effect on 1 April - have impacted its growth forecast. 

He says the impact of those taxes was taken into account when the OBR produced its last set of forecasts in October. The tax changes are not ""the main factor behind a pretty big downgrade for growth"" this year, he adds.

Miles suggests interest rates in the UK and around the world, coupled with weakening consumer and business confidence, were the driving factors in the more pessimistic outlook for the year ahead.

With that, we're going to turn our attention away from the OBR briefing and return to bringing you more analysis and reaction to the day's events from elsewhere. 

We're peeling away from the OBR news conference now to take a closer look at a bit more from its latest fiscal outlook, which was published as Rachel Reeves finished her Spring Statement in the Commons.

It's given the government a dressing-down for not providing details about plans to cut working-age welfare benefits until ""very late in the process"".

The forecaster also told the government off for ""late notice of changes and incomplete analysis"", which it said ""hampered our ability to reflect these measures
in our forecasts"".

Labour announced last week that it wanted to reduce welfare spending by £5bn. 

However, when the OBR subsequently checked the data behind the planned cuts, it found it fell £1.6bn short of the government's target. Cue much scrabbling around to find additional savings.

The government found them. The OBR now says welfare benefits will be cut by £4.8bn.

Dearbail JordanBusiness reporter

While the OBR no longer expects the economy to grow as quickly this year as they previously thought, things look relatively rosy after that. 

In 2026, the OBR now reckons the economy will expand by 1.9% against its last forecast in October of 1.8%.

For 2027, the OBR forecasts 1.8% growth up from 1.5%, and the following year, it is expected to hit 1.7%, again up from October's outlook of 1.5%.

Those numbers look less optimistic when you consider the historical context: before the global financial crisis in 2008, the average annual growth
rate was 2.7% according to the
IFS.

Over at the OBR press conference, its experts have been reminding the room that the UK economy's ""cruising speed"" used to be around 2.5%. That feels like a long time ago now.

The development of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) in Russia's Arctic territory will be at the center of discussions on Wednesday at the International Arctic Forum. The two-day event is taking place in Murmansk – the world's largest city north of the Arctic Circle and home to a strategic Russian port.

The forum, organized by the Russian government and national nuclear energy giant Rosatom, is a major platform for discussing the development of the Arctic. The region has drawn increasing global attention due to its vast untapped energy and mineral resources, as well as its strategic trade routes. 

Russia has been developing the NSR, a transport corridor that runs through its Arctic and Far East regions and serves as the shortest shipping link between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. The NSR is expected to become a major trade route for goods shipped between the continents and could drastically reduce transportation times compared to traditional pathways through the Suez or Panama canals.

Forum participants will examine plans to modernize and expand the NSR, with a focus on boosting its efficiency and strengthening partnerships between Russia and countries in Southeast Asia and the Persian Gulf. The discussion will also seek ways to keep the route operational year-round, improve logistics along the corridor, and enhance Arctic infrastructure.

The NSR in Russia's exclusive economic zone within Arctic waters has been experiencing an unprecedented surge in development over the past decade. Moscow has extensively modernized the route, with significant investment from India and China, which hold stakes in several Arctic energy projects.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last year outlined the development of the NSR as a strategic priority for the country, pledging to ensure all-year navigation on the Arctic route. He has also invited foreign partners to use the shipping artery.

Freight traffic via the route has been growing steadily. Russian authorities expect annual maritime cargo flows along the NSR to reach 200 million tons by 2030. They plan to boost cargo throughput at northern seaports and to increase the country's Arctic fleet.

The West is continuing to “cause damage to humanity” through neocolonial practices, including looting resources from African countries, Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Director Sergey Naryshkin has said. He cited France as an example, accusing Paris of importing uranium from its former colony, Niger, at extremely low prices for six decades. 

Naryshkin made the remarks during a roundtable discussion on the history of the fight against colonialism, organized by the Russian Historical Society (RHS) in Moscow on Tuesday.

“It is enough to recall, for example, how France purchased uranium from Niger for 60 years at a humiliatingly low price – 80 cents per kilogram,” he said.

“But as soon as the French military contingent was withdrawn from this country last year, the price of uranium was raised by the new government to the market price – more than 200 times,” Naryshkin, who is also the chairman of the RHS, added.

Niger's new leadership, which took power following a coup in July 2023, has taken several measures to cut ties with France. Last year, the military government revoked a license that had allowed French state-owned company Orano to operate one of the world's largest uranium mines in the West African country – the world's seventh-largest uranium producer. The miner had been operating in Niger since 1971.

Niamey also followed in the footsteps of allies in neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali by expelling French military forces, accusing Paris of aggression and meddling in the affairs of their nations. France's military presence in Africa has been controversial for decades, with critics arguing that it perpetuates neocolonial dynamics. Leaders in countries that have severed defense ties with Paris insist that the presence of French forces has been ineffective, prompting them to seek alternative alliances, including with Moscow.

Russian officials have been vocal about condemning neocolonialism. In a speech at a G20 meeting in South Africa last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western powers of exploiting natural resources from developing countries at low costs, imposing “pseudo-ecological taxes” on their products, and attempting to block cooperation between Africa, Asia, and Latin America with Russia and China.

On Tuesday, Naryshkin condemned European powers such as Britain, Belgium, and France for their “cruelty and unrestrained exploitation of the population in Africa, India, and Southeast Asia” during the colonial era.

“It is necessary to put up a reliable legal barrier to new attempts to revive the system of colonialism, and ideally, even to seek fair compensation for damages,” the SVR director said, adding that Russia is “at the forefront of the struggle for a more just world order.”

He is a postgraduate of the University of Delhi and the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University), Russian Federation. He is currently pursuing PhD; his area of expertise is the Russian-Ukrainian Conflict and the Multipolar World Order.

At a time when global governance is fraying and multilateralism teeters on the edge, the 2024 Raisina Dialogue, India's flagship geopolitical platform, offered a rare window into the world's evolving geopolitical imagination – connecting North and South, West and East, somewhat unimaginable these days.

Speaking to a packed hall, Samir Saran, President of the Observer Research Foundation which annually hosts the Raisina Dialogue, set the tone with a sharp observation: “The creators of multilateralism have given up on multilateralism.” 

Co-hosted by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the Dialogue showcased India's balancing act – between East and West, power and principle – while reflecting deep anxieties over global disorder. The invitees to the conference represent a good litmus test of the health of India's bilateral engagements with the world.  

Americans were represented by a large delegation of foreign policy pundits and business leaders, with Tulsi Gabbard, US director of National Intelligence, providing a keynote address. 

A separate QUAD panel was hosted too, signifying Indian appetite towards the multilateral concept in the face of disruptive Indo-Pacific geopolitics. There were no representatives from the Mohammad Yunis-led Bangladesh, interestingly, while a Chinese professor from Fudan University was invited, signifying the thawing of Indo-Chinese relations for the time being.

The invitation to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga was artfully balanced by an invitation to Vyacheslav Nikonov, a prominent member of Russia's State Duma and the grandson of Vyacheslav Molotov, among other Russian experts.

Other prominent mentions include Slovenia, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Latvia, Moldova, Georgia, Sweden, Slovak Republic, Bhutan, Maldives, Norway, Thailand, Antigua and Barbuda, Peru, Ghana, Hungary, Mauritius and Philippines. The sessions represented a marked diversity, with due considerations given to the Global South throughout.

It wasn't unusual to witness panelists hailing from three or more different continents in each session, replicating the multilateral cross-cultural deliberations even as the latter disappear from fracturing global institutional frameworks.

During the course of the forum, the United Kingdom wielded a noticeably softer stance on the Ukraine conflict, with National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell obliquely referencing it without explicitly naming Russia. Contrastingly, the 2024 edition of the Raisina Dialogue saw the former European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson give a strongly worded speech criticizing Russia and its ‘colonial war' against Ukraine.

Whether the change in stance is due to Europe's new-found crisis of security or a realisation of the limits of Western power is far from certain. 

The UK NSA mentioned with satisfaction that Britian has been invited back into European security discussions almost a decade after Brexit, symbolising the return of “British relevance” to European geopolitics. Other commentators may argue that increasing British relevance at a time of growing European irrelevance and crisis of confidence doesn't make a robust case for Britain's rise. In fact, as the Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Tanja Fajon opined, even smaller states like Slovenia are pivoting towards strengthening relations with Eastern and South East Asian states since the contemporary disorder is governed by “not power of the rules but the rules of the power.” 

Pre-pandemic notions of reducing supplier base through outsourcing have being replaced by a diversification of supplier chains, if not by indigenisation. Such a move has placed increased stress on the robustness of multilateral cooperative mechanisms such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty, which has, despite some exceptions, successfully prevented global nuclear proliferation.

Consequently, some scholars like Dr. Happymon Jacob argue that a facade of rules-based order is better than no order. Despite rampant hypocrisy amongst rule-makers, it provides relative benchmarks and course-corrective measurements, which are absent when the world is adrift on an unordered international system. 

As Fajon commented, there is a need to develop trust within an increasingly sceptical and suspicious international system. A similar concern was raised by Russian President Vladimir Putin at a plenary session hosted by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs where he remarked that trust is difficult to foster in an environment of contradictions and violations to the rules-based order.

The accelerating drift towards regional orders amidst a global power vacuum complicates concerted state efforts to predict shifting global trends. Disparate and contradictory mega-trends are increasingly shaped by pivotal spaces where geopolitics converge. 

The point was driven home by an Arab state facilitating peace negotiations between two European powers, an event unimaginable three decades ago. Ashok Malik summed up the global drift by stating, “In 2023 Europeans were berating the Global South for not upholding European values in Ukraine. In 2024 the Global South was berating Europe for not upholding European values in Gaza. In 2025 the US Vice President was berating Europe for not upholding European values in Europe.”

Today we witness a recalcitrant America courting transactionalism, a recessionist Europe feigning to be a great power, a resurgent Russia balancing unchecked Western expansionism, a revisionist China vying for its ‘place in the sun' and a rising India which comprehends “all three sides of a bipolar debate.”

The “weaponisation of everything” as pointed out by Jaishankar, is a trend which will not subside in the near future. Pierroberto Folgiero, CEO of Italian shipbuilding giant Fincantieri subsequently argued how the geopolitics of shipbuilding is emerging as a key strategic pillar of the maritime economy.

Today, shipbuilding in terms of tonnage is largely concentrated between South Korea and China, since the West abandoned it two decades ago. Beijing crystallizes shipbuilding expertise, logistics handling and owning port infrastructure as key focal points within its long-term strategic maritime economy. Despite current trends, an Emirati panellist sensibly argued that pursuing sovereignty shouldn't be outright viewed as declaring isolationism, threading a fine line within a saturated global dichotomous discourse of globalisation versus nationalism. 

Moving Forward, inter- and intra-state conflicts are likely to increase in face of global institutional paralysis and American recessionary motives. In this context, diplomacy takes on a renewed urgency – even as it risks becoming a rarity in conflict-ridden international arenas.

As states find themselves in a post-truth and post-rules world, governments are facing the dangerous triad of AI weaponisation, nuclear proliferation and ultranationalism. In such a volatile environment, it is imperative to establish guardrails that can prevent unnecessary escalations. Without them, we risk repeating the mistakes of a previous generation – one that too hastily declared ‘peace for our time.'

With Taiwan's South African office having been recently downgraded from Taipei Liaison Office (TLO) to Taipei Commercial Office (TCO), the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has revealed that while the impending relocation of the Taiwan office has been set in stone, Taipei has indicated that this might take longer than expected due to budgetary constraints.

The South African government had initially ordered Taiwan to move its Pretoria office to Johannesburg in October 2024, but talks between the countries resulted in a new date of end of March being set.

However, with just under a week to go before the deadline, this might not happen as Taiwan and the South African government are still engaged in a possible change of date due to financial implications associated with this relocation.

DIRCO spokesperson Chrispin Phiri has indicated that due to the shift in relations between the two countries since the advent of democracy, this name change reflects the current government's position on its relations with Taiwan.

”The name change is the accurate representation of the status of their office... The apartheid government maintained close ties with Taiwan, this relationship shifted after the country's democratic transition in 1994. Since joining the UN in 1994, South Africa has aligned with international consensus and adhered to UN Resolutions, including Resolution 2758 (1971), which recognises the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legitimate representative of China.

“In 1997, South Africa severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan and maintained a non-political, non-diplomatic engagement. In 1998, South Africa formalised its diplomatic relations with the PRC and committed to the One China Policy, which asserts that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,” Phiri stated.

It has been reported that as the deadline looms large over this relocation, Taiwan has formally requested talks to decide on the relocation site, personnel arrangements, and agreement signing details.

”The location of the Taiwan Liaison Office (TLO) is simply a matter of geography and poses no threat to the Republic of South Africa. Our relationship with Taiwan revolves around trade, rather than political or diplomatic concerns. The Taiwanese Authorities have indicated that they cannot adhere to the relocation deadline for various reasons, including budgetary concerns. The discussions are ongoing, and in the interim, South Africa is following domestic processes to undertake administrative adjustments that appropriately reflect the status of Taiwanese representation in South Africa,” Phiri further stated.

DIRCO renamed the “Taipei Liaison Office” to the “Taipei Commercial Office” on its website earlier this month, saying the relocation will not hinder but enhance economic ties between the two nations.

”The relocation of the TLO presents a unique opportunity that promises to enhance economic and trade relations. Johannesburg, a thriving commercial and financial hub, is ideally positioned to foster productive economic collaborations.

”South Africa is committed to strengthening its non-diplomatic ties with the island, focusing on lucrative areas such as trade, investment, and education. This strategic approach will be facilitated through a non-binding Memorandum of Arrangement with the Taipei Authorities,” Phiri added.

The US is considering lifting certain sanctions against Russia in order to advance the Black Sea Grain Initiative, seen as a step towards settling the Ukraine conflict, President Donald Trump has said.

Both the Kremlin and the White House stated on Tuesday that, as part of the agreement, the US “will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”

Moscow's statement further noted that the deal envisages a lifting of restrictions on Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial institutions involved in the international sale of food and fertilizers, as well as a removal of sanctions on its vessels, port services, and ability to purchase agricultural machinery and related goods.

The White House did not provide details, but President Donald Trump confirmed that his administration is indeed considering lifting some of the sanctions against Moscow.

“They will be looking at them, and we're thinking about all of them right now. There are about five or six conditions. We're looking at all of them,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky lashed out at Washington later in the day, accusing the US of discussing the issue of sanctions with the Russian delegation without properly briefing Kiev on the matter.

“We did not agree to this so that it would be in a joint document. We believe that this is a weakening of positions and a weakening of sanctions,” he claimed.

The US and Russia agreed to revive the defunct Black Sea Grain Initiative following 12 hours of talks focused on the Ukraine conflict which were held on Monday in Saudi Arabia by expert groups from both countries. The agreement, originally brokered in July 2022 by the UN and Türkiye, envisioned the safe passage of Ukrainian agricultural products in exchange for the West lifting sanctions on Russian grain and fertilizer exports.

Moscow eventually refused to extend the deal, citing the West's failure to uphold its obligations. Now, Russia needs ironclad guarantees from the US, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said, arguing that only a “direct order” from Washington could compel Kiev to observe any agreement.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Wednesday that four U.S. soldiers who went missing while training in Lithuania have been killed, but that he did not yet know the details. 

A U.S. official would say only that the four soldiers were involved in a training accident. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not comment on the status of the soldiers. 

Rutte said, during a trip to Warsaw, that his thoughts were with their families and with the United States. 

“The news came out about four American soldiers who were killed in an incident in Lithuania. This is still early news so we do not know the details. This is really terrible news and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones,” Rutte told reporters in Warsaw. 

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Four U.S. Army soldiers have gone missing at a training area outside of Lithuania's capital, and a search is underway, the U.S. military said Wednesday.

A statement from U.S. Army Europe and Africa public affairs in Wiesbaden, Germany said the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time.

It said further information will be provided as new information becomes available.

Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported that four U.S. soldiers and vehicle were reported missing Tuesday afternoon during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Belarus. 




The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all NATO members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. 

Relations soured further over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Ukraine in its fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte appealed for unity on Wednesday as European nations scale up their armed forces and defense industries after the United States warned that Europe must take care of its own security in future.

Trust between the 32 member countries is at a new low. NATO was formed 76 years ago to provide stability in Europe; a guarantee underwritten by the United States. But the Trump administration says America's security priorities now lie in Asia and on its own borders.

“Let me be absolutely clear, this is not the time to go it alone. Not for Europe or North America,” Rutte said in a speech in Warsaw. “The global security challenges are too great for any of us to face on our own.”

Rutte said that “there is no alternative to NATO” even as some allies worry about the U.S. commitment to the organization's central principle that an attack on one ally must be considered an attack on them all, while Washington demands that European countries stop free-riding on its massive military budget.

His warning comes as Europe tries to wean itself off its security dependence on the United States, just as it reduced its reliance on Russian energy after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine three years ago, amid a drive to buy more European military equipment.

“Yes, Europe needs to know that Uncle Sam still has our back, but America also needs to know that its NATO allies will step up and play their full part, without restrictions and without capability gaps,” Rutte said. “It's only fair. Reassurance is a two-way street.”




His comments come on the eve of a visit to Greenland by U.S. Vice President JD Vance. President Donald Trump has not ruled out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory belonging to NATO and European Union member Denmark and this has deeply unsettled many allies. 

Still, Rutte said he is “absolutely confident” about the U.S. commitment to NATO's Article 5 security guarantee. He added that “nothing can replace America's nuclear umbrella, the ultimate guarantor of our security.” Britain and France are also nuclear powers but their arsenals are tiny by comparison.

Asked on March 13 whether U.S. forces would defend an ally which came under attack from Russia, Trump said: “We'll make sure it doesn't happen.” Trump also said that “you have to keep NATO strong. You have to keep it relevant.”

Rutte said he believes that when Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands in June, “we will begin a new chapter for our transatlantic alliance where we build a stronger, fairer and more lethal NATO to face a more dangerous world.”

He said that ambitious new spending targets would be set. Twenty-three NATO member countries are estimated to be meeting the current guideline of more than 2% of their gross domestic product on national defense budgets. Rutte has said that the new target would be “well north of 3%.”

Earlier on Wednesday, at talks with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Rutte warned Russia that the alliance would always stand by Poland or any other member and that its reaction to an attack would be “devastating.”

Tusk said it was important to be prepared for any outcome of talks between Russia and the United States aimed at ending t he 3-year-old war in Ukraine.

NATO members along its eastern flank, particularly Poland and the Baltic states, are extremely worried that the talks could end with a settlement that is favorable to Russia. They fear such an outcome would allow Putin to rebuild his country's forces and threaten other countries in the region in the coming years.

Rutte said that neither Putin nor anyone else should assume they could get away with something like that.

“If anyone were to miscalculate and think they can get away with an attack on Poland or on any other ally, they will be met with the full force of this fierce alliance. Our reaction will be devastating. This has to be very clear to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and anyone else who wants to attack us,” Rutte said.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved early Wednesday by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland Friday, reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration's attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

The couple will now visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance's previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.

President Donald Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.

Trump, in an interview Wednesday on “The Vince Show,” repeated his desire for U.S. control of Greenland. Asked if the people there are “eager” to become U.S. citizens, Trump said he didn't know “but I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.”

The vice president's decision to visit a U.S. military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. Yet Vance has also criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S.

During his first term, Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world's largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn't for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump's plans.

Anne Merrild, a Greenlander and an expert on Arctic politics and development, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders. 

Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table.

“It's a signal to the whole world, it's a strong signal to Denmark, it's a signal to Greenland,” she said. “And of course it's also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we're pursuing.” 

Vance is allowed to visit the base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the U.S. regarding the defense of Greenland.

Jacobsen said the timing is controversial, particularly because coalition negotiations are ongoing to form a government after the election earlier this month.

Ahead of the vice president's announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday night that it had “not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.”

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday that the visit was “unacceptable pressure.” 

Peter Viggo Jakobsen, associate professor at the Danish Defense Academy, said the trip's flip-flop continues to cause major confusion on the island. The U.S. has not articulated specific demands from Greenland or Denmark at this point.

 “We have no idea what the end game is,” Jakobsen said.

In Greenland, the political group the most sympathetic to the U.S. president, the Naleraq party that advocates a swift path toward independence, has now been excluded from coalition talks to form the next government. The Trump administration's aspirations for Greenland could backfire and push the more mild parties closer to Denmark.

“But now Trump has scared most Greenlanders away from this idea about a close relationship to the United States because they don't trust him,” Jakobsen added.

One of the biggest remaining hurdles to Greenland's independence is diversifying the economy, where fishing accounts for 90% of exports. In the meantime, Greenland receives an annual block grant from Denmark of around 3.5 billion kronen ($506 million), which is more than half the public budget, to cover the island's Nordic-style social programs, including free health care.

It's therefore better for Greenland, strategically, to threaten Denmark with independence and a referendum than actually do it, Jakobsen said. As long as the threat is there, Greenland can push for more concessions and more money from Denmark. 

If the island pins all its hopes on the U.S., Greenlanders have no guarantee they will be better off or have any power in a future relationship with America, he said.

“In that sense, Trump is the Danish realm's best friend at the moment,” Jakobsen added.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a tentative U.S-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges to negotiating a broader peace in the war in Ukraine. 

Russia's Defense Ministry alleged that Ukrainian drone attacks hit an electric facility in the Bryansk region early Wednesday and a power grid facility in the Kursk region on Tuesday, leading to a power cut affecting thousands of people.

“The Kyiv regime is doing everything to derail the Russian-U.S. agreements on the gradual settlement of the Ukrainian conflict,” the ministry said Wednesday.

Ukraine's General Staff denied the allegations, saying in a statement Wednesday that Russia's claims were part of a broader disinformation campaign aimed at justifying continued hostilities.

The accusations came hours after Washington announced Tuesday that it had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine and Russia to implement a pause on attacks on energy sites as well as taking steps to ensure safe navigation for ships in the Black Sea. The deal followed three days of separate U.S-Ukrainian and U.S.-Russian talks in the Saudi capital. 

Those talks were part of efforts by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to implement a limited, 30-day ceasefire that Moscow and Kyiv agreed to in principle last week. That has thus far failed to materialize as both sides continue to launch drone and rocket attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday Ukraine had agreed with U.S. negotiators in Riyadh “that a ceasefire for energy infrastructure can start today,” and expressed his country's willingness to comply with the agreement while warning Russia would face “strong retaliation” if it attacked Ukrainian energy facilities. 




Ukrainian officials have contested claims by the Kremlin that Russian forces have not attacked energy sites in Ukraine since March 18. In a post on X on Tuesday, Zelenskyy's communications adviser Dmytro Lytvyn said Moscow was “lying” about observing a ceasefire on energy infrastructure.

“They've been hitting our energy sites with bombs, attack drones, and FPV drones. We're not going into all the details, but there have already been eight confirmed hits on energy facilities,” Lytvyn wrote. “Every night our air defense forces shoot down nearly a hundred attack drones – and many of those drones were likely targeting other energy facilities.” 

On Tuesday, the White House said in separate statements that the sides had “agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”

Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey but halted by Russia the next year.

After the White House issued its statement Tuesday, the Kremlin warned that a potential Black Sea deal could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial organizations involved in food and fertilizer trade are lifted and their access to the SWIFT system of international payments is ensured.

Zelenskyy described the demands as an example of Moscow “manipulating, twisting agreements, and lying” about the terms of the agreement. 

“There are absolutely clear statements that have been published by the White House, everyone can see what is stated there,” Zelenskyy said. “And there is something that the Kremlin is lying about again: that supposedly the (ceasefire) in the Black Sea depends on the issue of sanctions.”

In an apparent reference to Moscow's demands, the White House said Tuesday the U.S. “will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”

When asked about when Washington might help Moscow achieve those ambitions, Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Wednesday that contacts between Russia and the U.S. “continue quite intensively,” and that authorities are “satisfied with how pragmatic, constructive and productive our dialogue is.”

Peskov said the 2022 Black Sea Grain initiative could be revived if Russia's demands regarding agricultural and fertilizer exports are met. He said that those are the same demands that Russia initially put forward in the grain deal and that weren't being fulfilled.

Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown, came under the “most massive kamikaze drone attack since the beginning of the war” on Tuesday night, the city administration head, Oleksandr Vilkul, wrote on Telegram.

Although no one was killed or injured, civilian infrastructure including warehouses, an administration building and a fire station was widely targeted, Vikul said. Multiple fires were sparked across the city, he said. 

“Everyone is alive, thank God. It's truly a miracle. The destruction is significant,” Vilkul said. 

Civilian infrastructure also came under strike in the Sumy, Cherkasy, and Kirovohrad regions, local authorities said. There were no immediate reports on any injuries.

Overall, Russian forces launched 117 Shahed and decoy drones overnight, Ukraine's air force said Wednesday morning, adding that 56 drones were destroyed and 48 more jammed by the defense forces.

Palestinians chanted against Hamas during an anti-war protest in northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday, videos showed. Wednesday's protest comes after similar ones the day before, marking a rare show of public anger against the militant group that has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory 17 months into the war with Israel.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said Wednesday the bodies of 39 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 124 wounded, the ministry said in its daily report.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that if Hamas doesn't release the hostages held in Gaza, pressure will increase, and may include “seizing territory,” on the Strip.

CAIRO (AP) — Thousands of Palestinians marched between the wreckage of a heavily destroyed town in northern Gaza on Wednesday in the second day of anti-war protests, with many chanting against Hamas in a rare display of public anger against the militant group.

The protests, which centered mainly on Gaza's north, appeared to be aimed generally against the war, with protesters calling for an end to 17 months of deadly fighting with Israel that has made life in Gaza insufferable. 

But the public calls against Hamas, which has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory months into the war with Israel, were rare.

In the town of Beit Lahiya, where a similar protest took place Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated, with many chanting “the people want the fall of Hamas.” In the hard-hit Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted “Out, out out! Hamas get out!” 

“Our children have been killed. Our houses have been destroyed,” said Abed Radwan, who said he joined the protest in Beit Lahiya “against the war, against Hamas, and the (Palestinian political) factions, against Israel and against the world's silence.”

Ammar Hassan, who took part in a protest Tuesday, said it started as an anti-war protest with a few dozen people but swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.

“It's the only party we can affect,” he said by phone. “Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but it can affect Hamas.”




The militant group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed its war against it.

Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim, in a post on Facebook, wrote that people had the right to protest but that their focus should be on the “criminal aggressor,” Israel.

Family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's renewed offensive and its tightened blockade on all supplies into Gaza. Their statement said the community fully supports armed resistance against Israel.

“The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,” said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father of three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined a demonstration Tuesday.

“We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,” he said.

A similar protest occurred in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to witnesses.

One protester in Jabaliya, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they joined the demonstration because “everyone failed us.”

They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the Western-backed Palestinian Authority and Arab mediators. They said there were no Hamas security forces at the protest but scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the group.

Later, they said they regretted participating because of Israeli media coverage, which emphasized the opposition to Hamas. 

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz urged Palestinians to join the protests.

“You too should demand the removal of Hamas from Gaza and the immediate release of all Israeli hostages. That is the only way to stop the war,” he said.

A 19-year-old Palestinian, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said he planned to join demonstrations on Wednesday. His mother has cancer and his 10-year-old brother is hospitalized with cerebral palsy, and he said the family has been displaced multiple times since their home was destroyed.

“People are angry at the whole world,” including the United States, Israel and Hamas, he said. “We want Hamas to resolve this situation, return the hostages and end this whole thing.”

The protests erupted a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.

Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

The war was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have caused vast destruction and at their height displaced some 90% of Gaza's population.

Hamas won a landslide victory in the last Palestinian elections, held in 2006. It seized power in Gaza from the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by the secular Fatah movement, the following year after months of factional unrest and a week of heavy street battles.

Rights groups say both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas violently suppress dissent, quashing protests in the areas they control and jailing and torturing critics.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Under pressure from Israel's top court to improve conditions at a facility notorious for mistreating Palestinians seized in Gaza, the military transferred hundreds of detainees to newly opened camps.



But abuses at these camps were just as bad, according to Israeli human rights organizations that interviewed dozens of current and former detainees and are now asking the same court to force the military to fix the problem once and for all.



What the detainees' testimonies show, rights groups say, is that instead of correcting alleged abuses against Palestinians held without charge or trial — including beatings, excessive handcuffing, and poor diet and health care -- Israel's military just shifted where they take place.

“What we've seen is the erosion of the basic standards for humane detention,” said Jessica Montell, the director of Hamoked, one of the rights groups petitioning the Israeli government.



Asked for a response, the military said it complies with international law and “completely rejects allegations regarding the systematic abuse of detainees.”



The sprawling Ofer Camp and the smaller Anatot Camp, both built in the West Bank, were supposed to resolve problems rights groups documented at a detention center in the Negev desert called Sde Teiman. That site was intended to temporarily hold and treat militants captured during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. But it morphed into a long-term detention center infamous for brutalizing Palestinians rounded up in Gaza, often without being charged. 



Detainees transferred to Ofer and Anatot say conditions there were no better, according to more than 30 who were interviewed by lawyers for Hamoked and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel. The Associated Press is the first international news organization to report on the affidavits from PHRI.






“They would punish you for anything” said Khaled Alserr, 32, a surgeon from Gaza who spent months at Ofer Camp and agreed to speak about his experiences. He was released after six months without charge. 



Alserr said he lost count of the beatings he endured from soldiers after being rounded up in March of last year during a raid at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. “You'd be punished for making eye contact, for asking for medicine, for looking up towards the sky,” said Alserr.

Other detainees' accounts to the rights groups remain anonymous. Their accounts could not be independently confirmed, but their testimonies – given separately – were similar.



The Supreme Court has given the military until the end of March to respond to the alleged abuses at Ofer.







Since the war began, Israel has seized thousands in Gaza that it suspects of links to Hamas. Thousands have also been released, often after months of detention. 



Hundreds of detainees were freed during the ceasefire that began in January. But with ground operations recently restarted in Gaza, arrests continue. The military won't say how many detainees it holds.



After Israel's Supreme Court ordered better treatment at Sde Teiman, the military said in June it was transferring hundreds of detainees, including 500 sent to Ofer.



Ofer was built on an empty lot next to a civilian prison of the same name. Satellite photos from January show a paved, walled compound, with 24 mobile homes that serve as cells.

Anatot, built on a military base in a Jewish settlement, has two barracks, each with room for about 50 people, according to Hamoked.



Under wartime Israeli law, the military can hold Palestinians from Gaza for 45 days without access to the outside world. In practice, many go far longer.



Whenever detainees met with Hamoked lawyers, they were “dragged violently” into a cell — sometimes barefoot and often blindfolded, and their hands and feet remained shackled throughout the meetings, the rights group said in a letter to the military's advocate general.



“I don't know where I am,” one detainee told a lawyer.



Newly freed Israeli hostages have spoken out about their own harsh conditions in Gaza. Eli Sharabi, who emerged gaunt after 15 months of captivity, told Israel's Channel 12 news that his captors said hostages' conditions were influenced by Israel's treatment of Palestinian prisoners. 











Alserr said he was kept with 21 others from Gaza in a 40-square-meter cell with eight bunk beds. Some slept on the floor on camping mattresses soldiers had punctured so they couldn't inflate, he said. Scabies and lice were rampant. He said he was only allowed outside his cell once a week.



Detainees from Ofer and Anatot said they were regularly beaten with fists and batons. Some said they were kept in handcuffs for months, including while they slept and ate — and unshackled only when allowed to shower once a week. 



Three prisoners held in Anatot told the lawyers that they were blindfolded constantly. One Anatot detainee said that soldiers woke them every hour during the night and made them stand for a half-hour.



The military told AP it was unaware of claims that soldiers woke detainees up. It said detainees have regular shower access and are allowed daily yard time. It said occasional overcrowding meant some detainees were forced to sleep on “mattresses on the floor.”



The military said it closed Anatot in early February because it was no longer needed for “short-term incarceration” when other facilities were full. Sde Teiman, which has been upgraded, is still in use.

Alserr said the worst thing about Ofer was medical care. He said guards refused to give him antacids for a chronic ulcer. After 40 days, he felt a rupture. In the truck heading to the hospital, soldiers tied a bag around his head.



“They beat me all the way to the hospital,” he said. “At the hospital they refused to remove the bag, even when they were treating me.”



The military said all detainees are checked and receive proper medical care. It said “prolonged restraint during detention” was only used in exceptional cases and taking into account the condition of each detainee. 



Many detainees complained of hunger. They said they received three meals a day of a few slices of white bread with a cucumber or tomato, and sometimes some chocolate or custard.



That amounts to about 1,000 calories a day, or half what is necessary, said Lihi Joffe, an Israeli pediatric dietician who read some of the Ofer testimonies and reviewed them for PHRI and called the diet “not humane.” 



After rights groups complained in November, Joffe said she saw new menus at Ofer with greater variety, including potatoes and falafel — an improvement, she said, but still not enough.



The military said a nutritionist approves detainees' meals, and that they always have access to water.







Two months into his detention, Alserr had a 5-minute videoconference with a judge, who said he would stay in prison for the foreseeable future.



Such hearings are “systematically” brief, according to Nadia Daqqa, a Hamoked attorney. No lawyers are present and detainees are not allowed to talk, she said.



Several months later, Alserr was allowed to meet with a lawyer. But he said he was forced to kneel in the sun for hours beforehand.



Another detainee told the lawyer from Physicians for Human Rights that he underwent the same punishment. ”All the time, he has been threatening to take his own life,” the lawyer wrote in notes affixed to the affidavit. 



Since his release in September, Alserr has returned to work at the hospital in Gaza.



The memories are still painful, but caring for patients again helps, he said. “I'm starting to forget ... to feel myself again as a human being.”

Serbia's populist government is facing increased public scrutiny over reports that it used a sonic weapon against a peaceful crowd during a massive anti-corruption rally in the capital, Belgrade, on March 15.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Ivana Ilic Sunderic had never heard anything quite so alarming and disturbing at a protest as the sound that broke a commemorative silence during a huge anti-government rally in Serbia's capital, Belgrade.

“It was quiet and peaceful and then we heard something we could not see … like a sound rolling toward us, a whiz,” Ilic Sunderic said about the March 15 incident. “People started rushing for safety toward the pavement, feeling that something was moving toward us down the street.”

It was “a subdued sound lasting only 2-3 seconds but very unusual and very frightening, like a sound from hell,” she said.

Ilic Sunderic was not alone in describing the panic. Hundreds of others have offered similar accounts, triggering accusations that the police, military or security services under the tight control of authoritarian Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic used an acoustic crowd control weapon to target peaceful protesters.

The weapons, which are illegal in Serbia, emit sound waves which can trigger sharp ear pain, disorientation, eardrum ruptures or even irreversible hearing damage. 

The incident piled more pressure on Vucic, who has been rattled by nearly five months of anti-corruption protests over the collapse in November of a concrete canopy at a railway station in the northern town of Novi Sad that killed 16 people.

Serbia's officials have issued often contradictory denials that an acoustic weapon was directed at the demonstrators. Calls have been mounting for answers as to what caused the sudden commotion, if not a sonic device. 




An Associated Press video shows thousands of protesters holding up their lit mobile phones in silence when they suddenly start running away in panic. A swooshing sound can then be heard.

“I have been going to protests for 30 years but I've never heard anything like this,” Ilic Sunderic said.

A defiant Vucic has rejected what he called “lies and fabrications” that the security services targeted the demonstrators with a sonic device. He said that such accusations are part of an alleged Western-orchestrated ploy to topple him.

“If there was a single piece of evidence that a sound cannon was used against demonstrators, then I would no longer be president,” he said.

Serbia's police, army and the state security agency, BIA, initially all denied possessing the U.S.-made Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), which is illegal in Serbia and some other countries. When presented with photos of the device mounted on an off-road vehicle and deployed at the rally of hundreds of thousands of protesters, officials admitted possessing a sonic weapon, but insisted it was not used against the protesters.

The photos showed nothing more than “loudspeakers” that also are available on eBay, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said. The rectangular devices, purchased from a U.S. supplier in 2021, serve to emit warnings to the crowds in case of major trouble, he said.

“Serbian police have never, including March 15, used any illegal or unallowed device that is not envisaged by the law, including the device known as a sound cannon,” Dacic said. “Police only use sound devices for warnings.”

Sonic weapons use sound waves to incapacitate, disorient or harm individuals by harnessing acoustic energy, causing both physical and psychological effects, such as dizziness, disorientation or severe headaches. 

Although often described as non-lethal, their use in military, law enforcement and covert operations has raised serious ethical concerns.

More recently, sonic devices have been used against Somali pirates as well as migrants in Greece and reportedly in Serbia. 

Images from the Belgrade protest show what appears to be an LRAD 450XL.

The California-based manufacturer, Genasys, said on X that “the video and audio evidence we have seen and heard thus far does not support the use of an LRAD during the March 15th incident in Belgrade, Serbia.”

Many who were in the crowd later complained of headaches, confusion, ear pressure or nausea. 

Sasa Cvrkovic, a 23-year-old political science student from Belgrade, described the sound as a “jet that flew past like some kind of wind.” He said that it created panic and a brief stampede: “One young man next to me broke his leg.”

Cvrkovic said he felt nauseous all through the day after the demonstration. Ilic Sunderic said she felt pressure in her head and ears.

Reports also have emerged of pressure on doctors at Serbia's emergency clinics to withhold records of hundreds of people who sought medical help and advice after the rally.

Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare, radar and military communications at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said he reviewed some of the videos from the Belgrade stampede. 

“Extraordinary film of people gathering, protesting in the streets peacefully, the demonstration,” he said in an interview. “And suddenly, an almost kind of biblical passing of a huge number of people in a very panicked rush, very sudden and very panicked movement, and the likes of which I must confess I've never seen before.”

He said it was clear that something caused several hundred people to suddenly panic and move in a very specific way, rushing for cover to the pavement and abandoning the middle of the street. 

“So certainly, the behavior that you see on the film does appear to be consistent with people reacting en masse to something that is making them feel deeply unsettled or deeply uncomfortable,” he said.

Predrag Petrovic, a research manager at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, a think tank, said, “We can claim with huge probability that some unconventional weapon, some version of a sonic cannon, was used.”

“I have a lot of experience in participating and monitoring street protests and I have never seen a stampede happen in a second and along an almost straight line,” Petrovic said.

In an online petition signed by over half a million people, the Serbian opposition Move-Change movement asked the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for an independent investigation.

Several Serbian rights groups announced Tuesday they have taken the issue to the European Court of Human Rights, saying that they collected more than 4,000 testimonies from people who complained of various physical and psychological problems after the incident on March 15. The court in Strasbourg has given Serbia until the end of the month to respond, the groups said in a joint statement.

Vucic's pro-Russia government, however, invited the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, to investigate. There has been no immediate answer from the American and Russian security agencies.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's truth commission concluded the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children's backgrounds and origins.

The landmark report released Wednesday followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States, and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea's foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and '80s.

The government-appointed Truth and Reconciliation Commission said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May.

However, some adoptees and even a commission investigator criticized the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government's complicity.

That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, also lamented that the panel on Tuesday deferred assessments of 42 other adoptees' cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions.

However, Lee implied that some members of the commission's decision-making committee were reluctant to recognize cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified — either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them.




Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives.

Lee said the committee's stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases.

“Personally, I find yesterday's decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,” Lee said. 

After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children.

Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea's military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their custody and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in “large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,” the commission said.

Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children's identities, according to the commission's report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees.

The commission's findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The AP. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea's government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means.

The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies.

“The commission determined that the state violated the human rights of adoptees protected under the constitution and international agreements, by neglecting its duty to ensure basic human rights, including inadequate legislation, poor management and oversight, and failures in implementing proper administrative procedures while sending large numbers of children abroad,” the commission said in a statement. It said the government “actively utilized” foreign adoptions, which “required no budget allocation,” rather than strengthening a social safety net for needy children. 

When asked why the commission's report focused on the government's negligence and monitoring failures, rather than highlighting its more direct responsibility for creating a system that put children at risk, Lee acknowledged a need for a deeper investigation into the government's role, citing limitations in the commission's reach. 

A more extensive review of the systemic problems would require a closer look at adoptions to the United States, which by far was the largest recipient of Korean children, Lee said. U.S. adoptees accounted for a smaller number of complaints received by the commission, most of which were filed by adoptees in Europe. 

“Rather than producing a final conclusion, we focused on pointing out the problems the best we could,” Lee said.

The commission recommended the government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.

South Korea's government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, the government department that handles adoption issues, and adoption agencies didn't immediately comment on the commission's report.

During the news conference, Yooree Kim, who was sent at age 11 by an adoption agency to a couple in France without her biological parents' consent, pleaded for the commission to strengthen its recommendations.

She said the government should encourage broader DNA testing for biological families to increase the chances of reunions with adoptees and officially declare an end to foreign adoptions. She said adoptees who fell victim to illicit practices should be entitled to “compensation from the Korean government and adoption agencies, without going through lawsuits.” 

South Korea's practices in the past seven decades formed what's believed to be the world's largest diaspora of adoptees. Recent reforms, including a 2011 law that required foreign adoptions go through family courts, have led to a significant decline, with only 79 cases of South Korean children placed abroad in 2023.

Palestinians chanted against Hamas during an anti-war protest in northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday, videos showed. Wednesday's protest comes after similar ones the day before, marking a rare show of public anger against the militant group that has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory 17 months into the war with Israel.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said Wednesday the bodies of 39 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 124 wounded, the ministry said in its daily report.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that if Hamas doesn't release the hostages held in Gaza, pressure will increase, and may include “seizing territory,” on the Strip.

The Israeli military on Wednesday ordered the evacuation of parts of Gaza City as it steps up its renewed offensive against Hamas after breaking the ceasefire last week. Israel's bombardments and ground operations have caused vast destruction and at their height displaced some 90% of Gaza's population.

Thousands of Palestinians marched in heavily destroyed northern Gaza on Wednesday in the second day of anti-war protests. It's a rare display of public anger against Hamas, although the protests appeared generally aimed against the war in Gaza and their insufferable living conditions. 

Israel has cut off all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to war-torn Gaza's roughly 2 million people since the beginning of the month — a strategy that rights groups say is a war crime.

Israel has vowed to increase military pressure until Hamas returns the remaining 59 hostages — 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel also demands Hamas disarm and send its leaders into exile. Hamas says it won't release the remaining hostages without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. 

Here's the latest: 




At least nine Palestinians were killed Wednesday in two separate Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza, medics said.

One strike hit a group of Palestinians gathered outside a charity providing hot meals in the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least five people, including a woman and her adult daughter, were killed in the strike, according to the Awda hospital, which received the casualties.

A separate strike on a tent killed a father, mother and their daughter in the town of Zwaeida, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. The hospital said the explosion tore the man's body in half.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment.

In the town of Beit Lahiya, where a similar protest took place Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated Wednesday, with many chanting “the people want the fall of Hamas.” In the hard-hit Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted “Out, out out! Hamas get out!”

“Our children have been killed. Our houses have been destroyed,” said Abed Radwan, who said he joined the protest in Beit Lahiya “against the war, against Hamas, and the (Palestinian political) factions, against Israel and against the world's silence.”

“You too should demand the removal of Hamas from Gaza and the immediate release of all Israeli hostages. That is the only way to stop the war,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said Wednesday.

One Palestinian who protested on Tuesday told The Associated Press they regretted participating because of Israeli media coverage, which emphasized the opposition to Hamas. 

The protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they joined the demonstration in the heavily destroyed northern town of Jabaliya because “everyone failed us.”

They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the Western-backed Palestinian Authority and Arab mediators. They said there were no Hamas security forces at the protest but scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the group.

Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim, in a post on Facebook, wrote that people had the right to protest but that their focus should be on the “criminal aggressor,” Israel.

“The exploitation of these tragic human conditions is rejected and denounced, either to pass on dubious political agendas or to drop responsibility for the criminal aggressor, which is the occupation and its army,” he wrote.

The militant group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed the war.

The United Nations Population Fund said Israel's ongoing aid blockade into Gaza is creating a critical shortage of maternal health supplies. They include much needed drugs for pregnancy and to prevent deaths and complications during childbirth.

Since the beginning of the month, Israel has cut off the entry of all food and other goods into Gaza, and last week resumed bombardment as it tries to pressure Hamas to accept its demands to extend the January ceasefire. 

UNFPA said its supplies are languishing at the border, including more than 50 ultrasounds to monitor fetal health, nine incubators and 350 midwifery kits to help during deliveries, impacting more than 15,000 women.

The group said pregnant women and newborns in Gaza are facing higher than normal rates of complications, driven by widespread malnutrition, which is being compounded by the aid blockade. Since the blockade around 520 babies — one in five —have required advanced medical care that is increasingly scarce, it said.

Lawyers representing a Gaza hospital director detained in an Israeli raid late last year say an Israeli court has extended his detention for another six months.

Israeli troops detained Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya when they raided Kamal Adwan Hospital in December. He was held without access to a lawyer for 47 days and has not been charged, according to Al Mezan, a human rights group representing him in court.

Al Mezan said the Beersheba District Court issued the order extending his detention on Tuesday. It said prosecutors submitted secret evidence alleging he is a threat to Israeli security, allegations he denies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

Israel has raided hospitals in Gaza on several occasions during the 17-month war with Hamas, accusing the militant group of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and accuse Israel of recklessly endangering civilians.

An Israeli co-director of an Oscar-winning film about settler violence said the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences refused to publicly condemn the beating and detention of the Palestinian co-director by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the occupied West Bank.

Writing on X, Yuval Abraham, co-director of “No Other Land,” wrote that several members of the academy, which awards the Oscars, advocated in vain for the group to make a statement denouncing the attack on Hamdan Ballal. He said he was told that the academy would not denounce the attack because it involved other Palestinians.

“In other words, while Hamdan was clearly targeted for making No Other Land … he was also targeted for being Palestinian — like countless others every day who are disregarded. This, it seems, gave the Academy an excuse to remain silent when a filmmaker they honored, living under Israeli occupation, needed them the most,” wrote Abraham.

He noted that the European Academy had voiced solidarity with Ballal following the attack and said it was not too late for the American Academy to do the same. The military has denied that Ballal was beaten.

Palestinians chanted against Hamas during an anti-war protest in the Gaza Strip, according to videos circulating online. It was a rare show of public anger against the militant group, which has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory 17 months into the war with Israel.

The videos, which appeared to be authentic, showed hundreds of people taking part in an anti-war protest in the heavily destroyed northern town of Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. People held signs saying “Stop the war,” “We refuse to die,” and “The blood of our children is not cheap.” 

Some could be heard chanting: “Hamas out!” Other videos appeared to show Hamas supporters dispersing the crowds.

A similar protest occurred in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to witnesses.

The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of parts of Gaza City as it steps up its renewed offensive against Hamas.

The latest orders issued Wednesday apply to Zeitoun, Tel al-Hawa and other neighborhoods where Israeli forces have carried out previous operations during the 17-month war. The military said it will soon respond to rocket fire from the area and ordered residents to move south.

Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas last week when it launched a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians.

It has vowed to increase military pressure until Hamas returns the remaining 59 hostages it holds – 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel has also demanded that Hamas disarm and send its leaders into exile.

Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

The war was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Israel's retaliatory war has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says women and children make up over half the dead.

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The U.S. government used an 18th-century wartime law to deport more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants earlier this month to El Salvador, where they were immediately transferred to the country's maximum-security gang prison.

And while a federal judge in Washington tries to determine whether the U.S. government defied his order to return the migrants while they were in the air and insists that they must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged members of a notorious gang, there has been no word from El Salvador's president or judiciary about what the prisoners' legal status is in that country.

That may change soon. On Monday, lawyers hired by the Venezuelan government took legal action on behalf of the Venezuelan prisoners seeking their release from the prison, which U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is scheduled to visit Wednesday.

The U.S. says the Venezuelans deported on March 15 were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, a criminal organization that U.S. President Donald Trump declared an invading force, but has provided no evidence of their alleged membership. The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.

El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have any consular support from their government either.

Even Salvadoran citizens have been living under a state of emergency that has suspended fundamental rights since 2022 and the country's judiciary is not considered independent. All of which raises questions about the prisoners' legal future in El Salvador.




Very little.

President Nayib Bukele announced the day after their arrival that the United States had sent what he called “238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua” to El Salvador and they were immediately sent to its maximum security gang prison. The U.S. government would pay an annual fee for their incarceration, Bukele wrote in a post on X.

El Salvador's Attorney General's Office and Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights and Freedom of Expression did not respond to requests for comment about the legal status of the Venezuelan prisoners.

Lawyer David Morales, legal director for the nongovernmental organization Cristosal, said there was no legal basis for the Venezuelans' imprisonment in El Salvador. He said he knew of no Salvadoran law or international treaty that would support their imprisonment.

“They are illegal detentions because they haven't been submitted to the jurisdiction of a Salvadoran judge, nor have they been prosecuted or convicted in El Salvador,” he said. As such, their imprisonment here is “arbitrary.”

He said El Salvador's prosecutor's office for human rights would have the authority to intervene, because it has a broad mandate when it comes to prisoners, “but we already know that it's not playing its role because it is dominated, subjected to political power.”

Lawyers hired by the Venezuelan government filed a legal action Monday in El Salvador aimed at freeing the 238 Venezuelans deported by the United States.

Jaime Ortega, who says he represents 30 of the imprisoned Venezuelans, said his firm filed the habeas corpus petition with the Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber. He said that by extension they requested that it be applied to all Venezuelans detained in El Salvador.

Before it was filed, constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya had suggested human rights organizations and the prisoners' families should file habeas corpus petitions, essentially compelling the government to prove someone's detention was justified “as a mechanism to denounce (the situation) as well as to pressure” the government.

Still, Anaya said the lack of judicial independence in El Salvador made success unlikely. Bukele's party removed the justices of the Supreme Court's Constitutional chamber in 2021 and replaced them with judges seen as more amenable to the administration.

“Who is going to decide these people's freedom, U.S. judges, Salvadoran judges?” Anaya asked. The habeas corpus petitions could at least “show the illegitimacy of this vacuum.”

El Salvador has lived under a state of emergency since March 2022, when Congress granted Bukele extraordinary powers to fight the country's powerful street gangs.

Since then, some 84,000 people have been arrested, accused of gang ties. The state of emergency has allowed authorities to act without basic protections like access to a lawyer or telling detainees why they're being arrested. They can be held for 15 days without seeing a judge.

Homicides have plummeted in El Salvador and the improved security has fueled Bukele's popularity.

But while Bukele has said some 8,000 of those arrested have been freed for lack of evidence, many more have found no way out.

Last year, the Due Process Foundation published a report showing that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court had “systematically” rejected more than 6,000 habeas corpus petitions made by families of people arrested under the state of emergency.

HEBRON, West Bank (AP) — Only a few weeks ago, Hamdan Ballal stood on a stage in Los Angeles accepting an Oscar for the film “No Other Land,” a documentary depicting his West Bank village's struggle against Israel's occupation.



On Tuesday, Ballal – his face bruised and clothes still spotted with blood – recounted to The Associated Press how he was heavily beaten by an Israeli settler and soldiers the night before. The settler, he said, kicked his head “like a football” during a settler attack on his village.



The soldiers then detained him and two other Palestinians. Ballal said he was kept blindfolded for more than 20 hours, sitting on the floor under a blasting air conditioner. The soldiers kicked, punched or hit him with a stick whenever they came on their guard shifts, he said. Ballal doesn't speak Hebrew, but he said he heard them saying his name and the word “Oscar.”

“I realized they were attacking me specifically,” he said in an interview at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. “When they say ‘Oscar', you understand. When they say your name, you understand.”



The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the claims that Ballal was beaten by soldiers. The settler whom Ballal identified as his attacker, Shem Tov Luski — who has threatened Ballal in the past — denied he or the soldiers beat him and told the AP that he and other Palestinians in the village had thrown stones at his car. He said he didn't know Ballal was an Oscar winner.



The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks as well as one Israeli civilian, who was soon released. Ballal denied throwing stones.

The attack took place Monday night in the southern West Bank village of Susiya. It's part of the Masafer Yatta region featured in “No Other Land,” which depicts the Palestinian residents' attempts to fend off settler attacks and the military's plans to demolish their homes.



At around sunset, as residents were ending their daylong Ramadan fast, roughly two dozen Jewish settlers along with police entered the village, throwing stones at houses and breaking property, witnesses say. Around 30 soldiers arrived soon after. Jewish Israelis in an activist group supporting the villagers showed video of themselves also being attacked, with settlers hitting their car with sticks and stones.

Ballal said he filmed some of the damage caused by the settlers. Then he went to his own home and locked it, with his wife and three young children inside.



“I told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,” he said.



Ballal said Luski approached with two soldiers. He said Luski hit him on the head, knocked him to the ground and kept kicking and punching him in the head. At the same time, one soldier hit him on the legs with his gun butt, while the other pointed his weapon at him, he said.



Lamia Ballal, the director's wife, said she was huddling inside with their children and heard him screaming, “I'm dying!”

Luski told the AP that he and other settlers had come to the village to help a fellow settler who said he was being attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers. He said dozens of masked Palestinians attacked his car with stones, including Ballal. “He broke my window, threw a stone at my chest,” he said.



He said when soldiers arrived, he led them to Ballal's house to identify him as one of the attackers but denied that he hit him or that settlers attacked any property in the village. Luski said he had footage of the night's events but when asked to show it to the AP, he responded with a string of expletives.



On Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside Ballal's home, and the family car's windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.







Lea Tsemel, the attorney representing Ballal and the two other Palestinians detained with him, said they were taken to an army base, where they only received minimal care for their injuries from the attack. She said they had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.

Ballal said he had no idea where he was being held, could see nothing and was “freezing” from the hours spent blindfolded under the air conditioner.



The three were transferred to an Israeli police station at the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and were released Tuesday afternoon.



“All my body is pain,” he told the AP immediately after his release as he walked, limping, toward a hospital in the nearby Palestinian city of Hebron. 



Doctors at the hospital said Ballal had bruises and scratches all over his body, abrasions under his eye and a cut on his chin but no internal injuries. The two other detained Palestinians also had minor injuries.











In a widely circulated video from August, Luski and several other masked settlers are seen arguing with Ballal. Luski shouts profanity at him and tries to provoke him into a fight. 



“This is my land, I was given it by God,” Luski says. “Next time it won't be nice.” He taunts Ballal with the prospect of being sent to Sde Teiman, a notorious military prison holding Palestinians detained from Gaza, where five soldiers have been charged with raping a detainee with a knife. 



“Rape for a higher cause,” he says in Hebrew, then blows Ballal a kiss.



The film “No Other Land,” a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.

Settlers have also set up outposts around the area and at times destroy Palestinian property. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually turn a blind eye or intervene on behalf of the settlers.



The film has drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened it.



Basel Adra, another of the film's co-directors and a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there's been a massive upswing in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.

“We're living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank,” he said. “Nobody's stopping this.”



Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state.



Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.



The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. 



The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

A spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Tuesday that the outcome of his country's talks with the U.S. in Riyadh “has been reported in the capitals” and is currently being “analyzed” by Moscow and Washington. Dmitry Peskov also said the Kremlin has no plans to release any details of what was discussed to the public.

Russia carried out overnight drone strikes in several regions of Ukraine, local authorities said Tuesday. The Kyiv region was targeted in the early hours of the day, with firefighters battling to put out a fire at a warehouse, the State Emergency Service said. No casualties were reported. In the eastern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, Russian strikes destroyed several buildings and vehicles, according to the State Emergency Service.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States said Tuesday that it had reached a tentative agreement for Ukraine and Russia to stop fighting and ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea in separate talks with both sides, but many details were unresolved, and the Kremlin made the deal conditional on lifting some Western sanctions.



The announcement was made as the U.S. wrapped up three days of talks with Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia on prospective steps toward a limited ceasefire.



While a comprehensive peace deal still looked distant, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the talks as the early “right steps” toward a peaceful settlement of the 3-year-old war.

“These are the first steps — not the very first but initial ones — with this presidential administration toward completely ending the war and the possibility of a full ceasefire, as well as steps toward a sustainable and fair peace agreement,” he said at a news conference.



U.S. experts met separately with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, and the White House said in separate statements after the talks that the sides “agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”



Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey but halted by Russia the next year.






“We are making a lot of progress,” U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday at the White House. “So that's all I can report.”



When Moscow withdrew from the shipping deal in 2023, it complained that a parallel agreement promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertilizer had not been honored. It said restrictions on shipping and insurance hampered its agricultural trade. Kyiv accused Moscow of violating the deal by delaying the vessels' inspections.



After Russia suspended its part of the deal, it regularly attacked Ukraine's southern ports and grain storage sites.



Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in televised comments Tuesday that Moscow is now open to the revival of the Black Sea shipping deal but warned that Russian interests must be protected.



In an apparent reference to Moscow's demands, the White House said the U.S. “will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Ukraine regions have again come under overnight Russian attack.

Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's envoy for investment and economic cooperation, hailed the results of the talks as a “major shift toward peace, enhanced global food security and essential grain supplies for over 100 million additional people.”



Trump “is making another global breakthrough by effective dialogue and problem-solving,” he said on X.



But the Kremlin warned in a statement that the Black Sea deal could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial organizations involved in food and fertilizer trade are lifted and their access to the SWIFT system of international payments is ensured.

The agreement is also conditional on lifting sanctions against Russian food and fertilizer exporters and ships carrying Russian food exports, and removing restrictions on exports of agricultural equipment to Russia, the Kremlin said.



The deal emphasized that inspections of commercial ships would be necessary to ensure they aren't used for military purposes.



Zelenskyy bristled at Russia's demand for lifting sanctions, saying that doing so “would weaken our position.”



Still, Trump indicated that the U.S. was considering the Kremlin's conditions: “We're thinking about all of them right now.”



In an interview Tuesday with Newsmax, Trump considered the possibility that Putin could be stalling on ending the war.



“I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they're dragging their feet,” said Trump, comparing the negotiation to his own experience in real estate. “I've done it over the years. I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game, but maybe I don't want to do it.”



A senior official in the Ukrainian government, who is directly familiar with the talks and spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, said the Kyiv delegation does not agree to lifting sanctions as a condition for a maritime ceasefire and that Russia has done nothing to have sanctions rolled back. The official also said European countries are not involved in the sanctions discussions, despite sanctions being within the European Union's responsibility.



Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov warned that Kyiv would see the deployment of Russian warships in the western Black Sea as a “violation of the commitment to ensure safe navigation” there and “a threat to the national security of Ukraine.”



“In this case, Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defense,” he said.











The White House also said the parties agreed to develop measures for implementing an agreement reached in Trump's calls with Zelenskyy and Putin to ban strikes against energy facilities in Russia and Ukraine.



The talks in Riyadh, which did not include direct Russian-Ukrainian contacts, were part of an attempt to work out details on a partial pause in the fighting in Ukraine, which began with Moscow's invasion in 2022. It has been a struggle to reach even a limited, 30-day ceasefire, which both sides agreed to in principle last week, even while continuing to attack each other with drones and missiles.



After the Trump-Putin call last week, the White House said the partial ceasefire would include ending attacks on “energy and infrastructure,” while the Kremlin emphasized that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Tuesday's White House statement reverted to the wording used by Russia.



The Kremlin, which has accused Ukraine of breaching the agreement to stop strikes on energy infrastructure, on Tuesday published a list of energy facilities subject to a 30-day halt on strikes that began on March 18. It warned that each party was free to opt out of the deal in case of violations by the other side.



Zelenskyy noted that significant uncertainties remain.



“I think there will be a million questions and details,” he said, adding that the responsibility for potential violations also remains unclear.

He emphasized that Ukraine is open to a full, 30-day ceasefire that Trump has proposed, reaffirming that Kyiv is “ready to quickly move toward an unconditional ceasefire.”



Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilization — demands rejected by Ukraine and its Western allies.



The U.S. noted its commitment to helping achieve the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.



In other developments, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that Moscow would not agree to surrender control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, that Russia captured in the opening days of the invasion.



Trump suggested that Zelenskyy consider transferring ownership of Ukraine's power plants to the U.S. for long-term security, while the Ukrainian leader said they specifically talked about the Zaporizhzhia plant in last week's call.







The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine had “continued deliberate drone strikes against Russia's civilian energy facilities.”



One Ukrainian drone attack on Monday knocked down a high-voltage power line linking the Rostov nuclear power plant with the city of Tikhoretsk in the southern Krasnodar region, the ministry said, adding that another drone strike had occurred on the Svatovo gas distribution station in the Russia-occupied Ukrainian region of Luhansk.



Russian state media said six people, including three Russian journalists, died Monday after a Ukrainian missile strike in the Luhansk region.



In Ukraine, the number of people injured Monday in a Russian missile strike in the city of Sumy rose to 101, including 23 children, according to the Sumy regional administration.



The strike on Sumy, across the border from Russia's Kursk region that has been partially occupied by Ukraine since August, hit residential buildings and a school, which had to be evacuated.



Meanwhile, Russia launched a missile and 139 long-range drones into Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Those attacks affected seven regions of Ukraine and injured multiple people.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli authorities released a Palestinian director of the Oscar-winning documentary “ No Other Land,” a day after he was beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by soldiers. Hamdan Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny.

Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces in the West Bank usually turn a blind eye to settler attacks or intervene on the settlers' behalf. 

Israel's parliament passed a crucial state budget on Tuesday, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.

Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday, Palestinian medics said, including three children and their parents who were killed in their tent.

Hospitals have been flooded with at least 792 dead — including over 300 children — and 1,663 wounded in the week since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed heavy bombardments of Gaza. The Health Ministry's count does not distinguish between civilians and militants. 

Here's the latest:




Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani says his country will provide medical treatment for two Palestinian women for injuries and illnesses from the conflict in Gaza, and one of them has arrived in Tokyo.

Nakatani said Wednesday that one patient is being treated at the Self Defense Forces Central Hospital. Another patient is to arrive within days, he said. Both women were previously being treated in Egypt. Nakatani did not give further details about the patients, their conditions or their expected length of stay in Japan.

The treatments, Nakatani said, are part of Japan's efforts to address the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and followed a request from the World Health Organization.

“(The women) are supposed to return to their original places after treatment, and their visit is not meant for settling in Japan,” Nakatani said.

Geir Pedersen said Syria can return to violence and monopolies of power — or launch an inclusive transition, overcome conflict and realize the aspirations of its people.

He told the U.N. Security Council it “must not come to pass” that Syria backslides into conflict, fragmentation, and having its sovereignty routinely violated by external powers.

Pedersen said the other road, restoring sovereignty and regional security, “requires the right Syrian decisions,” but the country's interim Islamist-led authorities can't do it alone and need increased and continuing international support.

The U.N. special envoy, who will be returning to Damascus shortly, highlighted several priority areas for action and attention.

He asked whether the soon-to-be announced transitional government and transitional legislative council reflect Syria's diversity, and include both men and women?

Pedersen said developments on a new constitution, accountability for crimes committed over decades, security, foreign fighters and the economy must also be addressed.

The fresh Israeli evacuation orders affect as many as 120,000 people living in heavily damaged northern Gaza, and cover two hospitals and a one primary health care center, the United Nations humanitarian agency said Tuesday.

That's in addition to 120,000 people already displaced in the week since Israel restarted the war in Gaza, according to U.N. estimates.

Israel says it ordered civilians to evacuate late Monday because its forces need to advance into two areas where Palestinian militants recently fired rockets.

As stone-throwing Israeli settlers and armed soldiers approached his home, Hamdan Ballal could only think about his wife and three young kids inside.

“I told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday following a night in military detention.

Three weeks after winning the Oscar for best documentary, the Palestinian director was again pointing his camera at settlers who were attacking his village in the West Bank on Monday night. Soldiers aimed their guns at him and other residents.

“I can't do anything when someone is threatening your life with their gun. I just keep filming them and that's it,” he said, describing how one settler walked toward his front door flanked by armed Israelis in uniform.

The settler hit Ballal in the head, knocking him to the ground, and began kicking his head like “it was a football.” One of the soldiers used the butt of his gun to hit Ballal's leg, he alleges.

Bloodied and blindfolded, witnesses filmed Ballal being detained by soldiers and driven away in a military vehicle amid the gathering dusk. He says he was kept handcuffed and blindfolded underneath an air conditioner overnight, and soldiers would periodically hit, kick and beat him with sticks. He has no idea where he was held.

Asked if he felt specifically targeted, he said: “When they say ‘Oscar,' you understand. When they say your name, you understand.”

Mike Huckabee, facing a U.S. Senate hearing for his confirmation as President Donald Trump's ambassador to Israel, is facing close questioning from Democrats on his views on the potential for Israeli annexation of the West Bank, but he avoided giving direct answers.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, asked Huckabee whether he thought it would be wrong for a Jewish settler to push a Palestinian family off land they own in the West Bank.

Huckabee, a well-known evangelical Christian, stood by past statements that Israel has a “Biblical mandate” to the land. He also responded by saying he believed in the “law being followed” and “clarity,” but also that “purchasing the land” would be a “legitimate transaction.”

Huckabee also said that any Palestinians living in an annexed West Bank would have “security” and “opportunity,” but wouldn't answer Van Hollen's questions about whether they would have the same legal and political rights as Jewish people.

Four pro-Palestinian demonstrators interrupted the hearing in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday to decry Huckabee's ardent support for Israel. 

One blew a shofar, a ram's horn used for Jewish religious purposes, and another shouted, “I am a proud American Jew!” then “Let Palestinians live!”

Police quickly grabbed the protesters, but their shouts could still be momentarily heard in the Senate hallway.

Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and one-time Republican presidential hopeful, has taken stances on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that sharply contradict longstanding U.S. policy in the region.

He has spoken favorably in the past about Israel's right to annex the occupied West Bank and has long been opposed to the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian people. 

In an interview last year, he went even further, saying that he doesn't even believe in referring to the Arab descendants of people who lived in British-controlled Palestine as “Palestinians.”

An Oscar-winning Palestinian director and two others have been released by Israeli authorities, a day after he says he was badly beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.

Associated Press journalists on Tuesday spoke with Hamdan Ballal after he left the police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba where he was being held. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.

Ballal and other witnesses say he was attacked by Jewish settlers before being detained by the Israeli army Monday evening. The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a what it described as a violent confrontation.

Ballal is one of the other directors of “No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary. The film chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.

An Israeli strike Tuesday in southwestern Syria killed at least four people as Israeli troops occupying the area clashed with local residents, Syrian state media and a war monitor reported. 

Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said troops fired back at gunmen who attacked them, before launching a drone attack. 

Syrian state-run news agency SANA said several people were wounded, including a woman. The report said Israeli tanks in the southwestern village of Koayiah also fired several rounds. 

Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at seven. The observatory and a town resident told The Associated Press that clashes had erupted between Israeli troops and residents when the Israeli troops fired. 

Israel seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone inside Syria after Islamist insurgents toppled President Bashar Assad and seized power in December, with Israeli officials saying they will thwart any threats.

The lawyer for an Oscar-winning Palestinian director who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces says he will be released. 

Lea Tsemel, the attorney for Hamdan Ballal, said Tuesday that he and two other Palestinians spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could feel free to move toward a lasting ceasefire with Hamas since his political allies, who oppose ending the war, have little incentive to trigger new elections while their polling numbers are down, said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

But the vote doesn't mean Netanyahu will move in the direction to end the war, she said. She expected him to further his ultranationalist partners' agenda to keep them as loyal allies and galvanize the nationalist right ahead of any future vote.

“Netanyahu is always thinking about the next elections,” Talshir said. “His goal is to make sure the extreme right will be in his government now and in the future.”

Israel's parliament on Tuesday passed a state budget, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.

The budget vote was seen as a key test for Netanyahu's coalition, which is made up of ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties who had demanded and largely received hefty sums for their constituents in exchange for support for the funding package. By law, the government would fall and elections triggered if a budget weren't passed by March 31. 

With its passing, Netanyahu buys himself what's likely to be more than a year of political quiet that could see his government coast through to the end of its term in late 2026, a rare occurrence in Israel's fractious politics. It's a political win for Netanyahu, who faces mass protests over his decision to resume the war in Gaza while hostages still remain in Hamas' hands, and over his government's recent moves to fire top legal and security chiefs. 

Palestinian first responders say a nine-member ambulance crew is still missing days after being surrounded and targeted by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said the team was responding to airstrikes in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood of the southern city of Rafah when Israeli forces encircled the area early Sunday. It said Israel has refused access to the area since then. 

The military said troops had fired on ambulances and fire trucks that it said had raised suspicion by moving without prior coordination and without headlights or emergency signals. It said those inside were militants, without providing evidence.

The Israeli military says a well-known Palestinian journalist killed in a strike on the Gaza Strip was also a Hamas sniper. 

It shared what it said were internal Hamas documents purportedly showing that Hossam Shabat was a sniper in a Hamas battalion in northern Gaza and had received military training in 2019. The military said he had carried out attacks during the war, without providing evidence. 

Qatar-based Al Jazeera said Shabat, a freelance reporter, was covering the war for the satellite news network when he was killed in an Israeli strike on Monday. It said he had been wounded in an Israeli strike in November. 

Shabat, in his early 20s, was prolific on social media, sharing videos and other reports with more than 170,000 followers on the X platform.

Israel has banned Al Jazeera and accused several of its journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants. A number of them have been killed or wounded in Israeli strikes. The channel denies the accusations and says Israel is trying to silence journalists covering the war.

One of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary “ No Other Land ” was still missing on Tuesday after being beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by the Israeli military.

Attorney Lea Tsemel told The Associated Press she had no information on filmmaker Hamdan Ballal's whereabouts early Tuesday, around 12 hours after witnesses said he was attacked and detained in the occupied West Bank.

Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya late Monday, according to Tsemel, who is representing them. Police told her they're being held at a military base for medical treatment, and she said she hasn't been able to speak with them.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones.

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed.

The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.

Palestinian medics say Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday.

Nasser Hospital said it received four additional bodies from two other strikes in addition to the family of five.

In central Gaza, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said it received the bodies of six people who were killed in three separate strikes. Three others were killed in a strike on a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Al-Awda Hospital.

In Gaza City, an Israeli strike on a residential building killed 5 people, according to the Health Ministry's emergency service. Another 12 people were wounded, it said.

ISTANBUL (AP) — The head of Turkey's main opposition party visited jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on Tuesday after six nights of massive protests calling for his release.

Imamoglu, arrested on March 19 on corruption charges, is seen as the main challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 22-year rule. His arrest has been widely viewed as politically motivated and sparked demonstrations, some turning violent, across the country. The government insists Turkey's judiciary is independent and free of political influence.

Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Imamoglu's Republican People's Party, or CHP, held a two-hour meeting with Imamoglu at Silivri prison, west of Istanbul. Ozel told reporters that he was “ashamed on behalf of those who govern Turkey of the atmosphere I am in and the situation that Turkey is being put through.”

He described Imamoglu and two jailed CHP district mayors he also met as “three lions inside, standing tall, with their heads held high … proud of themselves, their families, their colleagues, not afraid.”

Ozel later spoke at what he said would be the last rally in front of Istanbul's City Hall, saying the party would appoint an acting mayor in Imamoglu's place in hopes of staving off a state-appointed replacement.

Ozel announced plans for a demonstration on Saturday at another location in Istanbul and warned the governor, a government appointee in charge of police, not to allow any violence at the final City Hall gathering.

“If you provoke this square tonight, if you use tear gas or attack, I will change our plan for the coming days. I will make a call for 500,000 people to (come to) the place that will disturb you the most,” he said.

Students across Turkey protested and occupied campuses on Tuesday after declaring a boycott of classes. In Istanbul, thousands gathered in a park before marching to Sisli district, where the elected mayor has been jailed and replaced with a government appointee.

Meanwhile, Turkish authorities have been cracking down on journalists as protests have grown.

The Media and Law Studies Association, a civil society group, said 11 journalists who were detained for covering banned protests in Istanbul were brought to the city's Caglayan Courthouse to answer charges of violating the law on meetings and demonstrations.

The journalists were among more than 200 people prosecutors have recommended for imprisonment pending trial, including left-wing activists rounded up at their homes in raids early Monday. By late Tuesday, 172 people, including seven journalists, had been jailed ahead of trial.

Among those sent to pretrial detention was 22-year-old student Berkay Gezgin, who as a boy coined the phrase “Everything will be great” when he met Imamoglu on the campaign trail in 2019. The slogan has endured as a central part of the mayor's political identity since.

Turkish media reported that U.S. citizen Michael Anthony Ganoe was deported for “inciting the public to hatred” during the protests.

The head of the CHP's Istanbul branch, Ozgur Celik, shared a letter he received from the prosecutor's office ordering the removal of Imamoglu's posters. He said he would not comply.

“You will see more of Mayor Ekrem on the balconies of houses, in squares, on the streets and on the walls,” Celik posted on X.

Demonstrations in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, as well as smaller cities and towns across Turkey, have been largely peaceful with protesters demanding Imamoglu's release and an end to democratic backsliding. Some turned violent, with officers deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters, some of whom have hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police.

The governors of Ankara and Izmir on Tuesday extended bans on demonstrations to April 1 and March 29, respectively. The ban in Istanbul currently ends on Thursday. 

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said early Tuesday that police had detained 43 “provocateurs” over what he said were “vile insults” hurled at Erdogan and his family at protests. Later he posted that 1,418 people had been detained since Wednesday last week, and 979 suspects were currently in custody. “No concessions will be made to those who attempt to terrorize the streets,” he wrote on X.

Ozel and Imamoglu's social media accounts posted condemnations of insults hurled at Erdogan's mother.

Addressing a Ramadan fast-breaking meal in Ankara, Erdogan called on people to “know their limits, maintain moderation and not to cross the line between seeking rights and insult and vandalism.”

He added: “Those who spread terror in the streets and want to turn this country into a fire have no destination. The path they take is a dead end.”

Imamoglu has been jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. He also faces prosecution on terror-related charges and has been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure.”

Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people have been jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul. A further 44 suspects in the case alleging widespread graft at Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality were released under judicial control.

The U.N. Human Rights Office condemned “widespread detentions” in Turkey. “All those detained for the legitimate exercise of their rights must be released immediately and unconditionally,” spokesperson Liz Throssell said in a statement.

Although Turkey is not due for another election until 2028, there is a reasonable possibility that Erdogan will call for an early vote in order to run for another term.

Imamoglu has been confirmed as the candidate for the CHP and has performed well in recent polls against Erdogan. He was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul alongside its predecessors for a quarter-century.

Security forces used a more subdued approach Tuesday to disperse anti-government protesters compared to earlier days.

Ozel, the leader of CHP, spoke at length near the Istanbul City Hall after threatening a larger demonstration if authorities used excessive force again.

Following his speech, officers said the road under the historic aqueduct where police and protesters held a standoff since the second day of the protests would reopen. Officers repeatedly asked protesters to leave.

Police advanced slowly on the group until it dispersed, with some physical altercations. A small crowd briefly sought refuge outside the City Hall.

Protesters chanted anti-government slogans, demanded Erdogan's resignation and staged a sit-in near the historic aqueduct.

One demonstrator, who declined to give his name due to fear of reprisals and detention by security forces, said protesters who threw stones at police did not belong there. He also called on Erdogan to resign.

Another protester, an 18-year-old who also withheld his name, said he was detained and then released after the Monday protests, “Even though we did not scuffle with the police, they came and sprayed us with pepper gas,” he said.

Footage of clashes on Monday circulated widely on social media, including of an officer spraying and yelling at fleeing demonstrators.

Protesters on Tuesday sought to remain peaceful, singling out and removing those who threw objects or shouted insults.

Small fights between protesters broke out after groups accused each other of needlessly provoking the police. One man was struck in the head by a group of protesters after being accused of throwing objects at police.

        The US vice-president will accompany his wife on a visit to the Arctic island, a trip Denmark's prime minister has previously said is not what 'Greenland wants or needs.'
    

US Vice President JD Vance announced on Tuesday he would join his wife, Usha, on an unsolicited trip to Greenland, but scaled back the visit amid criticism of the original trip. 

A delegation from Washington including JD and Usha Vance, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright were set to visit semi-autonomous Danish territory from Thursday until Sunday.

Usha Vance's office originally said she and one of her three children had planned to visit Greenland's historical sites and take part in a dog-sled race, but her husband suggested the trip would now be centred on a visit to the US Pituffik Space base on the northwest coast of the island. 

Waltz's name has since been omitted from the list of visitors after JD Vance announced he was attending. 

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Danish media it was ""positive that the Americans cancelled their visit to the Greenlandic society.”

“Instead, they will visit their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that,” he said.

The acting government of Greenland noted ""that the previously announced US delegation visit to Nuuk and Sisimiut has been cancelled by the US government.”

JD Vance framed the visit to the space base as necessary to check on the island's security. 

The vice-president said, ""a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland.""

“Speaking for President (Donald) Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world,” Vance concluded in an online video. 

The previously planned trip involving Usha Vance, Waltz and Wright, had been slammed by both Greenlandic and Danish politicians. 

On Tuesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the US was putting ""unacceptable pressure"" on the island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

""You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country,"" Frederiksen told Danish media. 

“It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs, or what Greenland wants,"" Frederikson concluded. 

Greenland's Prime Minister Múte B Egede, who will remain in his post until a new government is formed following fresh elections, called the visit ""highly aggressive"" earlier on Monday.  

Discontent around the visit grew sharper on Monday evening, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook that it had “not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.”

Both Egede and Frederikson have rejected Trump's repeated advances that the US could take control of the island. Copenhagen, which controls Greenland's foreign and defence policy, has recognised the island's right to independence at a time of its choosing.

Trump on Monday reiterated his desire to take over Greenland, using national security as a justification. He argued that the visit was about ""friendliness, not provocation"".

        Two UK brothers and a co-conspirator attempted to kill a convicted armed robber just weeks after stealing Ming Dynasty artefacts worth millions of Euros.
    

Three men in the UK have been found guilty of conspiracy to murder in the case of a cage fighter and career criminal who narrowly escaped death after being shot and injured in his own home in 2019.

The three men, Daniel Kelly and brothers Louis and Stewart Ahearne, were convicted at the Old Bailey in London two days ago after a trial that drew on evidence from the SIM card of an iPad recovered from the river Thames.

The three men had just weeks before staged a major art heist, looting several 14th-century Chinese artefacts worth more than €3m from the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva using an angle grinder, a sledgehammer and a crowbar.

The prosecution's case said that they carefully planned their attempt on the life of convicted armed robber Paul Allen a month later, monitoring him for weeks and attaching a tracking device to his car to follow his movements. He was eventually shot through a window at his home and seriously injured, but medics were able to save his life with emergency surgery. 

Allen had previously served time in jail for taking part in the most lucrative armed robbery in British history, a 2006 attack on a security facility in Kent that saw a manager and his family abducted and £54m (€64.5m) stolen by robbers wielding AK-47s.

The case against the three men for their attack on Allen drew on witness testimony, DNA left at the scene, and CCTV and car numberplate recognition data — as well as call data recovered from an iPad that had been thrown into the Thames just downstream of London's O2 arena.

After carefully retrieving the device's SIM card, police were able to establish that it had been connected to GPS devices found in the men's car. Investigators were also able to access an email account containing details of multiple Amazon purchases made in advance of the murder attempt, including the burner phones the men used to communicate.

Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Matt Webb, the lead officer in the investigation, said the men were likely to face lengthy custodial sentences.

“The court heard how the defendants, hardened organised criminals, acted together in a well-planned and orchestrated manner to shoot their victim. It is only for the intervention of police first responders and medical professionals that the victim wasn't killed,"" Webb said.

""This attack may look like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster but the reality is something quite different. This was horrific criminality."" 

""The court heard how this was a clear and defined attempt to take a man's life with those responsible making significant efforts to ensure this was successful,"" he concluded.

        Senior intelligence officials testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, a day after an explosive report in The Atlantic, with the CIA director denying that 'a huge mistake' had been made.
    

US President Donald Trump's top intelligence officials have claimed, under oath, that no classified information was shared in a Signal group chat that accidentally included a journalist and concerned strikes against Yemen.

Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee a day after the stunning revelation in The Atlantic, senior officials attempted to downplay the significance of what has been roundly condemned as a historic security failure. 

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, on Monday reported that he was added to a text thread, which discussed imminent strikes on Houthi militias in Yemen, after Michael Waltz sent him a connection request. 

While Goldberg initially did not believe the Signal chat to be genuine, he was subsequently shocked to watch as Houthi targets were indeed struck at the time that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had announced they would be to the group. 

Goldberg wrote that the discussion in the Signal chat ""included precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing,"" though he did not release information that could jeopardise US national security. 

Goldberg reported, without revealing their identity, that Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe shared the name of an active CIA agent via Signal. 

The National Security Council later confirmed the chat's veracity. 

Despite the jaw-dropping development, which has made front pages globally, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard claimed that no classified information had been shared in the group chat. 

Asked during the hearing whether the timing and location of upcoming military strikes had been shared in the group she said: ""I can attest to the fact that there were not classified or intelligence equities that were included in that chat group at any time.""

Gabbard's response drew incredulity from members of the committee, with Independent Senator Angus King of Maine saying, ""It's hard for me to believe that targets and timing and weapons would not have been classified.""

Senator Mark Warner, of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, also pushed back against Gabbard's claim, saying: ""If there was no classified material, share it with the committee. You can't have it both ways.""

Gabbard later refused to confirm whether she had accessed the Signal group chat from a personal or work phone.

Ratcliffe also attempted to downplay the significance of the mishap. While he acknowledged that he was in the chat, he described it as ""lawful,"" claiming that Signal was permitted as a workplace communication tool.

When pressed to admit that a ""huge mistake"" had been made, Ratcliffe denied it. Democrat Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia asked, ""Director Ratcliffe, this was a huge mistake, correct?"" Ratcliffe responded, ""No.""

Ossoff subsequently launched into a full-throated criticism, calling the incident ""an embarrassment … utterly unprofessional"" and stressing that there's been ""no apology"" or ""recognition of the gravity of this error."" 

""By the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain – and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content,"" he added.

        Rights groups accuse Hamas of violently suppressing dissent, quashing protests in the areas they control, while also jailing and torturing their critics.
    

Palestinians in Gaza have staged a rare public protest against Hamas, calling for the militant group to end the war and leave the Strip. 

Videos circulating online show hundreds of people marching in an anti-war protest in partially destroyed northern town of Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. 

While the protests began in northern Gaza, according to online users they sprang up elsewhere in Gaza as the day progressed, with demonstrations reportedly taking place as far south as Khan Younis by the evening.

In some videos, Hamas supporters can be seen attempting to break up the crowds. 

While some protesters called more generally for an end to the war with Israel, others openly blamed Hamas for starting the conflict and demanded the group leave Gaza. 

While Hamas won the most seats in the 2006 legislative election, it didn't win an outright majority of votes. Hamas was also opposed to a power-sharing agreement with Fatah, the political group which previously controlled Gaza, and seized power in 2007. 

Rights groups accuse Hamas of violently suppressing dissent, quashing protests in the areas it controls and jailing and torturing critics.

In Beit Lahiya, people held signs saying ""Stop the war"" and ""We refuse to die"" while others openly chanted ""Hamas out"".

""We are sick of the bombing, killing and displacement,"" said Ammar Hassan, who took part in the protest.

According to Hassan, the demonstration started as an anti-war rally with just a few dozen people but then swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.

""It's the only party we can affect,"" he said over the phone. ""Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but they can affect Hamas,"" he said.

""The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,"" said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father of three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined the demonstration.

""We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,"" he said.

A statement released by the Elders and Mukhtars of Beit Lahiya group expressed support for the protests against Israel's offensive and its blockade, but backed armed resistance. 

Local leaders said they rejected ""any attempt to exploit legitimate popular demands by a fifth column,"" in an apparent reference to opponents of Hamas.

The protests erupted a week after Israel ended the ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes, which killed hundreds of people. 

Earlier this month, Israel also halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's population of roughly two million people.

Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds, 24 of whom are believed to still be alive. 

Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile. 

Hamas' conditions for releasing the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners are a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza.

The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw Palestinian militants kill some 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and take 251 people hostage.  

Hamas claims only a handful of its top commanders knew about the attack before it happened.

Israel's bombardment and ground operations in its war on Hamas have caused vast destruction across Gaza and displaced around 90% of the Strip's population.

        More than 200 police officers searched 19 properties in a large-scale operation, with a related raid also conducted in Denmark. No arrests have been made so far.
    

German authorities carried out raids across six states on Wednesday targeting individuals suspected of involvement in Brigade N'Hamedu, a group accused of attempting to overthrow the government of Eritrea.

According to a statement from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, the group is considered a “domestic terrorist organisation” under German law, with 17 identified suspects believed to hold senior roles in its German branch, which has been active since at least 2022.

The prosecutor's office said the group is part of “an internationally-connected network that intends to topple the Eritrean government”. 

Brigade N'Hamedu has allegedly orchestrated violent clashes at Eritrean events in Germany, including Eritrea Festivals in Giessen on 20 August 2022 and 7–8 August 2023, as well as a seminar in Stuttgart in September 2023.

According to the statement, the suspects regard violence against German state institutions and police officers as “legitimate means”, particularly at gatherings supported by the Eritrean government. In these incidents, numerous officers were injured.

In total, 19 properties were searched across Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Rhineland-Palatinate. A parallel search was also conducted in Denmark. 

More than 200 officers from federal and state law enforcement were involved in the operation. No arrests have been reported yet.

The prosecutor's office also revealed that another alleged senior figure in Brigade N'Hamedu, active in both the Netherlands and Germany, was recently sentenced to several years in prison by a Dutch court for his role in clashes in The Hague on 17 February 2024.

Eritrea is widely regarded as one of the world's most repressive regimes. In recent years, people who fled the country have disrupted festivals organised by the Eritrean diaspora in Europe and North America. 

Some say these protests are aimed at the Eritrean government, while others claim the events may instead raise money to support it.

        Trump told local media that the lapse “turned out not to be a serious one,” and expressed his continued support for national security adviser Mike Waltz.
    

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday downplayed the texting of sensitive plans for a military strike against Yemen's Houthis this month to a group chat that included a journalist, calling it “the only glitch in two months” of his administration.

Trump's reaction to the development, which seemed to have caught him by surprise when a reporter first asked him on Monday, comes as Democratic lawmakers heaped criticism on his administration for handling highly sensitive information carelessly.

Trump told local media that the lapse “turned out not to be a serious one,” and expressed his continued support for national security adviser Mike Waltz.

“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,” he said. He also appeared to place blame on an unnamed Waltz aide for Goldberg being added to the chain. “It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there.”

According to a story published online by The Atlantic on Monday, Waltz seemed to have unintentionally included Jeffrey Goldberg, the magazine's editor-in-chief, in a chat that involved eighteen high administration officials talking about strike preparations against Houthi rebels.

The use of the messaging app Signal to discuss a sensitive operation has opened the administration to blistering criticism from Democratic lawmakers who expressed outrage at the White House's and senior administration officials' insistence that no classified information was shared. 

Senior US administration officials have struggled to explain why the publicly available app was used to discuss such a delicate matter.

Earlier on Tuesday, Waltz said he was not sure how Goldberg ended up on the chat. “This one in particular, I've never met, don't know, never communicated with,” Waltz said.

Later, in an interview with FOX News, the national security adviser admitted the mistake and took responsibility.

“We made a mistake. We're moving forward,” said Waltz, who added that he took “full responsibility” for the episode.

Before defeating Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, Trump called for the former secretary of state to be charged with a crime for discussing confidential material with her advisers using a private email server she set up. 

The matter was investigated, but the FBI ultimately recommended against charges. None were brought.

On Monday, Clinton was among Democrats this week to criticise Trump's administration officials' use of Signal.

“You have got to be kidding me,” she wrote in a post on X that spotlighted The Atlantic article, making sure to include a rolling eyes emoji.

A report at Al-Ain media in the UAE says that recent US strikes in Yemen have caused heavy losses among the Iranian-backed Houthis. The report says that “the US military has intensified its airstrikes on Houthi militia bases, facilities, and command centers in their main stronghold in Saada Governorate, northern Yemen.”Saada governorate is one of the largest governorates in Yemen and includes an area in northwest Yemen along the border with Saudi Arabia. The capital of the region is Saada city.

The prospects of a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan could unite some countries that are not usually on the same side of issues. This is because it appears that the US, Iran, Russia, Turkey, and basically everyone in the region would like to see a deal between Yerevan and Baku.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran welcomed the conclusion of a draft agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Iran's official news agency, reported Wednesday.Two weeks ago, the US State Department said: “The United States commends Armenia and Azerbaijan for concluding negotiations on a historic peace treaty. This is an opportunity for both countries to turn the page on a decades-old conflict in line with President [Donald] Trump's vision for a more peaceful world. Now is the time to commit to peace, sign and ratify the treaty, and usher in a new era of prosperity for the people of the South Caucasus.”  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Tuesday in Washington. Rubio requested “support for peace in Ukraine and the South Caucasus,” his office said.Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), Turkey's national public broadcaster, reported: “US Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the agreement on a peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan, underscoring the importance of lasting security and prosperity in the region, according to the State Department.” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signs the guestbook during his visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum in Jerusalem February 16, 2025. (credit: Jack Guez/Pool via Reuters)“The secretary welcomed the agreement on a peace treaty with Azerbaijan and underlined the importance of a lasting peace to break the cycle of regional conflict and bring security and prosperity to the South Caucasus,” TRT quoted State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce as saying after a phone call between Rubio and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Tuesday.Fidan had held talks in Washington about the peace deal, media outlets in Azerbaijan reported. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan had informed Russian President Vladimir Putin about the completion of talks on a peace treaty with Azerbaijan, Russian state media reported earlier this month.Pope Francis also welcomed the chance for peace between the countries, according to other reports.As Fidan was in Washington, Araghchi met with Pashinyan in Yerevan on Tuesday.

He said ties were now moving toward increased consolidation.”Iranian support for ArmeniaMeanwhile, Araghchi also discussed the importance of peace in the South Caucasus region and discussed Iran's role in the region.“Foreign Minister Araghchi said... the growing Iran-Armenia relationship had mutual benefits for both countries and guaranteed peace and stability in the region,” IRNA reported. “He emphasized that Iran and Armenia should, by taking advantage of their civilizational, cultural, and historical ties, as well as people-to-people relations, strive to promote relations and cooperation in all fields, especially in the economy, trade, tourism, transit, transportation, and energy fields. Araghchi also said that security and stability in the South Caucasus was of strategic value to Iran.” Araghchi also held a meeting with his Armenian counterpart, Ararat Mirzoyan.Iran has welcomed the potential deal with Baku.

He said ties were now moving toward increased consolidation.”Iranian support for ArmeniaMeanwhile, Araghchi also discussed the importance of peace in the South Caucasus region and discussed Iran's role in the region.“Foreign Minister Araghchi said... the growing Iran-Armenia relationship had mutual benefits for both countries and guaranteed peace and stability in the region,” IRNA reported. “He emphasized that Iran and Armenia should, by taking advantage of their civilizational, cultural, and historical ties, as well as people-to-people relations, strive to promote relations and cooperation in all fields, especially in the economy, trade, tourism, transit, transportation, and energy fields.

This could build confidence toward a larger ceasefire.

Israel stands on the precipice of a decisive victory over its adversaries. As the military campaign in Gaza resumes, Hamas finds itself with almost no options and even fewer allies. Its infrastructure is decimated and its argument that the war with Israel was over has been unraveled.Meanwhile, the Houthis are preoccupied with their own battles against US forces. Hezbollah finds itself deeply wounded and withdrawn from southern Lebanon and Syria and unable to help Hamas. Similarly, Iran is in no position to help or support Hamas at this time.Israel, undeterred, continues its operations in Gaza, while Hamas struggles to assert any meaningful control. This decisive shift is further reinforced by a looming geopolitical earthquake: the Saudi-Israel-US normalization deal.The Arab world is realigning, and Hamas – along with Iran and its proxies – can see the writing on the wall. Adding to this, in a stunning reversal, Cairo has agreed to allow up to half a million Palestinians to “temporarily” resettle in the Sinai.  This is more than just a policy shift. It is an admission that Gaza, as it once was, is no longer viable. This is no small concession.At the core of this shift is the simple fact that as long as Hamas refuses to surrender hostages and relinquish control, no meaningful reconstruction in Gaza can take place. Israel has shown no indication that it will cease military operations while Hamas has shown no willingness to de-arm, evacuate, or return all the hostages.Palestinian Hamas terrorists take part in an anti-Israel rally in Gaza City May 22, 2021 (credit: REUTERS/MOHAMMED SALEM)Meanwhile, reports indicate that Somaliland has agreed to take in Palestinian refugees, further eliminating the argument that Gaza cannot be emptied of its terrorist rulers. Slowly but surely, the pieces are falling into place for a long-term solution that neutralizes Hamas once and for all.With the newly appointed IDF chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, Israel is poised to complete its mission. Total victory is within reachParadoxically, the primary opposition to Israel's march toward victory comes from within the country itself. Elements of the Israeli Left, segments of the retired military establishment, and certain political factions continue to resist the full realization of this military and strategic objective.However, the return of 198 out of 250 hostages is a testament to the effectiveness of Israel's operations and its willingness to engage in “deals” with its barbaric enemies to secure its people.It is important for the whole society to recognize that the status quo of partial victories where reservists are required to return to the same positions every four to six years is untenable and is not fair to them or to Israeli society at large.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The broader strategic landscape only reinforces this total victory. The Trump administration's unflinching support for Israel – its direct action against the Houthis in Yemen, its maximum pressure campaign on Iran, and its willingness to “open the gates of hell” on Hamas – has provided Israel with a perfect window to complete what it started.It is no coincidence that Defense Minister Israel Katz has recently reiterated the message: If Hamas does not return every last hostage: “The gates of hell will open.”It is now clearer than ever that Hamas's October 7 attack was not just an act of terror – it was an act of desperation. Hamas saw normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia coming and recognized it as the final nail in the coffin of the so-called “Arab-Israeli conflict.” They understood what that meant for their prospects of realizing their dreams of destroying Israel; their brutal assault was a last-ditch effort akin to a Hail Mary pass in American football to stop it.As events continue to unfold, Israel's position continues to reveal itself. The world is witnessing the final unraveling of Hamas, the crumbling of Iran's regional proxies, and the emergence of a new Middle East order. Israel is winning decisively.The question that remains is whether Israeli society can realize this or will it allow for internal discord to squander what could be a defining victory. Israel is on the last leg of a long marathon and it needs to be patient to realize that the finish line is right around the corner.The writer is co-chair of a new organization leading the effort to combat antisemitism on social media. drosen@emissary4all.org

The Atlantic released screenshots of the private Signal chat in which top Trump administration officials shared plans to strike the Houthis in Yemen.In a Wednesday article published shortly before Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliff started their testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, the Atlantic posted screenshots of US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth providing extremely detailed updates for strikes on Houthi terrorists.   In the messages, Hegseth provided detailed information about when US forces would strike Houthi targets, as well as what planes and drones would be used.

I don't text him, he wasn't on my phone,"" he said in a Tuesday Fox News interview. Goldberg noted in a Wednesday article with Atlantic reporter Shane Harris that the messages occured ""31 minutes before the first US warplanes launched, and two hours and one minute before the beginning of a period in which a primary target, the Houthi 'Target Terrorist,' was expected to be killed by these American aircraft.""If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests — or someone merely indiscreet and with access to social media — the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds.

However, in light of Gabbard, Waltz, and Ratcliff's statements, the editorial board decided ""that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions.""Goldberg said in an interview with MSNBC that his publication did redact sensitive pieces of information in the follow-up article. “We did redact one piece of information because we felt, on our own, that we felt it was best to do.

The pressure the IDF will exert will be “more and more powerful,” and will include “seizing territory” and “doing other things” in Gaza if Hamas does not return Israeli hostages, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the Knesset plenum on Wednesday. The prime minister did not elaborate further.Netanyahu's comments came during a debate known as the “40 Signatures Debate,” which is the Israeli version of the British “Prime Minister's Questions”. The debate included a series of short speeches in the prime minister's presence, after which the prime minister and opposition leader gave concluding speeches.In his speech, Netanyahu repeated conspiracy theories about a “deep state.”  ""Democracy is not in danger; the bureaucracy is in danger, the deep state is in danger,” the prime minister said. “When I say 'bureaucracy,' I mean a small group of officials struggling to maintain the levers of power in the country.”“Democracy is, first and foremost, the rule of the people. It is not the rule of officials, not the rule of former leaders, and not the rule of media outlets. In a democracy, the people are sovereign, and they demand that their vote in the ballot box be reflected in policy. This does not mean the government has unlimited power. We do not have a tyrannical rule, but it is impossible to expect the government to have negligible power,” Netanyahu said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seen in the Knesset plenum, in Jerusalem, March 25, 2025 (credit: DANNY SHEMTOV/KNESSET SPOKESPERSON'S OFFICE)Opposition leader MK Yair Lapid dedicated his speech to attacking the 2025 national budget, which passed into law on Tuesday. Lapid said to Netanyahu, ""You carried out yesterday the greatest theft in the history of the country. You exploit the Israeli middle class, squeeze it, all for one purpose: to survive politically.""High levels of crime in the Arab sectorThe official topic of Wednesday's debate was the high levels of crime in the Arab sector, and opposition MKs blasted the prime minister for the high crime levels. Hadash-Ta'al chairman MK Ayman Odeh opened the discussion by presenting a series of statistics. Odeh, quoting the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel, said that since Netanyahu took office, there were 14 times more homicides in the Arab sector than the Jewish state.Until 2008, the ratio was 3:1. Just 14.8% of homicides in the Arab sector have been solved, compared to approximately 70% in the Jewish sector, and even those were “usually when the perpetrator turned himself in,” Odeh said.Odeh noted that the annual number of homicides had risen by 230% in five years, and 58 people have been killed since the beginning of 2025.  Arab citizens were 18% of the population but suffered 80% of violent crime.   Stay updated with the latest news!

Abbas did not provide proof of this claim. During the debate, families of hostages and victims of the October 7 held up signs saying, “If we have returned to October 6, return my child.”

For years, Viktor Frankl's books occupied a cherished spot on my shelf. I would often recommend Man's Search for Meaning to friends over coffee, explaining logotherapy's principles with the confidence of someone who understood suffering—at least intellectually. That illusion shattered on October 7, 2023.That morning, as sirens wailed across Israel, my 21-year-old son—a tank sergeant with an infectious laugh and dreams for the future, like so many young Israelis—was killed defending our southern border. In an instant, all my academic knowledge about grief crumbled. The theories I had taught in lecture halls suddenly felt hollow, written in a language I no longer recognized.“How could a concentration camp survivor speak about meaning?” I found myself wondering in the small hours, staring at photos of my smiling son, forever frozen at 21. “How can I, having buried my child, possibly find meaning in this unjust world?” These questions echoed not just in my home, but in hundreds of Israeli living rooms left with similar gaping wounds.  Returning to Frankl's work with new eyesAs we approach March 2025—marking 120 years since Frankl's birth—I find myself returning to his work with new eyes. The psychiatrist who survived Auschwitz after losing his parents, brother, and wife developed a therapeutic approach centered on finding meaning even in the most unbearable suffering. Today, his ideas pulse with renewed urgency through our wounded nation. Viktor Frankl 1972 (credit: PICRYL)Frankl's “tragic triad”—pain, guilt, and death—has shifted from academic concept to daily reality. The searing pain of absence. The whispered guilt: “Why him?” The disorienting presence of death that changes how others see you, speak to you—or avoid you altogether.A week after the funeral, I forced myself back to work. Through a chance encounter with Professor Tami Ronen in a university corridor, I found myself joining a logotherapy study group led by Professor Pninit Russo-Netzer. The synchronicity felt like my son's gentle nudge from somewhere beyond.Among Frankl's many insights from the camps, one feels especially prophetic now: prisoners who maintained a purpose—reuniting with loved ones, completing unfinished work—had markedly better chances of survival. The human spirit, he taught, can withstand almost anything if anchored to meaning.

That morning, as sirens wailed across Israel, my 21-year-old son—a tank sergeant with an infectious laugh and dreams for the future, like so many young Israelis—was killed defending our southern border. In an instant, all my academic knowledge about grief crumbled. The theories I had taught in lecture halls suddenly felt hollow, written in a language I no longer recognized.“How could a concentration camp survivor speak about meaning?” I found myself wondering in the small hours, staring at photos of my smiling son, forever frozen at 21. “How can I, having buried my child, possibly find meaning in this unjust world?” These questions echoed not just in my home, but in hundreds of Israeli living rooms left with similar gaping wounds.  Returning to Frankl's work with new eyesAs we approach March 2025—marking 120 years since Frankl's birth—I find myself returning to his work with new eyes. The psychiatrist who survived Auschwitz after losing his parents, brother, and wife developed a therapeutic approach centered on finding meaning even in the most unbearable suffering. Today, his ideas pulse with renewed urgency through our wounded nation. Viktor Frankl 1972 (credit: PICRYL)Frankl's “tragic triad”—pain, guilt, and death—has shifted from academic concept to daily reality. The searing pain of absence. The whispered guilt: “Why him?” The disorienting presence of death that changes how others see you, speak to you—or avoid you altogether.A week after the funeral, I forced myself back to work. Through a chance encounter with Professor Tami Ronen in a university corridor, I found myself joining a logotherapy study group led by Professor Pninit Russo-Netzer. The synchronicity felt like my son's gentle nudge from somewhere beyond.Among Frankl's many insights from the camps, one feels especially prophetic now: prisoners who maintained a purpose—reuniting with loved ones, completing unfinished work—had markedly better chances of survival.

The centerpiece exhibit at the Eretz Israel Museum (MUZA) is not by an Israeli or even a Jew. However, the art collection by Greek artist Vagelis Kyris blends contemporary photography, traditional embroidery, and MUZA's Jewish and local costumes to create the collection Thread and Light. The costumes in the collection fuse Jews in the Diaspora, Bedouin, Muslims, and Christians. Kyris's unique perspective shows the origins of the costumes and the identities of the people who once wore them, creating a united collection. This was methodically chosen during a time that marks the struggle over individual identity and the lack of social consensus over shared values. “[It's] a message to the people for peace, for love. That's why we don't only have Jewish costumes; we have some local costumes from Bedouin, from [Palestinians], and from everybody. People can live together in peace and love,” Kyris told The Jerusalem Post. The exhibit, in the museum's Jewish Culture and Folklore Pavilion, features costumes that date back to the 18th century and centers on Jewish culture around the world, such as Morocco, Iran, or the Netherlands. With 80 models of men and women, the photos match his iconic style of Renaissance and Baroque-inspired photography.Kyris is bold and dramatic throughout all of his pieces; within the artwork and outside in his photography, he uses the chiaroscuro technique that balances lights and darks.

The dark room is illuminated only by the small lights dangling over the heads of each model in the art piece, highlighting the texture of the embroidery. Eleftheria Deko, an Emmy winner in lighting and design, carefully selects the lights. The music is also carefully selected by Greek composer Dimitris Maronidis, who composed individual pieces for each concept. The tone set by the two is dark and dramatic, complementing and capturing the tone of the photography. Even with the support of Kyris's large team, it still took up to six months to complete a piece. The research aspect was only one part of the embroidery process, necessary to truly capture the traditional style of craft; the other was the time-consuming process to actually execute the embroidery. The support of other artists was needed to complete a piece.Embroidery to Kyris also represents the nature of a person as well as a garment's history, indicating the success of a country, its time, and the symbolic nature of the art. Kyris uses Greece under Ottoman rule as an example: though little art was made, garments that the average person made showed symbols and messages – an inconspicuous art.“It's not enough to be a good embroiderer. To do this work, it's not only the technique of embroidery. You have to understand and feel the pose, because we embroider on a pixel with highlights, with shadow, with everything,” said Kyris.“If someone is [embroidering] without the talent, to see where the right place to [embroider] is – it's a disaster.” Though Kyris is not Jewish, he developed a connection to Israel through friends who exposed him to conversations about Jewish life, culture, and religion. Coupled alongside this “treasure,” he calls MUZA's costume collection and the proximity of Greece and Israel his inspiration, which came naturally to him.“I feel that there is a connection between the Jewish people and Greek people because we have the same sea, the Mediterranean.” The exhibit opens on Friday, March 28. eretzmuseum.org.il


Kyris's unique perspective shows the origins of the costumes and the identities of the people who once wore them, creating a united collection. This was methodically chosen during a time that marks the struggle over individual identity and the lack of social consensus over shared values. “[It's] a message to the people for peace, for love. That's why we don't only have Jewish costumes; we have some local costumes from Bedouin, from [Palestinians], and from everybody. People can live together in peace and love,” Kyris told The Jerusalem Post. The exhibit, in the museum's Jewish Culture and Folklore Pavilion, features costumes that date back to the 18th century and centers on Jewish culture around the world, such as Morocco, Iran, or the Netherlands. With 80 models of men and women, the photos match his iconic style of Renaissance and Baroque-inspired photography.Kyris is bold and dramatic throughout all of his pieces; within the artwork and outside in his photography, he uses the chiaroscuro technique that balances lights and darks.

The United States has named China and India as the primary sources for “illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment”.

According to the Annual Threat Assessment report of the US Intelligence Community, fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are the most lethal drugs trafficked into the United States, causing more than 52,000 U.S. deaths in 12 months ending in October 2024. 

“This represents a nearly 33 percent decrease in synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths compared to the same reporting time frame the previous year, according to CDC provisional data, and may be because of the availability and accessibility of naloxone,” the report released by the Office of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stated.

“Nonstate groups are often enabled, both directly and indirectly, by state actors, such as China and India as sources of precursors and equipment for drug traffickers,” the report stated in its foreword.

On March 21, an India-based chemical manufacturing company and three of its high-level employees were charged in a federal court in Washington DC in a case related to illegally importing precursor chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl.

According to a PTI report, federal agents also arrested two of the top-ranking employees of Hyderabad-based Vasudha Pharma Chem Limited (VPC) in New York City.

Fentanyl is a potent opioid drug that is blamed for widespread drug addiction in the US. 

The Trump administration has initiated a crackdown on the illegal import of fentanyl and also linked it with tariff adjustments in the case of some countries.

According to an AP report, in his executive order on the first 10% tariff, Trump had accused China of subsidizing chemical companies to export fentanyl and related “precursor chemicals” and of providing a safe haven for Chinese criminal organisations that launder the revenues from the opioid trade.

The amount of fentanyl seized at the US-Mexico border fell dramatically since January to its lowest level since December 2021, Bloomberg quoted the new US Customs and Border Protection data.

Some 590 pounds of the deadly synthetic opioid were intercepted in February, down 40% on January's 990 pounds.

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order introducing stricter election rules in the United States, including requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration and ensuring all ballots are received by Election Day.

The order mentions that the US has failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protections” and, directs states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes.

It also warns that states failing to comply could face cuts to federal funding.

The order is expected to face legal challenges, as states have broad authority over election rules. It aligns with Trump's longstanding criticism of election processes, as he has frequently claimed rigging even before results are announced, news agency Associated Press reported.

Since the 2020 election, Trump has repeatedly challenged certain voting methods and claimed widespread fraud was to blame for his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.

Trump has repeatedly targeted mail voting, alleging it is insecure and prone to fraud, even as he has adjusted his stance due to its popularity among voters, including Republicans.

By requiring documentary proof of citizenship, the order signals that the president is not waiting for congressional Republicans to pass the long-anticipated Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which aims to introduce the same requirement.

Republicans argue the measure is necessary to restore public confidence in elections. Voting in federal elections by noncitizens is already illegal and can lead to felony charges and deportation.

Voting rights groups have raised concerns that the requirement could disenfranchise voters. A 2023 report by the Brennan Center for Justice and other organisations estimated that 9 percent of voting-age US citizens—about 21.3 million people—lack readily available proof of citizenship.

There are also worries that married women who have changed their names may face difficulties registering, as their birth certificates list their maiden names. Similar issues arose in recent town elections in New Hampshire, where a new state law requires proof of citizenship for voter registration.

Trump's order directs federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, and the State Department, to share federal data with election officials to help identify noncitizens on voter rolls.

It also instructs the attorney general to “prioritize enforcement of federal election integrity laws” in states that do not share information on suspected election crimes with the federal government.

The order seeks to ensure that votes are “cast and received” by Election Day and ties federal funding to state compliance. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico allow mailed ballots received after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Trump's directive is expected to face legal challenges, as the Constitution grants states authority over elections. While Congress has the power to regulate voting, such as through the Voting Rights Act, the Constitution gives states primary control over setting election “times, places, and manner.”

President Donald Trump, citing practices in countries like India and Brazil, where voter identification is linked to biometric databases, signed an executive order on Tuesday to overhaul the US election system.

The executive order states that despite pioneering self-government, the United States now “fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections” used by both developed and developing nations.

“India and Brazil, for example, are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the United States largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship,” the order reads.

The US President called for free and fair elections, emphasising the need to ensure votes are accurately counted and protected from fraud or illegal interference.

“Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic. The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,” the US President stated in the executive order.

Trump said that under the Constitution, state governments must safeguard American elections in compliance with federal laws that protect voting rights and guard against illegal voting, discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance.

He added that the United States has not adequately enforced federal election requirements, such as prohibiting states from counting ballots received after Election Day or allowing non-citizens to register to vote.

Voter citizenship verification: The order mandates that US citizens provide documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration. It also requires the recording of details such as the document type, issue date, and expiration when verifying citizenship.

State and federal coordination: States will now have access to federal databases to verify voter citizenship. The Department of Justice will assist in reviewing voter registration lists to ensure compliance with federal citizenship requirements.

Enforcement of non-citizen voting laws: The order stresses the need for strict enforcement of laws prohibiting non-citizens from registering or voting in federal elections. It calls for collaboration with state attorneys general to address unlawful voting by non-citizens.

Voter registration list maintenance: States are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date voter registration lists, in line with the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.

Support for state eligibility verification: States will gain access to federal databases, such as the Social Security Number Verification and Death Master File, to verify voter eligibility. The secretary of defence will also update the Federal Post Card Application to include proof of citizenship and state voting eligibility.

Election Assistance Commission reforms: States that fail to comply with federal election laws, including those requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, will lose federal funding. The order also mandates updates to the voluntary voting system guidelines to prevent fraud and mistakes in the voting process.

Prosecution of election crimes: The attorney general will prioritise action against election-related crimes such as fraudulent registration and voter fraud. States are encouraged to share information on suspected violations to aid enforcement.

Voting system security: The order prohibits non-citizens from participating in the administration of federal elections, including handling election equipment or ballots. It also calls for a review of the security of electronic voting systems, especially those connected to the internet, to prevent unauthorised access or malicious interference.

Election Day compliance: States must adhere to the federal Election Day deadline, preventing the counting of ballots received after this date. Compliance with this deadline will be a condition for receiving federal funding.

Preventing foreign interference: The order prioritises efforts to prevent foreign interference in US elections, including prohibiting foreign nationals from influencing elections through financial contributions or other means. The attorney general will take steps to enforce laws that restrict foreign influence.

An astrological event of substantial significance is taking place on the night of 29 March 2025, when Saturn enters the zodiac sign of Pisces. Saturn will stay in Pisces until June 3, 2027, after which it will temporarily move to Aries but return to Pisces on October 20, 2027. It will eventually leave Pisces on February 23, 2028. This two-and-a-half-year period holds utmost importance because it is a unique combination of trials and opportunities for growth and development.

In astrology, Saturn is the taskmaster among the planets, and very often, this planet teaches us the lessons of discipline, responsibility, and maturity. This planet's transit is about 29.5 years, impacting a single zodiac sign for around two and a half years on average. It acts as an instrument of transition, making us face reality, hammering out the foundations, and growing through the experiences it brings in.

As per Vedic astrology, Saturn's transition is considered to be one of the most intense phases of an individual's astrological experience, bringing along life-altering changes. This is the time when debts incurred over multiple lifetimes are redeemed, and learnings come through difficult life lessons. Saturn makes one introspective and analyses aspects of life. It asks the native to correct or set right what needs to be put in order and mature up where he or she may not have bothered initially.

The transit of Saturn in Pisces is a meaningful time, bringing an exciting combination of energies that could radically change our lives. Pisces is the ocean of intuition, dreams, and emotions running deep, and amalgamating this ethereal sign with that of Saturn, a planet typifying constraints, obligations, and harsh truths, makes for a truly profound transformation. The alignment happens every 29.5 years, thus promising to be a significant period of transformation, particularly intensifying with regard to how one manages one's innermost hopes and fears.

Saturn plays the role of a hard-tasking teacher under this transit, bringing down the often nebulous and idealistic world of Pisces to a reality check. Our dreams and ideals are tested against the harshest truths of reality. A fantasy meets the cold, hard ground, and we part ways, demanding to see some of our dreams transformed into practical realities and some determined unpractical fantasies. This reality check is important because it keeps our focus on realistic goals, thus encouraging a more practical approach to achieving dreams.

Saturn in Pisces also has an important spiritual lesson on discipline. However, there would be much more to integrating priors such as structured spiritual practices like meditation or yoga into everyday lives, thus, in effect, stabilising the internal world for resilience against the mounting chaos of external life. These might help us provide balance against the extremely variable Pisces with the thrown Saturn energy.

Another crucial lesson that this transit teaches is boundary setting in all spheres, as well as personal and emotional boundaries. Those ceaseless extremes of Pisces's energies often lead to an individual bearing more emotional burdens than he should willingly carry, both from love relationships and the compassion that continues to thrive in other people's experiences. With Saturn, we learn the necessity of creating boundaries to affirm one's energy and emotional safety. It teaches us that saying no or stepping back is not just fair but quite essential for health and sanity maintenance.

Saturn's transit through Pisces in 2025 will mark an extremely significant time for different zodiac signs, each one experiencing its own changes and challenges. This interstellar shift will cause deep changes in these signs, thus segregating them into those experiencing a time of transformation and change and those who are opening their lives to welcome new energy.

Aquarius: The concluding stage of Sadhe-Sati symbolises an important moment for those born under the Aquarius sign. The last phase, worthy of relief and achievement, comes to an end because the lingering energy has already tried the very existence and patience of an Aquarian. What was learned as a lesson during this trying period will now begin to be acknowledged as wisdom. This acquired wisdom will help Aquarians to use their resilient selves for better opportunities in the coming phases.

Pisces: Here in Sadhe, Sati reaches its peak for all born with their Moon in Pisces. Saturn, from this position, represents the deep waters of Sadhe Sati for these souls. A critical opportunity for introspection and personal development, the Pisceans are meant to consciously deal with their reality and reassess their ambitions by letting go of anything that stands in the way of their greater purposes. Thus, this phase will bring with it the challenge of emotional depths, therefore testing their abilities to rebound and reinforce their emotional boundaries.

Aries: The commencement of Sadhe-Sati for Aries sets the focus on long-range planning and reassessing life objectives. During this phase, Aries people will start pondering deeper questions relating to life, career paths, relationships, and personal projections. This phase of existence will weigh heavily on their generally free spirit as Saturn announces the need for structure and foresight, creating the stage for outstanding personal evolution.

Sagittarius: Saturn will be coming in the fourth house for Sagittarians, which will bring changes in the areas relating to home or safety. Such movements could inspire them to create a more stable emotional environment and rethink what security means to them. Now is the time to fortify foundations literally and figuratively, including moving or redesigning their living spaces.

Leo: This year, Leos celebrate the beginning of Ashtam Shani. It will concentrate on the professional and the health sectors. Their leadership skills and endurance against career challenges will be tested during this time. Illness may open the opportunity to be reminded of how to balance ambition with the needs of the body. Adjustments in work or in one's behaviour will have to be made.

Capricorn: With the completion of Sadhe Sati, Capricorns would enjoy great relief in burdens. A time that is fresh with opportunities to achieve and progress marks the end of hard lessons and tough trials. Freed from the constraining energy of Saturn, Capricorns have now advanced with more wisdom and understanding in preparation to tackle new challenges with renewed vigour.

Scorpios: Just when their Saturn dhaiya comes to an end in life, for Scorpios, it marks the end of an intense trial of their strength and patience. This marks the beginning of a new phase with increased freedom of emotion and profession. Scorpios broaden their horizons, shrugging off the heavy Saturn burdens over their shoulders and feeling less suffocated from then on.

Cancer: For Cancerians, the phase of Ashtam Shani will be over. This phase has perhaps lent some emotional and professional pressures in their lives. The draining energies toward the end of this period signal freedom from such severe pressures and open options for new roads to travel. Cancerians will have a time for recovery and a time for rebuilding since they can now strengthen their careers and personal lives.

Different signs will view all these transits from different angles, but it will be significant for everyone involved as they will mark some changes to be borne in the future. The transformations and new beginnings heralded by Saturn's passage into Pisces promise growth, learning, and, ultimately, a deeper understanding of themselves and the world in which they live.

A new U.S. missile system deployed in the Philippines puts key Chinese military and commercial hubs within striking distance and hands President Trump an early test of his commitment to deterring Chinese aggression against American allies in Asia.

 Last year, the U.S. Army moved the Typhon Missile System, which can fire missiles as far as 1,200 miles, to a base on Luzon Island in the northern Philippines. It is the first time since the Cold War that the U.S. military has deployed a land-based launching system with such a long range outside its borders.  The Typhon, military experts say, is part of a broader strategic repositioning by the American military as it seeks to counter Beijing's huge buildup of intermediate- and long-range missiles in the Pacific. In the event of a conflict with China, land-based missile systems such as the Typhon could be central to defending key U.S. allies such as the Philippines, which has clashed with China over Beijing's claims to nearly all of the South China Sea, and Taiwan, which Beijing has threatened to take, by force if necessary. The Chinese government has responded to the Typhon's deployment with alarm, rebuking the U.S. and the Philippines for fueling what it called an arms race. Now, the Typhon, which was moved to the Philippines during the Biden administration, has emerged as an important litmus test amid concerns among American allies over the Trump administration's willingness to come to their defense in a conflict with China. A visit to the Philippines and Japan by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week could provide more clarity on the administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. The Typhon can fire two types of missiles. Tomahawk missiles bearing conventional warheads have a range of around 1,200 miles, putting into reach much of southeastern China along with the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. In the case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, such missiles could target air-defense and radar systems on the Chinese coast as well as the Chinese military's control-and-command centers in Guangzhou and Nanjing. The shorter-range Standard Missile 6, or SM-6, could target Chinese or other enemy ships and aircraft, and intercept cruise missiles and ballistic missiles fired at U.S. interests. Army officials have said that it is the only missile in the U.S. arsenal capable of intercepting, at least in late flight, the hypersonic missiles that both China and Russia have been testing. Flashpoint with ChinaThe U.S. Army first moved two Typhon launchers, an operations center and support vehicles to Luzon Island for joint military exercises between the two countries a year ago. The Army, which first took delivery of the system in late 2022, said it wanted to test it in the hot and humid climate of the Indo-Pacific region. The Army later agreed to extend the deployment indefinitely. Since then, Philippine commanders have said they would like to buy the Typhon for their own military and the country's troops are now being trained on using the system. Despite the limited immediate military value of the deployment—a full Typhon battery has four launchers and it didn't come with any missiles—Beijing's reaction was forceful. An image provided by the U.S. Army shows a Typhon launcher firing an SM-6 missile in an exercise in New Mexico.China's Foreign Ministry demanded the Typhon's removal and threatened retaliatory action. “China will not sit idly by when its security interests are harmed or threatened,” the ministry said in February. Russia, a close ally of China, also denounced the move. Russian President Vladimir Putin likened the deployment to that of Pershing II missile launchers in West Germany in 1983, a step that Soviet leaders at the time interpreted as a preparation for a pre-emptive strike on the Soviet Union by the West. The Pershing II deployment prompted large protests in Europe and the U.S. and eventually led to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the Soviet Union. That treaty banned the possession, production and flight testing of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. But the INF treaty didn't include China, allowing Beijing to assemble an enormous arsenal of such missiles. In 2019, during Trump's first term, the U.S. pulled out of the treaty and the Army began preparations for a new intermediate-range missile system. Mounted in trailers on the back of trucks, the Typhon is relatively easy to move, including on military transport planes. Compared with ship-based missile launchers, land-based missile systems are harder to spot and take out early on in a conflict. In the future, the U.S. could deploy the Typhon in locations across the Indo-Pacific region or sell it to allies there. That would leave adversaries guessing from where they could be hit. “The U.S. is shifting away from a reliance on big centralized bases, towards a more dispersed resilient force posture,” said Shawn Rostker, a research analyst with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. A potential bargaining chipThe Typhon's deployment in the Philippines was a recognition of the increasingly strategic importance of the Philippines under the Biden administration. The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has expanded access to military bases for U.S. forces, and Philippine vessels and airplanes have pushed back against Chinese forces in the South China Sea, a thoroughfare for nearly one-third of global maritime trade. Other American allies in Asia, including Japan, have so far balked at hosting U.S. missiles capable of striking China, but are developing their own comparable capabilities. There have been some signs that the Trump administration also sees the Typhon as key to its strategy in the Indo-Pacific. “We proved the MRC's deterrent effect via a dynamic deployment in the Philippines and look forward to all future power projection opportunities!” Dan Driscoll, the new Army secretary, said in a post on X earlier this month, using the abbreviation for the army's technical name for the Typhon, Mid-Range Capability. Others, however, have warned that moving such powerful U.S. missile systems close to China risks a spiral of escalation and, perhaps by accident, a war between two nuclear superpowers. An image provided by the U.S. Army shows American and Philippine soldiers working on Typhon equipment in Luzon Island in the northern Philippines.“Just the presence of the system causes those escalation risks, and that's before you even consider what happens if you use the system in a conflict,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a libertarian-leaning Washington-based think tank that backs a more restrained U.S. foreign policy. Similar views have been espoused by some senior Trump appointees, including Andrew Byers, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, who has favored a less contentious relationship with Beijing. Before taking office, Byers suggested pulling U.S. assets out of the Philippines in return for China's coast guard running fewer patrols in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Marcos himself has said he would remove the Typhon system if China ceased its aggressions in the South China Sea. But in the wake of Trump's talks with Putin over Ukraine, there are also concerns in the Philippines that Typhon could become part of a deal between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Such a deal might sacrifice the interests of the smaller American ally, said Richard Heydarian, a lecturer in international studies at the University of the Philippines's Asian Center. “What the Philippines does with [the Typhon] and what the Trump administration will do about it,” he said, “determines how the game of deterrence will play out in the coming months and years.” Write to Gabriele Steinhauser at Gabriele.Steinhauser@wsj.com

“The U.S. is shifting away from a reliance on big centralized bases, towards a more dispersed resilient force posture,” said Shawn Rostker, a research analyst with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

The Typhon's deployment in the Philippines was a recognition of the increasingly strategic importance of the Philippines under the Biden administration. The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has expanded access to military bases for U.S. forces, and Philippine vessels and airplanes have pushed back against Chinese forces in the South China Sea, a thoroughfare for nearly one-third of global maritime trade.

Other American allies in Asia, including Japan, have so far balked at hosting U.S. missiles capable of striking China, but are developing their own comparable capabilities.

There have been some signs that the Trump administration also sees the Typhon as key to its strategy in the Indo-Pacific.

“We proved the MRC's deterrent effect via a dynamic deployment in the Philippines and look forward to all future power projection opportunities!” Dan Driscoll, the new Army secretary, said in a post on X earlier this month, using the abbreviation for the army's technical name for the Typhon, Mid-Range Capability.

Others, however, have warned that moving such powerful U.S. missile systems close to China risks a spiral of escalation and, perhaps by accident, a war between two nuclear superpowers.

“Just the presence of the system causes those escalation risks, and that's before you even consider what happens if you use the system in a conflict,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a libertarian-leaning Washington-based think tank that backs a more restrained U.S. foreign policy.

Similar views have been espoused by some senior Trump appointees, including Andrew Byers, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, who has favored a less contentious relationship with Beijing. Before taking office, Byers suggested pulling U.S. assets out of the Philippines in return for China's coast guard running fewer patrols in disputed areas of the South China Sea.

Marcos himself has said he would remove the Typhon system if China ceased its aggressions in the South China Sea.

But in the wake of Trump's talks with Putin over Ukraine, there are also concerns in the Philippines that Typhon could become part of a deal between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Such a deal might sacrifice the interests of the smaller American ally, said Richard Heydarian, a lecturer in international studies at the University of the Philippines's Asian Center.

“What the Philippines does with [the Typhon] and what the Trump administration will do about it,” he said, “determines how the game of deterrence will play out in the coming months and years.”

For 12 freezing hours, a pilot and two children clung to the wing of their crashed plane, half submerged in an icy Alaska lake, their survival uncertain until a good samaritan spotted the wreckage and set a rescue in motion.

While scrolling through Facebook on Sunday night, Terry Godes saw a post seeking help to find a missing plane. By Monday morning, he was at Tustumena Lake near the edge of a glacier when he spotted what he thought was wreckage.

“It kind of broke my heart to see that, but as I got closer down and lower, I could see that there are three people on top of the wing,” he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

He said a little prayer, then continued to approach and witnessed a miracle.

“They were alive and responsive and moving around,"" he said, adding they waved at him as he approached.

The Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser, carrying a pilot and two juvenile family members, went missing on Sunday while on a recreational sightseeing tour from Soldotna to Skilak Lake.

The Alaska National Guard rescued the three from the eastern edge of Tustumena Lake on Monday after Godes informed other pilots searching for the plane that he had located it.

Another pilot, Dale Eicher, heard Godes' radio call and, being closer to Skilak Lake with better cell reception, notified troopers and gave them the plane's coordinates.

“I wasn't sure if we would find them, especially because there was a cloud layer over quite a bit of the mountains so they could have very easily been in those clouds that we couldn't get to,” Eicher said.

But he said that finding them within an hour of starting the search and finding them alive “was very good news.”

The three were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, Alaska State Troopers said.

“They spent a long, cold, dark, and wet night out on top of a wing of an airplane that they weren't planning on,” Godes said.

He mentioned that many miracles were involved, from the plane not sinking to the survivors staying on the wing, and the fact that they survived the night in temperatures dropping into the 20s (subzero Celsius).

The plane was mostly submerged in the lake, with only the wing and the top of the rudder visible above the ice and water.

Located about 130 km southwest of Anchorage, the 24,200-hectare Tustumena Lake is known for its sudden, dangerous winds, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

Donald Trump brutally shut down CNN's Kaitlan Collins during a press briefing on Tuesday, March 25, when she attempted to question him about the “Signal” messaging incident that involved various top administration officials. Collins tried to pepper the president with a question during a meeting with ambassadors at the White House.

“Mr. President, you said that your national security learned a lesson after a reporter …,” Collins began.

However, before Collins could even finish her sentence, Trump replied sharply, “Excuse me, I didn't pick you.”

Trump then went on to point at a different reporter in the gallery, and said, “Go ahead.”

The Signal controversy surfaced after The Atlantic revealed that Jeffrey Goldberg, its editor-in-chief, added to a secret group chat by mistake where high-ranking Trump administration members had been discussing an upcoming military strike against Yemen's Houthi rebels. As the administration's handling of classified conversations was questioned following Goldberg's inclusion, Trump initially said he did not know about the incident. However, he later defended National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who was allegedly responsible for Goldberg's unexpected inclusion. Trump labelled the mistake as a “glitch.”

Collins, a frequent Trump nemesis, had clashed with the president just last month. During a press conference at the Oval Office in February, Collins asked Trump, “Do you trust President Putin?”

“I believe that — yeah,” Trump replied, adding, “I believe that he would like to see something happen. I trust him on the subject. I think he would like to see something happen. I think it could have happened a long time ago.”

Trump then called out Joe Biden, saying, “I think Biden — number one, it shouldn't have started, but it did, and now all those cities are knocked down, like demolition sites.”

“This should've been done by Biden years ago. This should've never been allowed to happen,” Trump added, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war. Taking a swipe at Collins, he then said, “I know he [Biden] is a friend of yours,” making the other reporters laugh.

Trump also criticised Collins' network, saying Biden is a “friend of CNN.” “That's why nobody watches CNN anymore. Because they have no credibility,” he added.

With the Donald Trump administration's heightened immigration policies, several Indian individuals on H-1B visas and Green Cards have quite surprisingly been deported or forced to go through detention procedures.

Now, a fresh wave of anxiety has swept through the Indian immigrant community in the US following Vice President JD Vance's comment: “A green card does not give an individual an indefinite right to stay in the United States.”

Immigration attorneys are now advising caution, especially for those planning to travel abroad. “The administration is taking the law in their own hands with blatant disregard to the judiciary of the nation,” New York City attorney Naresh Gehi told Newsweek.

However, the question is now: Can Trump's $5 million “gold card” be a breath of fresh air for Indians amid this green card and H-1B row? With over a million Indians stuck in employment-based green card backlogs—some waiting for over 50 years—this could be the key to the American dream.

Trump has proposed a new “gold card” that would replace the EB-5 investor program and offers green card privileges and a path to US citizenship for a $5 million fee.

Unlike the existing EB-5 investor visa, which requires a $800,000-$1.05 million investment in a business that creates at least 10 jobs, the gold card has no such requirements. It is essentially a golden ticket to residency.

Trump himself dismissed EB-5, calling it “full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud.”

For Indians who have spent decades waiting for a green card through employment-based categories, the gold card could be a faster option for them.

Now, with Trump's “gold card” affluent Indian business tycoons, startup founders, and tech executives could bypass traditional green card queues.

However, on the other font skilled workers on H-1B and EB-2/EB-3 visas who lack the financial means to pay $5 million will continue facing green card delays.

ALSO READ| Why are some Indian H-1B visa and Green Card holders being deported?

Yes—if they can afford the $5 million price tag. Trump lamented the gold card as a “road to citizenship for people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.”

“We'll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards,” the POTUS claimed, even floating the idea of issuing 10 million gold cards to help reduce the US deficit. Unlike EB-5, which had an annual cap, the gold card appears to have no actual limit.

That being said, the green card backlog is so vast that the vast majority of Indian professionals are stuck in it; there's nothing to make it easier.

Former Fox News primetime star Megyn Kelly is launching her own podcast network, MK Media. It is “a podcast network for video and audio shows from creators in the news and entertainment space,” according to megynkelly.com. The first few shows will be hosted by independent journalist Mark Halperin, columnist Maureen Callahan, and influencer and political commentator Link Lauren, and more are expected to follow.

“I'm thrilled to launch MK Media and to use our platform to help sane, reasonable, good-humored people build their own followings in this new media space,” Megyn Kelly said in a statement, according to the website. “I am a huge fan of Mark's, Maureen's and Link's and I know our audience will be as excited as I am to hear more from them.”

“We'll have additional announcements soon, as we expand beyond news and entertainment,"" Kelly further said.

Halperin, a veteran of ABC News and Bloomberg, is set to host Next Up, a news show. “America is filled with quality sandboxes; I can say without fear of contradiction that the Megyn Kelly sandbox is as good as it gets these days,” Halperin said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “I'd point out that I'm thrilled to play Dr. Phil to Megyn's Oprah, but that metaphor might be lost on some.”

Callahan, who previously wrote for Vanity Fair and the New York Post, will be hosting the entertainment and culture-focused show – The Nerve. “What an unexpected joy getting to know (and love) Megyn Kelly. But for her to give me my own show, on her new network, is beyond anything I could have anticipated,” Callahan said. “I can't wait to get going over on The Nerve, digging into pop culture, celebrity scandals, and all the stories that captivate, aggravate and fascinate.”

Lauren, who previously worked as a communications adviser to the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will be hosting the news-focused show – Spot On. “Megyn is a powerhouse whose work ethic and journalism inspire me,” Lauren added. “This venture is a win not only for me, but for my existing audience and those who've been dismissed by the mainstream media. My goal is to always deliver the news in a way that's fact-based and entertaining — that's what you'll get from Spot On and I can't wait to hit the ground running to make this show a success.”

Steve Krakauer, executive producer of The Megyn Kelly Show and AM Update, will be responsible for overseeing the MK Media shows.

President Donald Trump appeared to forget Usha Vance's name while talking about her controversial trip to Greenland. The upcoming trip will see Usha and US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, visit the territory on March 27. The decision has made Greenlanders angry, with many calling it a “demonstration of power.”

Speaking to the press at the White House, Trump praised Usha, Vice President JD Vance's wife, but seemed to forget the second lady's name. The President paused for a second and then referred to Usha as ""the wife of our great Vice President."" Before appearing to forget Usha's name, Trump claimed he has ""great respect for her.”

Trump then went on to talk about the work Usha has been doing since Vance was sworn in as the Vice President of the US. Trump called her a ""very brilliant woman"" and a ""very nice woman,” adding that ""she loves the concept of Greenland.""

“I thought it would be a great… I have great respect for, er, the wife of our first… of our great Vice President. I think she's doing a… she's a brilliant woman. She's, er, a very nice woman and she loves the concept of Greenland,” Trump said.

Were Usha Vance and Mike Waltz ‘invited' to Greenland?Trump told reporters that Usha and Mike have been “invited” to the country. However, Greenland's government strongly dismissed the claim in a social media post. “Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,” the government said. Usha's tour comes after Trump's repeated comments about the US wanting to take ownership of Greenland, which is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. Although Trump claimed Usha and Mike's trip is one of “friendship”, Greenland's Prime Minister did not agree. “So they're going there and that's purely friendship … People from Greenland are asking us to go. We have many, many requests from many, many people – some officials, too,” Trump reportedly said. However, Greenland's PM Múte B. Egede told local media, “We are now at a level where it can in no way be characterised as a harmless visit from a politician's wife. What is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us.”

Veteran quarterback Russell Wilson has officially joined the New York Giants, and that in essence, rules out the possibility of Aaron Rodgers joining the club. The Giants now have Wilson, Jameis Winston and Tommy DeVito leading the quarterback group, the Giants appear to be set at the position.

Since the Minnesota Vikings also did not try to lure Rodgers, the Pittsburgh Steelers are the last chance for the 41-year-old quarterback.

Pittsburgh's current starter, Mason Rudolph, has yet to solidify himself as a franchise quarterback, making Rodgers a highly intriguing option for the team looking to strengthen its offence.

With that, the Steelers have a prime position to sign the 41-year-old veteran who'd make for a sound addition to an offence that this offseason traded D.K. Metcalf for.

The AFC North is shaping up to be one of the most competitive divisions in the league. The Baltimore Ravens remain a strong force with Lamar Jackson at the helm, while the Cincinnati Bengals have successfully retained their core players. 

That said, the players the Cleveland Browns would select with their second overall pick in the upcoming NFL Draft are also up for debate, with rumours circulating that the team will select Shedeur Sanders with the pick.

It makes Rodgers joining the division power fold interesting in itself, though, because any one of the teams has a puncher's chance of making the playoffs if things go right, except maybe the Browns.

That would be the final piece the Steelers would need to make a serious playoff push, and securing Rodgers would be like opening a treasure chest of cash. Not only does a Rodgers-caliber quarterback already enhance the team's formidable defence, but he could well propel the team to new heights for their offence.

However, there is a downside because the longer Rodgers waits before making a decision, the more leverage he possesses. Having appeared desperate, Pittsburgh might be at a disadvantage should they drag a deal out.

The Trump administration has reportedly paused some green card applications. A US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told Newsweek that the pause on some so-called adjustment of status applications was made because of two executive orders signed by Donald Trump.

""This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk,"" National Immigrant Justice Center Director of Policy Azadeh Erfani told the outlet.

The pause could leave thousands of applicants with a longer wait time for permanent residency. The president has vowed to deport millions of illegal immigrants while he is in office. In fact, some advocates are afraid that individuals who do not have criminal records might also be included to boost numbers.

The possibilities have been worrying several people, including Indian immigrants. India happens to be the source of the largest number of migrants globally. Over 2.9 million Indian immigrants lived in the United States as of 2023, migrationpolicy.org. In the US, the Indian population has continuously and substantially grown since 1960. The greatest number of arrivals happened between 2000 and 2023, according to the website.

It is unclear which applications were affected, and how long the pause would last. However, it would be a vetting on top of a process for refugees and those who were granted asylum in the US.

“There's a certain amount of documentation you have to provide as a refugee as well as an asylee,” Laura Collins, director of the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute, told NBC News. “All of these people who are approved for resettlement or to remain in the United States, that's because the United States government already approved them to be here.”

Collins recalled that in the first Trump administration, USCIS ensured every blank on a form was correctly filled out. “So if you didn't have a middle name ... they would send your application back and say, ‘Well, you didn't fill in your middle name portion,'” Collins said, adding that USCIS might even check social media, “things they probably already vet, but asking for another set of eyes or a slightly longer look at it.”

At least 67,800 green card applications were filed by asylum seekers between October 2023 and September 2024. Almost 40,000 were submitted by refugees, who are permitted to apply after arriving in the country at least a year earlier. The average wait times for those applications to be decided on by the US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) were approximately 10 and 8 months respectively. However, decisions could be delayed even more because of the pause.

According to DHS, the action was a result of two of Trump's executive orders: ‘Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats' and ‘Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists.' The first one instructed DHS and other agencies to increase vetting and screening of people seeking legal status in the US, including people trying to get into the country and individuals already admitted from countries considered to be ""security risks.""

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, slammed the pause in an X post. He wrote, “DHS is suspending green card applications for people who are already living in the US with asylee or refugee status! These applications have insane wait times already, and Trump is freezing them solely to make it easier to deny the applications and deport them.”

The pause has also been criticised by National Immigrant Justice Center Director of Policy Azadeh Erfani as a “discriminatory animus against people who seek refuge.” Erfani told Newsweek, “USCIS already conducts extensive vetting of all individuals who apply for permanent resident status. Already, our clients wait over a year for USCIS to process their applications. This stop in processing will unfairly block people who have full eligibility to gain permanent status in the United States.""

The H-1B visa registration for Fiscal Year 2026 ended on March 24, 2025. If more are registered than the annual cap, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) releases a lottery and usually announces the results by early April.

The 90-day submission window for announcing full H-1B petitions beginning April 1, 2025, is available to selected applicants' employers who can file the petitions. Approved applicants can begin employment on or after October 1, 2025.

While accuracy and preparation aren't the first two words people think of when they hear the words ‘Form I-129 (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker), they are true.

ALSO READ| H-1B petition filing starts: When is the deadline? Here's a quick rundown

1. Go through the most recent Form I-129 requirements: USCIS policies and forms are subject to change, so always check the latest edition on the USCIS website. Using an outdated version can result in delays or rejections. 

Carefully review the eligibility criteria, required documents, and any recent updates specific to the H-1B category.

2. Labor Condition Application (LCA): For H-1B petitions, employers must secure a certified LCA from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) before filing Form I-129. 

The LCA ensures that hiring a foreign worker won't negatively impact U.S. workers' wages and conditions. It must include job details such as salary, duties, and work location and be filed electronically via the DOL's iCERT system.

3. Employer and employee information: Employers should collect all necessary details about their company and the foreign national employee. This includes the employer's business details, contact information, and proof of ability to pay the required wages. The employee's qualifications, work experience, and immigration history should also be compiled to ensure accurate filing.

4. File the Form I-129 VERY precisely: Minor errors in Form I-129 can lead to unnecessary processing delays or denials. Ensure all sections are correctly filled, including employer details, beneficiary information, job title, job duties, and salary. 

Double-check all entries before submission.

5. Prepare filing fees and correctly file the petition: USCIS requires multiple fees, including the I-129 filing fee, fraud prevention fee, and (for H-1B) the ACWIA fee. Employers can also opt for premium processing by paying an additional fee. Ensure all checks or money orders are payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and correctly included in the petition package.

Tiger Woods initially hoped to keep his relationship with Vanessa Trump private, but once news broke, he had no choice but to go public. Now, insiders close to the couple reveal exactly why he did so.

“He knew it would be a huge story when it came out,” an insider told Daily Mail. “And he didn't exactly love it. But obviously, Tiger dating a Trump is always going to make headlines, which is exactly what he wanted to avoid.”

The golf legend and President Donald Trump's former daughter-in-law kept their romance discreet for months—avoiding public places and keeping it a secret even from close friends. 

“He has never been one to really share things until he absolutely had to,” a former Woods employee told Daily Mail. “But once things are found out, he doesn't really have a choice.”

Earlier this month, Daily Mail reported the pair “have been seeing each other since just before Thanksgiving.” Woods and Vanessa's relationship became an open secret at the prestigious Benjamin School in Palm Beach, where both have children enrolled.

“Benjamin is like a small community,” the insider added. “And there's nothing that rich people like to do more than gossip about each other. Frankly, I'm surprised that it was secret for so long.”

Their romance was confirmed when Woods posted photos with Vanessa on his Instagram handle. “Love is in the air, and life is better with you by my side!” Woods wrote in the caption. “We look forward to our journey through life together. At this time, we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.”

Vanessa's former sister-in-law, Ivanka Trump, chimed in commenting, “So happy for you both,” alongside heart emojis. Vanessa's eldest daughter, Kai Trump, also liked the post, and touted about the golfer in a later YouTube video.

Vanessa, who divorced Donald Trump Jr. in 2018 after 13 years of marriage, has not had a relationship until now. Unlike previous controversies in Woods' personal life, this time, the news revolves around a fresh start rather than scandal.

“I know that Tiger didn't want to share the news,” the former employee concluded, “but now that he has, there has to be some relief. Now he can just go and live his life.”

President Donald Trump has signed a memorandum directing the declassification of FBI files connected to the investigation into his 2016 campaign's potential ties to Russia. According to White House staff secretary Will Scharf, the memorandum calls for the declassification of “all files related to Crossfire Hurricane investigation,” The Hill reported.

“We believe that it's long past time for the American people to have a full and complete understanding of what exactly is in those files,” Scharf said.

Meanwhile, Trump said while signing the memo, “This was total weaponization. It's a disgrace…but now you'll be able to see for yourselves.”

Back in July 2016, the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into whether members of Trump's campaign were coordinating with Russian officials. The probe eventually preceded the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.

For years, Trump and his allies have expressed their doubt on the legitimacy of the FBI's investigation into his campaign. They have argued that it was a politically motivated probe.

Ultimately, Mueller did not establish that Trump or his campaign members coordinated or conspired with Moscow in an attempt to affect the 2016 presidential election. However, he and his team did not reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice.

Trump has now said in a statement released by the White House, “I have determined that all of the materials referenced in the Presidential Memorandum of January 19, 2021 (Declassification of Certain Materials Related to the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane Investigation), are no longer classified.”

He added, “My decision to declassify the materials described above does not extend to materials that must be protected from disclosure pursuant to orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and does not require the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information or any other materials that must be protected from disclosure under applicable law.”

President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order seeking broad changes to elections in the US, including mandating voters to show proof that they are American citizens, counting only mail or absentee ballots received by Election Day and prohibiting non-US citizens from being able to donate in certain elections.

Citing India and some other countries as examples, Trump said the US now fails to enforce ""basic and necessary election protections"" employed by modern, developed and developing nations.

""India and Brazil are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the United States largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship,"" he said.

""Germany and Canada require paper ballots when tabulating votes, while the United States has a patchwork of methods that often lack basic chain-of-custody protections,"" he added.

Trump's order also stated that while countries like Denmark and Sweden ""sensibly"" limit mail-in voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count late-arriving votes regardless of the date of postmark, many American elections now feature mass voting by mail, with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after Election Day.

President Trump, who returned to power in January after defeating Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, said that ""free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic"".

""The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,"" he said.

President Trump, who has repeatedly questioned certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 US Presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, said the polls ""must be honest and worthy of the public trust"".

US citizenship proof

Donald Trump's order called for the federal voter registration form to be amended so that prospective voters must provide documentary proof of citizenship, such as a US passport or a birth certificate.

It also said states should turn over their voter lists and records of voter list maintenance to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Government Efficiency for review. It directed federal agencies to share data with states to help them identify noncitizens on their rolls.

The order said if states refuse to collaborate with federal law enforcement to prosecute election crimes, they could potentially lose out on federal grants.

Mail ballots by Election Day

The executive order required votes to be ""cast and received"" by Election Day and said federal funding should be conditional on state compliance with that deadline.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 18 US states along with Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, DC, will count ballots that are postmarked on or before Election Day, regardless of when they arrive.

Ballots can't rely on QR codes

The order instructed the Election Assistance Commission to amend its guidelines for voting systems to ""protect election integrity"". That would include guidance that voting systems should not rely on ballots that use barcodes or QR codes in the vote-counting process.

Trump instructed the commission to “take appropriate action to review and, if appropriate, re-certify voting systems” under those new standards within six months of the order.

Foreigners barred from making donations

Donald Trump's order also barred foreign nationals from contributing or donating in US elections.

""Foreign nationals and non-governmental organizations have taken advantage of loopholes in the law's interpretation, spending millions of dollars through conduit contributions and ballot-initiative-related expenditures. This type of foreign interference in our election process undermines the franchise and the right of American citizens to govern their Republic,"" he said.

Hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets in northern Gaza to take part in the largest anti-Hamas protest since the war with Israel began, calling for an end to the ongoing conflict and demanding that the group step down from power. The demonstrations took place in Beit Lahia in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where the crowd had gathered a week after the Israeli army resumed its intense bombing of Gaza after nearly two months of a truce.

Videos and photos shared on social media late on Tuesday showed hundreds of protestors, mostly male, chanted ""out, out, out, Hamas out"" and ""Hamas terrorists"" as they carried banners emblazoned with slogans including ""Stop the war"" and ""We want to live in peace"".

Media reports said that masked and armed Hamas militants, some carrying guns and others batons, forcibly dispersed the protesters, assaulting several of them in the process.

Protestors said they were mobilised after appeals to join the protest were circulated on the social media network Telegram.

""I don't know who organised the protest,"" a man named Mohammed told Agence France-Press. The demonstrator declined to give his last name for fear of reprisals.

 ""I took part to send a message on behalf of the people: Enough with the war,"" he said, adding that he had seen ""members of the Hamas security forces in civilian clothing breaking up the protest"".

Majdi, another protester who did not wish to give his full name, said the ""people are tired"".

""If Hamas leaving power in Gaza is the solution, why doesn't Hamas give up power to protect the people?"" he told AFP.

Separate footage from Jabalia refugee camps, in the western part of Gaza City, showed dozens of protestors burning tyres and calling for the war to end.

""We want to eat,"" they chanted.

As of Tuesday evening, Telegram messages from unknown sources were calling on people to reprise the demonstration in various parts of Gaza on Wednesday.

Hamas has been ruling Gaza since 2007, after it won the Palestinian elections a year prior and then violently ousted rivals. The group is yet to comment on the matter, but pro-Hamas supporters defended the group by downplaying the significance of the movement and accusing protestors of being traitors.

Criticism of the group has grown in Gaza since the war with Israel began, though Hamas still has fiercely loyal supporters in the territory, and the levels of discontent towards the group are difficult to gauge.

The last available survey was conducted in September by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR).

It estimated that 35 percent of Palestinians in Gaza said they supported Hamas, and 26 percent said they supported its rival Fatah, the party of Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas.

Israel regularly calls for Gazans to mobilise against the Islamist movement that has been in power in the territory since 2007.

Hamas rival Fatah's spokesman in Gaza, Monther al-Hayek, called on Hamas Saturday to ""step aside from governing"" to safeguard the ""existence"" of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Strip has been devastated by more than 17 months of war between Israel and Hamas, with the humanitarian situation again deteriorating after Israel blocked the passage of aid into the territory on March 2 in an attempt to force the militants to release Israeli hostages.

Since Israel resumed its military operations in Gaza, at least 792 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The war was sparked by the group's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.

Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 50,021 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

In a strongly-worded rebuttal, India said today that it is the US religious freedom body USCIRF that should be designated internationally as an ""entity of concern"" for its repeated ""pattern of biased and politically motivated assessments"" and ""misrepresentation"" of facts. 

New Delhi's statement came hours after the US body's annual religious freedom report claimed that minorities in India continue to face deteriorating treatment. The panel's report also called for imposing sanctions on India's external intelligence agency R&AW over its alleged involvement in the ""assassination"" plots against 'Khalistani' separatists and extremists overseas.

""We have seen the recently released 2025 Annual Report of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which once again continues its pattern of issuing biased and politically motivated assessments,"" India's Ministry of External Affairs said, raising concerns on the authenticity of the body over such ""agenda-based"" claims.

Indirectly calling the panel's report fake, India questioned if at all the USCIRF is even genuine in its work and concerns on religious freedom.

""The USCIRF's persistent attempts to misrepresent isolated incidents and cast aspersions on India's vibrant multicultural society reflect a deliberate agenda rather than a genuine concern for religious freedom,"" the foreign ministry said.

Saying that the US religious freedom body is far from reality, New Delhi said it does not even expect the panel to engage with the truth. ""India is home to 1.4 billion people who are adherents to all religions known to mankind. However, we have no expectation that the USCIRF will engage with the reality of India's pluralistic framework or acknowledge the harmonious coexistence of its diverse communities,"" noted the foreign ministry.



Labeling the US religious freedom body as ""an entity of concern"", India said, ""Such efforts to undermine India's standing as a beacon of democracy and tolerance will not succeed. In fact, it is the USCIRF that should be designated as an entity of concern.""

Despite the US panel's recommendation, It is unlikely that the US government will sanction India's external intelligence agency R&AW or Research & Analysis Wing for its alleged involvement in plotting the killings of extremists and terrorists overseas. This is because the panel's views and recommendations are not binding on the government.

In its current report, the US panel has recommended that India be designated as a ""country of particular concern"" over alleged violations of religious freedom and ""impose targetted sanctions"" against R&AW. It also alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP ""propagated hateful rhetoric and disinformation against Muslims and other religious minorities"".

Melania Trump's custom wedding gown, designed by John Galliano for Christian Dior, is reportedly up for auction at a fraction of its original price. The dress, which the First Lady wore to marry Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida, 20 years ago, originally cost $100,000 and weighed 60 pounds, according to Page Six.

Now, an eBay seller named Svjabc1 has listed the gown with a starting bid of $45,000, claiming she purchased it for $70,000 to wear at her wedding in 2010.

The listing describes the dress as a ""Christian Dior wedding dress specifically designed by John Galliano for Melania Trump's wedding to Donald Trump. United States PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.""



A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump)





Photos shared by the seller include an image of Melania walking down the aisle with Trump in the original strapless ivory duchesse satin gown, which was famously featured on the February 2005 cover of Vogue, shot by Mario Testino. The dress was adorned with Swarovski crystals and took over 500 hours to complete, boasting a dramatic 13-foot train.

However, the gown up for sale looks noticeably different. The listing images reveal that the once-strapless bodice now features intricate foliage-inspired beading, added shoulder straps, and a satin waist sash.

The seller explained that alterations were made to accommodate her size. ""Because Melania Trump was a size 0-2, I had to have this dress made a little bigger as I was a size 4-6,"" she wrote. Additional satin layers, embroidery, and fabric were incorporated into the bodice and back of the dress to fit her proportions. However, she noted that the gown can be resized to its original fit by removing these alterations.

According to the listing, the gown has only been worn twice-once by Melania and once by the seller. It is described as being in ""good"" condition, though no certificate of authenticity is included.

As of now, the listing has attracted significant attention, with over 3,500 views in the last 24 hours on eBay.

After stirring the hornet's nest in Greenland, Donald Trump has now had to take a step back in US' approach to the semi-autonomous Danish territory. Amid widespread outrage over Washington's plan to ""buy"" the country, a high-level delegation led by Second Lady Usha Vance was to arrive in Greenland's capital Nuuk this week - that will now not happen.

Greenlanders have outrightly rejected Donald Trump's offer to ""buy"" their country. They have said they will ""never"" become a part of the United States. So outraged are they, that citizens of Greenland recently staged anti-American protests - the largest ever demonstrations in Greenland's history.

Similar protests were planned for the day Usha Vance was scheduled to arrive in the country.

Keeping the optics of the high-level visit and the anti-America sentiment in mind, the White House has completely changed the plan. It announced that instead of Second Lady Usha Vance, the delegation would now be headed by Vice President JD Vance himself, but the visit would be restricted only to the US Space and Military Base at Pituffik in northern Greenland.

The original plan was that Usha Vance would visit Greenland's capital Nuuk, before heading for the dog-sled race, a big annual sporting and cultural event. She would be accompanied by US National Security Adviser Mike Walts and US Energy Secretary Chris Wright - who would also visit the US military base besides these events. This plan now stands cancelled amid reports that Greenland was planning an unsavoury welcome for the US Second Lady.

Greenland's acting head of government, Mute Egede, had labelled Usha Vance's visit as a ""provocation"" by the United States. ""Until recently, we could trust the Americans, who were our allies and friends, and with whom we enjoyed working very closely, but that time is over,"" Greenland's prime minister said.

Even Denmark's prime minister had called the visit an ""unacceptable pressure"" being put by Washington. This was hours before the White House announced revised plans. The spat between Copenhagen and Washington was on public display amid Trump's plan to takeover the arctic region island - for which he has not ruled out the use of force.

Denmark has now welcomed Washington's decision to revise the plan. ""I think it's very positive that the Americans cancelled their visit to the Greenlandic society. Instead, they will visit their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that,"" Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told local broadcaster DR.

However, not everyone agrees. There are still many who feel that this was done because Washington saw the writing on the wall - that they are not welcome in Greenland. Karsten Honge, a member of the Danish parliament in Copenhagen, said the U.S. decision not to visit the dog-sled race in the town of Sisimiut, as well as a trip to the capital Nuuk, appeared to have been made out of necessity.

""They are doing this for the obvious reason that if they had shown up in Nuuk or Sisimiut, they would probably have been met by demonstrations with banners and people yelling 'Yankees go home',"" Honge told Danish broadcaster TV2.

The visit of the US delegation will remain the same - from Thursday, March 27 to Saturday, March 29, 2025. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The United States has named India, along with China, a ""state actor"" in enabling direct and indirect supply of precursor chemicals for illicit fentanyl drug production by criminal organisations. The use of fentanyl, among other synthetic opioids, is the most lethal drug trafficked into the United States, and has claimed the lives of more than 52,000 Americans in 12 months ending in October 2024, according to the Annual Threat Assessment (ATA) of the US intelligence community released on Tuesday.

""These groups [transnational criminal organisations or TCOs] are often enabled, both directly and indirectly, by state actors, such as China and India, as sources of precursors and equipment for drug traffickers,"" the report published by the office of Tulsi Gabbard, US Director of National Intelligence (DNI), said. 

""China remains the primary source country for illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment, followed by India,"" it added. 

Notably, it is the first time the US has placed India on the same level as China in connection with the supply of precursor chemicals used by drug cartels to manufacture opioids like fentanyl. Last year's report mentioned India as just one of several countries from where the Mexican groups were sourcing chemicals to a ""lesser extent"". It had identified China as the primary supplier.

The report comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has made combating opioids a political priority, shaping his foreign policy decisions. Earlier this month, Trump said his administration would not rest until ""we have ended the fentanyl epidemic in America once and for all.""

On February 1, the American commander-in-chief imposed an additional 10 per cent tariff on China for failing to take sufficient action against fentanyl trafficking. He also levied 25 per cent duties on Canada and Mexico for allegedly lacking adequate border enforcement.

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose reciprocal duties on several countries as part of his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs set to take effect on April 2. However, India is in talks with America to expedite a free trade deal that could help it avoid some of these taxes.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday said Bangladesh was witnessing a ""festival of rumours"" against his administration, blaming it on ""the defeated force"" -- an apparent reference to deposed premier Sheikh Hasina's regime.

""The rumours are big instruments of the defeated forces against the July-August (2024) Uprising,"" he said in a nationwide televised address on the eve of Bangladesh's 53rd Independence Day on March 26 when the country in 1971 declared independence from the then Pakistan followed by a nine-month Liberation War.

Unlike in past years, there would be no National Day military parade in the capital. District-level parades will take place as usual. Home Ministry Senior Secretary Nasimul Ghani recently said that the country is in a wartime mode.

In his address, Yunus called upon the countrymen to resist the rumour through awareness and greater unity.

He said that as the upcoming election, the date of which is yet to be decided, would come near, the rumours would take more dangerous shape. ""You all know, who are behind the phenomenon and why they are spearheading these (rumours),"" he said.

Yunus asked the people to look for the source of the rumour whenever they hear any such misleading gossip instead of ignoring them ""as many experienced war experts are working round the clock spending unlimited money behind these rumours"" with their ""main objective to thwart the July Uprising"".

""Our overall unity is severely irritating them. They want to break the unity. You will not even realise their innovative techniques. You do not even understand when you became a pawn of their game,"" he said.

Yunus added: ""Always keep in mind we are in a war situation."" The interim government chief did not cite any specific example of such rumours but several of his advisers in the cabinet have said conspiracies were underway at home and abroad particularly using social media platforms to destabilise the government.

Yunus, however, said his administration sought United Nations cooperation to prevent the spread of rumours and disinformation and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who recently visited Bangladesh, ""assured us of extending the cooperation"".

Deposed premier Hasina's regime was ousted in a student-led mass protest spearheaded by now-defunct Students against Discrimination on August 5, 2024.

Yunus, who was in France at that time, flew home and assumed the role of the Chief Adviser of the interim government three days later.

Yunus, whose experiment of poor men's banking earned him the Nobel Peace Prize, was in a protracted row of the past regime for obscure reasons.

Several political parties and analysts said during Yunus' past seven-month rule ultraright and Islamist elements created a space in the political arena and they were spearheading a campaign to sideline the forces in favour of the 1971 Liberation War.

Most leaders of the Awami League, which led the Liberation War in 1971, were arrested or on the run at home or abroad to evade trial on charges like mass murders and crimes against humanity in Bangladesh's domestic International Crimes Tribunal.

""Some people, some parties, some groups are trying to make it seem as if 10971 never happened... trying to erase it from memory,"" Secretary-General of ex-premier Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party Mirza Faklhrul Islam Alamgir told a party rally on Tuesday.

""Those who once collaborated in the (Pakistani troops') massacre - those very people - are now speaking louder than ever,"" he said.

Two months ago, he said in an interview that ""I can somehow smell, some quarters are trying to belittle the 1971 (liberation War)"" while several of his party leaders have spoken in near identical tones in recent months.

Yunus, however, at the onset of his speech, recalled those who sacrificed their lives during the Liberation War, saying March 25 is a day of massacre that remains stigmatised in the history of human civilisation.

""On this night in 1971, the Pakistani occupation forces brutally opened fire on innocent, unarmed and sleeping Bangalees and killed thousands of people. Since March 25, the people of this country had raised armed resistance. Bangladesh became independent through a nine-month war,"" he said.

A military correspondent from Russia's main state TV channel, Channel One, was killed by a mine on the border with Ukraine earlier, her employer said Wednesday.

The incident took place on the Russian side of the border, in the Belgorod region, the channel said.

""Channel One war correspondent Anna Prokofieva died while performing her professional duty,"" the TV channel wrote in a statement. ""Channel One's film crew struck an enemy mine.""

The mine also wounded her colleague, cameraman Dmitry Volkov, it said.

It said Prokofieva was 35 years old and had been covering the Ukraine conflict with the channel since 2023.

Her last post on Telegram was dated Tuesday and appeared to show her in a forest, sitting on a chair in military fatigues and wearing a head-mounted camera.

The post, in which she is smiling, was captioned: ""Somewhere on the border with country 404"" -- a derogatory reference to the ""404 file not found"" internet error that pro-Kremlin military bloggers use to refer to Ukraine.

Several Russian journalists have been killed in the three-year conflict, including on Monday when a war correspondent for Russia's main pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia died in Ukraine's Kharkiv region.

At least 21 journalists have died in total since the beginning of Moscow's offensive in February 2022, according to the International Federation of Journalists.

Tulsi Gabbard, United States Director of National Intelligence (DNI), on Tuesday said that the American intelligence community have assessed that Iran is not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon at the moment, but discussion of nuclearization has increased inside the regime in Tehran. 

""The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamanei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,"" she said during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.

Gabbard, however, added that in the past years, it was seen that there has been ""an erosion of a decades-long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.""

""Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons,"" she added.

The DNI Director, meanwhile, added that the entire impact of renewed sanctions on Iran is still not in effect, but that the ""message"" has been ""certainly heard"" by Tehran. 

Earlier in October 2024 also, the United States said it believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel.

The DNI also released the intelligence community's annual threat assessment in conjunction with the hearing. The report predicted that Iran will try to leverage its robust missile capability and expanded nuclear program, and its diplomatic outreach to regional states and US rivals to bolster its regional influence and ensure regime survival. 

However, regional and domestic challenges, most immediately tensions with Israel, are seriously testing Iran's ambitions and capabilities, it added,

""The IC assesses Iran's prospects for reconstituting force losses and posing a credible deterrent, particularly to Israeli actions, are dim in the near-term,"" the report continues.

It suggested that Tehran will continue its efforts to counter Israel and press the United States to leave the region by aiding and arming its loose consortium of like-minded terrorists, known as the ""Axis of Resistance."" 

The report also noted that Iranian investment in its military has been a key plank of its efforts to confront diverse threats and try to deter and defend against an attack by the United States or Israel. Iran will also continue to directly threaten US persons globally and remains committed to its decade-long effort to develop surrogate networks inside the United States, it added.

The report also mentioned that Tehran intends for its expanding relationships with other key US adversaries and the Global South to mitigate America's efforts to isolate the regime and blunt the impact of Western sanctions. ""Tehran's diplomatic efforts-including at times outreach to Europe-are likely to continue with varying degrees of success,"" it said. 

It, however, added that Iranian political and economic struggles could be fodder for renewed domestic political unrest and protest inside Iran, unless Iran is granted sanctions relief.

The report also found that Russia is developing a new satellite meant to carry a nuclear weapon, which could have ""devastating consequences"" for the US and the world.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Billionaire Elon Musk has trained his guns on The Atlantic magazine after the publication reported that its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a classified group chat discussing US military operations. The chat, which included senior national security officials, covered planned strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

The Tesla CEO mocked the publication, writing, ""Best place to hide a dead body is page 2 of The Atlantic magazine because no one ever goes there.""

He also reposted a satirical piece from The Babylon Bee titled, ""4D Chess: Genius Trump Leaks War Plans To 'The Atlantic' Where No One Will Ever See Them.""

Best place to hide a dead body is page 2 of The Atlantic magazine, because no one ever goes there https://t.co/10A01hObHO

President Donald Trump, when asked about the situation during a White House briefing, distanced himself from the slip-up but was critical of the magazine.

""I don't know anything about it,"" Trump told reporters. ""I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine, but I know nothing about it.""

Pressed further on the nature of the leaks, Trump appeared uninterested, responding, ""Having to do with what? What were they talking about?""

Mr Goldberg's report for The Atlantic revealed that a leaked group chat contained details of planned US strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, including targets, weapons, and attack sequencing.

The leak happened when National Security Advisor Mike Waltz mistakenly invited Mr Goldberg to a high-level Signal chat. The group included Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The conversation took place just two days before the planned strikes.

Mr Goldberg said senior officials continued discussing sensitive military details in the chat. Despite the security lapse, the White House and the National Security Council did not deny the report's authenticity.

On Monday, addressing the reporters, Pete Hegseth didn't take any responsibility for the security breach and instead attacked Mr Goldberg, insisting ""nobody was texting war plans.""

The White House said President Trump ""continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The US Senate on Tuesday (local time) confirmed the appointment of Indian-origin Jay Bhattacharya, a professor at Stanford School of Medicine, as Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

According to the official website of the US Senate, Mr Bhattacharya won the vote 53-47 during the first session of the roll call vote in the 119th Congress.

According to an earlier nomination statement from US President Donald Trump, Mr Bhattacharya is a professor of health policy at Stanford University, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Stanford Freeman Spogli Institute, and the Hoover Institution.

He also directs Stanford's Centre for Demography and Economics of Health and Ageing, and his research emphasises the role of government programs, biomedical innovation, and economics.

Jay is a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an alternative to lockdowns proposed in October 2020. His peer-reviewed research has been published in economics, statistics, legal, medical, public health, and health policy journals.

The statement further added that Mr Bhattacharya and newly appointed US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr will be working together to restore the NIH to a ""Gold Standard of Medical Research.""

Following his confirmation as the head of the NIH, US Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell congratulated Mr Bhattacharya, stating that he would provide ""sound leadership"" to the institution.

""Voted today to confirm Dr Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health. With an extensive background in medical research, I expect Dr J Bhattacharya to provide sound leadership at the NIH,"" Mr McConnell said, taking to X.

Earlier in February, the US Senate voted to confirm Robert F Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, as US Health and Human Services Secretary. He was confirmed as US Health and Human Services Secretary with a vote of 52-48.

Multinational conglomerate Tata Group has reportedly become a global supplier of billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla. Several Tata firms, including Tata Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata AutoComp, and Tata Electronics, are now part of Tesla's supply chain, according to a report by The Economic Times (ET).

Per the report, these Tata companies have already signed global agreements with the automaker as essential partners and are providing crucial components and services to Tesla, which represents approximately half of the global automotive industry's market value. 

These firms contributed to the approximately $ 2 billion worth of Indian supplies-- including castings, forgings, electronics, and fabrication parts-- to the American automaker in FY24.  With the EV maker looking to diversify its supply chain, its sourcing from India is expected to increase.

The Tata group is now positioning itself for expanded opportunities and growing further, especially if Tesla sets up a manufacturing unit in India. Billionaire Musk's company has also initiated conversations with existing Indian suppliers about the possibility of establishing facilities near their manufacturing centres to enhance the supply ecosystem, the ET report said.

""Tesla is, in a way, readying the supplier base in India...We are very sure that once Tesla starts manufacturing here, Indian suppliers will benefit from sourcing opportunities,"" a top industry source told ET, requesting anonymity.

The report said that Tesla's Senior procurement executives have been meeting with numerous current suppliers about manufacturing specific components.

Currently, Tesla is evaluating manufacturing opportunities in India and is closely monitoring government incentives, tax benefits, and potential duty waivers before making a final decision. While the EV maker has not confirmed its manufacturing plans, reports indicate that it is in talks with several states, including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Telangana, to explore options for setting up a production facility. 

If Tesla moves ahead with its India plans, Tata's role in its supply chain could grow even further. The ET report said the American company has strict non-disclosure agreements with its suppliers, which prevent them from revealing details about their contributions.

However, the sources told ET that Tesla also intends to procure various components from suppliers outside China and Taiwan, including wiring harnesses, electric motors, gearboxes, forged components, castings, sheet metal, sophisticated electronics, suspension systems, electric powertrains, and ball and ceramic bearings. 

Tata AutoComp provides specialised EV engineering products.

Tata Technologies delivers comprehensive product lifecycle management services. 

TCS supplies circuit-board technologies.

Tata Electronics provides chips.

The financial daily reported that while these companies within the Tata ecosystem maintain their current global supply arrangements, their future strategic decisions may be influenced by Tesla's ultimate decision regarding local manufacturing or contract manufacturing for the Indian market.

The American EV maker has established partnerships with numerous Indian manufacturers, including prominent names such as Samvardhana Motherson, Suprajit Engineering, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Varroc Engineering, Bharat Forge, and Sandhar Technologies, for sourcing vital components, but it is likely to source essential vehicle control components from Tata Electronics, including printed circuit board assemblies for Tesla's battery management systems, motor controller units and door control mechanism, the report said.

A US doctor was taken into custody after he allegedly struck his wife in the head with a rock and tried to push her off a hiking route after she refused to take a picture with him, Hawaiian authorities said.

Gerhardt Konig, a 46-year-old Maui anaesthesiologist, has been charged with the attempted murder of his wife, Arielle Konig. The couple was on vacation in Oahu when Mr Konig allegedly pushed his 36-year-old wife down a hiking trail near the Pali Lookout.

According to reports, the Nuuanu Pali Lookout provides sweeping views of the Koolau cliffs and Windward Coast from its location more than a thousand feet above the Oahu coastline.

Law enforcement sources told Hawaii News Now that Mr Konig snapped because his wife refused to take a photo with him.



The doctor repeatedly hit his wife, struck her with a rock, and attempted to stab her with two syringes, though it did not specify if they carried drugs, The NY Post reported.

Mr Konig was taken into custody by Honolulu police following a brief foot pursuit near Pali Highway on Monday night. Police posted a billboard featuring his picture earlier in the day, stating he was sought for attempting to kill someone at Pali Lookout.

Following the alleged attack early Monday, the Honolulu Police Department reported that Arielle Konig was taken to a hospital in critical condition with several facial and head injuries.

Mr Konig has been a physician with the Anaesthesia Medical Group, CBS affiliate KGMB reported. He has already been suspended until an inquiry is conducted. He worked under an independent contract and supplied medical services to Maui facilities.

""Maui Health is committed to patient safety and upholding the highest standards of care,"" Maui Health stated.

The physician previously served as an Assistant Professor of anesthesiology and bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh and an anaesthesiologist at UPMC. According to the company, Mr Konig has not worked for UPMC for more than two years.

An on-duty Uber Eats driver has been fired for allegedly urinating in an apartment lift in Australia's Sydney. The incident at Northview Apartments in Artarmon occurred on March 10 afternoon and was caught on camera.

A video of him peeing in the lift has now gone viral on X.

The clip begins with the delivery agent entering the lift and pressing the button for level 10 to reach the customer's floor.

With his back facing the camera, the driver, holding a parcel in his right hand, appears to unzip his pants with the left and moves to the front corner of the lift.

He then allegedly pees on the front doors of the lift, leaving a wet patch near the entrance when he walks out.

An Uber Eats spokesperson said they ""strongly condemned this kind of behaviour, which has no place on the Uber platform.""

Residents said they were disgusted by the incident and had the lift sanitised, but a smell remained there.

A resident told a media channel that despite a deep clean, the elevator still smelt and required thousands of dollars in repairs.

It is a major breach of food handling requirements, he said.

Another resident described the incident as ""disgusting and completely unacceptable"".

The driver's account has been deactivated and he will no longer be able to work with Uber Eats, according to latest reports.

NSW Police confirmed that an investigation had been launched and urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers.

Luigi Mangione, jailed for allegedly murdering a health insurance CEO, has requested a laptop. Mangione, 26, is accused of fatally shooting Brian Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel in December.

Mr Thompson, a father of two high school-aged children, had worked for decades at UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.

The Independent reported that in a court filing made public late Monday, Mangione's lawyers requested that he be provided with a laptop for legal purposes. 

They stated that the device would allow him to review more than 15,000 pages of documents, videos, and other materials related to his case. The laptop would be restricted, preventing internet access, communication with others, and the use of video games or entertainment content.

Mangione can only access case materials during meetings with his attorneys, but his defense team argues that available visiting hours are insufficient for proper case preparation.

Similar accommodations have been granted to other defendants at the facility where Mangione is being held.

The Manhattan district attorney's office, prosecuting Mangione under a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, has not yet responded to a request for comment.

According to Mangione's attorneys, prosecutors oppose the laptop request, citing concerns about witness threats.

Defence lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo countered in the filing that there is ""no connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.""

Mangione, an Ivy League-educated computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the state charges.

He also faces a parallel federal case that could result in the death penalty but has not yet entered a plea to those charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Mr Kanal, a prominent youth leader, led the attack late Sunday night, allegedly in response to Kamra's parody song mocking the Deputy Chief Minister.

Senior GOP figures warn of potential ‘significant political problem' for Trump administration in rare sign of unrest

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly.

“This is what happens when you don't really have your act together,” the Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski told the Hill.

The Trump administration has been facing criticism from Democrats – and now Republicans – after Monday's embarrassing revelation that a team of senior national security officials accidentally added a journalist to a private group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app. The group, which included Vice-President JD Vance, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and others, discussed sensitive plans to engage in military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

On Wednesday morning the Atlantic posted another tranche of messages that contained details of the attack on Yemen, including descriptions of targets, launch times and even the details of weather during the assault.

Senior national security officials testified before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday, where the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA director, John Ratcliffe, were grilled by lawmakers over the scandal. The national security officials said “no classified material” was shared in the chat. Republicans are now calling for investigations, as well.

According to reporting from the Hill, top Republican senators are calling for various committees to investigate the leak, including the Senate armed services committee and the Senate intelligence committee. The Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the armed services committee, told the Hill he would be asking the defense department's inspector general to investigate the scandal.

The national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who reportedly added Goldberg to the group chat, took “full responsibility” for the leak on a Tuesday night Fox News appearance. However, he did not describe how the leak happened and trashed Goldberg, calling him “the bottom-scum of journalists”. During his television appearance, Waltz said he started the Signal group chat but unknowingly added a contact that happened to have Goldberg's number.

“Of course I didn't see this loser in the group, it looked like someone else,” he said, and denied that a staffer was responsible.

Tensions are rising among Republicans, with the two wings of the party divided on what should happen with Waltz, according to reporting from Politico.

On the one hand, traditional, hawkish Republicans see Waltz as a strong vehicle to push Trump officials towards a more aggressive foreign policy, and advocate for him to stay in the administration. On the other hand, Trumpian Republicans like Vance, oppose the hawkish approach to foreign policy. Waltz's position, for now, seems to be safe, with Donald Trump calling Waltz a “very good man”.

Despite the prospect of congressional investigations, there are still significant questions left unanswered about the leak, with Waltz and Trump contradicting each other in separate interviews. Waltz on Tuesday said that a staffer was not responsible for the leak.

“Look, I take full responsibility, I built the group,” Waltz said. But Trump suggested the opposite during an interview.

“What it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody that worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level, had Goldberg's number or call through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call,” Trump said. His statements were unclear, since the Atlantic journalist was added to a text chat, not a phone call.

The use of Signal for internal government discussions has also been called into question. A non-profit organization, American Oversight, sued members of the Trump administration on Tuesday afternoon, saying the app's use violated the Federal Records Act. The organization is requesting that a federal court order the officials to preserve the messages “to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Search plane spotted family sheltering overnight on wing of small aircraft that crashed and partly sunk into frigid lake

A pilot and his two young daughters survived on the wing of a plane for about 12 hours after it crashed and was partly submerged in an icy Alaska lake, then were rescued after being spotted by a good Samaritan.

Terry Godes said he saw a Facebook post on Sunday night calling for people to help search for the missing plane, which did not have a locator beacon. On Monday morning about a dozen pilots including Godes headed out to scour the rugged terrain. Godes headed toward Tustumena Lake near the toe of a glacier and spotted what he thought was wreckage.

“It kind of broke my heart to see that, but as I got closer down and lower, I could see that there's three people on top of the wing,” he told the Associated Press on Tuesday.

After saying a prayer, he continued to approach and saw a miracle.

“They were alive and responsive and moving around,” Godes said, adding that they waved at him.

The missing Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser, piloted by a man with two juvenile immediate family members aboard, was on a sightseeing tour from Soldotna to Skilak Lake on the Kenai Peninsula. It was not immediately clear how old the juveniles were.

In a social media post early on Monday, John Morris implored people to help search for his son and granddaughters, saying they were late returning from a Sunday – afternoon flight.

“There are friends ready to search at daylight. But this is my plea for any and all help to locate my family,” he wrote.

The three were rescued on the eastern edge of Tustumena Lake on Monday by the Alaska army national guard after Godes alerted other searching pilots that he had found them. Another pilot, Dale Eicher, heard Godes's radio call and related it to troopers since he was closer to Skilak Lake and figured he had better cell reception. He was also able to provide the plane's coordinates to authorities.

“I wasn't sure if we would find them, especially because there was a cloud layer over quite a bit of the mountains, so they could have very easily been in those clouds that we couldn't get to,” Eicher said. But finding the family alive within an hour of starting the search “was very good news”.

The three were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, Alaska state troopers said.

Godes said many miracles were at play, from the plane not sinking, to the survivors being able to stay atop the wing, to them surviving nighttime temperatures dipping below 30F (-1C).

“They spent a long, cold, dark, wet night out on top of a wing of an airplane that they weren't planning on,” Godes said.

Alaska has few roads, leaving many communities to rely on small airplanes to get around.

Last month 10 people died when a small commuter plane that was overweight by half a ton crashed on to sea ice in the Norton Sound, near Nome on the state's western coast.

And five years ago, a midair collision near the Soldotna airport claimed seven lives including that of a state lawmaker.

For this week's rescue, the national guard dispatched a helicopter from its base in Anchorage.

The initial plan of using a hoist to pluck the crash survivors from the wing proved too dangerous, as the the smallest girl was being buffeted and blown around by the wind created by the helicopter, said Lt Col Brendon Holbrook, commander of the 207th aviation regiment. So instead the aircraft hovered to the side and pulled them on board.

Personnel reported that the girls were surprisingly dry but the man had been in the water at some point, Holbrook said: “We don't know to what extent, but he was hypothermic.”

Holbrook said he was told they had basic clothing one would wear on small planes without very good heating systems, but nothing sufficient to keep warm outside in wintry temperatures with cold winds blowing on the lake.

“It was literally the best possible scenario and outcome,” Holbrook said. “Ultimately the crew of that airplane were lucky, because from what my guys told me, that plane was in the ice with the tail refrozen, and if that tail hadn't refrozen, it would have sunk.”

The 60,000-acre (24,200-hectare) Tustumena Lake, the largest freshwater body on the Kenai Peninsula, is about 80 miles (130km) south-west of Anchorage, with nearby mountains and a glacier.

It has been described by the Alaska department of fish and game as “notorious for its sudden, dangerous winds”, with conditions that can cause havoc for both boats and planes.

“The terrain helps turn the winds around, and occasionally they get a little squirrelly,” said Michael Kutz, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Anchorage.

Godes agreed that the area is always windy and the water can be whipped up into waves.

“Then just the way it's placed right there at the heel of that, or at the toe of that glacier where you've got mountains on both sides, you know, just a few miles to the west, you've got Cook Inlet running back and forth with huge temperature and tidal swings every day,” he said. “It's just a recipe for chaos and for turbulence.”

There was no indication yet why the plane crashed.

Mark Ward, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board's Alaska division, said the pilot had not yet reported the accident, nor had the agency been able to contact him. Efforts were to be made again on Wednesday to speak to him.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

James Malone triumphed in a district that voted for Trump over Harris by more than 15 points in last November

A Democrat won a state senate seat in a Pennsylvania district that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump, offering a ray of hope for the party as it continues to struggle nationally with its response to the Trump administration.

James Malone triumphed on Tuesday in the 36th senatorial district, which voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by more than 15 points in last November's presidential election, in a victory that Democratic party leadership said “should put Republicans on edge”.

It served as a major upset win for the party, which has seen recriminations spill out into the open after Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, voted for Republicans' funding bill to avoid a government shutdown this month.

“I'm very excited and really, really happy that all the work we put in has paid off,” Malone, who won the district by 482 votes, told WGAL-TV.

“Everyday voters are not liking what they're seeing at the federal level, they don't like the chaos. We want to be sure that we, as Pennsylvania, are standing up for our neighbors and are standing up for our state.

“And, brotherly love is Pennsylvania, and that just proved out. Kindness over criticism, right? So that's what we're trying to do, and I think that that really is what we're looking at moving forward.”

Trump won Pennsylvania by less than 2% of the vote in 2024, after the state voted for Joe Biden four years earlier. The state has a Democratic governor, rising star Josh Shapiro, but is a persistent swing vote nationally, and is crucial to Democratic hopes of winning the White House in 2028.

Malone's win capped a second Pennsylvania victory for Democrats on Tuesday, with Dan Goughnour winning a house seat to maintain the party's slim control of the state house.

“It's only March, and Democrats have defied the odds again with another upset victory in Republican territory,” Heather Williams, president of the Democratic legislative campaign committee, said in a statement.

“Democrats are on a roll in state legislative races in 2025, from flipping red seats to defending one-seat majorities, which should put Republicans on edge. Both wins affirm Democratic leadership in a moment when GOP power is synonymous with chaos.”

Nationally Democrats have been struggling to present party unity, and Schumer has faced backlash from his colleagues over his funding bill vote. Several Democrats in the House of Representatives, including Glenn Ivey and Delia Ramirez, have suggested Schumer resign, Reuters reported, prompting Schumer to tell NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: “I'm not stepping down.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the popular congresswoman from New York who recently launched a “fighting oligarchy” tour with Bernie Sanders, has criticized what she called an “acquiesce” by Schumer to the Republicans.

“There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people,” she said. “Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think, is a huge slap in the face.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Approved refugees reportedly affected by freeze on processing after Trump demands more aggressive vetting

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications as the US government continues to implement a hardline immigration agenda.

CBS News reported that approved refugees are part of the processing freeze, as the White House enacts an effort to more aggressively vet immigrants to the US.

The move is likely to leave some immigrants granted refuge in the US in limbo, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claiming the pause is necessary to carry out two executive actions on immigration signed by Donald Trump.

“USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] is placing a temporary pause on finalizing certain Adjustment of Status applications pending the completion of additional screening and vetting to identify potential fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, in alignment” with Trump's orders, DHS told CBS News.

Adjustment of status is the process by which individuals can apply to become a lawful permanent resident, or green-card holder, in the US.

The DHS cited a presidential action issued by Trump in January, which ordered the federal government to ensure people seeking admission to the US “are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible”.

It comes as a federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday blocked immigration officials from detaining Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student and legal permanent resident the Trump administration is trying to deport for taking part in Gaza solidarity protests.

Chung, 21, has lived in the US since she was seven years old. She filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Monday, arguing the government was “attempting to use immigration enforcement as a bludgeon to suppress speech that they dislike”.

Chung's case has echoes of the ongoing detention of Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist and green-card holder who took part in protests at Columbia, and experts told the Guardian that there was evidence that people of color are being targeted for deportation.

At least five students and academics of color who participated in protests in support of Palestine at US universities have been targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as a part of the Trump administration's ongoing crackdown on Palestinian support.

“What we're seeing is the use of immigration law to go after visa holders, permanent lawful residents, [over] their speech,” Samah Sisay, a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, told the Guardian this week. “[Trump is] trying to suppress political speech that goes against what the administration wants.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Edward Coristine, who is 19, is among members of Doge effort that has been given access to official networks

The best-known member of Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.

Edward Coristine is among the most visible members of the Doge effort that has been given sweeping access to official networks as it attempts to radically downsize the US government. It is headed by Musk – the world's richest man – with a powerful mandate from Donald Trump.

Past reporting had focused on the staffer's youth – he is 19 – and his chosen nickname of “bigballs,” which became a pop culture punchline. Musk has championed the teen on his social media site X, telling his followers last month: “Big Balls is awesome.”

Beginning around 2022, while still in high school, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, according to corporate and digital records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with half a dozen former associates. Among its users was a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name “EGodly,” according to digital records preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools and the online cybersecurity tool Any.Run.

The details of Coristine's connection to EGodly have not been previously reported.

On 15 February 2023, EGodly thanked Coristine's company for its assistance in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

“We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website,” the message said.

The digital records reviewed by Reuters showed the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was tied to internet protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other Coristine-owned entities between October 2022 and June 2023, and that some users attempting to access the site around that time would hit a DiamondCDN “security check”.

Coristine did not return messages seeking comment. Musk's team, which is not an official government department, did not respond to emails about Coristine.

Coristine is listed as a “senior adviser” at the state department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to one official at each agency who told Reuters they had seen his name in their respective agencies' staff directory.

On LinkedIn, Coristine describes himself as a “Volunteer (Intern) Plumber” with the US government.

The state department did not return messages asking about Coristine. CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.

EGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for the past year; attempts to elicit comment from eight people who participated in or interacted with EGodly were unsuccessful.

DiamondCDN's website – CDN typically stands for “content delivery network” – was registered in mid-2022, according to records collected by DomainTools. It pitched itself as offering “excellent security tools” that would help “lower your infrastructure costs”, according to copies of the site maintained by the Internet Archive. The site said the company “has no business inspecting user content”.

In 2023, EGodly boasted on its Telegram channel of hijacking phone numbers, breaking into unspecified law enforcement email accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and cryptocurrency theft.

Early that year, the group distributed the personal details of an FBI agent who they said was investigating them, circulating his phone number, photographs of his house, and other private details on Telegram.

EGodly also posted an audio recording of an obscene prank call made to the agent's phone and a video, shot from the inside of a car, of an unknown party driving by the agent's house in Wilmington, Delaware, at night and screaming out the window: “EGodly says you're a bitch!“

Reuters could not independently verify EGodly's boasts of cybercriminal activity, including its claims to have hijacked phone numbers or infiltrated law enforcement emails. But it was able to authenticate the video by visiting the same Wilmington address and comparing the building to the one in the footage.

The FBI agent targeted by EGodly, who is now retired, told Reuters that the group had drawn law enforcement attention because of its connection to swatting, the dangerous practice of making hoax emergency calls to send armed officers swarming targeted addresses. The agent didn't go into detail. Reuters is not identifying him out of concern for further harassment.

“These are bad folks,” the former agent said. “They're not a pleasant group.”

He declined to comment further about the harassment or whether EGodly had been or still was the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI didn't return messages seeking comment on EGodly.

Reuters was not able to ascertain how long EGodly used DiamondCDN, or whether EGodly paid Coristine's company. Archived copies of DiamondCDN's website said the firm envisioned having both paying and nonpaying customers.

Another individual who has been subject to abuse from EGodly and a cybercrime researcher who has followed the group said it was composed of hardened fraudsters, citing the group's makeup and the credibility of its claims. Both asked not to be identified, citing fears of retaliation.

Even if the connection between Coristine and EGodly were fleeting, Nitin Natarajan, who served as the deputy director of CISA under Joe Biden, told Reuters it was worrying that someone who provided services to EGodly only two years ago was part of a group that has gained wide access to government networks.

“This stuff was not in the distant past,” he said. “The recency of the activity and the types of groups he was associated would definitely be concerning.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

That's incredibly dangerous","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/26/donald-trump-war-on-woke-science-diversity","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:05:00 GMT","

Contrary to claims by the US president, we have found that diversity initiatives result in better scientists and greater progress

Donald Trump's attacks on diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives since his January inauguration have been intense, indiscriminate and escalating. A tragic plane crash was baselessly blamed on DEI. All DEI programmes within public bodies have been ended and private contractors face cancellation if they also don't comply. Webpages that defend religious diversity in the context of Holocaust remembrance have been taken down.

Science and academia have been particularly targeted. Universities are threatened with losing federal funding if they support DEI. Government reports and government-funded research are being held back if they include prohibited terms such as “gender”, “pregnant person”, “women”, “elderly”, or “disabled”. Grants funded by the National Institutes of Health are being cancelled if they address diversity, equality or inclusion in any form.

What is more, this total “war on woke” (more accurately: “fight against fairness”) is happening in the UK as well as the US. Already, British companies and British watchdogs are abandoning their diversity drives. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has described diversity initiatives as a “poison”.

These attacks are rooted in wilful distortions of what DEI is all about. There are two big lies that need to be nailed. The first is that diversity and inclusion initiatives compromise the quality of employees by selecting incompetent candidates because of their minority group membership. The second is that DEI is a distraction that holds back success. Let's consider each in turn, using the field of science itself as an example.

The notion that DEI involves putting group membership before ability and leads to the appointment of incompetent candidates is a misrepresentation of what DEI initiatives are all about. Scientific ability is not restricted to one sex, ethnicity or religion, or to the able-bodied. Embracing diversity has the simple advantage of widening the pool of talent from which scientists are drawn. DEI initiatives are about ensuring that less competent members of the most privileged groups are not advantaged over more competent members of less privileged groups.

Bias starts at school, particularly in the physical sciences, where both girls and boys consider these “boy subjects” by the time they are teenagers. Even once you start your academic career, bias affects grant funding decisions and publication rates. Women and minorities face additional barriers to career progression: for instance, both female and ethnic minority scientists receive less credit for their work than male or white scientists respectively. Bias affects whether you feel at home in the scientific workplace. Institutions that tackle the many workplace barriers for women and ethnic minorities (child-unfriendly working hours, tolerance of harassment, culturally insensitive socialisation practices) have higher retention rates among women and minority researchers. Diverse workplaces attract more diverse staff to apply for jobs – creating a positive feedback loop. And we know that scientific research teams and institutions that prioritise diversity perform better.

As for the second myth that DEI is a barrier to success, diversity actually improves the quality of science. Evidence shows that scientific papers produced by ethnically diverse teams are more impactful than those written by homogeneous teams. Similarly, studies show that diverse teams consider more alternatives and make better decisions.

Scientists from diverse backgrounds raise new research questions and priorities – especially questions that affect minoritised communities. The lack of women in the higher echelons of biomedical science has led to a comparative lack of research into menstrual and reproductive health problems. The lack of black scientists has led to a neglect of conditions that affect black people such as sickle cell disease. And when it comes to the intersection of “race” and sex, things are even worse. It is only in the last few years that it even became known that black and Asian women are much more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women.

Medical sciences and social sciences have long suffered from a lack of diversity in research design, leading to worse medicine because findings do not apply to all populations. For example, clinical trials have tended to test treatments mainly on men and on white people, leading to poorer health outcomes for women or minorities. A diverse group of researchers makes members of minorities more willing to volunteer for trials and helps ensure diverse participant recruitment. This improves scientific validity. It also increases the trust of minorities in the outputs of research (say, the development of new vaccines) and hence the societal impact of the research (say, their willingness to get vaccinated).

All in all, ensuring diversity and equality and inclusion among scientists makes for better scientists and better science. While our examples are drawn from science, they are true much more broadly. DEI initiatives are about ensuring that we always select the best irrespective of group membership, not about selecting by group membership irrespective of who is best. Science is fundamentally about discovering truth through rigorous, unbiased, transparent inquiry and narrow pools of talent or perspectives make that much harder. Therefore, DEI initiatives are necessary to achieving the core mission of science, not a distraction from it.

Supreme court judges decide former president should face criminal prosecution alongside seven close allies

Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro will stand trial for allegedly orchestrating a violent plot to seize power through a military coup, after the country's supreme court decided he should face criminal prosecution.

The ruling leaves the far-right populist, who governed Brazil from 2019 until the end of 2022, facing political oblivion and a possible jail sentence of more than 40 years.

The supreme court decided that seven other close allies of the ex-president should also stand trial for crimes including involvement in an armed criminal organization, coup d'état and violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy.

They are: Bolsonaro's former defense ministers Gen Walter Braga Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira; his former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos; his former security minister, Anderson Torres; his former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem; his former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno; and his former assistant, Lt Col Mauro Cid, who, if convicted, will receive a lighter sentence after he struck a plea deal with prosecutors.

The men are accused of forming the kernel of a sprawling conspiracy to keep Bolsonaro in power after he narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

On Wednesday five supreme court judges – Cristiano Zanin, Alexandre de Moraes, Luiz Fux, Flávio Dino and Cármen Lúcia – unanimously ruled that there was sufficient evidence for all of those men to face prosecution and officially declared them defendants.

The accusations relate to an alleged plan to stage a pro-Bolsonaro coup in the months between the October 2022 election and the far-right riots that broke out in Brasília on 8 January 2023 – one week after Lula's inauguration.

Those attacks – which many believe were inspired by the 6 January 2021 storming of the US Capitol – were allegedly incited as part of a last-ditch attempt to return Bolsonaro to the presidency, against the public will, by creating turmoil that would justify a military intervention.

“It was a veritable pitched battle … It was an extraordinarily violent attempted coup d'état,” the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes told the court as he showed video footage of Bolsonarista hooligans vandalizing the supreme court and attacking police in the capital.

“Untamed violence – utter insolence … These images leave no doubt as to the materiality and the gravity of the crimes committed,” Moraes added.

In the weeks and months before the rightwing rampage in Brasília, a series of other machinations were allegedly afoot in the hope of stopping Lula taking power – some of them deadly. Police claim one sub-plot – code-named “Green and Yellow Dagger” – included plans to cause social and political chaos by assassinating Lula with poison and shooting the supreme court judge Moraes dead.

Brazil's attorney general, Paulo Gonet, told the court police investigators had “uncovered a terrifying operation to carry out the coup, which even included killing the president and vice-president elect, as well as that of a supreme court minister”.

One assassination plot “envisaged using explosives, military ordnance and poison … [and] the operators only didn't follow through on what had been agreed because they didn't manage to … co-opt the commander of the army,” Gonet added, urging judges to put Bolsonaro and his alleged accomplices on trial.

Bolsonaro rejected the charges in a lengthy WhatsApp statement sent to allies as the hearing began on Tuesday, calling the case against him “an aberration, the like of which has never been seen before”. “They are accusing me of a crime I never committed – a supposed attempted coup,” Bolsonaro claimed, insisting he had never desired or suggested “a democratic rupture”.

However, the former president admitted having discussed what he called “political alternatives for the nation” with his aides.

In court, lawyers for the accused also denied their clients had broken the law, although many stopped short of denying a coup attempt had taken place.

Bolsonaro's lawyer, Celso Vilardi, denied the ex-president had been involved in the 8 January uprising or led a criminal organization that plotted to murder Lula and other top authorities.

José Luis Mendes de Oliveira Lima, a lawyer representing Braga Netto, called his client “a man of unblemished reputation” who was not guilty of “any kind of criminal act”.

Oliveira's lawyer, Andrew Fernandes Faris, called the former defense minister “a most honourable man”, and called for the charges against him to be thrown out.

The lawyer for Torres, Eumar Novacki, denied his client was part of the “macabre coup drama” and claimed the investigation was filled with “false conclusions”.

Demóstenes Torres, representing Santos, also denied his client was part of the plot and attacked the “federal police novelists” he claimed had concocted a fictional narrative about the supposed conspiracy.

Ramagem's lawyer, Paulo Renato Garcia Cintra Pinto, said it would have made no sense for his client to have tried to destroy Brazil's democracy since he had himself just been elected to congress in the 2022 election.

Bernardo Mello Franco, a political commentator for the newspaper O Globo, said he saw little chance of the ex-president avoiding jail. “Bolsonaro will probably be convicted, Bolsonaro will probably be arrested – or he'll go into exile, he'll flee the country … From a judicial standpoint Bolsonaro's cornered,” he said.

Bolsonaro's best chance of a “political resurrection” lay in helping elect a rightwing ally in next year's presidential election who would agree to pardoning him after taking power. His congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, and wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, were possible candidates.

The far-right populist was also banking on support from his most important foreign ally, the US president, Donald Trump, in his quest to avoid jail and ensure his political survival.

“Bolsonaro is hoping Trump will be a kind of saviour for him, both politically and judicially. He believes Trump will somehow interfere in Brazilian politics to help him,” said Mello Franco, although he suspected Trump had bigger fish to fry.

“Right now, I think Trump seems to have greater priorities than Brazil … [and that] the Bolsonaros are paying more attention to Trump than Trump is paying to Bolsonaro.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Delegation originally meant to visit the capital will now have a trip only to the island's US military base

Denmark has welcomed the Trump administration's decision to scale back an unsolicited visit to Greenland as a sign the US is “de-escalating” after the planned trip sparked a diplomatic row with the Arctic island and Denmark.

The trip was originally to have involved a delegation led by the US second lady, Usha Vance, and including the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, visiting the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, and a dog sled race.

But after strong public statements opposing the visit from Greenland's prime minister, Múte B Egede, and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, it was announced that the trip would be more contained in scale and feature only a visit to the island's US military base, Pituffik.

The vice-president, JD Vance, said on Tuesday he would be joining his wife, a step that the Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, appeared to allude to when he said the US was giving the impression of escalating the row “when they're actually de-escalating”.

The White House has not yet confirmed whether or not Waltz, who has since become embroiled in an embarrassing security leak, will still be travelling. His name was omitted from a list of those attending.

“I actually think it is very positive that the Americans are cancelling their visit to the Greenlandic community. Then they will instead make a visit to their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that,” Rasmussen told the Danish broadcaster DR.

Rasmussen was speaking on Wednesday, as US planes were preparing to take off from Nuuk airport after reportedly being loaded with bulletproof cars that had been delivered in preparation for the visit.

“The short of it is that the cars that were delivered a few days ago are now being brought back home, and there will be no visit from the US vice-president's wife and their security adviser to the Greenlandic community. It is being packed up, and that is positive,” Rasmussen said.

He added: “It's kind of a masterful spin in many ways, to make it look like they're escalating when they're actually de-escalating.”

The change of plans was claimed as a diplomatic victory by Copenhagen and Nuuk, which is now being led by a caretaker government while coalition talks continue after a general election earlier this month.

Greenland, a former Danish colony, is now a semi-autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark, but its foreign and security policies are run by Copenhagen.

On Tuesday, Frederiksen accused the US of putting “unacceptable pressure” on Greenland and Denmark – vowing: “It is pressure that we will resist.”

Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to acquire the vast Arctic island for the US, had said that the American delegation was invited by Greenlandic “officials”. The Nuuk government responded by saying it had not issued any invitations for visits – “either official or private”. Egede had already accused Washington of “foreign interference.”

Pele Broberg, the leader of Naleraq, the most Trump and US-friendly Greenlandic party, which on Monday became the first party to leave coalition talks, accused the Danish media of prompting fears of “annexation”.

“We have more or less missed the chance to have a normal relationship with the US in the future, but I of course hope I am wrong,” he told Sermitsiaq.

Announcing that he would be joining his wife on the trip to Greenland, vice-president Vance said in a video on X: “Speaking for president Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.”

Drew Horn, who worked in various roles in the first Trump administration and is now an investor in Greenlandic minerals, said the US government's intentions for the trip had been “manipulated and misrepresented”.

“The intent is to demonstrate friendliness and commitment to supporting security for Greenland. The intentions have been manipulated and misrepresented with a bunch of noise coming out of Denmark,” he said. “So the vice-president now is looking basically to do a troop visit and keep it very traditional.”

Horn, who is chief executive of Washington DC-based mineral investment company GreenMet, added: “It is not a threat, it is not a show of force, it is not meant to influence or interfere with the new government.”

Usha Vance, he said, had been invited to Greenland by the organisers of the dog sled race “as a show of friendship to learn more about the Greenlandic culture”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Politician says idea would be ‘compensation for centuries-old injustice' of children being assigned father's name

An Italian politician has proposed a law that would make it automatic for babies to be assigned their mother's surname at birth, a step that would mark a rupture with a centuries-old tradition and has sparked a fiery debate.

Dario Franceschini, a former culture minister from the centre-left Democratic party, argues that such legislation would “right a historic wrong”.

His proposal follows a 2022 ruling by the constitutional court which defined the practice of newborns automatically taking their father's surname as “discriminatory and harmful to the identity of the child”. The court said children should be given both parents' surnames in the order they decided, unless they agreed their children should take just one of them. If there was indecision or disagreement, it added, a judge would have the final say.

New legislation approved by parliament was required to implement the ruling, made six months before Giorgia Meloni's rightwing coalition came to power. The topic was buried in parliament before being revived by Franceschini, who argues that rather than creating “endless problems” with double-barrelled surnames, or choosing between the mother's or father's, a law should be established for only the maternal surname to be used.

“It is a simple thing and also compensation for a centuries-old injustice that has had not only a symbolic value, but has been a cultural and social source of gender inequality,” Franceschini added.

Like in many countries, children born in Italy are automatically registered with their father's surname, with the mother's surname usually permitted only if the father is absent from the child's life.

Franceschini said he would present the bill in the coming days, angering members of Meloni's coalition.

“Here are the great priorities of the Italian left,” Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League, wrote on X. “Of course, let's wipe these fathers off the face of the earth; that way we'll solve all the problems.”

Federico Mollicone, from Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, said Franceschini's vision would mark a shift “from patriarchy to matriarchy”. Mollicone was, however, open to the possibility of children assuming the surnames of both parents.

Pierantino Zanettin, from the Forza Italia party, said the move appeared to be “a provocation aimed, above all, at media attention”, while Giulia Bongiorno, from the League, called for “a point of balance that does not make any parent invisible”.

Franceschini was mostly applauded by other opposition members, apart from a sceptical Carlo Calenda, who leads the centrist Azione party. “Don't we have any other priorities? Boh,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

As White House takes aim at medical missions, SVG says it gave US proof that workers aren't human-trafficking victims

The prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) said his government has provided evidence to the US that Cuban health workers in the country are not victims of human trafficking, as the Trump administration takes aim at the medical missions.

Speaking in advance of US secretary of state Marco Rubio's visit to the Caribbean on Wednesday, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said he was confident that the information he provided would settle US concerns about the deal under which Cuban medical professionals work in SVG.

Rubio, who is the child of Cuban immigrants, announced in February the expansion of an existing policy to target “forced labor” and “abusive and coercive labor practices”, which he claimed were part of Cuba's overseas medical missions.

But Caribbean leaders have consistently rejected the claims of human trafficking and stressed the important role the Cuban medical professionals play in saving lives in the region.

Gonsalves said he had provided US officials with evidence that there was “no human trafficking here, no forced labour, none of that”.

“We have modern labour laws, we follow all the international conventions when Cubans come here. They do excellent work, and they have their own bank accounts and are compensated comparably to nationals. They have a lot of benefits, including paid holidays. You can enter the program freely and leave the program,” he said.

Since its 1959 revolution, Cuba has been sending medics to both developed and developing countries around the world, including Italy, Brazil, and countries in the Caribbean and West Africa. Its doctors and nurses have been instrumental in tackling outbreaks such as Covid-19 and Ebola.

But under the expanded US policy, “current or former Cuban government officials, and other individuals, including foreign government officials, who are believed to be responsible for, or involved in, the Cuban labor export program” and their immediate family will be subjected to visa restrictions.

Cuba's ambassador to the SVG, Carlos Ernesto Rodríguez Etcheverry, earlier this month described the announcement as a “shameful decision”, saying that it has no legal basis and will deprive millions of people around the world of medical services.

“We really reject the idea … that Cuban doctors, Cuban nurses are slaves and that the Cuban government is involved in any trafficking issue with regard to our medical brigades. Because we respect our doctors, our nurses,” he told local media.

Describing the idea that Caribbean nations are involved in trafficking as “propaganda”, Gonsalves said that Cuban doctors operate private practices in SVG while they are employed by the government, and some apply for permanent residency in the country. “It's very clear that there isn't any sort of issue around trafficking as suggested,” he said.

Barbados's prime minister, Mia Mottley, currently chair of the Caricom group of Caribbean nations, told parliament that although Barbados does not currently have Cuban medical staff, “we could not get through the [Covid] pandemic without the Cuban nurses and the Cuban doctors”.

She added: “I will also be the first to tell you that we paid them the same thing that we pay Bajans, and that the notion, as was peddled not just by this government in the US, but the previous government, that we were involved in human trafficking by engaging with the Cuban nurses was fully repudiated and rejected by us.”

Mottley said that “like others in this region”, she is prepared to lose her US visa if “we cannot reach a sensible agreement on this matter”.

Caricom met on Friday, 21 March, to discuss Rubio's visit among other matters, Gonsalves said. During his visit to Jamaica, Rubio will hold bilateral meetings with officials from Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados, before going to Guyana and Suriname. Gonsalves said that he was sure the issue of Cuban doctors would be raised by Caribbean governments.

A statement from Trinidad and Tobago announcing the meeting with Rubio said discussions would “focus on US foreign policy and the effect on Trinidad and Tobago and the wider region”, but did not specify whether the issue of Cuban doctors was on the agenda.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Donald Gorske, 71, has eaten two of the McDonald's offering every day since 1972, and holds the Guinness World Record

If chowing down on Big Mac hamburgers daily for more than 50 years had ever inflicted any harm on him, Donald Gorske would probably get himself evaluated for an obsessive disorder, he admitted.

But he has attained a measure of fame, having held since 1999 the Guinness World Record for most Big Macs eaten over a lifetime – while maintaining his cholesterol and blood sugar levels have always been normal.

And following through on a promise to never complain about her lack of cooking was all he needed to do to secure his wife's eternal support for his habit – despite experts' ubiquitous warnings that regular consumption of McDonald's and other fast food packed with calories, sodium, sugar and fat could contribute to weight gain, obesity and other health problems.

As Gorske put it: “There's nothing to make it be called a disorder.”

Gorske, 71, has been back in the news in some corners of the internet after extending his Guinness record to more than 35,000 in mid-March, documenting each dispatched burger with receipts and containers.

The Guardian used the occasion – achieved by eating Big Macs twice daily since 17 May 1972 – to ask him to detail precisely how deep was his devotion to McDonald's signature product, given the fascination it has caused among some in the public for years.

The devotion evidently is quite deep.

Among the most visible reminders of it is an electric stove that Gorske and his wife, Mary, bought before their wedding in 1975. It looks almost as new as the day they installed it in their kitchen because his unique diet does not require much cooking.

“It's more or less a decoration,” said the retired corrections officer from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. “We needed it to fill the space in between the cupboards.

“There's nothing to make me want to use a stove ever.”

Then there's the booth with his name on it at the McDonald's closest to his home. It is inside the second iteration of that McDonald's, which was opened in 2008 on the same property but on a spot just over from its torn-down predecessor.

Gorske says the booth marks the exact location where he proposed marriage to Mary, when that location was still a parking lot outside the original McDonald's there. And that booth is where he prefers to dine on the Big Macs he occasionally chooses to eat at the restaurant. Most Big Macs he brings home to refrigerate or freeze and then microwave to cut down on gasoline expenses – as well as to ensure he never loses access to his favorite burger in the event of, say, a blizzard.

“That's a special spot to me,” said Gorske, referring to his booth. He added that he appreciates how the owner of that McDonald's has also put up a picture of him on a wall there.

Gorske's gargantuan collection of Big Mac containers is another of the visuals created by his life's pursuit that he considers to be the most striking.

He stored the cartons in his attic until it ran out of capacity in 2006. Since then, Gorske has been keeping his containers in his basement – but they have stacked up so high that it tends to overwhelm visitors who get to see his collection.

“You can rub your hand over just hundreds and hundreds of cartons,” Gorske said. “And what I always tell people is that – how I look at it – is it's time. You know, every two cartons is a day of my life, and it's kind of a weird thing when you see something like that.”

Two cartons in particular which are neither in his basement nor attic – but permanently in his freezer – hold the last Big Macs he bought from the torn-down McDonald's outside of which he proposed to Mary, with whom he has a son. He regards them as a dear memento.

“The wife jokes that she probably will just throw them in the coffin with me because I'll never get around to eating those,” Gorske said.

Gorske said he channels much of the rest of his free time into participating in local senior bowling leagues four times weekly. He doesn't have a cell phone or a computer and therefore doesn't surf the internet, though he understands from loved ones that many are aware of his record-setting affinity for the item that most McDonald's eateries list as No 1 on their menu.

He reiterated advice he has given before for people who are potentially thinking about gunning for his Big Mac eating crown: don't.

“For somebody to want to do that, you're going to have to eat Big Macs for 50 years … and you're going to have to really like Big Macs,” Gorske said. “It's such an easy thing for me to do because I already do it every day.

“I'm just one of them people that can eat Big Macs constantly, and it's not going to affect my health at all.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Hamdan Ballal says Israeli soldiers beat him with their rifle butts and threatened to kill him

The Oscar-winning Palestinian film director Hamdan Ballal has said that Israeli settlers who attacked him were aided by two Israeli soldiers, who beat him with the butt of their rifles outside his home and threatened to kill him.

In an interview with the Guardian, Ballal, one of the four directors of the film No Other Land, which documents the destruction of villages in the West Bank and won best documentary at this year's Academy Awards, recounted how on Monday two Israeli soldiers first encircled him while a settler was assaulting him, before violently striking him on the head and threatening to shoot him.

“It all started around 6pm on Monday,” said Ballal, who was released on Tuesday after Israeli forces detained him in a police station in the West Bank. “We had finished our daily Ramadan fast in Susya in the Masafer Yatta area, south of Hebron, when someone called me to say that settlers had entered our village.”

Some of the settlers were armed with batons, others had knives and one was holding an M16 rifle, witnesses told the Guardian. Among them were a group of Israeli soldiers who escorted the settlers inside the village where Ballal lives.

“Because I work for a human rights organisation called Haqel: in Defense of Human Rights, and because I'm also a photographer, I went there to document what was happening,” he said. “I took three or four photos, and then I realised that the situation was deteriorating. There were dozens of settlers, and they were becoming increasingly aggressive.”

Masked settlers with sticks started attacking Palestinian residents, including a group of Jewish activists, smashing their car windows and slashing tyres, according to Josh Kimelman, an activist with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV). Video provided by the group showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night.

“In that precise moment, I thought about my family, who were at home,” Ballal said. ‘‘I ran to them and told my wife, ‘Lock the house and keep the children inside.' They could have attacked me, but by doing so they wouldn't have harmed my family.”

One settler, escorted by two Israeli soldiers, walked straight over to Ballal's house. Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone from supporting Ballal, who was shouting for help.

“The soldiers pointed their rifles at me while the settler from behind began beating me,” Ballal said. “They threw me to the ground, and the settler started hitting me on the head. Then a soldier also began beating me; with the butt of his rifle, he struck me on the head. After that, he fired his weapon in the air. I don't understand Hebrew, but I gathered that he said the next rifle shot would hit me. In that moment, I thought I was going to die.”

Injured, handcuffed and blindfolded, Ballal and two other Palestinians were moved by the soldiers to a military vehicle and then to a police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where they spent the night on the floor and were forced to sleep under a freezing air conditioner.

Ballal said he was beaten by IDF soldiers while in detention. “It was a revenge for our movie,” he said. “I heard the voices of the soldiers, they were laughing about me … I heard [the word] ‘Oscar'.”

His lawyer, Lea Tsemel, said the three received only minimal care for their injuries from the attack and that she had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.

A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces denied Ballal was beaten in detention. They said: “The claims that the detainees were beaten during the night at an IDF detention facility were found to be entirely baseless.

“IDF forces facilitated medical treatment for the detainees after the initial transfer of the suspects to the Israel police, and throughout the night the detainees remained in a military detention facility while handcuffed in accordance with operational protocol.”

The spokesperson did not respond to Ballal's allegations that he was beaten by IDF soldiers in front of his house.

Born in 1989 in Susya, Hamdan Ballal Al-Huraini went on to become a film-maker, photographer and human rights activist. He won acclaim as co-director of No Other Land (2024), which exposes Israeli settler violence and the displacement of Palestinian communities in Masafer Yatta between 2019 and 2023.

Earlier this month, he and the film's other directors appeared on stage at the 97th Academy Awards in Los Angeles to accept the Oscar for best documentary.

The joint Israeli-Palestinian production has won a string of awards, starting at the Berlin international film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad. The mayor Miami Beach in Florida proposed ending the lease of a theatre that screened it. Israel's culture minister, Miki Zohar, has called the Oscar win “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.

“We won the Oscar just three weeks ago, and the violence has escalated,” Ballal said. “Not only against me, not only against the activists and other crew members of the film, but against all the residents.”

The No Other Land co-director Yuval Abraham claimed on X that the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the Oscars, “sadly, declined to publicly support Hamdan Ballal while he was beaten and tortured by Israeli soldiers and settlers. Several US Academy members – especially in the documentary branch – pushed for a statement, but it was ultimately refused. We were told that because other Palestinians were beaten up in the settler attack, it could be considered unrelated to the film, so they felt no need to respond.

“In other words,” Abraham added, “while Hamdan was clearly targeted for making No Other Land, he was also targeted for being Palestinian – like countless others every day who are disregarded. This, it seems, gave the Academy an excuse to remain silent when a film-maker they honoured, living under Israeli occupation, needed them the most.”

The Academy has been contacted for comment.

The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. About 1,000 people have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards, and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.

During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians.

CJNV shared details of at least 43 attacks in the village of Susya since the beginning of the year, perpetrated by violent settlers.

“They won't stop here,” Ballal said. “The settlers will continue to attack us. I'm more scared now than before.

“After what they did to me,” he added, “I fear it could now happen to others.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Günther Felßner says wife was ‘in fear of life and limb' after animal rights group climbed shed and set off flares

The conservative pick for German agriculture minister has withdrawn his candidacy after animal rights activists stormed his farm, prompting cross-party condemnation.

Günther Felßner, a farming lobbyist who had won the backing of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), said his wife was “in fear of life and limb” when activists climbed on to the cattle shed she was in to hang a banner and light smoke-emitting flares on Monday.

Felßner said he would withdraw his candidacy as a result of the protest, which politicians have criticised as antidemocratic. The Bavarian conservative leader Markus Söder called it an “attack on rural life” and demanded a special investigation.

Cem Özdemir, the acting agriculture minister in the caretaker government, from the Greens, posted on X: “Intimidation and threats have absolutely no place in our democracy. Not against Günther Felßner and his family, nor against anyone else.”

Referring to the farmer protests which took place in Germany last year, Özdemir said: “This applies to everyone, and it applies just as much to gallows, ferry blockades, and all other attacks.”

Radical protests have become a polarising force in Germany, with political tolerance for disruptive actions – such as climate activists gluing themselves to runways and farmers blocking streets with tractors – often dependent on the group carrying them out.

The outgoing coalition's cuts to tractor diesel subsidies caused furious protests in 2024 that included sightings of makeshift gallows.

In January 2024, a mob trapped the Green economy minister, Robert Habeck, on a ferry with his wife when they were coming home from holiday. Ricarda Lang, the party's co-leader at the time, was stopped from leaving a party meeting the following month by farmers who lit fires and blocked roads with tractors.

Joachim Rukwied, the president of the German farmer's association, who previously described the ferry blockade as a “no-go”, said on Wednesday he was astonished by the protest at Felßner's farm and deeply regretted the withdrawal of his candidacy.

“Such criminal actions are crimes and have nothing to do with freedom of expression or legitimate protest,” he said. “We must not allow these radical activists to further poison democratic discourse.”

He added that he thought activists should not be allowed to bring class action lawsuits either.

Middle Franconia police said they were investigating 13 people on suspicion of trespass, two who they understood to have climbed on to the roof and lit a flare.

Animal Rebellion, which hung the banner that read “No animal exploiter as agriculture minister”, defended its protest as peaceful and suggested Felßner was using it as an excuse to quit because his candidacy was unpopular. An online petition to stop him from becoming a minister gathered 400,000 signatures.

Felßner was fined by a court in 2018 for discharging waste on to his neighbour's property that polluted the water and soil.He has also alarmed experts by calling on the public to “eat meat for the climate”. Animal agriculture is responsible for 12-20% of the greenhouse gas pollutants worsening extreme weather, and climate scientists have found that eating less meat is a vital step to stop the planet from heating.

“An agricultural lobbyist, convicted environmental criminal and science denier is not a suitable candidate for the agriculture ministry,” an activist from Animal Rebellion said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Mark Rutte says Nato needs to know US has its back but Europe must also do its fair share

Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte is speaking again, giving a lecture at the Warsaw School of Economics in which he strongly backs the role of the alliance and tells both Europe and the US that in the face of growing geopolitical challenges “this is not the time to go it alone.”

Here are the key passages so far:

I know there are questions about the strength of the transatlantic bond and the United States ‘ commitment to European security. There is tough rhetoric. There are difficult debates between Europe and America over trade and tariffs, and there are calls to revive ideas of European autonomy. 

Let me be absolutely clear: this is not the time to go it alone, not for Europe or North America. 

The global security challenges are too great for any of us to face on our own. 

When it comes to keeping Europe and North America safe, there is no alternative to Nato. Without the US, UK, Turkey, Canada, Norway and Iceland, it is impossible to imagine the defence of Europe, and nothing can replace America's nuclear umbrella, the ultimate guarantor of our security.

Rutte also added that he was “absolutely confident that United States remains committed to Nato and to Article Five,” adding:

“Don't just take my word for it. 

Listen to President Trump, who has repeatedly stated his commitment to a strong Nato. 

Listen to the strong bipartisan support in the US Congress, and listen to the American people, three quarters of whom support Nato, according to a recent poll.”

On earlier reports about four US troops and a vehicle missing in Lithuania (15:18), Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte told reporters that they were confirmed as dead.

Starting his news briefing after delivering a speech at the Warsaw School of Economics, he said:

Whilst I was speaking, the news came out about four American soldiers who were killed in an incident in Lithuania.

That's still early news, so we do not know the details, but obviously this is really terrible news, and our thoughts are with families and loved ones.

I sent a message to the American secretary of defence Pete Hegseth that, of course, our thoughts and prayers are with the families and with the United States.

Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT said the four servicemen “may have been killed,” but “this has not been officially confirmed,” while other Lithuanian outlets – TV3 and Lrytas – unofficially reported their deaths.

Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda was quoted by TV3 as saying that he was being kept up to date, but refusing to elaborate as “the circumstances are being clarified”.

LRT also reported that Lithuanian defence minister Dovilė Šakalienė was on the way to the training base.

A statement from the US army's Europe and Africa public affairs office in Wiesbaden, Germany, said earlier that the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time.

“A possible scene has now been identified, and a search and rescue operation is underway,” the Lithuanian military said in a statement.

In the meantime, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Paris, where he is due to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron this evening ahead of tomorrow's summit of the “coalition of the willing”.

He will also give a joint TV interview to France 2 and the European Broadcasting Union, which will be conducted by Caroline Roux (France 2), Jeremy Bowen (BBC), Jessy Wellmer (ARD), and Joakim Klementi (Estonian Public Broadcasting).

Rutte also gets asked about the suggestions that France could extend its nuclear deterrent programme to cover other countries.

Rutte says he “highly respects” both French and British nuclear deterrents, but insists that “there is no alternative to the nuclear umbrella the US is providing us.”

“When you look at an amount of nuclear warheads pointed at us from Russia, and increasingly, by the way, from China who will get to 1000 warheads by 2030, the only credible nuclear deterrence and ultimate guarantor of our freedom here is the United States of America. … 

There's no way the French and the Brits can replace this. 

And still, it is important that they have that nuclear deterrence, so I'm all for it, but it is not an alternative.”

He also once again seeks to reassure Europeans that the US remains committed to Article 5, pointing to Trump's comments in meetings with European leaders, and also because:

“The US realises that for their collective defence connected to the Euro-Atlantic Theater, including what they want to achieve in the Indo Pacific, being together as 32 allies … as one group, also projecting Nato/American power in the world, it is unbeatable.”

“We can worry about many things, but let's stop worrying about it,” he says.

And that's it for this event.

Discussing the question of security and defence funding, Rutte says that Donald Trump's inauguration in January radically changed the way the allies look at their budget planning.

He says:

Since then, look what happened. 

Belgium has been saying we want to get to 2% by the summer. Spain now is saying they want to get to 2% this summer. 

We know that Portugal, Italy, they all have these debates now.

And I tell them that, well, now I am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2% by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2% because we have to spend much, much more than 2% but now I am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from Washington on the line if you don't listen to me. 

And I would love to listen into those phone calls, but let's hope they are not necessary. 

At this moment, I must say that all these non two percenters are having genuine debates to move to the 2% before summer.

(Who am I to disagree, but since he mentioned it: Spain remains committed to meeting 2% only in… 2029 (11:05), although prime minister Sanchez has suggested he would try to do it sooner than that.)

Rutte is now taking questions.

Asked about the US-led peace talks with Russia and Ukraine, he says he is “glad that president Trump broke the deadlock,” and remains “positive” about the negotiations.

“It will be a step by step process. Nato gets regular updates. I know the Europeans are as much as possible involved. 

But in the end, of course, these are conducted by the Americans with the Ukrainians and the Russians.

He goes on:

We always have been very clear. We need to bring Ukraine to a durable, a lasting peace. Vladimir Vladimirovich should never try again to attack Ukraine.

He notes the Franco-British initiative to offer security guarantees for Ukraine, which will meet in Paris on Thursday, saying Macron and Starmer are “working hard to bring together European countries to potentially help maintaining peace in Ukraine.”

“The most important thing is that these discussions are now taking place, but obviously you first need a peace deal before you can keep a peace. 

You can only keep a peace if there is a peace to keep, and that is exactly the process we are now in.”

Rutte also clearly rejects Putin's demand to have a say in a broader security landscape in Europe.

“He has absolutely no say in how we organise ourselves within the 32 alliance. Absolutely no say at all. 

And I hate this whole idea of having a sort of two tier Nato that you have somehow the eight countries on the eastern flank, different from the other 24 allies … 

With the latest missile technology coming out of Russia, the difference between an attack on Warsaw or an attack in Madrid is 10 minutes. So we are all on the eastern flank. Amsterdam is at the eastern flank. London is at the eastern flank. Even Washington is at the eastern flank. …

It is important to realise this and Putin has to know that [if] he would try to get a square kilometre of Estonia or of Poland, or of Slovakia, or for of Spain or Portugal, for that matter, that our reaction will be devastating and that the full onslaught of Nato will be upon him.”

Attempting to explain some of Trump's frustration with burden sharing, Nato's Rutte wants to send a clear signal to European countries to step up their defence and spending responsibilities within the alliance, as he says:

Yes, Europe needs to know that Uncle Sam still has our back.

But America also needs to know that its Nato allies will step up.

Without restrictions and without capability gaps. It's only fair.

Reassurance is a two-way street.

The US commitment to Nato comes with a clear expectation that European allies and Canada take more responsibility for our shared security.

He adds that the alliance will look at this issue again during the upcoming summit in the Hague in June.

He says:

A fair Nato means all allies doing their fair share, and a more lethal Nato means that where we will always remain a defensive alliance, we will always be ready and able to do whatever it takes to stay safe.

He then also notes a “sea change” in spending over the last year alone, as he acknowledges Poland's position at the top Nato spender at 4.7% GDP, but also gives credit to other countries that have committed “to considerably ramp up spending.”

“This acceleration is absolutely necessary, and we have to keep our foot on the gas [pedal,]” he says.

Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte is speaking again, giving a lecture at the Warsaw School of Economics in which he strongly backs the role of the alliance and tells both Europe and the US that in the face of growing geopolitical challenges “this is not the time to go it alone.”

Here are the key passages so far:

Poland moves closer to implementing the controversial plans to temporarily suspend the right to claim asylum for irregular migrants coming from Belarus after the country's president, Andrzej Duda, signed the law reforming the existing rules.

The move came after repeated requests from prime minister Donald Tusk, who said earlier this week that an implementing act was waiting for the law to enter into force.

The government is planning an information campaign in foreign languages to target migrants in their countries of origin and discourage them from attempting to cross the border, he said.

Any suspension of the right to claim asylum would need to be territorially limited and time restricted to 60 days but could be then further extended by a vote in parliament.

Polish broadcaster TVN24 noted that the law includes an exemption for unaccompanied minors, pregnant women, and particularly vulnerable people, who will still be able to seek to claim asylum.

Last week, Tusk explained the reform was needed to counter “the pressure on our border with Belarus … which is growing” as he accused Alexander Lukashenko and Russia's Vladimir Putin of encouraging irregular migration to put pressure on the EU's external borders.

According to the Polish government, people trying to cross the border in 2024 came from 51 countries, with the greatest numbers coming from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Syria.

The European Commission responded to reports of Russia seeking sanctions relief as part of a maritime ceasefire in Ukraine, saying today that one of its main precondition would be to see “the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces” from Ukraine.

In a stark response to Russian demands, EU spokesperson said in a statement, reported by Reuters:

The end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine would be one of the main preconditions to amend or lift sanctions.

The spokesperson added that “Russia must now demonstrate genuine political will to end its illegal and unprovoked war of aggression.”

She also pointedly noted that “experience has shown that Russia must be judged by its actions, not by its words.”

Four US army soldiers have gone missing in Lithuania during a scheduled tactical training, the US embassy in Vilnius said in a social media post.

US Army, Lithuanian Armed Forces and Lithuanian law enforcement agencies are conducting a search operation.

The four soldiers are all from 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, the statement said.

The V Corps commanding general Lt. Gen. Charles Costanza thanked the authorities for their help as the search continues.

Austria said it would pause family reunifications for those with asylum status from May, becoming the first in the European Union to do so.

Interior minister Gerhard Karner said in a government press release the move was necessary to counter the impact on “schools, health system and even security” in the country.

It said that in 2023 and 2024, over 17,000 came to Austria through the scheme, mostly underage school-age children from Syria.

After new security measures were implemented, including DNA testing and document verification, the number of successful applications has dropped to just 60 in February 2025, down from a thousand a year earlier.

“By May, so in just a few weeks, the stop is expected to become reality,” integration minister Claudia Plakolm told reporters, adding the country's “systems have reached their limits”.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen hinted that the EU could step in to support Radio Free Europe after recent US funding cuts by the Trump administration.

Responding to a push from a coalition of countries, led by the Czech Republic, von der Leyen said:

Radio Free Europe provides independent reporting to many countries where media freedom is threatened. We‘ll work with partners including [flags of the Czech Republic, Austria, Belgium, Lithuanian, Latvia, Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Slovenia] to support @RFERL‘s award winning journalism. The world needs media freedom.

The European Union has announced its EU Preparedness Union Strategy, outlining plans to prevent and respond to new crises and threats, such as floods, wildfires, or conflicts. The strategy includes stark advice to keep essential supplies to get through 72 hours of an emergency.

EU social rights and preparedness commissioner Roxana Mînzatu said the bloc wanted to “talk to our citizens, of all generations” to make sure they are “equipped, skilled, prepared” to react to power cuts, natural disasters, and other potential issues.

The underlying report said that the EU crisis management is “mostly reactive, rather than pro-active,” with insufficient tools for spotting risks early, and fragmented response mechanisms.

The strategy proposes 30 actions, including developing “minimum preparedness criteria” for essential services, enhancing the stockpiling of critical equipment and materials, and encouraging the public to adopt practical measures, such as “maintaining essential supplies for a minimum of 72 hours in emergencies.”

Senator Mark Warner, who questioned national intelligence director and CIA director on Tuesday says messages clearly classified as Gabbard doubles down on claims

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who grilled top security officials during Tuesday's Senate intelligence committee briefing, appeared on Morning Joe this morning to discuss the recently released text messages published by the Atlantic on Wednesday.

“Well it sure answers that the two witnesses I believe lied when they said, ‘Oh, nothing to see here, nothing classified,'” he said.

“You would have to be an idiot not to understand that what Jeffrey [Goldberg] just laid out is at a huge classification level. That if it had fallen into enemy hands and the Houthis had been able to realign their offenses, American lives could be lost,” he added.

Warner and other senators questioned Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and CIA director John Ratcliffe about the group chat that discussed war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Gabbard said on Tuesday that “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.

Donald Trump will hold a press conference to announce tariffs on the auto industry today at 4pm, according to the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Wednesday's press conference will be in the Oval Office.

National security adviser Michael Waltz said on Fox News that a staffer wasn't responsible for adding the Atlantic's editor-in-chief to the group chat and that he “takes full responsibility” for building the group and maintaining coordination.

“Have you ever had somebody's contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else's number?,” Waltz said.

“You have somebody else's number on someone else's contact, so of course I didn't see this loser in the group,” he added, referring to the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.

The Guardian's Peter Beaumont offers an analysis of what the latest Signal leak revelations expose:

The disclosure by the Atlantic of further devastating messages from the Signal chat group used by the Trump administration's most senior security officials has nailed the lie that nothing that threatened the safety of US servicemen and women was shared on the group.

After the vague and evasive assertions by Trump officials at Monday's Senate intelligence committee hearing, from the White House, and from the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that no war plans or classified material was shared, readers can make up their own minds.

Despite Hegseth's angry denial, the exchanges in the leaked group chat did contain details of war planning, shared recklessly by him in advance of the attack on 15 March, on a messaging system and perhaps devices which he and others in the chat could not have been certain were secure.

Most damning is the fact that Hegseth sent details in advance of the F-18s and other aircraft that would take part in the attack, including the timing of their arrival at targets, and other assets that would be deployed.

As Ryan Goodman, a law professor who formerly worked at the Pentagon, put it after the latest release: “The Atlantic has now published the Signal texts with attack plans in response to administration denials. I worked at the Pentagon. If information like this is not classified, nothing is. If Hegseth is claiming he declassified this information, he should be shown the door for having done so.”

In attempting to cover up and diminish their culpability for a shocking breach of operational security – including the fact that two participants in the chat were overseas (including one in Moscow at the time) – the Trump administration has made the scandal immeasurably more serious than it was already.

At the most simple level, the pilots who flew on those strikes should rightly be furious that the most senior civilian defence official placed them in harm's way.

Read the full analysis here:

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly.

“This is what happens when you don't really have your act together,” the Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski told the Hill.

The Trump administration has been facing criticism from Democrats – and now Republicans – after Monday's embarrassing revelation that a team of senior national security officials accidentally added a journalist to a private group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app. The group, which included the vice-president, JD Vance; the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and others, discussed sensitive plans to engage in military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

On Wednesday morning the Atlantic posted another tranche of messages that contained details of the attack on Yemen, including descriptions of targets, launch times and even the details of weather during the assault.

Senior national security officials testified before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday, where the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA director, John Ratcliffe, were grilled by lawmakers over the scandal. The national security officials said “no classified material” was shared in the chat. Republicans are now calling for investigations as well.

Read the full story by José Olivares here:

National security officials have wrapped up their testimonies before the House intelligence committee on Wednesday.

A closed session will be held at 2pm ET today.

“Classified information is classified for a reason. Sec. Hegseth was openly sharing classified materials on an insecure channel that potentially endangered service members. And then he lied about it. He should resign,” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said on X, just moments after questioning intelligence officials at Wednesday's hearing.

“It is completely outrageous to me that administration officials come before us today with impunity, no acceptance of responsibility,” said Jason Crow of Colorado. He said the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, “must resign immediately. There can be no fixes, there can be no corrections until there is accountability.”
 Other Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee rejected assertions by Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe that no classified material was included in the chat. They pointed to chat messages released by the Atlantic on Wednesday as evidence the leak could have jeopardized the mission's success or endangered US service members' lives.

Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Alina Habba, downplayed the controversy over the group chat that mistakenly included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief.

“Look, it is what it is,” Habba told reporters. “At the end of the day, this is – in my opinion – something that they're making a big to do about nothing. A reporter that is trying to get clout.

“We stand by Mike Waltz; he's doing a tremendous job. I think this is a distraction.”

The Democratic representative Jimmy Gomez of California asked Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, and the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, whether the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, was drinking before the group chat discussions regarding war plans in Yemen were published.

“That's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is, no,” Ratcliffe said. “I just wish in an annual threats hearing, where the American people want to hear about threats, that that's what we would be talking about.”

Gabbard said: “Secretary Hegseth, in my experience, has continued to operate in the way that President Trump's confidence in him inspires, which is in the best interest of the American people and our war fighters and ensuring our national security, I think it's wrong to impugn him, especially at a point where he is not here to defend his own honor.”

The Republican senator Lindsey Graham defended Donald Trump and other members of his administration over their handling of the fiasco involving top national security officials discussing US military attack plans in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.

“President Trump and his team have admitted that having a journalist in the group text was wrong, will be reviewed and falls in the category of ‘lessons learned' so that it doesn't happen again,” Graham said in a statement. “I believe that all the participants in the chat were under the impression they were using an appropriate and secure form of communication. This will also fall into the category of ‘lessons learned'.

“However recent revelations about the content of the texts – while not discussing war plans per se – do in fact detail very sensitive information about a planned and ongoing military operation,” he added.

The US district court judge James Boasberg, whom the government has argued cannot be trusted with sensitive information in the Alien Enemies Act case, has been assigned to oversee a lawsuit alleging that government officials violated federal record-keeping laws when they used a group chat to discuss a planned military strike in Yemen, Politico reports.

“Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations,” the plaintiffs argue.

The Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi had an aide hold up Signal messages released by the Atlantic that showed the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, shared in the group exact details of the strikes against the Houthis.

“This is classified information. It's a weapon system as well as sequence of strikes, as well as details about the operations,” Krishnamoorthi said. “This text message is clearly classified information. Secretary Hegseth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information. He needs to resign immediately.”

Warner and other senators questioned Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and CIA director John Ratcliffe about the group chat that discussed war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Gabbard said on Tuesday that “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.

As he had done before the Senate the day before, CIA director John Ratcliffe insisted he broke no rules and did not share classified information.

“I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information. And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success is what everyone should be focused on here, because that's what did happen, not possibly could have happened,” Ratcliffe told the House intelligence committee.

The House intelligence committee's top Democrat Jim Himes asked Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, why she had told senators on Tuesday that no details of timing, targets or weapons were revealed in the Signal group chat.

The Atlantic this morning published the transcript of the chat, which showed that defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared such details with the chat's participants ahead of the US military's airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

“My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof, on the details that were posted there ... What was shared today reflects the fact that I was not directly involved with that part of the Signal chat and replied at the end, reflecting the effects, the very brief effects that the national security advisor had shared,” Gabbard replied.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

This live blog is now closed, you can read more of our Middle East coverage here

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated threats on Wednesday to seize territory in the Gaza Strip if Hamas failed to release the remaining hostages it still holds.

“The more Hamas continues in its refusal to release our hostages, the more powerful the repression we exert will be,” Netanyahu told a hearing in parliament, which was occasionally interrupted by shouting from opposition members. “This includes seizing territory and it includes other things,” he said, according to Reuters.

It is approaching 5pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv, and 6pm in Damascus. This blog will be closing shortly but you can find all of the Guardian's latest Middle East coverage here.

Here are the key developments from today's Middle East live blog:

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated threats on Wednesday to seize territory in the Gaza Strip if Hamas failed to release the remaining hostages it still holds. “The more Hamas continues in its refusal to release our hostages, the more powerful the repression we exert will be,” Netanyahu told a hearing in parliament. “This includes seizing territory and it includes other things,” he said.

Hamas warned on Wednesday that hostages may be killed if Israel attempts to retrieve them by force and airstrikes continue in the Gaza Strip. The group said in a statement that it was “doing everything possible to keep the occupation's captives alive, but the random Zionist (Israeli) bombardment is endangering their lives,” adding: “every time the occupation attempts to retrieve its captives by force, it ends up bringing them back in coffins”.

US vice-president JD Vance on Wednesday dismissed a magazine story on the Trump administration inadvertently sending plans for an imminent attack on Yemen to a journalist as “oversold,” after the publication released the transcript. Yesterday, the US president, Donald Trump, defended his embattled national security adviser, Michael Waltz, and said the leak of highly classified military plans was “the only glitch in two months”.

Hundreds of Palestinians have joined protests in northern Gaza, shouting anti-Hamas slogans and calling for an end to the war with Israel, in what has been described as the largest protest against the militant group inside the territory since the 7 October attacks. Videos and photos shared on social media late on Tuesday showed hundreds of people, mostly men, chanting “Hamas out” and “Hamas terrorists” in Beit Lahia, where the crowd had gathered a week after the Israeli army resumed its intense bombing of Gaza after nearly two months of a truce.

Netanyahu on Wednesday accused the opposition of fuelling “anarchy” in Israel, after mass anti-government protests in recent days. Addressing the opposition during a speech in parliament, Netanyahu said: “Perhaps you could stop putting spanners in the works of the government in the middle of a war? Perhaps you could stop fuelling the sedition, hatred and anarchy in the streets?”

Thousands of Israelis have taken part in several days of anti-government protests, accusing Netanyahu of undermining democracy and resuming strikes in Gaza without regard for hostages. The demonstrations which erupted last week have been organised by a broad coalition of anti-Netanyahu groups, who called to protest against the premier's move to oust Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security agency. After a rally in Tel Aviv, protesters are due to travel to Jerusalem for an anti-government demonstration outside parliament on Wednesday evening.

An Oscar-winning Palestinian director who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces has been released from detention. Hamdan Ballal and two other Palestinians left a police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where they were being held on Tuesday. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes. The three had spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack, according to Ballal's lawyer, Lea Tsemel.

The Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday that at least 830 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel resumed large-scale strikes on 18 March. According to the ministry's statement, the figure included 38 people killed in the past 24 hours. It also reported that the overall death toll had reached 50,183 since the war began on 7 October 2023.

Houthi media in Yemen reported on Wednesday at least 17 strikes in Saada and Amran, blaming the United States for the attacks. The rebels' Ansarollah website said US warplanes carried out “aggressive air raids … causing material damage to citizens' property”, but gave no details of casualties. Washington on 15 March announced a military offensive against the Houthis, promising to use overwhelming force until the group stopped firing on vessels in the key shipping routes of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

Israel's military said two projectiles were fired from Gaza into Israeli territory on Wednesday, with one intercepted and the other falling in an area near the Gaza border.

Syria described Israeli attacks as a “flagrant violation” of its sovereignty after a deadly bombardment on Tuesday in the country's south, where Israel's military said it had responded to incoming fire. The violence near the UN-patrolled buffer zone on the Golan Heights followed Israeli airstrikes in central Syria.

Japan's defence minister Gen Nakatani says his country will provide medical treatment for two Palestinian women for injuries and illnesses from the conflict in Gaza. One of them has arrived in Tokyo, he added. “[The women] are supposed to return to their original places after treatment, and their visit is not meant for settling in Japan,” Nakatani said.

France is “deeply concerned” by the arrests of journalists in Turkey including Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer Yasin Akgul in the crackdown on protests after the jailing of the Istanbul mayor, a French diplomatic source told AFP on Wednesday. The source, asking not to be named, added that Akgul “was covering the protests professionally”.

Geir Pedersen, the UN special envoy for Syria, told the UN security council it “must not come to pass” that Syria backslides into conflict, fragmentation, and having its sovereignty routinely violated by external powers. Pedersen said the other road, restoring sovereignty and regional security, “requires the right Syrian decisions,” but the country's interim authorities cannot do it alone and need increased and continuing international support.

Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet in Jerusalem on Sunday, two Greek sources told Reuters on Wednesday. The agenda of the talks was expected to be extensive, one of the sources said. The two leaders last met in Israel in 2023.

Syria's authorities delayed a visit planned for Wednesday by the Lebanese defence minister that aimed to discuss tensions along the border, officials from the two countries told AFP. “We were informed on Tuesday by the Syrian party of the postponement of the visit” of Lebanese minister Michel Menassa, a Lebanese official told AFP on condition of anonymity. The delay was “in no way related to tensions or conflicts”, the official added, without specifying the date to which it had been postponed.

UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said Syria can return to violence and monopolies of power – or launch an inclusive transition, overcome conflict and realise the aspirations of its people, reports the Associated Press (AP).
 He told the UN security council it “must not come to pass” that Syria backslides into conflict, fragmentation, and having its sovereignty routinely violated by external powers. Pedersen said the other road, restoring sovereignty and regional security, “requires the right Syrian decisions,” but the country's interim authorities cannot do it alone and need increased and continuing international support.
 The UN special envoy, who will be returning to Damascus shortly, highlighted several priority areas for action and attention. He asked whether the soon-to-be announced transitional government and transitional legislative council reflect Syria's diversity, and include both men and women.
 Pedersen said developments on a new constitution, accountability for crimes committed over decades, security, foreign fighters and the economy must also be addressed, reports the AP.

Japan's defence minister Gen Nakatani says his country will provide medical treatment for two Palestinian women for injuries and illnesses from the conflict in Gaza. One of them has arrived in Tokyo, he added, according to the Associated Press (AP).
 Nakatani said on Wednesday that one patient is being treated at the Self-defence Forces Central hospital. Another patient is to arrive within days, he said. Both women were previously being treated in Egypt. Nakatani did not give further details about the patients, their conditions or their expected length of stay in Japan, reports the AP.
 The treatments, Nakatani said, are part of Japan's efforts to address the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and followed a request from the World Health Organization.
 “[The women] are supposed to return to their original places after treatment, and their visit is not meant for settling in Japan,” Nakatani said.

US vice-president JD Vance on Wednesday dismissed a magazine story on the Trump administration inadvertently sending plans for an imminent attack on Yemen to a journalist as “oversold,” after the publication released the transcript, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“It's very clear [Jeffrey] Goldberg oversold what he had,” Vance posted on X, referring to the Atlantic editor-in-chief who was mistakenly included in the group chat of top Trump officials discussing military plans.

“No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS,” posted national security adviser Mike Waltz, who has admitted being responsible for Goldberg being added to the group on commercial chat app Signal.

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday accused the opposition of fuelling “anarchy” in Israel, after mass anti-government protests in recent days, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Addressing the opposition during a speech in parliament, Netanyahu said:

You recycle the same worn-out and ridiculous slogans about 'the end of democracy'. Well, once and for all: Democracy is not in danger, it is the power of the bureaucrats that is in danger”.

Perhaps you could stop putting spanners in the works of the government in the middle of a war? Perhaps you could stop fuelling the sedition, hatred and anarchy in the streets?”

Thousands of Israelis have taken part in several days of anti-government protests, accusing Netanyahu of undermining democracy and resuming strikes in Gaza without regard for hostages.

The demonstrations which erupted last week have been organised by a broad coalition of anti-Netanyahu groups, who called to protest against the premier's move to oust Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security agency.

Israel's opposition filed an appeal against the move to dismiss Bar, calling it “a decision based on flagrant conflict of interest”. Netanyahu has pressed ahead with proceedings to sack Bar, a move which the supreme court blocked on Friday.

The government has also begun proceedings to dismiss attorney general Gali Baharav-Miara, who has challenged the legality of some of Netanyahu's policies.

After a rally in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, protesters are due to travel to Jerusalem for an anti-government demonstration outside parliament on Wednesday evening, reports AFP.

Here are some more images coming in via the newswires:

The Atlantic magazine on Wednesday published what it said was the full text of a chat group mistakenly shared with a journalist by top Trump administration officials laying out plans of an imminent attack on Yemen.

Details, including the times of strikes and types of planes being used, were all laid out in screenshots of the chat, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

The magazine said it was publishing after the Trump administration repeatedly denied that any classified information had been included in the unsecure chat.

As reported earlier, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to seize parts of Gaza if Hamas does not release hostages.

Hamas said, in a statement, that hostages would return “in coffins” if Israel continues bombing the territory.

Netanyahu told parliament on Wednesday that “the more Hamas persists in its refusal to release our hostages, the stronger the pressure we will exert”.

“This includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here,” he added, days after his defence minister Israel Katz had warned: “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel”.

“Every time the occupation attempts to retrieve its captives by force, it ends up bringing them back in coffins,” Hamas said in a statement on Wednesday.

The militant group said it was “doing everything possible to keep the (Israeli) occupation's captives alive, but the random Zionist bombardment is endangering their lives”.

Gal Gilboa-Dalal, an Israeli survivor of the 2023 attack whose brother was taken hostage, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) he can “constantly imagine our reunion. This moment felt closer than ever, and unfortunately, it's drifting away from me again,” he said of his brother Guy Gilboa-Dalal, taken from a music festival near the Gaza border and last seen in a video shared by Hamas last month.

“We are fighting here against a terrorist organisation that only understands force,” said Gal. “On the other hand, I am terrified that these bombings and this operation … will endanger the hostages there. There's no way to know what the terrorists might do to them or if a missile might accidentally hit them,” he added.

France is “deeply concerned” by the arrests of journalists in Turkey including Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer Yasin Akgul in the crackdown on protests after the jailing of the Istanbul mayor, a French diplomatic source told AFP on Wednesday.

“We are deeply concerned by reports of repression against protesters and journalists in Turkey,” said the source, asking not to be named, adding that Akgul “was covering the protests professionally”.

Palestinians involved in yesterday and today's anti-Hamas protests in Gaza have spoken about their motivations with local journalists. 
 “We are sick of the bombing, killing and displacement,” Ammar Hassan, a young man from Beit Lahiya who took part in the protest, told the Associated Press.
 Hassan said it started as an anti-war protest with just a few dozen people but then swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.
 “It's the only party we can affect,” he said over the phone to the AP. “Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but it can affect Hamas,” he said.
 “The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,” said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father-of-three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined the demonstration. “We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,” he said.
 A similar protest erupted in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya, according to witnesses.
 One of the protesters in Jabaliya, who requested anonymity, said they joined the demonstration because “everyone failed us.” They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the western-backed Palestinian Authority and even Arab mediators.

Syria's authorities delayed a visit planned for Wednesday by the Lebanese defence minister that aimed to discuss tensions along the border, officials from the two countries told Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“We were informed on Tuesday by the Syrian party of the postponement of the visit” of Lebanese minister Michel Menassa, a Lebanese official told AFP on condition of anonymity. The delay was “in no way related to tensions or conflicts”, the official added, without specifying the date to which it had been postponed.

A Syrian government source meanwhile told AFP that the delay was due to “preparations for the formation of a new government”.

Menassa had been set to meet his Syrian counterpart, Murhaf Abu Qasra, in the first visit by a Lebanese minister since the cabinet was formed in February.

Border tensions flared earlier in March after Syria's new authorities accused Lebanese armed group Hezbollah of kidnapping three soldiers into Lebanon and killing them. The Iran-backed group, which fought alongside the forces of toppled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, denied involvement. But the ensuing cross-border clashes left seven Lebanese dead.

Israel's military said two projectiles were fired from Gaza into Israeli territory on Wednesday, with one intercepted and the other falling in an area near the Gaza border, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“Following the sirens that sounded at 12.03 (10.03 GMT) in the communities near the Gaza Strip, two projectiles were identified crossing into Israeli territory from central Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement.

It added:

One projectile was successfully intercepted by the IAF (air force) and a fallen projectile was identified in the area of Zimrat”.

As we reported earlier, hundreds of Palestinians joined protests in northern Gaza, shouting anti-Hamas slogans and calling for an end to the war with Israel, in what has been described as the largest protest against the militant group inside the territory since the 7 October attacks.

Here is a video report on the story:

Agence France-Presse (AFP) has a little bit more detail on Netanyahu's comments today (see 10.43am GMT). The news agency reports the Israeli prime minister as saying:

The more Hamas persists in its refusal to release our hostages, the stronger the pressure we will exert.

I say this to my colleagues in the Knesset, and I say it to Hamas as well: This includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here.”

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated threats on Wednesday to seize territory in the Gaza Strip if Hamas failed to release the remaining hostages it still holds.

“The more Hamas continues in its refusal to release our hostages, the more powerful the repression we exert will be,” Netanyahu told a hearing in parliament, which was occasionally interrupted by shouting from opposition members. “This includes seizing territory and it includes other things,” he said, according to Reuters.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Fintech firm, operating CashApp, Square and Tidal, to close nearly 800 open jobs in second such move in just over a year

Block, Jack Dorsey's financial technology company, plans to let go almost 1,000 current employees, while making other changes to its operations in its second such move in just over a year.

Dorsey, who co-founded and previously ran Twitter before co-founding Block in 2009, informed employees of the impending cuts on Tuesday in an email, viewed by the Guardian, titled “smaller block”. The layoffs will impact more than 930 employees, with another nearly 200 managers being moved into non-management roles, and another nearly 800 open jobs will be closed, according to the email.

Block now operates payment platforms Square and Afterpay, the money transfer app CashApp, and the music streaming service Tidal.

Dorsey wrote in the email that the layoffs and other changes to staffing and organization are not being implemented with the intention of hitting “a specific financial target, replacing folks with AI, or changing our headcount cap”. As part of an earlier reorganization that began in early 2024 and also saw roughly 1,000 Block employees lose their jobs, Dorsey implemented a headcount maximum of 12,000 employees.

Instead, Dorsey wrote that this additional reorganization is about “raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move fast and with less abstraction”, according to the email. Last year Dorsey struck a similar tone in notifying staffers of layoffs, saying the company needed to “build like a startup again”.

In Tuesday's email, Dorsey added that he was enacting cuts to staff and management levels and closing open jobs all at once, instead of over time, because “we're behind in our actions, and that's not fair to the individual or the company.”

Block's stock is down 29% this year so far. Its revenue and profits have grown less over the last year, creating shareholder concern, even as Dorsey has taken back more operating control during that time. Dorsey noted in his email that part of his job is to increase the company's stock value and that this reorganization “will help us focus and execute better to do just that”.

“When we know, we should move, and there hasn't been enough movement,” the CEO wrote. “And we need to move faster to stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in, so we're able to continue increasing access, openness and automation.”

A spokesperson for Block did not respond to calls and email seeking comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

BBC's international editor says lack of access is ‘because there's stuff they don't want us to see'

Jeremy Bowen, the BBC's international editor, has accused the Israeli government of blocking journalists from Gaza because of scenes “they don't want us to see”.

Bowen said that in the last 18 months, he had been granted only half a day with the Israeli army within Gaza. He said that the lack of access was part of an attempt to “obfuscate what's going on, and to inject this notion of doubt into information that comes out”.

Speaking after he accepted a special fellowship award for the Society of Editors conference, he said that while Palestinian journalists were doing “fantastic work”, he and other international media colleagues wanted to contribute to reporting on the ground in Gaza.

“Why don't they let us in,” he said. “Because there's stuff there they don't want us to see. Beginning after those Hamas attacks on 7 October, they took us into the border communities. I was in Kfar Aza when there was still fighting going on inside it. They had only just started taking out the bodies of the dead Israelis. Why did they let us in there? Because they wanted us to see it.

“Why don't they let us in to Gaza? Because they don't want us to see it. I think it's really as simple as that. Israel took a bit of flak for that to start with, but none now, certainly not with [President] Trump. So I don't see that changing anytime soon.”

The Israeli government has been approached for comment. However, Israel's military has previously said that it has escorted journalists to Gaza to allow them to report safely. According to the Foreign Press Association, Israel's defence authorities have said that journalists in Gaza could be at risk in wartime and could endanger soldiers by reporting on troop positions. Scores of journalists have been killed since the war started.

Asked about whether international media should trust Gaza casualty figures released by the territory's health ministry, which is led by Hamas, Bowen said the numbers were currently “the best measure that we have” because of the inability of reporters and other bodies to verify them. The ministry says more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war.

“I think without question, it's the bloodiest war that they've had since the foundation of the Israeli state of 1948,” Bowen said. “If the place could open up, people could go through, look at the records, count the graves, exhume the skeletons from under the rubble and then they'd get a better idea. But when the doors shut, these things become very, very difficult.”

Last year, Bowen was among 50 journalists, including the BBC's Lyse Doucet and its former presenter Mishal Husain, calling on Israel and Egypt to provide “free and unfettered access to Gaza for all foreign media”.

Bowen's intervention comes with the BBC still investigating the making of the documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, which was pulled from iPlayer after it emerged that the 13-year-old who narrated the film, Abdullah al-Yazouri, was the son of the deputy minister of agriculture in the Hamas government.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Award-winning film set in fictional town has already made its debut at Cannes but censors have refused to approve it for domestic release

Indian film censors have blocked the release of critically acclaimed film Santosh over concerns about its portrayal of misogyny, Islamophobia and violence in the Indian police force.

Santosh, written and directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri, is set in north India and has won international plaudits for its portrayal of a young widow who joins the police force and investigates the murder of a young Dalit girl.

The film is an unflinching fictional portrayal of the murkier elements of the Indian police force, depicting deep-rooted misogyny, discrimination against Dalits – the lowest caste in India previously known as untouchables – and the normalisation of mistreatment and torture by police officers. The film also grapples with the issue of sexual violence in India, particularly against lower caste women, and the rising tide of anti-Muslim prejudice in the country.

Santosh made its debut at Cannes film festival to widespread acclaim. It was the UK's official entry for the Oscars' international feature category and went on to be nominated for a Bafta for best debut feature this year, as well as receiving glowing reviews, including five stars in the Observer, which called it a “phenomenal achievement”. Its lead actor, Shahana Goswami, recently won best actress at the Asian film awards.

The film was made in India, has an entirely Indian cast and is all in Hindi, the dominant language of north India. The filmmakers had previously submitted the script in order to film in India and had faced no issues. India's largest cinema chain was also on board to distribute the film in January.

However, Indian audiences are unlikely to ever be able to see it in cinemas after censors on the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a government body which approves all cinematic releases, refused to do so for Santosh over concerns about its negative portrayal of the police.

Suri, the film's writer and director, described the decision by the censors as “disappointing and heartbreaking”.

“It was surprising for all of us because I didn't feel that these issues were particularly new to Indian cinema or hadn't been raised before by other films,” she said.

Suri said the censors had demanded a list radical cuts so lengthy and wide-ranging that they would be “impossible” to implement. Legal restrictions prevented her sharing exact details of the censor's demands, but she said that the list of cuts was so long it had gone on for several pages, and included concerns about themes relating to police conduct and wider societal problems which are deeply baked into the film.

“It was very important to me that the film is released in India so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work,” said Suri. “But in the end it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision.”

Suri emphasised that while the film offered an uncompromising depiction of the police, “I don't feel my film glorifies violence in a way that many other films focusing on the police have done. There's nothing sensationalist about it.”

The decision by the censorship board comes at a time when India's cultural sphere is seen to be more heavily policed than ever, with films and TV series dealing with politically sensitive themes often targeted with hate campaigns and police cases, or dropped by streaming platforms before they are released.

Suri admitted she had been “nervous” about releasing the film in India in the current climate but insisted it was “vitally important” for her that the very people affected by the issues in the film were able to see it. It was the incident in 2012 of a women raped on a bus in Delhi, commonly known as the Nirbhaya case, that had initially inspired her to make the film and she had collaborated with Indian non-government organisations when building up the story.

Police violence and torture is a well-documented issue in India. According to a 2020 Human Rights Watch report, police in India routinely use torture and flout arrest procedures with little or no accountability.

Depictions of police violence have also previously appeared in Indian cinema but Suri questioned whether the highly realistic depictions in Santosh – as opposed to the often stylised format of Bollywood and other Indian film industries – had caused discomfort among the censors.

“Maybe there's something about this film which is troubling in that everybody is morally compromised and there is no single hero,” she said. “I think that's what might set it apart from other stories in Indian cinema which often show a maverick cop in a rotten system.”

No Indian police figures have responded to coverage of the film, which is set in a fictional north Indian town. The CBFC have been contacted for comment.

There is no appeals process or negotiation allowed with the CBFC once their report is submitted and the matter can be contested only in court. However, Suri said she would still keep fighting to have the film available to Indian audiences.

“All my work has been about India; one film was deeply nostalgic, another was super beautiful and sensual,” she said, “Yes this one shows another face of the country. But there's humanity in everybody in this film.”

Film assistant says actor groped her several times in three incidents while filming Les Volets Verts

The French actor Gérard Depardieu sexually assaulted an assistant director on three occasions while she was working with him on a film shoot, placing his hands on her buttocks and breasts, leaving her feeling “petrified”, the woman told Paris's criminal court on Wednesday.

Depardieu – the biggest French cinema star to face trial for sexual assault since the #MeToo movement – is charged with sexually assaulting the assistant director three times during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021.

He is also on trial for the sexual assault of a set decorator on the same film, who alleged he gripped her hard between his legs while grabbing her body. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted of the offences.

Depardieu denies any wrongdoing, telling the court this week: “I deny all of it.”

The woman employed as third assistant film director has not been named in the media. She was tasked with accompanying Depardieu from his dressing room on to the set during the filming.

She told the court a first sexual assault happened during a night shoot in Paris, when she found herself alone with Depardieu at the end of a short road where his dressing room was located as they walked towards an outdoor set.

She said she felt his hand on her buttock. “It happened by surprise; I was shocked. I didn't know how to react … I carried on as if nothing had happened, kept walking to the set. I had a knot in my stomach.”

She said the second assault happened at a later date on a set inside a Paris apartment, where Depardieu blocked her against a door and put his two hands on her breasts. She told the court: “I said no. I was scared.” She said that on a third occasion Depardieu put his hand on her buttocks and she again said: “No.”

The assistant director told the court that before this, Depardieu “talked about sex all day on set, constantly talking of ‘pussy' to everyone”. She said: “He listens a lot, observes everyone, listens to everything and uses it later to humiliate everyone. At the time, I was having a difficult separation. I'd spoken to someone about it, so he mocked me for it. There were lewd comments, humiliations; it was an unhealthy environment.”

She said she felt ashamed of what Depardieu had done and did not want to speak out because she wanted to continue working on the film and handle the situation herself. But when her direct superior asked how she was getting on with Depardieu, she told her all that had happened.

The assistant director said that, after this, Depardieu shouted at her that she was a “snitch” and he was “odious” to her on set, calling her “crazy”.

She said Depardieu later said “sorry” to her in an angry way in front of other crew members. She said Depardieu said he did not want her coming to collect him from his dressing room any longer.

She said: “On the set I felt huge anxiety, stress, shame, guilt; it was very difficult.”

Asked by the head judge what she wanted from the trial, the assistant director said: “I want us to hear the truth and stop minimising what happened.”

Depardieu denied sexual assault. “I did not touch her buttocks, I did not touch her breasts, I did none of that,” he said.

He told the court: “I'm not like that. I can't be like that … I've never of my own will touched a buttock like that, even furtively. It wouldn't cross my mind.”

Asked by the complainant's lawyer about the allegations of touching the woman's buttocks he said: “I didn't sexually assault. A sexual assault is more serious than that I think.”

Asked to clarify, he said he didn't know what sexual assault was.

He said that at the time, he couldn't walk 150 metres in the street on his own because of his health, weight and joint troubles. He said he was almost always accompanied by a bodyguard or aides on the film set, and was never alone with an assistant director.

Depardieu said of the assistant director: “I think that maybe, I don't know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,” Depardieu said. “But I'm not only that. I still respect people.”

He said he was not someone “who touches people”.

He said that he had later asked the production to make sure it was a man who collected him from his dressing room instead of a woman because he always made lewd comments in his dressing room and didn't want women to be shocked if they overheard them.

He said: “I'm crude and vulgar. I say things that can shock young people.” He told the court that on a previous film he'd said: “Bring me a man who's not shocked by my language,” and: “Stop putting in girls who are shocked by what I say.”

He denied shouting at the assistant director.

The French actor Fanny Ardant, a close friend of Depardieu, testified in his support. She said she had never witnessed any inappropriate gestures by him in a long career working together.

She appeared in Les Volets Verts but was not on set at the time of the alleged sexual assaults.

She called Depardieu an incredible actor and a “genius”, saying “all forms of genius carries within it something extravagant, unsubmissive”.

Ardant said: “Yes, he takes up space on set; yes, he has a big mouth, says crude things, likes to play the idiot on a set because people will then be less afraid of his personality ... I know Gérard Depardieu, I've heard his shouting, his cries of anger, his provocations ... but I have never witnessed a gesture I found shocking.”

Leaving the stand, she approached Depardieu, embraced him and kissed him on the cheek.

News of protests has been preserve of a few newspapers and channels outside well funded pro-government networks

At the same time as the sound of clanging pots and pans rang out through the streets of opposition strongholds in Istanbul on a recent evening, marking another mass anti-government demonstration, a different reality was being broadcast to viewers of Turkish pro-government channels.

Public television showed the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, speaking to a gilded conference room after an iftar dinner. He boasted of his government's achievements, of hiring new teachers and attracting youth to an aerospace and technology conference.

The pro-government cable channel NTV carried news of the efforts of the finance minister, Mehmet Şimşek, to stabilise the economy. Neither channel broadcast footage from the protests, which were sparked by the arrest of the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. Neither did they interview protesters. Though NTV was running a headline that said hundreds of people had been arrested, mirroring statements made by the interior minister.

Substantive coverage of the protests has instead been the preserve of the small slice of newspapers and cable channels that exist outside the well funded and slick pro-government broadcasting networks. The opposition-aligned newspaper Cumhuriyet, for instance, has carried news of the conditions inside a maximum-security facility where İmamoğlu has been held, and speeches by another opposition leader to rapturous crowds of thousands.

“This is the negative outcome of what Erdoğan has built for two decades, which is a highly polarised, toxic media environment,” said Erol Önderoğlu of Reporters Without Borders, pointing to the spread of cable channels and media companies with longstanding financial ties to the government.

“Erdoğan now controls about 85% of national and corporate media in Turkey, so we're not talking about a fair media environment where pluralism truly flourishes,” he said.

This imbalance is laid bare in the coverage of the protests. Murat Somer, a political science professor who studies polarisation at Istanbul's Özyeğin University, said when pro-government channels do cover the opposition or demonstrators, they portray them as a threat.

“If you listen to the pro-government media, you are hearing that the protesters are a bunch of vandals who are insulting Erdoğan,” he said. Demonstrators are described as “aggressive and hostile, but also weak and unable to accept that Imamoğlu has committed crimes”.

Turkey's government media watchdog (RTÜK) has banned the broadcasting of live footage of the protests, although this sparked a row within the body, whose membership is designed to reflect the makeup of the Turkish parliament.

İlhan Taşcı, an RTÜK official from the opposition, posted on X that bureaucrats called the managers of major television networks “and issued threats that they stop live broadcasts or their licenses would be revoked”. The RTÜK president, Ebubekir Şahin, responded, telling Taşcı “there is no need for disinformation. The state and its institutions will do what is necessary.”

Live footage of the protests would dispel much of what the pro-government channels have said about them, said Somer. “If there was live coverage, it would show a well-attended peaceful event – yesterday there were thousands of people singing and it almost looked like a concert,” he said. “But they can't show this. It's disinformation, it's as simple as that.”

This skewed coverage prompted opposition leader Özgür Özel and other members of his Republican People's party (CHP) to call for a boycott, targeting businesses that they claim have deep financial ties to the government or fund its media apparatus. The boycott list includes a popular coffee chain, Turkey's widely loved chocolate producer Ülker and media organisations including the state broadcaster. Özel has also called on the government to allow İmamoğlu's trial to be broadcast live.

Ten photojournalists were detained in dawn raids this week, with several charged by prosecutors the following day and facing jail time.

“As we know, images are powerful, and with these latest protests we've seen so many remarkable ones in the international media, showing that Turkey's democracy is resisting with so many people in the streets again,” said media expert Emre Kızılkaya, of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

“Some of the photos we've seen are documenting police brutality with remarkable visuals, and this may have alarmed the Turkish authorities.”

Most Turkish people get their news from television, but overwhelming government control means the few channels critical of the government or loyal to the opposition are constantly weathering heavy fines from the regulators. This pressure has only increased since the protests began, including the live broadcast ban, further fines, and arrests targeting employees of opposition channels.

Kızılkaya pointed to the crackdown on live broadcast and detentions of journalists who reported from the protests as preventing news that helps to “capture the essence of these protests”.

Opposition-aligned channels, he added, were unable to reflect the mood by interviewing demonstrators on the street or showing clashes with the police.

“Media organisations that are critical of the government see themselves as playing their last game,” he said. “They see these protests as vital for the future of the right to properly inform the country … the future of journalism is on the line now.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple is among buildings destroyed after dry and windy weather saw mostly contained blazes spread again

Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever are ravaging southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said on Wednesday.

Han Duck-soo, South Korea's prime minister and acting president, said five days of fires had caused “unprecedented damage” and asked agencies tackling the disaster to “assume the worst-case scenario and respond accordingly”, according to Yonhap news agency.

A helicopter crashed during efforts to contain wildfires in the south-eastern town of Uiseong, killing the pilot and forcing the Korea Forest Service to suspend helicopter operations across the country.

Officials in Andong city and other south-eastern cities and towns ordered residents to evacuate on Tuesday as firefighters struggled to contain multiple blazes fuelled by dry winds, which burned more than 17,400 hectares (43,000 acres) of land and destroyed hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.

More than 5,500 people were forced to evacuate from their homes in Andong, the neighbouring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan, where the fires were the largest, according to South Korea's ministry of the interior and safety.

South Korean officials earlier on Tuesday had said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but the ongoing dry and windy weather caused setbacks and allowed the blazes to spread again.

The Uiseong fire, only 68% contained and exacerbated by strong winds, shows “unimaginable” scale and speed, said Lee Byung-doo, a forest disaster expert at the National Institute of Forest Science.

Climate change is projected to make wildfires more frequent, Lee said. “We have to admit large-scale wildfires are going to increase and prepare more resources and manpower,” he told a local television station.

Nearly 9,000 firefighters, along with more than 130 helicopters and hundreds of vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires, but efforts were partially suspended overnight as the winds strengthened.

Officials in Andong and Uiseong county ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters – including schools and indoor gyms – as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread.

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the seventh century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple's national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.

The fire also spread to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The justice ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, also near Uiseong.

Human-caused climate breakdown is responsible for a higher likelihood of fire and bigger burned areas in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the US and Australia, with some scientific evidence of increases in southern China.

Climate breakdown has increased the wildfire season by about two weeks on average across the globe.

Caitlin Cassidy translates the prime minister's use of gen Z phrases for Catie McLeod

The prime minister is using phrases I don't understand in parliament. On Wednesday, he said the Coalition were “delulu with no solulu”. What is going on?

Catie, I am rapidly aging out of being cool and don't understand the inner workings of the teenage mind. But I do know young people love TikTok, and politicians love rhymes.

These two great loves combined on Wednesday as Anthony Albanese went gen Z, telling the speaker the Coalition were “delulu with no solulu”.

He was addressing his rivals' energy and economic plan, which he said would require unnamed cuts to public services.

A basic translation of the phrase is “delusional with no solution”.

Yikes. I wonder who came up with that zinger. Anyway, tell me more. Why are people saying “delulu”?

Thank you so much for asking. The origin of “delulu” dates back to K-pop fan communities in the early 2010s.

Originally, the internet slang term referred to super-fans who were in a parasocial, obsessive relationship with celebrities and believed they would one day meet them.

It was taken up by TikTok and Instagram users through viral trends like the catchphrase “delulu is the solulu” – stay with me here – which denoted a positive message to stay optimistic and keep an imaginative mindset even when the going gets tough. One I'm sure many politicians could use.

Now, in the Year of Our Lord 2025, the hashtag #delulu has racked up more than 5bn views, and influencers have adopted the term.

“Delulu” no longer means you're delusional, but committing an act of radical self-love, of manifesting to make your dreams come true, even if you look a bit mad. It's the Brené Brown of internet terms.

Of course, in Albanese's context, the self-confidence of the Coalition is not the “solulu” but rather a lack of concrete costings for nuclear energy policies.

I see. Have any other politicians attempted to, as they say, “appeal to the youth”?

Unfortunately yes, and it is nearly always cringe. In his final address to parliament last year, the former prime minister Scott Morrison almost sent me into cardiac arrest by taking up a suggestion from his daughters to work Taylor Swift song titles into his valedictory speech.

“I'm actually a true new romantic after all,” he told a room of bemused baby boomers. “I can assure you there is no bad blood.”

He has bad blood with me, personally, after that speech.

Some, though, have pulled it off better than others. Independent Senator Fatima Payman gave a shout-out to the kids in a speech she delivered opposing the age ban on social media, littered with phrases my nephew uses that I do not understand such as “sigma”, “capping” and “skibidi”.

“Though some of you cannot yet vote, I hope when you do, it'll be in a more GOAT'ed Australia for a government with more aura,” she said, which had a certain authenticity for the fact she was directly addressing gen Z and gen Alpha to make politics more accessible for young people, rather than coming off like an old white man in a suit channelling Steve Buschemi (“how do you do, fellow kids?”).

Sounds “delulu” to me. Do you think we'll see more of this during the election campaign?

I would rather gouge my eyes out than see more of this, but this coming election will be the first where gen Z and millennials outnumber baby boomers. If their official social media accounts littered with heinous memes are anything to judge by, both sides of politics are lobbying hard to swing votes from younger generations.

In the words of the internet, “delulu is trululu” (may all their delusions come true).","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

People living near Kasungu national park say they are living in fear after translocation of 263 elephants by International Fund for Animal Welfare 

People living on the edge of a protected area in Malawi are taking legal action against an NGO that moved more than 250 elephants into the area, which they say have killed at least 10 people.

Villagers near Kasungu national park, which is Malawi's second largest and crosses the Zambian border, say they are living in fear for their livelihoods and safety after 263 elephants were introduced in July 2022, causing a sharp spike in human-wildlife conflict. Ten people claiming to be affected by the translocation from Liwonde national park have begun legal action against the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), demanding that the conservation NGO construct adequate fencing to protect the 167 villages around the park and compensate local people for the damage caused by the elephants.

More than 50 children were orphaned between July 2022 and November 2024 as a result of the translocated elephants, according to local communities. Among the 10 people killed were John Kayedzeka, 31, who was trampled by a herd while working in a field in September 2022 and Masiye Phiri, 31, who died after she was charged by a bull elephant while in the garden with her two-year-old child a year later.

One farmer from Zambia said he was walking across his farm when he came across two elephants and a calf, which charged. “I couldn't run away in time. They stepped on me and then broke off branches and covered me in them,” he said.

“I was in Lumezi hospital for four months while my wounds healed … Since that incident, my stomach is swollen on one side. I don't know what is wrong. I can't straighten my arm, so I can't farm. I depend on the well wishes of others to survive,” the 53-year-old said. “I am very afraid to move around on my own, so I tend to stay at home alone. I am in pain all of the time.”

Two deaths do not directly involve elephants but have been blamed on the translocation: one person was killed by a hippo displaced by elephants and another by hyenas believed to be trailing the mammals out of the park. Local people say that elephants are also routinely raiding their crops and trampling fields, threatening their livelihoods.

The UK law firm Leigh Day has been instructed to act on behalf of the 10 people against Ifaw in the UK, Zambia and Malawi, potentially bringing the case to the high court in England. Claimants have not been named so far to protect their identities. While elephants have long been in the park, with populations falling due to poaching, local people said the spike in human-wildlife conflict started after the translocation.

“My farmland has been destroyed five times. Three times in April 2024. Twice in May 2024. I was growing maize, sugarcane, rice and beans. Everything was destroyed,” said one 73-year-old farmer. “Before the relocation, sometimes I could harvest 35 bags of rice. This year, I have nothing.”

Another farmer who lives on the Zambian side of the park, whose father-in-law was killed by the animals, is also part of the case.

“My father-in-law was old and he didn't manage to run away and they trampled him, and he was killed. The news spread across the community and the community members went to help but he had already died,” she said.

In a statement, Ifaw said it had received notice of legal action in December and rejected allegations of wrongdoing.

“Ifaw is deeply saddened by all cases of human-wildlife conflict in and around Kasungu, where it has been working to support government and communities develop sustainable solutions for reducing human-wildlife conflict and promote coexistence,” a spokesperson said, highlighting that Malawi's government had overall responsibility for its national parks. Ifaw provided technical and financial support, following international best practice while moving the elephants, they said.

The elephant translocation was among the largest of its kind and images of the operation were used for fundraising, with pictures of the mammals being lifted by crane described as “scenes reminiscent of the Disney classic Dumbo”. It was a three-way operation between Malawi's national park service and two NGOs: Ifaw and African Parks.

Another claimant in the case said they hoped to live in peace with the elephants and wanted the NGO to take steps to protect them.

“We need the owners of the elephants to compensate us, they need to barrier the park, if they don't barrier the park, they should find another way to protect us and our crops. We want to claim the damage and barrier the park. If it is like this next year how are we going to live? We can't be removed from this place. These are our ancestral places, inherited. If we moved it would take a very long time to settle and start over,” they said.

“We can't do anything as we are just human beings – we know the law, we can't attack the elephants. We want to ensure there is protection. We are peace-loving people, we don't want to have a war between us and the elephants. We just want peace.”

Public accounts committee also flags ‘persistent digital skills shortages' and uncompetitive civil service pay rates

The government's ambition to boost efficiency by embedding AI in all aspects of its work risks being undermined by out-of-date technology, poor quality data and a lack of skilled staff, an influential Commons committee has warned.

The report by the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) found that more than 20 government IT systems identified as “legacy”, meaning out of date and unsupported, have yet to be given funding to improve them.

Government research cited by the PAC in the report found that almost a third of central government IT systems met this definition in 2024.

Keir Starmer's government has repeatedly stressed its desire to increase economic growth through the mass take-up of AI systems, including in the public sector.

An official plan for the technology published in January called for the government to “rapidly pilot” AI-powered services, saying this would both increase productivity and improve people's experience of dealing with officialdom.

In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said AI should replace the work of government officials where it can be done to the same standard, with 2,000 new tech apprentices to be recruited to the civil service.

However, the PAC report also warned about “persistent digital skills shortages in the public sector”, in part because of civil service pay levels “that are uncompetitive with the private sector”.

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSI), which is spearheading AI roll-outs in government, says it has previously recognised many of the same worries in two reports published in January, the State of Digital Government and Blueprint for a Modern Digital Government.

However, the PAC report makes a series of new recommendations, including setting a six-month deadline for the department to specifically set out how it will fund replacements for the highest-risk legacy technology, and to also assess the costs of failing to take action.

It also calls for action to improve public confidence in the transparency and standards for how AI is used in government, saying that as of January this year, just 33 official records had been published setting out algorithm-assisted decisions and how they are made. The report recommends this be sped up.

The report also identifies a lack of coherent systems to learn from the mass of different AI pilots taking place across government, calling for action to address this.

Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Conservative MP who chairs the PAC, said: “The government has said it wants to mainline AI into the veins of the nation, but our report raises questions over whether the public sector is ready for such a procedure.

“A transformation of thinking in government at senior levels is required, and the best way for this to happen is for digital professionals to be brought round the top table in management and governing boards of every department and their agencies. I have serious concerns that DSIT does not have the authority over the rest of government to bring about the scale and pace of change that's needed.”

A government spokesperson said: “These findings reflect much of what we already know, which is why we set out a bold plan to overhaul the use of tech and AI across the public sector – from doubling the number of tech experts across Whitehall, to making reforms to replace legacy IT systems more quickly and building new tools to transform how people interact with the state.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Opposition says Labor's national vehicle emission standard is ‘poorly designed', despite data showing uptick in green vehicle sales

Australia's love-hate relationship with fuel-guzzling utes and SUVs is now a looming election issue, after the Coalition indicated it may rethink Labor's vehicle emission standard.

On Tuesday the shadow transport minister, Bridget McKenzie, called Labor's vehicle emission standard “poorly designed” and said the Coalition will have “more to say” about it when the opposition releases its own transport policy before the election.

Labor's new vehicle efficiency standard (NVES), which became law on 1 January, enforces an emissions maximum for each car manufacturer, with a penaltyfor every gram of emissions over the target.

The standard was designed to encourage carmakers to release more green vehicles on to Australia's market, with more competition to drive down the price for consumers. And the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) says the standard is already working.

More than 120 electric vehicles are now available in Australia as the new laws upend the nation's status as a “dumping ground” for big, polluting cars. Prior to January Australia was the only OECD country without a vehicle emission standard.

The obsession with big cars is not only fuelling the climate crisis, it is making roads deadlier and adding to traffic congestion. And there are other costs – Australians spend on average almost $100 a week on fuel.  

But the Coalition is set to make the standard an election issue.

On Tuesday McKenzie said the Coalition opposed the NVES when it was introduced “because it will punish Australian families and tradies simply because of the cars they love and need to drive”.

She claimed the NVES was “poorly designed, pulls the wrong lever in a cost-of-living crisis and discriminates unfairly against everyday Australians”, and criticised the government for keeping the modelling on which it was based a secret.

“We will have more to say on the NVES when the Coalition's low-emissions transport policy is released before the election,” she said.

McKenzie, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, have referred to the NVES as a “tax”, but the government described it as a “regulatory obligation to incentivise the supply of a greater number of fuel-efficient, low- and zero-emission vehicles to Australia”.

The Electric Vehicle Council says the standard is already having an effect on which cars international manufacturers choose to send to Australia.

The EVC's head of legal policy and advocacy, Aman Gaur, said the NVES is “definitely working”, even though the next part of the standard – the penalty and credit system – does not start rolling out until 1 July. (If carmakers beat the emission target they receive credits, which they can use to offset the emissions on other, dirtier cars, or trade with other manufacturers.)

The penalties are $100 per gram of CO2 per kilometre above the CO2 limit, per vehicle sold, Gaur said, though the regulator can only issue fines that are 50% of the maximum penalty and the first penalties are not payable until March 2028.

The council's statistics show electric vehicle sales – including hybrids – made up 11.3% of total car sales in February this year, compared with 9.3% last year.

“As the standards operate, they encourage manufacturers to bring in more efficient petrol cars, but also electric cars,” Gaur said.

He said there are now cheaper EVs available in more categories – including utes – and they can save people about $3,000 a year on fuel and maintenance.

Prior to the NVES, Gaur said, Australia had “the worst standards, right next to Russia” but now companies are flocking to sell EVs here.

At the Everything Electric show in Sydney earlier this month, Gaur said, there were 36 brands on offer, while “three years ago, there were three”.

The Coalition opposed the bill even after the government watered it down, reducing the targets and carving out popular SUVs, including the Toyota LandCruiser and the Nissan Patrol.

Australian cars are, according to the government's analysis in the lead-up to the creation of the standard, inefficient compared with other countries and responsible for megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, making up 11.4% of Australia's total emissions.

That analysis found “manufacturers supply cars to the Australian market that aren't as fuel efficient as the cars they supply to other markets”. It found manufacturers do not offer the same range of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric (PHEVs), hybrid electric (HEVs) and electric, because of the lack of a mandatory standard.

A 2024 study from the University of Technology Sydney found Australian passenger vehicles are emitting 50% more carbon dioxide than the average in major markets, including the US, EU, China and Japan, because those markets were “aggressively” adopting standards to prompt a transition to lower emissions.

The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries says, contrary to the EVC's position, that the standard is not working. According to its latest data, “pure” electric vehicle sales (excluding hybrids) were just 5.9% in February, down from 9.6% last year, while the preference for bigger cars continued.

The FCAI chief executive, Tony Weber, said while it is true there are more EVs available now, “consumers just aren't buying them” and “without a high penetration of EVs, we're just not going to meet the lofty ambitions of the government”.

“Penalties will be paid … or people will keep their existing cars longer and we'll have an older, dirtier and unsafer fleet.”

He said the government did not release its modelling on supply and demand, and called for it to sit down with industry to “work out a pathway forward”.

Guardian Australia has asked the government for a response.

Weber also said the idea of Australia as a “dumping ground” was “completely irrational” because it is a relatively small market.

The Climate Council fellow John Stone, a recently retired University of Melbourne transport planner, painted a bigger picture.

“If we're going to get to our climate targets and our health and wellbeing targets, we have to be using cars less,” he said.

Stone said that means giving people a way to leave their cars at home, including investing in pathways and bike paths to encourage other forms of transportation.

“Build it and they'll come,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

How Queensland's 2032 Games planning descended into farce","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/26/the-hot-mess-olympics-how-queenslands-2032-games-planning-descended-into-farce","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:55:00 GMT","

The LNP's vision is for an Olympics held in venues rather than a city – and guarantees controversy across Brisbane and beyond

Few people in Queensland disagreed with the former state premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, when she described plans for the 2032 Olympic Games in Brisbane as a “hot mess”.

Tuesday's announcement by the new LNP government was framed as an end to the sort of disarray that has plagued Olympic planning during the past four years.

But the city's third venues plan – its third proposed Olympic stadium – might be the most problematic.

It will now almost certainly ensure protests and opposition north and south of the Brisbane River, with the new Victoria Park stadium and the demolition of the Gabba controversial choices for locals. There may also be opposition from the middle of the Fitzroy River, where the local freshwater crocodiles might not be too pleased about the idea of Olympic rowing at Rockhampton.

The premier, David Crisafulli, began with an apology of sorts for breaking an election promise. He had campaigned in October last year by saying there would be “no new stadiums”.

“I have to own that, and I will, and I am sorry, and it's my decision, and I accept that decision,” Crisafulli said.

The premier's attempt to justify the broken promise went like this: he had to choose between pushing ahead with the plan to host athletics at the 1980s-era Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre (an option derided as embarrassing), or building a new venue at Victoria Park.

“And I know which one would have been politically easier for me to make, but I've made the right choice,” he said.

That choice seemed plain well before the election. It was repeatedly pointed out that his position – “no new stadiums” but definitely not Qsac – was untenable.

Victoria Park has been pushed for more than a year in certain quarters of the city. The idea that the plan is simply an organic recommendation of a 100-day venues review seems unlikely.

As does the argument that, finally, the needs of the Olympics have been put ahead of local politics.

Crisafulli's “no new stadiums” promise was largely pitched at voters in Queensland's regional cities, which were critical to the LNP's election win. Spending big money on big things in Brisbane is a move that brings up grievances in Townsville.

And so the LNP will send several sports – archery, sailing, football and rowing – up north, over the reported objections of those sports' governing bodies and against the recommendations of the venues review.

The government also rejected the advice of the panel and will build a swimming centre of excellence at the site of the Centenary pool, on the outskirts of Victoria Park.

There are some decent arguments for doing so. Hosting swimming events at an arena with a temporary pool doesn't create much of a legacy for the sport. The new venue would create a permanent world-class facility for swimmers.

It is exactly the same principle behind the last government's idea of using Qsac for athletics events. Athletics would get a permanent, top-level home.

Broken promises are dime a dozen in politics. There are those who will be sceptical that this plan is above politics, when it appears so clearly designed to appease regional voters and other interest groups.

The original plan to redevelop the ageing Gabba stadium fell by the wayside a year ago. Then the Australian Olympics supremo, John Coates, said the Olympic movement was “on the nose” in Brisbane because the plan was not popular. People were upset about the mooted cost, and the impact on the local area.

Building a new (and more expensive) stadium at Victoria Park shifts that flashpoint north of the river.

But turning the Gabba area into a privately funded entertainment precinct, as outlined on Tuesday, will ensure that protests continue on the south side, too.

When Victoria Park was first mooted, the idea of building over the city's largest green space – a 64-hectare parkland which, though close to the city, is woefully underused– was pushed as a sort of trade-off.

“Brisbane city council has a policy of no net loss of green space in the city,” said Graham Quirk, the former mayor who has championed Victoria Park.

“Our proposal, as inferred in the report, was that you could potentially turn the Gabba, an area which is in drastic need of additional green space, into green space over there.

“There would be a loss in one location but a gain in another area”.

No one mentioned green space at the big launch on Tuesday.

It seems as if the big vision of the new government – complete with a slick presentation and uplifting backing music – is for an Olympics held in venues, but not a city.

For all the urgency and “the time has come to just get on with it” talk on Tuesday, it remains to be seen whether the people of Brisbane are willing to support it.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Bloc's first preparedness strategy urges people to prepare for floods, fires, pandemics or military strikes

People in the EU are being advised to stockpile enough food, water and essentials for 72 hours as part of a European strategy that aims to increase readiness for catastrophic floods and fires, pandemics and military attacks.

Outlining its first preparedness strategy, the European Commission said it wanted to encourage citizens to take “proactive measures to prepare for crises, such as developing household emergency plans and stockpiling essential supplies”.

The strategy was partly inspired by plans in Germany and the Nordic countries, which have distributed public information pamphlets and devised apps advising people what to do in the event of a military attack or other national crisis.

“We are saying to member states: 72 hours of self-sufficiency is what we recommend,” Hadja Lahbib, the European commissioner for preparedness and crisis management, told reporters. Asked about what citizens should stockpile, she referred to a video on her social media, in which she presents an emergency bag.

Today, the EU launches its new #Preparedness Strategy. “Ready for anything” — this must be our new European way of life. Our motto and #hashtag. pic.twitter.com/fA1z8ZvMDA

To a soundtrack of off-key jazz piano, Lahbib is shown on the video discussing her emergency stockpile in a tongue-in-cheek way, including ID documents in waterproof casing, canned food, bottled water, matches, a Swiss army knife, cash, playing cards, medicines and a small radio.

The strategy was devised to ensure better EU coordination and public awareness in response to a range of potential risks, such as extreme weather exacerbated by the climate crisis, pandemics, cyber-attacks and military invasions. “We must prepare for large-scale, cross-sectoral incidents and crises, including the possibility of armed aggression, affecting one or more member states,” the document states.

The commission is also calling for a Europe-wide preparedness day to raise awareness; for the topic to be put on school curriculums; and for an EU “stockpiling strategy” to ensure adequate supplies of raw materials, shelters, generators, and “potentially” food and water.

While the EU has no powers over civilian or military uniformed services, it has carved out a bigger role in crisis response since the Covid pandemic led to the unprecedented common purchases of vaccines and medical equipment. Now it wants to go further after a report from the former Finnish president Sauli Niinistö last year found there was no “clear plan” on what the EU would do “in the event of armed aggression against a member state”. Nïïnistö, a special adviser to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was better prepared to deal with crises and disasters than five years ago, but needed a change of mindset and more planning to anticipate crises.

The plans are likely to provoke a mixed response from EU member states, who perceive threats in different ways. Last week, the European Commission rebranded its military spending plans “Readiness 2030”, instead of Rearm Europe, after complaints from the leaders of Italy and Spain, who argued the language risked alienating people.

In contrast, northern European countries have led the way in emergency planning. Swedish authorities recommend keeping at home a good supply of water, energy-rich food, blankets and alternative heating, as well as investing in a battery-powered radio. Norway advises people to stock up on non-essential medicines, including iodine tablets in the case of a nuclear incident. German households have been urged to adapt their own cellars, garages or store rooms for use as bunkers, while housebuilders will be legally obliged to include safe shelters in new homes – as Poland has already done.

Roxana Mînzatu, a commission vice-president, responded to accusations of scaremongering, likening preparedness to taking out accident insurance: “It doesn't mean much more than the fact that you want to be prepared and you want to minimise the damage, the costs, the suffering that you might go through.”

Mînzatu, who admitted she did not have a three-day stockpile, citing her mobile lifestyle as the reason, said the dividend of peace had given people a sense “it's not going to happen to us” despite seeing disastrous wildfires in Greece or floods in Spain. “I'm a good example of what we need to do,” she said.

Lahbib, who said she did have her 72-hour supplies, including ingredients for pasta alla puttanesca, said it was up to member states to define what was needed “on the basis of the geopolitical and geostrategic position they're in”.

The Belgian commissioner noted that in Finland young people were taught how to handle a weapon, “but I don't think that's the kind of thing you'd have here in Belgium or France, not immediately, at any rate. It differs from one country to another, but we can learn from each other.”

The strategy was published the day after Denmark's defence ministry announced it was bringing forward plans to introduce military service for women by two years.

Women who turn 18 after 1 July 2025 could be required to take part in an annual ballot from next year to determine if they must perform mandatory military service, something which is already required of men.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Brazil were humiliated 4-1 by bitter rivals Argentina in South American World Cup qualifiers as the pressure mounted on manager Dorival Júnior after his side were comprehensively outplayed and fortunate not to lose by more.

After edging Colombia 2-1 at home on Thursday, Brazil came crashing back to earth against the world champions, who started the rout with a close-range strike by Julián Alvarez four minutes after kick-off.

Alvarez took a through pass from Thiago Almada in his stride and evaded two defenders before beating the advancing goalkeeper Bento with a gentle touch to his right.

“We humbly did our job and played a great game. We gave them a show,” Alvarez said.

“It was a historic result, winning by 4-1, and that makes us really proud, I'm so happy for the fans, for helping the team and to see how we played an impressive game at home. It's great to know that we are qualified for the World Cup.”

A 0-0 draw between Uruguay and Bolivia earlier on Tuesday had sealed Argentina's spot at the 2026 World Cup as they became the first South American team to qualify for the tournament in North America.

Even without the injured Lionel Messi and Lautaro Martínez, Argentina were streets ahead of their rivals and they did not have to wait long to extend their lead.

Enzo Fernández made it 2-0 with a strike from inside the box in the 12th minute but Brazil pulled one back when a mistake by Argentina defender Cristian Romero gifted Matheus Cunha a goal in the 26th minute.

But Argentina restored their two-goal lead through Alexis Mac Allister in the 37th minute, firing home from a Fernández cross.

Argentina, who have not lost to Brazil in six years, wasted several chances to extend their lead before substitute Giuliano Simeone wrapped up the scoring in the 71st minute, handing Brazil their heaviest defeat in a World Cup qualifier.

Brazil captain Marquinhos apologised to the fans and urged his teammates to turn things around as quickly as possible.

“What we did here today can't happen again,” he told Brazilian TV Globo. “It's hard to talk about it in the heat of the moment... It's embarrassing. We started the game very badly, far below what we could do and they're on a great run of confidence. They knew how to play smart ... I'm sorry for our fans.”

Dorival Júnior has failed to earn the trust of Brazil's demanding fans after winning just seven of his 16 games in charge since taking over in early 2024.

“It's not just the coach's fault... It's the players' fault too,” Marquinhos said. “There's no secret formula in football where you make a choice and it works out. We can all do better. We have to share the blame. It's about understanding the moment and being humble.”

Argentina top the South American standings with 31 points from 14 matches, 16 points clear of seventh-placed Venezuela, who currently hold the spot for the international playoffs following their 1-0 win over Peru. Brazil are fourth on 21 points.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The youthful energy of street protest is breathing life back into failing progressive parties – and it's a model that could be applied everywhere

After 22 years of power grabs, the seizure of all state institutions and severe oppression aimed at reshaping Turkish citizens into Islamofascist minions, Turkey is striking back against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's authoritarianism. In cities across the country, including the regime's strongholds, protests have been ongoing for the past week.

Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu's detention on bogus corruption charges this week galvanised the people; within days, the protests evolved into something bigger – a national riot demanding democracy, dignity and freedom. The protests reminded many of the Gezi uprising of 2013, yet this time the young people who we thought had lost all hope for the future under Erdoğan and during the severe economic crisis took to the streets, risking limitless police violence by attending public gatherings which are now banned.

One of the slogans adorning placards encapsulated the sentiment perfectly: “If we burn, you'll burn with us.” While the protests were rife with political humour, everyone knows that what is happening is no joke: the country stands at a political point of no return. The die is cast. Either Erdoğan will retreat, or else. What that “else” could possibly be is a daunting prospect. Yet the people's determination to break the wall of fear is unprecedented, and this time, unlike during the Gezi uprising, the main opposition party is “hosting” the political action – or at least trying to.

İmamoğlu is not only the mayor of the largest city in Turkey but also, with his widespread popularity, Erdoğan's only credible political rival. Right before his detention on dubious claims made by the regime – financial corruption, being a leader of a criminal organisation and collaborating with terrorist organisations – İmamoğlu was about to announce his candidacy for the next presidential elections.

Several opinion polls indicated his support would probably surpass Erdoğan's in that election, due to be held in 2028. According to sources close to Erdoğan, the plan was to arrest and discredit İmamoğlu and to appoint a government trustee to the main opposition party. This has been Erdoğan's modus operandi for years. Several mayors from opposition parties – both social democrats and the Kurdish party – have been taken into custody, and İmamoğlu's arrest was anticipated. In his last video before his detention, while getting dressed, İmamoğlu calmly said that he would “stand resolute” for the people of Turkey.

Taking his words as a call to action, hundreds of thousands have filled the city's squares since the first night. The main opposition party, on witnessing the scale of the protests, transformed its primaries for presidential candidacy into a mass political action, inviting all citizens to cast their votes in support of İmamoğlu to demonstrate to the regime that support for him extends far beyond party politics. Close to 15 million people voted for İmamoğlu, securing his position as the official opposition candidate.

The particularities of this story may be confusing. The boundlessness of the lies and tricks employed by an authoritarian leader can be hard to follow. But what is happening in Turkey has important lessons for democracies around the world.

Over the last decade, as we have seen in several European countries and the US, holding the line by lining up with centrist political parties has not been effective, and Occupy-style street politics, inspiring though they may be, do not adequately counter the rising tide of fascism. “Try again, fail again” strategies have been exhausted in recent years, the most recent example being the US. Clearly, the conventional political parties – the Democrats in the US and social democrats in Europe – have failed to harness the political and moral outrage of the masses, which leaders like Erdoğan or Donald Trump induce. The political energy flowing from street politics is too unpredictable to be embraced by conventional political parties – and the masses, with their youthful enthusiasm, are hesitant to align themselves with worn-out political institutions. So what is the solution?

The old-school progressive opposition parties resemble shipwrecks – they are decaying structures. They have lost all that was vital in them over the last five decades after aligning with the neoliberal hegemony, which severed its organic ties to the progressive sectors of society. They are highly bureaucratised and, as a result, paralysed giants unable to keep up with the agility of the new far right. What is occurring in Turkey right now is youthful energy schooling and shoaling around this shipwreck, breathing life into it by transforming the wreck into a reef. For days now, youth leaders have been delivering speeches at significant party meetings, continually negotiating the guidelines for collaborative action. Whenever possible, they ensure that their outrage extends beyond İmamoğlu's arrest. Their presence irrevocably alters the spirit of the political movement and drives the social democratic party forward towards life. Throughout this process, the young learn to navigate the slow-moving giant while the giant adapts to become nimble and brave enough to counter the ruthless tactics of the regime.

Not only for Turkey but also soon for Europe and beyond, the central question of saving democracy from the rise of authoritarianism will be this: will the youthful energy of the masses be allowed into the wreckage to transform it into a living organism? One that is robust enough to challenge the historical tide bending towards authoritarianism? Turkey, in the days to come, will be answering this question.

Australia's fate remains in their own hands and will be decided in June's international window against runaway leaders Japan and Saudi Arabia

Nothing lasts forever, especially in the capricious world of football. And after having results go their way so often during World Cup qualification, it felt inevitable that the whims of the footballing gods would at some point turn away from Australia.

While Tony Popovic's side did pretty much everything they could over the last week, smashing Indonesia 5-1 in Sydney before dispatching China 2-0 in Hangzhou, Japan did everything but score against Saudi Arabia in Saitama on Tuesday. That result ensures the Socceroos' hopes of automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup will go down to the wire in June.

Given that much of Australia's fortune during the third phase of Asian qualifying has centred around them dropping points, perhaps Saudi Arabia would have seen their trip to Saitama as something of a karmic swing. There, they ground out a goalless draw six months after their Australian rivals had done the same to supplant them in one of the group's two automatic qualification slots. Daizen Maeda rattled the woodwork early on and Hajime Moriyasu's side ended the contest with 78% of the ball, but domination of possession could not be turned into clear-cut chances, let alone goals – and Saudi Arabia kept alive their hopes of seizing second place in three months.

With eight of 10 games in this phase of qualification complete, the Socceroos sit second in Group C with 13 points, three points clear of Saudi on 1o. After their narrow 1-0 win over Bahrain, Indonesia sit in fourth on nine points, while Bahrain and China occupy fifth and sixth on six points. A small mercy for the Socceroos is that regardless of what happens in June they cannot fall into one of those bottom two slots – and be eliminated from qualifying. Their worst-case scenario now is to be forced into further rounds of qualification.

Japan, who have an unassailable lead atop the group, will head to Perth for the first game of that window, while Saudi Arabia will travel to Bahrain. Both the Socceroos and Green Falcons will then likely head to Riyadh for a game that if the scriptwriters get their way, could mean everything. In a slightly less dramatic reality, given Australia's goal difference now stands at plus-seven compared to their rivals' minus-two, a draw in that contest would almost certainly be enough for the Australians to punch their tickets to North America, as would a win over Japan in the preceding game. Given the challenges that Bahrain have given Saudi Arabia in recent months – beating them in both the Gulf Cup and World Cup qualifying – it is not inconceivable that Dragan Talajić's side could render things almost moot by getting the job done in Riffa.

For the Socceroos, however, the belief within the group will be that they can win both their upcoming games, allowing the nerds to put away their calculators. Australia are still undefeated since the arrival of Popovic, and the win over China was another example of his side doing exactly what they needed to get a result in Asia; taking an early first-half-lead before shutting the door through disciplined and well-organised defending in the second. It's not always pretty but it's an approach that helped the coach once grind out an Asian Champions League crown and one which could now send him to a World Cup.

That's not to say Australia are the finished article. They're crying out for a difference-maker in attack who can receive and operate with the ball in packed opposition penalty areas. And there's still no clear answer in the No 9 position. But there were building blocks over this window. Jackson Irvine is in career-best form and Nishan Velupillay can't stop scoring. Despite a raft of injuries, the side conceded just one goal in 180 minutes and, entrusted with a debut in Hangzhou, Ryan Teague looked like he'd been playing for years in the Socceroos midfield.

“One of the common themes we have is to be hard to beat,” skipper Maty Ryan said. “We've given testament to that so far. Our definition of it isn't just to sit behind the ball and defend deep. It's picking and managing moments; when to press, when to go forward with the ball – making good decisions.

“The stakes every time you get to pull on the national team shirt are of the highest order. Our nation deserves our utmost attention, commitment, sacrifice and energy.

The agreement comes after separate U.S.-sponsored talks with Ukraine and Russia in Riyadh and includes facilitating Russia's access to world food markets for its exports.

KYIV — Russia and Ukraine agreed Tuesday to expand their initial limited ceasefire on energy infrastructure to include the Black Sea after U.S.-sponsored indirect talks in Saudi Arabia.

In separate joint statements from the White House — one between the United States and Russia, another between the U.S. and Ukraine — the two countries agreed to “ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes” in the Black Sea, as well as to develop measures to implement and monitor the partial ceasefire. The statements did not specify when the limited ceasefire would go into effect.

The statements — which came after this week's technical talks in Riyadh, the Saudi capital — differed in two key ways. The U.S. separately agreed to help Russia gain access to world markets to export fertilizer and other agricultural products. For Ukraine, Washington reiterated its commitment to help facilitate the exchange of prisoners of war, civilian detainees and kidnapped children.

In a news briefing Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to the U.S. side for the outcome and said it was his understanding “that once the American side officially issues a statement, the implementation of the decisions outlined in this document could begin.”

A statement on the Russian presidency's website said that the agreement includes lifting sanctions on Russia's agricultural bank and some other institutions, and that the partial ceasefire would not go into effect until that happened. Russia has a long-standing demand to have access restored to the international SWIFT system for transferring money.

The White House did not respond to questions about whether and which sanctions it was prepared to lift.

Russia and Ukraine appeared to have different understandings of when the truce began and how any violations would be managed. The Kremlin wrote in a statement that the truce applied to five categories of energy infrastructure, including oil refineries, oil and gas pipelines, storage facilities, power plants and substations, and hydroelectric dams. It also said the moratorium was valid from March 18 and that if one side were to violate it, “the other party shall be entitled to consider itself free from the obligation to comply with it.”

Zelensky, meanwhile, told journalists that the way violations would be managed was not included in the statements because “the American side was very eager not to let this fall apart.”

He added that Ukraine's follow-up conversation with American officials determined that if Kyiv identifies a violation of the deal, it “must reach out through all our available channels to the American side, presenting the facts and evidence that the Russian side has breached it.”

An official familiar with negotiations, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss them freely, said Russia is using the results to now demand that President Donald Trump lift sanctions, “and in doing so, they're even trying to steal from him the sense of success in his diplomacy.”

“It's a humiliation,” the official said.

Russia's backdating of the truce was “manipulating to shorten the term” of the deal, the official added. Ukraine's position, the official said, “is that it should be effective from today; besides, a control mechanism still needs to be developed.”

Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser to the head of Zelensky's office, said claims circulating among Russian lawmakers that Ukraine is to blame for the lack of a joint statement are “as false as the narratives that Ukraine killed civilians in Bucha or attacked the train station in Kramatorsk,” referring to Russian attacks in Ukraine in 2022.

“Ukraine did not participate in any negotiations with Russia in Saudi Arabia and had no influence over the outcome documents. This is a classic case of blaming the victim. It is Russia that refuses to recover from its imperial pathology and continues to poison the lives of people across the world,” he said.

Andriy Klymenko, head of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies, said Russia's and Ukraine's positions remain “irreconcilable” and that the new agreements appear to amount only to “rhetorical acrobatics.”

“These statements, the news items on the White House website, the commentary from Kyiv and Moscow — it all points to one thing: Nothing has been agreed. The war at sea will continue,” he said.

“It turns out that after everyone made their comments, the United States believes it has reached a major new agreement. … In their view, the parties have agreed — meaning, the U.S. believes the parties agreed to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea,” he added. “Meanwhile, the Russians believe they've secured a massive rollback of sanctions — which isn't mentioned anywhere.”

Zelensky, who said he wasn't sure how the agreement would be implemented, said that while a ban on attacks against civilian infrastructure was not included in the statement, the issue was discussed with the Americans and therefore implied in the agreement.

“The American side believes that calm skies, as related to the energy sector, also applies to other civilian infrastructure,” he said in the briefing.

Later, in his daily evening address to the nation, Zelensky thanked Washington for its contributions and said Russia's behavior this week “will reveal a lot — if not everything.”

“If we see renewed air raid alerts, renewed military activity in the Black Sea, renewed Russian manipulation and threats, then new measures will have to be taken — specifically against Moscow,” he said. “What's needed now is a result from Russia. We do not trust them. In truth, the world does not trust Russia. And they must prove that they are ready to end the war, ready to stop lying to the world, to Trump, to America.”

The partial ceasefire would prevent Ukraine from striking Russian oil production and exports, which Kyiv had found to be effective at bringing the war home to the Kremlin. Ukrainian sea drones have also been effective in attacking the Russian Black Sea fleet.

Most Ukrainians — as many as 85 percent — view a partial ceasefire positively, according to a poll from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, conducted from March 12 to 22, before the ban on attacks was updated to include the Black Sea.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday that the resumption of the Black Sea initiative was “agreeable” but that “we cannot take this man's word for it,” referring to Zelensky.

Lavrov said Moscow wants “the grain market, the fertilizer market to be predictable,” so that no one tries to remove Russia from those markets.

The 2022 Black Sea Grain Initiative, also known as the “grain deal,” envisaged the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and the normalization of Russian exports, such as agricultural products and fertilizers, to world markets after the war caused food prices to soar.

When Russia abandoned the deal in 2023, John Kirby, then the spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council, said the U.S. and allies were working to ensure that both Russian and Ukrainian grain reached global markets, adding that “contrary to Russian propaganda, [sanctions] do not target Russian food or fertilizer.”

Russian food exports have continued to rise during the war. In 2023, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said the Russian grain trade was nearing full recovery, with high grain export volumes and stabilizing fertilizer markets, quoting the Russian Union of Grain Exporters and the Russian Fertilizer Producers Association.

This live coverage has ended.

The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for several areas of northern Gaza late Monday, forcing another round of displacements for Palestinians who were able to return to their homes in the devastated north in late January for the first time since the early days of the war. The military described it as a final warning before the areas would come under attack.

Nearly 125,000 people have been displaced in recent days as they fled Israeli bombardment and ground operations, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Monday, before the latest evacuation orders. The United Nations estimates that over the past week, Israel has issued evacuation notices for more than 14 percent of the enclave, along with “vast ‘no go' areas along the border,” spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Monday.

It was past 10 p.m. in Gaza when the evacuation order for Jabalya came in, leaving families with few options other than fleeing on foot, in the dark, in search of relative safety. Two hours before, similar warnings were issued for the areas of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun.

“People left under the cover of darkness,” Razan Faisal, a resident of Jabalya who opted to stay behind, said in an interview Tuesday. “We have many elderly people and children, and evacuations involve walking for long hours, which is extremely difficult,” she said, adding that the situation in Jabalya is dire. “There is no aid, and only a few supplies are available in the market at extremely high prices.”

Since March 18, the day Israel broke the fragile truce and resumed bombing Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed more than 792 people, Gaza's Health Ministry said Tuesday. More than 60 percent of them are women and children, according to the ministry.

JERUSALEM — Hamdan Ballal, a Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” was released from custody Tuesday, following his arrest by the Israeli army Monday. He was detained after a group of settlers in the West Bank attacked him, according to activists and a neighbor who spoke to The Washington Post.

Ballal went to a hospital after being freed, and was in “moderate” condition on Tuesday, according to the activists.

The Palestinian director was in his home village of Susya, part of the cluster of rural Palestinian communities known as Masafer Yatta, when settlers approached the village and tried to graze their sheep on private Palestinian land just before iftar, the sundown meal at which Muslims break their daily fast during Ramadan, according to Nasser Nawajah, who lives in the small village and reports on settler violence for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. He spoke with Ballal's wife, who described the attack.

A video taken by Khamudi Mahmoud, a resident of the village, shows a tall man wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap aggressively approaching Ballal in a rocky clearing as Ballal backs away and a crowd of villagers shout behind him.

Dozens of masked settlers wielding batons, knives and a rifle then attacked property and residents, activists who document settler attacks in the area said in a statement afterward.

“Hamdan tried to retreat, and he brought his kids and wife inside the house and stood at the door to protect them,” Nawajah said. Four settlers began to hit the door of Ballal's house, injuring Ballal's head, according to Nawajah, recounting what Ballal's wife told him.

The settlers fired bullets next to the house and then dragged Ballal away while he was injured, Nawajah said.

The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement posted to X that a “violent clash” broke out between Palestinians and Israelis and that it involved “mutual stone-throwing.”

The United Nations said it is making the “difficult decision” to scale back its presence in the Gaza Strip following the collapse of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. About one-third of the roughly 100 international staff members in Gaza will be temporarily relocated, the agency said in a statement.

“We are not abandoning Gaza,” U.N. spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci said in a news briefing Tuesday, adding that the decision to reduce international staff numbers was because the U.N. was unable to guarantee the safety of its employees.

On Monday, the United Nations said a strike that hit a U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza, killing a Bulgarian employee and injuring five other international staff members, came from Israeli tankfire — something the Israel Defense Forces has denied. The U.N. has called for an investigation, with spokesman Stéphane Dujarric saying Monday, “The Israelis knew exactly where this U.N. facility was, and it was hit by a shell from one of their tanks.”

Also Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its offices in Rafah was “damaged by an explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties. Fortunately, no staff were injured in this incident, but this has a direct impact on the ICRC's ability to operate.”

The IDF said in a statement that its forces had “fired at a building after identifying suspects inside and feeling threatened. … Upon review, it was found that the identification was mistaken, and the building belongs to the Red Cross.” It added that the incident would be investigated.

Aid groups have warned about deteriorating conditions in Gaza. The U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said Monday that nearly 125,000 people in the enclave have been displaced in recent days as they flee Israeli bombardment,

“This is a human catastrophe,” UNRWA said Monday, emphasizing that Israel's siege and blockade of all aid into Gaza has caused food shortages and sent prices soaring.

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.”

CPJ, a nonprofit organization that tracks repression worldwide, has said Israel has “repeatedly made similar unproven statements” against journalists. In a statement Monday, CPJ denounced Shabat's killing and that of Mohammad Mansour, a journalist who worked for Palestine Today, who was killed the same day in southern Gaza. Shabat's last post on Instagram, hours before he was killed, was a post mourning Mansour.

Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called Shabat's “assassination” and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said it had “eliminated” Shabat, calling him “a sniper terrorist” who was affiliated with Hamas's military wing. It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.

Shabat denied the claims of militant links when Israel first made the accusations in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”

A statement posted on the 23-year-old Shabat's social media accounts and shared by supporters after his death read: “If you're reading this, it means I have been killed — most likely targeted — by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old — a college student with dreams like anyone else.”

This is an excerpt from a full story.

Top officials in the Trump administration discussed highly sensitive military planning using an unclassified chat application that mistakenly included a journalist, the White House acknowledged Monday, a development that swiftly drew criticism from Democrats and Washington's national security establishment.

Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the message thread revealed in an extraordinary report by the Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, “appears to be authentic,” and that administration officials were “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

The “inadvertent number” belonged to Goldberg, whose article details a robust policy discussion that occurred in the lead-up to a March 15 military operation targeting Yemen's Houthi militants. Goldberg reported being added to the group chat, which occurred on the encrypted messaging platform Signal, by President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz. Other participants appeared to include Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and several other senior aides, the Atlantic article says.

Hughes, the National Security Council spokesman, characterized the discussion as “a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials” executing Trump's national security strategy. But the disclosure immediately raised questions about how the administration has discussed classified national security matters and whether anyone will be disciplined.

Senior Trump administration officials have warned in recent days that they will investigate unauthorized leaks to journalists, citing reporting in a number of publications. Several of them also for years criticized the handling of classified information by Democrats in other cases.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader.

The migrants, accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang, are being held at CECOT without access to either the Salvadoran or American justice systems.

Kristi L. Noem, the U.S. secretary of homeland security, plans to travel Wednesday to a notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador that has become a legal black hole for Venezuelan migrants spirited out of the United States with no judicial hearing.

The Trump administration is locked in a court battle over whether it acted improperly in expelling the Venezuelans, who are accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. A U.S. judge had ordered the government to recall the planes carrying the detainees to El Salvador on March 15. But it didn't do so.

While the arguments in Washington have centered on the migrants' removal from the U.S., another legal issue has emerged: What happens to the Venezuelans now?

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele offered last month to take in dangerous criminals held in U.S. detention facilities. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who had previously complained about Venezuela's refusal to accept deported migrants, said the deal would “save our taxpayer dollars.” The U.S. agreed to pay $6 million a year to keep them at the Salvadoran jail known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

Now the prisoners are stuck — with no clear access to either the Salvadoran or U.S. justice systems. “They are in a legal limbo,” said Enrique Anaya, a Salvadoran constitutional lawyer.

Several of their families have said they are not gang members at all, just migrants who had tattoos, such as “Strong like Mom.” The U.S. government has acknowledged that many did not have criminal records in the U.S.

In El Salvador, “they aren't sentenced, they didn't commit crimes, they weren't tourists. What is the migration status of these people?” asked Napoleón Campos, a Salvadoran attorney specializing in international law. “How can you enter El Salvador overnight and go straight to jail, without committing a crime, and without being sought in extradition?”

On Monday, lawyers hired by the Venezuelan government, who said they represented 30 of the detainees, submitted a habeas corpus petition for all the jailed Venezuelans.

“There is no legal basis for their detentions,” the lawyers argued in their submission to the Constitutional Chamber of El Salvador's Supreme Court. They noted that the men had not violated Salvadoran law, and they asked for their release.

Legal experts said that request was unlikely to be granted. The chamber's judges were installed after Bukele's party won a congressional majority in 2021. They have consistently backed the president.

The 238 Venezuelans arrived in San Salvador on three U.S. planes, along with 23 Salvadorans accused of belonging to the ruthless MS-13 gang. The Trump administration used an 18th-century law, the Alien Enemies Act, to expel 137 of the Venezuelans — essentially arguing they belonged to an invading force linked to the Venezuelan government. The act allows expedited deportation of noncitizens. The other 101 Venezuelans were removed under traditional immigration law. Bukele described all of them as members of Tren de Aragua, which was designated a terrorist group last month by the U.S. government.

The Trump administration has removed other undocumented migrants to third-party countries — deporting more than 400 people from countries such as China and Iran to Panama and Costa Rica last month.

The difference this time is that the migrants were jailed like criminals. The three planes were met by heavily armed Salvadoran security forces, who bused the detainees to CECOT, where their heads were forcibly shaved. The prison, built for 40,000, is known for its harsh conditions. Up to 70 men share a single cell, and they sleep on metal bunks with no mattresses, according to journalists who have been to the prison. The inmates are not allowed visits by their relatives or lawyers.

It wasn't clear when — or if — the Venezuelans would ever be tried or freed.

Noah Bullock, executive director of the human rights group Cristosal, said that President Donald Trump and Bukele had usurped from the courts the power to determine who was a criminal and who should have legal rights.

“Nobody here is waving the flag of Tren de Aragua,” he said. “But do you want the president to have the right to determine who is a terrorist and who has rights — and who doesn't?”

Rubio has likened the removal of the Venezuelans to a counterterrorism operation. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the legal basis for sending the Venezuelans to a Central American prison.

Asked for comment, the Justice Department responded with Noem's statement after U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg's initial order blocking the removal of the Venezuelans. Noem said that the ruling “disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power.”

Salvadoran attorneys said that, in order for the U.S. government to outsource prisoners to El Salvador, the countries would have to sign a treaty or convention, and get the approval of their legislatures. In such a treaty, “you'd have to spell out who would have legal jurisdiction over these people — the United States or El Salvador,” Anaya said.

“At least the U.S. is citing a law, albeit one that's raising a lot of questions in the federal courts,” he said, referring to the Alien Enemies Act. “In El Salvador, there is no law.”

The Salvadoran presidential commissioner for human rights, Andrés Guzmán, did not respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Awashingtonpost.com","This Chinese city grew its birthrate. It won't be easy to copy.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/26/china-birth-rate-grows-with-support/","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 08:01:04 GMT","

With a plummeting birth rate and a rapidly aging population, China faces a demographic crisis. The city of Tianmen is an outlier — at least temporarily.

TIANMEN, China — There is a lot riding on the shoulders of toddlers being wheeled around the lakeside parks and fluorescent-lit shopping malls of this city in the plains of central China.

Tianmen, population 1 million, is being held up as proof that this country of 1.4 billion — and falling — can spend its way out of a looming demographic crisis. The city's birth rate suddenly grew by 17 percent last year, the first rise in eight years and well above a national increase of 5.8 percent.

State media has praised Tianmen's turnaround and noted its generous subsidies, among the highest in the country, for couples who have second or third children: Parents can in theory receive up to $39,616 for a second child and $49,107 for a third — though most get far less.

“Tianmen's policy is great. It has solved my housing problem because I have many children,” said Xie Fei, who gave birth to her third child in her hometown of Tianmen in September, even though she lives and works in Wuhan, a two-hour drive away.

The 37-year-old, who works at a state-owned chemical engineering firm, will receive a total of $5,600 before her son turns 3. She has already used a $25,000 housing coupon to cover more than one-third of the cost of a Tianmen apartment.

More than 100 officials from across the country have visited Tianmen in recent months to learn its “fertility secret,” state-run Xinhua News Agency said this month, as the Chinese leadership tries to replicate its success nationwide and reverse a stubbornly shrinking population.

China's fertility rate has been less than half of the replacement rate of 2.1 for three years, despite the government having now spent a decade trying to persuade people to have more babies.

The government ended its one-child policy in 2016, but instead of spurring a baby boom, there was a slump in births at a pace rarely seen in peacetime. For Beijing, an irreversible decline could grow into an economic disaster.

Many young people, weary from the rat race at work and concerned about the soaring costs of raising children, prefer to have only one child — if they want any at all.

Boosting fertility was a top priority at China's big political meetings in Beijing this month. The government noted — for the first time — the need for “child-rearing subsidies,” among various efforts to hit an ambitious economic growth target of “around 5 percent.”

It also announced a gradual shift toward free preschool education, expanded state health-care coverage for childbirth and improved pediatric services — many of which Tianmen introduced in 2023.

According to state media, Tianmen's formula for motivating young couples to reproduce is simple: subsidies, subsidies, subsidies — and a heavy dose of birth-positive propaganda from local officials.

The support starts with coverage for prenatal tests. A one-time payout of $275 for a second child or $314 for a third child follows at birth, then monthly payments of $110 or $137 until the child is 3. Some get additional support for maternity leave.

Perhaps most significantly, the policy includes generous housing coupons. The parents of a third child can claim $16,500 off a new home — a substantial amount in Tianmen's struggling property market.

It's unclear how Tianmen, which was $1.9 billion in debt as of 2023, can afford such a high level of expenditure.

Despite its apparent success, the Tianmen city government declined multiple requests to speak with The Washington Post about its policies to encourage childbirth.

Kids really are everywhere on Tianmen's streets. But their parents — and demographers — doubt the recent uptick will continue.

Many residents said Tianmen happened to introduce the policy as a wave of young couples moved back to the city. After the coronavirus pandemic forced migrant workers to return home from east coast factory towns, many stayed to work in a local textile industry that has thrived in the age of online shopping.

Almost every new parent whom The Post spoke to during a visit this month said they planned to have a second or third child regardless of subsidies. State support, while welcomed, was not the deciding factor.

“I chose to have a second child because I grew up in a house with two kids and thought it was great,” said a 29-year-old woman surnamed Dong, who only found out about the subsidies after becoming pregnant.

“Those who want to have children will not care about the subsidies and will naturally have children anyway,” she added, speaking on the condition that her full name not be used to avoid reprisals from officials.

The city's impressive performance was also helped by expectant mothers from Tianmen, like Xie, who were living in other cities and came back to take advantage of low-cost health care and steep discounts on housing. Three parents who spoke to The Post returned only temporarily to give birth.

If the 2024 rise turns out to be short-lived, that would be bad news for Tianmen — the city plans to renovate 30 kindergartens and open 100 after-school programs this year.

Tianmen's ability to quickly boost fertility shows the importance of comprehensive support for families, but it may be difficult to sustain or replicate elsewhere, said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, who focuses on China's demography.

As a relatively small city where living costs and work pressures are low — the average monthly disposable income was $440 in 2023 — Tianmen has the budget to afford large payouts relative to local salaries.

That makes the city a potential outlier. Elsewhere in China, the governments of poorer regions may struggle to afford subsidies, while big cities are too expensive and full of stressed young people more concerned with finding a job than starting a family.

In places such as Shanghai, “the labor market is very competitive for the younger generation, so these financial incentives won't easily change their minds,” Peng said.

China became the world's second-largest economy partly because young people worked hard to achieve a better life.

Now, as the economy loses momentum, the Chinese Communist Party is increasingly concerned that the dwindling labor force will soon struggle to support the rapidly aging population. It will need many more Tianmens to avoid a demographic crisis.

The introduction of “baby bonuses” often creates a moderate and immediate increase, said Shuang Chen, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. But this is usually because people have children earlier — or, in Tianmen's case, back in their hometown — not because they decide to have more children.

“You're simply encouraging the same group of people who were going to have children anyway to have them now,” Chen said. “That's why these effects are very temporary.”

China's demographic woes are worsened by the lingering traumas of the one-child policy, which resulted in local officials forcing women to have abortions and undergo compulsory sterilization surgery. It also left behind a generation of young women determined to make their own choices about having children, free from state interference.

But the Chinese Communist Party has once again turned to its army of neighborhood officials and volunteers who enforced the one-child policy to encourage births.

For Yin Li, an official in charge of family planning in one Tianmen neighborhood, that means making daily phone calls and home visits to try to persuade couples to keep reproducing.

“It will be hard to match last year,” she said, adding that the number of births in her neighborhood “is already starting to decline.”

The 47-year-old mother of two (unsubsidized) children is concerned that too few young couples want to get married or have children. Out of 11 newlyweds on her list, only three intend to have kids. “The rest tell me they have no plans to have children,” she said.

After 17 months, Israeli reserve soldiers are questioning their leaders' decision to restart the war against Hamas.

TEL AVIV — In the days following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushed to join the fight against Hamas and allied militants in the Gaza Strip. The enlistment rate soared, according to the Israeli military, with the number of soldiers reporting for duty far surpassing those who were formally called up.

But now, as Israel resumes operations in Gaza following a temporary ceasefire, some reservist soldiers have questioned the role they are playing in their nation's longest war. The 17-month campaign, they say, has failed both to eliminate Hamas and to secure the release all of the hostages abducted during the attacks, which killed about 1,200 people. It's a shift that could complicate plans, now under consideration by Israel's political and military leaders, to reoccupy Gaza.

“In the beginning, there was no dilemma, because there was a feeling that we were all running to save the state of Israel,” said Haim Har-Zahav, who joined an Israel Defense Forces reservist unit soon after the Oct. 7 attacks.

In December, however, after serving 254 days of reserve duty over the course of the war, Har-Zahav refused to continue his service, saying he had come to the conclusion that the Israeli government “was uninterested in a hostage deal” and that “the war was going nowhere.” Har-Zahav, 47, has aged out of the category of reservists who are required to answer the call-up. But his commanders, he said, tried to persuade him to stay.

“If the government doesn't share my values, or the values of most of the country, I wondered if my being there wasn't helping the bad guys by being a useful idiot,” he said of Israel's government, citing months of public pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war and negotiate a hostage deal with Hamas. “I was educated with the ethos that you serve because no one else will do it for you. But also, that if you can bring Israelis home, you do it.”

He said others in his unit have also left in recent months.

Israel, with a population of about 9 million, maintains a conscripted army but also relies on a reserve of combat-ready troops. In the early days of the war, the IDF called up about 360,000 reservists, thousands of whom have now served multiple tours in Gaza and in Lebanon, where Israel fought a war with Hezbollah in the fall.

Reservists have always been critical to the functioning of the military in times of crisis. But in the past decades, as Israel engaged in relatively short wars with Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, combat soldiers were typically called up for a maximum of several weeks, including training and operational duties — a stark contrast with the hundreds of days that are required of reservists now.

The time away has caused hardship for the soldiers, including mounting debt as their businesses falter, pressure from family members to stay at home, and agony over the failure to eradicate Hamas and get the remaining 59 hostages — 24 of whom are still thought to be alive — out of Gaza. Together, the demands have caused some of them to reassess their commitment to the military.

The army does not publish statistics on rates of refusal among reservists, saying that the “reserve system is fully functional and fulfills all its missions,” according to an IDF spokesperson. But if it follows through on plans to launch a full-scale ground campaign and military occupation of Gaza, experts estimate that at least five divisions, or about 60,000 soldiers, would be needed — manpower that many of those who have served on the front lines suspect simply does not exist.

One active reservist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in accordance with military protocol, said his special forces unit originally made up of 14 men has whittled down to about five. He declined his call-up twice last year, but has served several stints since — a more common form of refusal among reservists who still believe Israel is under threat but are nonetheless hitting their limit, according to the reservists interviewed for this article.

The soldier added that he increasingly worries his deployment to Gaza will give a “green light” to the government to pursue unpopular war strategies there. “Now that people have been home, and had more time to think,” he said, he suspects that even fewer of his fellow soldiers will answer the next call.

During the ceasefire and hostage release deal that went into effect in January, 33 living hostages were released and aid surged into Gaza. In recent weeks, however, Netanyahu refused to continue negotiations for the second phase of the deal, saying that Israel had agreed to a 50-day ceasefire extension as proposed by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff. On March 18, Netanyahu restarted the war with deadly aerial bombardments, followed by a limited ground incursion.

As Israel gears up for another major military offensive, it has also been roiled by political crises in recent weeks, including mass demonstrations to push Netanyahu to make yet another deal with Hamas to release the hostages and end the war.

Instead, the prime minister forged ahead with controversial plans to oust the country's top security and legal officials. On Thursday, Netanyahu began the process of firing Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic security agency. On Sunday, he did the same to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who responded by saying that Netanyahu has sought to put himself “above the law, to act without checks and balances, even at the most sensitive of times,” including the war in Gaza.

“There is a feeling that the burden is on the same small number of people,” said Hagar Chen-Tzion, whose husband, a deputy company commander in the Armored Corps, was preparing to deploy for a fourth stint to Gaza this week.

She said her 3-year-old daughter has struggled with her father's absence and doesn't let him out of her sight when he is home; their 6-month-old barely knows him. Over the nearly 300 days of his reserve service, Chen-Tzion has been increasingly fearful that he will be injured or killed, as many of their friends and neighbors have. “Statistically, it feels like it will get us at some point, too,” she said.

More than 840 soldiers have died in the war, and more than 5,700 have been wounded, on Oct. 7 and since, according to IDF figures — a significant number in a small country, roughly the size of New Jersey, where the military draft is universal.

And while many reservists say they signed up for the sacrifice, they are having discussions at home with their wives, in combat buddy WhatsApp groups and on social media about the painful decision not to serve, even as Hamas regroups, the hostages remain in captivity, their fellow soldiers are increasingly stretched and the pace of war is unpredictable.

Because the army was not designed to rely on so many reservists for so long, “they never expected to put us in this situation,” said Ari Krauss, a reservist from Golani, an elite IDF infantry brigade.

He said that after being away from his home, his job and his 2-year-old daughter for five months over the past year and a half, he has been told to prepare for another two months of service in the coming year. His wife doesn't know if she can take it again.

“With our families, there's respect and appreciation or whatever,” he said. “But that really doesn't help when, at the end of the day, Daddy isn't home to help out.”

Krauss says his unit has thinned from 22 to about 15, with a couple of soldiers being swapped in to help with the shortage.

Chen-Tzion, the wife of the reservist, supported Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners, known as the Religious Zionist bloc. She worries that the government she helped vote into power is not doing enough, militarily or diplomatically, to free the hostages or neutralize Israel's enemies on its borders.

“I want to know that if my husband is called it is because it is really necessary, and because we will really win,” she said. “At the moment, the aims do not feel clear enough.”

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

The head of Turkey's largest opposition party visited jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in prison on Tuesday, after his detention sparked a week of protests.

The leader of Turkey's primary opposition party visited jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on Tuesday, as sustained protests calling for his release entered their seventh night.

After a two-hour visit with Imamoglu on Tuesday, Ozgur Ozel, who leads the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), sounded defiant. The imprisoned mayor and fellow CHP members who are jailed are “not afraid,” Ozel said, and have denied the corruption-related charges brought by prosecutors.

Ozel has repeatedly said his party and its supporters will not back down, but he also announced that Tuesday night would mark the end of scheduled protests in front of Istanbul's city hall, the Associated Press reported. Amid the largest wave of Turkish street protests in years, however, agitated CHP supporters might defy their party leadership and continue protests in a different form or venue.

Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute's Turkish program, said she expects protests — which appear to have already affected President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's behavior — to continue across Istanbul and the country. “I don't think [Erdogan] expected this many people to show up. I don't think anyone expected this many people to show up,” Tol said.

For Erdogan's political opponents, the coming days may serve as an inflection point. Imamoglu's victory in the Istanbul mayoral election in 2019 was a major blow to Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Since then, Imamoglu has widely been seen as one of the only opposition politicians who may be capable of ending Erdogan's 22-year-long grip on power.

While Turkey's next presidential election is scheduled for 2028, some opposition members suspect that the government is sidelining Imamoglu to pave the way for an earlier vote and another Erdogan term. The president's allies have increasingly tightened their control over state institutions and have been criticized for deepening restrictions on speech and expression.

Erdogan and members of his government have rejected opposition accusations of interference with the rule of law.

In response to the protests, Erdogan blamed the opposition for making “the most vile and unlawful statements” in Turkey's political history, and described the protests as a “show” and as “street terror.”

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya accused opposition protesters of provocations and incitement, including more than 40 people who were detained for “vile insults” that targeted Erdogan's family. Turkish officials say more than 1,400 protesters have been detained since the middle of last week. Almost 1,000 people were in custody as of Tuesday evening, Yerlikaya wrote on social media.

“No concessions will be made to those who attempt to terrorize the streets,” he wrote.

In several cities, including Istanbul and Ankara, protesters peacefully defied restrictions on assembling in recent days. Students across the country walked out of classes. Some demonstrations ended in violent clashes.

International human rights observers criticized the Turkish police's role. The Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Michael O'Flaherty, said in a statement Monday that he was “following with concern the reports about disproportionate use of force by the police,” and he called on Turkish authorities “to immediately release all those individuals who are detained for the legitimate exercise of their human rights.”

O'Flaherty and other human rights observers also voiced concern about the detention of several journalists. In a statement Tuesday, Turkey's Media and Law Studies Association said 11 journalists have been taken into custody for covering the protests. Seven of them were formally arrested Tuesday, the association said.

Turkey's political crisis also threatens to imperil the country's economy, which was already struggling after a long streak of high inflation. Turkey's currency and stock markets were thrown into turmoil by Imamoglu's arrest last week, prompting an exodus of foreign investors and the imposition of emergency governmental measures to stabilize markets.

Turkey's finance minister has spent years convincing foreign investors that Turkey is past instability and chaos, Tol said. “I think that work has been undone now,” she said.

Erdogan on Monday said that he will never allow those gains to be harmed and that protecting “macro-financial stability” is a priority, local news reported.

“The Turkish economy is in such a fragile state,” Tol said, adding that any bold moves by the president could backfire. Erdogan is banking on the protesters leaving within a few days, long before the next elections, she said. “But here he is taking a huge risk: What if they don't go back home? If there's months and months of chaos, the cost to the economy is going to be huge.”

The grain and fertilizer proposal, which drew pushback from Ukraine, came alongside a U.S.-brokered pact between Russia and Ukraine to expand a limited ceasefire.

The United States agreed Tuesday to help Russia sell its grain and fertilizer on the world market — a move that was quickly criticized in Kyiv as a unilateral concession on a long-standing Kremlin demand.

The grain deal was announced in a U.S. statement on negotiations with Russia regarding a U.S.-brokered framework between Russia and Ukraine to expand a limited ceasefire to include the Black Sea, as the Trump administration pushes for a more comprehensive deal.

In later public statements, the Kremlin said the grain and fertilizer agreement would need to include relief from Western economic sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv was not consulted on the proposal and would not support it.

“It's a concession,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former economy minister in Ukraine who heads the Kyiv School of Economics, said after the announcement. “But [it is] unclear for what.”

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has claimed that it has struggled to access export markets for its agricultural goods. In the past, Western officials responded by saying that there were no formal sanctions on the goods and that Russian exports had continued at high levels.

Agricultural experts said they were confused by the latest proposal, noting that while a prior agreement on shipping through the Black Sea had broken down in 2023, both Ukraine and Russia had been able to find ways to export their grain since then.

Andrey Sizov, managing director at research firm SovEcon, which tracks the Black Sea grain market, said Tuesday that the U.S. announcement was “surprising,” as Russian food and fertilizer exports had hit “record highs since the war began.” Data collected by SovEcon showed Russian grain exports hitting 71 million metric tons in the 2023-2024 season, compared with just 42 million in 2021-2022.

“Looks like another nod to Moscow,” Sizov wrote on X, adding that the move could indicate that U.S. sanctions on Rosselkhozbank, a state-owned agricultural bank, would be lifted.

In a later phone call, however, Sizov emphasized that the U.S. proposal was so vague, it was “hard to know if it was an actual concession.”

He added that some key aspects of sanctions relief, such as the reconnection of Rosselkhozbank to the Brussels-based SWIFT financial messaging system, would require cooperation with European allies.

The Kremlin said Tuesday that it would implement the agreements reached in Saudi Arabia only if the West lifted “sanctions on Rosselkhozbank and other financial institutions that provide operations in international trade in food, fishery products and fertilizers.”

“This includes connecting Rosselkhozbank to SWIFT,” the Kremlin added.

The language on U.S. support for Russian grain exports was not included in a separate White House statement detailing the results of U.S. negotiations with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. Zelensky said that the issue had not been on the agenda for those meetings and that Kyiv did not support it.

“We believe that would weaken our position and the sanctions regime,” Zelensky said at a news conference.

“Oral bilateral agreements can only be considered as the first step towards achieving a binding trilateral agreement,” said Nikolai Petrov, an expert with the New Eurasian Strategies Center, a think tank founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

The talks in Riyadh over recent days came less than two years after Moscow unilaterally withdrew from an agreement to allow Black Sea grain exports from Ukraine, claiming that its demands to allow the export of Russian grain and fertilizer were not being met.

That agreement, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative and brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, was designed to alleviate global food prices that had surged after Russia invaded Ukraine and cut off a major global grain supplier from world markets.

Earlier Tuesday, Russia's top diplomat said exports via the Black Sea were a key Kremlin priority for the talks being held in Riyadh.

“We are for the resumption of the Black Sea initiative in some form more acceptable to all,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Russian state television, adding that the aim was to make “the grain market, the fertilizer market to be predictable.”

Moscow, Lavrov noted, is concerned about the food situation in Africa and other countries of the Global South that have suffered from the “games of the West.”

While global food prices spiked in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they have remained far lower in the years since then, according to U.N. statistics. Sizov said he thought it was unlikely that the U.S. proposal on Tuesday would affect global prices.

“Wheat prices are already 30 percent lower than they were before the war, despite the lack of a ceasefire, lack of a grain deal,” he said.

Daniel Fried, a retired career diplomat who now works for the Atlantic Council, wrote on X that the deal to facilitate exports was a gain for Russia but that there was little sign of gains for Ukraine so far. Russia was “slow walking” the process, he added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte says that four U.S. soldiers who went missing while training in Lithuania have been killed, but that he does not yet know the details

WARSAW, Poland — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Wednesday that four U.S. soldiers who went missing while training in Lithuania have been killed, but that he did not yet know the details.

A U.S. official would say only that the four soldiers were involved in a training accident. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not comment on the status of the soldiers.

Rutte said, during a trip to Warsaw, that his thoughts were with their families and with the United States.

“The news came out about four American soldiers who were killed in an incident in Lithuania. This is still early news so we do not know the details. This is really terrible news and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones,” Rutte told reporters in Warsaw.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

VILNIUS, Lithuania — Four U.S. Army soldiers have gone missing at a training area outside of Lithuania's capital, and a search is underway, the U.S. military said Wednesday.

A statement from U.S. Army Europe and Africa public affairs in Wiesbaden, Germany said the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time.

It said further information will be provided as new information becomes available.

Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported that four U.S. soldiers and vehicle were reported missing Tuesday afternoon during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Belarus.

The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all NATO members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.

Relations soured further over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 , and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Ukraine in its fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Tributes are pouring in for a veteran Zimbabwean journalist who rose to prominence by exposing government corruption

HARARE, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe is mourning Geoffrey Nyarota, one of the country's most prominent journalists best known for exposing government corruption and launching what became the country's most popular and critical independent newspaper.

Nyarota died on Saturday of colon cancer. He was 74. His burial is set for Wednesday.

The veteran newsman came to prominence in the late 1980s when, as editor of state-run newspaper The Chronicle, he exposed a racket involving cabinet ministers and top government officials who jumped the line to buy cars from a local vehicle assembly firm, and resold them for a profit at a time the country was facing vehicles shortages.

A commission of inquiry was established, five ministers resigned, one of them eventually taking his own life, but Nyarota lost his job and left the country to teach journalism in southern Africa.

Nyarota had trained as a teacher, one of the few jobs open to educated Blacks during white minority rule in what was then known as Rhodesia, before branching into journalism.

Government spokesman Nick Mangwana said Nyarota had “left an indelible mark on the country's journalism landscape.”

“Nyarota slept, dreamt, breathed and lived journalism,” said the Media Institute of Southern Africa, a regional media freedom group.

In 1999, Nyarota helped launch The Daily News, an independent newspaper that challenged the state hegemony on the media. With its motto ” Telling it like it is,” and Nyarota as editor-in-chief, the newspaper gave space to dissenting voices while poking at government corruption and excesses. Soon, the paper was outselling the government-controlled Herald daily newspaper.

Nyarota and journalists from the Daily News were arrested multiple times, the paper's printing press was bombed in 2001, before it was closed over licensing issues in 2003. Nyarota had resigned from the paper earlier in 2002 due to differences with its new management.

In 2003, he moved to the U.S as a fellow of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, and also ran an online publication, The Zimbabwe Times. He later returned to Zimbabwe and chaired a government-supported panel of inquiry into media ethics in 2014.

Nyarota was a recipient of several international awards, including the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award in 2001, Golden Pen of Freedom Award from the World Association of Newspapers in 2002, and the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize the same year.

He described his journalism work in the face of adversity as a kind of national responsibility.

“It's a form of national service for the welfare of our people,” he told The Harvard Gazette after his enrolment at the institution.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The top editor of the Atlantic magazine revealed on Monday that he knew about U.S. airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen hours before they happened, because he was added to a Signal messaging app group chat where members of the Trump administration appeared to be discussing such war plans.

Editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg said he received a Signal connection request on March 11 from someone whom he believed to be national security adviser Michael Waltz. Two days later, he said he was added to a conversation called “Houthi PC small group” with what appeared to be 18 members of the administration, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance, where they talked about plans to bomb Yemen.

U.S. air and naval assets hit multiple Houthi targets in Yemen on March 15. The Houthi rebels are an Iran-backed terrorist organization based in Yemen that has said their attacks are intended to help end the war in Gaza, according to the Associated Press.

In a March 25 Fox News interview, Waltz said he took ""full responsibility"" for Goldberg's access to the Signal conversation.

“I take full responsibility. I built the group. My job is to make sure everything's coordinated,” Waltz said. But in terms of whether he knew who Goldberg was and his role at the Atlantic, Waltz added, “I can tell you 100% I don't know this guy... He wasn't on my phone. And we're going to figure out how this happened.""

Goldberg broke down details of the conversation between people involved in the Signal group, including accounts identified as “JD Vance,” “MAR” (the initials of Secretary of State Marco Antonio Rubio) and “TG” (which Goldberg said could be Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence).

Goldberg, a veteran foreign affairs reporter, said he struggled to believe that this Signal group chat was real. “I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,” he wrote.

""I have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal,” Goldberg wrote. “But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters — not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I've never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.""

President Trump first told reporters on Monday that he “doesn't know anything about it” when asked about the report in the Atlantic. He later told NBC News that he stands with Waltz, and Goldberg's inclusion in the Signal group chat had ""no impact at all"" on the operation.

""Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" Trump said.

White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that the message thread described in the article “appears to be authentic.”

“We are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” the statement continued. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security.”

Hegseth, meanwhile, referred to Goldberg as “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist” and added, “Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that.”

Signal is a private, secure messaging app launched in 2018. It skyrocketed to more than 40 million users globally in 2021, after it became popular for its end-to-end encryption of messages sent and received over the app, similar to other popular encrypted messaging apps WhatsApp and Telegram. WhatsApp is owned by Meta, while Signal is owned and operated by the Signal Foundation, a nonprofit cofounded by the app's creators.

End-to-end encrypted messaging apps allow only the sender and the chosen recipient to read the messages exchanged over the platform. Signal also offers end-to-end encrypted video and voice calls.

Nothing is stored on Signal's servers — not even employees at Signal can read any of the messages being shared over the platform they run.

The app also offers an option to enable disappearing messages, where users set a timer for specific messages to delete automatically, to protect and maintain all conversation security.

“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Atlantic reporter Shane Harris.

Several former U.S. officials told Goldberg and Harris that they had used Signal in the past specifically to share “unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems.”

Some members will therefore occasionally use Signal while traveling abroad, because the government has its own communication system specifically to share classified information either over government-approved equipment or in a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, which most Cabinet-level officials have installed in their homes, according to the Atlantic.

“They knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app,” Goldberg said of the former officials and Signal. “Waltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation.”

In addition to improperly discussing classified information, adding a journalist to the group chat, even by accident, creates new security and legal issues: providing classified information to someone who was not authorized to receive it.

“That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack,” Goldberg pointed out.

Shortly after the Atlantic's report was published, congressional Democrats called for an investigation into the national security officials who were involved in the Signal conversation.

“This is an outrageous national security breach and heads should roll,” Pennsylvania Rep. Chris Deluzio, a member of the Armed Services Committee, told Axios. “We need a full investigation and hearing into this.”

“We can't chalk this up to a simple mistake,” another Democrat, California Rep. Sara Jacobs, told the outlet. “People should be fired for this.”

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on X, “This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe.”

New York Rep. Pat Ryan, a Democrat who also sits on the Armed Services Committee, posted on X, “If House Republicans won't hold a hearing on how this happened IMMEDIATELY, I'll do it my damn self.”

Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican on the Armed Services Committee, told Axios that while he has “accidentally sent the wrong person a text,” the “unconscionable action was sending this info over non-secure networks.”

“None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,” Bacon said.

“It appears that mistakes were made, no question,” Republican Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said. “We'll try to get to ground truth and take appropriate action.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters at the Capitol that there should only be one investigation into how Goldberg's number was added.

“I'm told they're doing an investigation to find out how that number was included, and that should be that,” Johnson said. “I'm not sure that it requires much additional attention.”

Three people were ""found conscious"" after two jets from the French air force's acrobatics team apparently collided near an air base in northeastern France on Tuesday, authorities said.

The Alpha Jet planes are thought to have collided near an air base west of Saint-Dizier in northeastern France, the French air and space force told AFP.

Three people -- two pilots and one passenger -- ejected and were ""found conscious"", according to the military.

One person suffered multiple injuries, a source told AFP.

One of the planes crashed into a silo, sparking a fire.

There were no civilian casualties.

""Emergency services have been mobilised,"" Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on X.

France has been using the light Alpha twin-engined aircraft to train Ukrainian pilots after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In August 2024, two French pilots died after their Rafale jets collided in mid-air in eastern France, in a rare accident involving the cutting-edge military aircraft.

President Donald Trump's executive order seeking broad changes to how elections are run in the U.S. is vast in scope and holds the potential to reorder the voting landscape across the country, even as it faces almost certain litigation.

He wants to require voters to show proof that they are U.S. citizens before they can register for federal elections, count only mail or absentee ballots received by Election Day, set new rules for voting equipment and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from being able to donate in certain elections.

A basic question underlying the sweeping actions he signed Tuesday: Can he do it, given that the Constitution gives wide leeway to the states to develop their own election procedures? Here are some of the main points of the executive order and questions it raises.

Trump's order calls for the federal voter registration form to be amended so prospective voters must provide documentary proof of citizenship, such as a U.S. passport or a birth certificate.

It also says states should turn over their voter lists and records of voter list maintenance to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Government Efficiency for review, and directs federal agencies to share data with states to help them identify noncitizens on their rolls.

If states refuse to collaborate with federal law enforcement to prosecute election crimes, they could potentially lose out on federal grants, the order says.

Noncitizen voting, which is already a felony in federal elections that can lead to prison time and deportation, is exceedingly rare. Still, Trump falsely claimed in 2024 that it might happen in large enough numbers to sway the outcome of the presidential race, and it has been a top conservative priority in recent months.

Republicans have been trying to get a documentary proof of citizenship requirement through Congress, a goal this order seeks to accomplish. Voting rights groups have expressed concern about such a requirement, saying it could disenfranchise the millions of Americans who do not have proof of citizenship readily available.

The order requires votes to be “cast and received” by Election Day and says federal funding should be conditional on state compliance with that deadline. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Perhaps no state is more notorious for drawn-out vote counts than California, the nation's most populous. It allows ballots to be counted if they are received up to seven days following the election as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.

Most California voters cast ballots they receive in the mail, and in the pursuit of accuracy, thoroughness and counting every vote, the state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks or even a month or more. In one Northern California U.S. House primary last year, a recount settled the outcome nearly two months after the election. At the time, Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who oversees elections, said in a statement: “I understand that people want finality, but accuracy is of utmost importance.”

But the extended tallies have raised fears that they could undercut, rather than bolster, voter confidence. In 2018, then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan described California's election system as “bizarre” in a year when Democrats picked off a string of GOP-held House seats.

In a statement, California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla said Trump's order “does nothing to improve the safety of our federal elections — what it would do is disenfranchise millions of eligible American voters.”

Padilla, who formerly served as California's chief elections officer, said Trump “lacks the authority to implement many of the changes laid out in this illegal executive order.”

The executive order instructs the Election Assistance Commission to amend its guidelines for voting systems to protect election integrity. That would include guidance that voting systems should not rely on ballots that use barcodes or QR codes in the vote-counting process.

Trump instructed the commission to “take appropriate action to review and, if appropriate, re-certify voting systems” under those new standards within six months of the order.

In Georgia, an important presidential battleground, virtually all in-person voters use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode that is read by a scanner to count the votes.

It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and other jurisdictions throughout the country that use these machines.

Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. The Georgia Legislature last year passed a law requiring that QR codes be removed from ballots by July 2026.

The order cracks down on foreign nationals contributing or donating in U.S. elections. It's an issue that's been bubbling in recent years in the states, as Republicans seek to dampen the influence of Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss.

Wyss, who lives in Wyoming, has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to 501(c) nonprofit organizations that support liberal causes. One of those groups, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, donated a combined $3.9 million to enshrine abortion protections in the Ohio Constitution. It also helped thwart a proposed constitutional amendment advanced by Ohio Republicans the previous summer that would have made passing future constitutional amendments harder.

During the run-up to last year's presidential election, legislative Republicans linked then-President Joe Biden's appearance on Ohio's fall ballot to passing a ban on contributions from foreign individuals, companies, governments or political parties to campaigns for or against proposed amendments to the state constitution.

Other states have followed suit, most recently Kansas — which passed a nearly identical bill earlier this month after hearing testimony from Ohio's secretary of state. Like the Ohio bill, it appears partly a response to a successful campaign to protect abortion rights in Kansas, which received money from the Sixteen Thirty Fund. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has not said publicly whether she'll sign it.

The federal government plays a fairly limited role in American elections. Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution gives states the authority to determine the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run. The so-called “Elections Clause” doesn't get into the specifics of voting or ballot-counting procedures -– those details are left to the states – but it does give Congress the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office.

It does not mention any role for the president or the executive branch in regulating elections. Biden issued an executive order in 2021 directing federal agencies to take steps to promote voting access, but Republicans at the time argued that the order was unconstitutional and exceeded the president's authority. Trump rescinded the Biden order earlier this year.

“A president does not set election law and never will,” said Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, a grassroots advocacy organization that supports expanded voter access.

Sophia Lin Lakin, the director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, called core parts of the executive order “a blatant overreach that threatens to disenfranchise tens of millions of eligible voters.”

Given the nation's long history of decentralized, state-run elections, any attempt to change state election laws by executive order is likely to face challenges in court. Marc Elias, a leading Democratic election and voting rights attorney, promised exactly that.

“Moments ago, Donald Trump signed a massive voter suppression executive order,"" he said in a social media post. ""This will not stand. We will sue.”

Ultimately, the courts will decide how far Trump can go in overhauling election procedures.

By Raphael Satter

WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -The best-known member of Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE Service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.

Edward Coristine is among the most visible members of the DOGE effort that has been given sweeping access to official networks as it attempts to radically downsize the U.S. government.

Past reporting had focused on his youth - he is 19 - and his chosen nickname of ""bigballs,"" which became a pop culture punchline. Musk has championed the teen on his social media site X, telling his followers last month that ""Big Balls is awesome.""

Beginning around 2022, while still in high school, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, according to corporate and digital records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with half a dozen former associates. Among its users was a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name ""EGodly,"" according to digital records preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools and the online cybersecurity tool Any.Run.

The details of Coristine's connection to EGodly have not been previously reported.

On Feb. 15, 2023, EGodly thanked Coristine's company for its assistance in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

""We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website,"" the message said.

The digital records reviewed by Reuters showed the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was tied to internet protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other Coristine-owned entities between October 2022 and June 2023, and that some users attempting to access the site around that time would hit a DiamondCDN ""Security check.""

Coristine did not return messages seeking comment. Musk's team, which has adopted the name ""Department of Government Efficiency"" though it is not an official government department, did not respond to emails about Coristine. He is listed as a ""senior adviser"" at the State Department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to one official at each agency who told Reuters they had seen his name in their respective agencies' staff directory.

On LinkedIn, Coristine describes himself as a ""Volunteer (Intern) Plumber"" with the U.S. government.

The State Department did not return messages asking about Coristine. CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.

EGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for the past year; attempts to elicit comment from eight people who participated in or interacted with EGodly were unsuccessful.

'THESE ARE BAD FOLKS'

DiamondCDN's website - CDN typically stands for ""content delivery network"" - was registered in mid-2022, according to records collected by DomainTools. It pitched itself as offering ""excellent security tools"" that would help ""lower your infrastructure costs,"" according to copies of the site maintained by the Internet Archive. The site said the company ""has no business inspecting user content.""

In 2023, EGodly boasted on its Telegram channel of hijacking phone numbers, breaking into unspecified law enforcement email accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and cryptocurrency theft. Early that year, the group distributed the personal details of an FBI agent who they said was investigating them, circulating his phone number, photographs of his house, and other private details on Telegram.

EGodly also posted an audio recording of an obscene prank call made to the agent's phone and a video, shot from the inside of a car, of an unknown party driving by the agent's house in Wilmington, Delaware at night and screaming out the window, ""EGodly says you're a bitch!""

Reuters could not independently verify EGodly's boasts of cybercriminal activity, including its claims to have hijacked phone numbers or infiltrated law enforcement emails. But it was able to authenticate the video by visiting the same Wilmington address and comparing the building to the one in the footage.

The FBI agent targeted by EGodly, who is now retired, told Reuters that the group had drawn law enforcement attention because of its connection to swatting, the dangerous practice of making hoax emergency calls to send armed officers swarming targeted addresses. The agent didn't go into detail. Reuters is not identifying him out of concern for further harassment.

""These are bad folks,"" the former agent said. ""They're not a pleasant group.""

He declined to comment further about the harassment or whether EGodly had been or still was the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI didn't return messages seeking comment on EGodly.

Reuters was not able to ascertain how long EGodly used DiamondCDN, or whether EGodly paid Coristine's company. Archived copies of DiamondCDN's website said the firm envisioned having both paying and nonpaying customers.

Another individual who has been subject to abuse from EGodly and a cybercrime researcher who has followed the group said it was composed of hardened fraudsters, citing the group's makeup and the credibility of its claims. Both asked not to be identified, citing fears of retaliation.

Even if the connection between Coristine and EGodly were fleeting, Nitin Natarajan, who served as the deputy director of CISA under former President Joe Biden, told Reuters it was worrying that someone who provided services to EGodly only two years ago was part of a group that has gained wide access to government networks.

""This stuff was not in the distant past,"" he said. ""The recency of the activity and the types of groups he was associated would definitely be concerning.""

Rep. Lauren Boebert has hinted that the Trump administration is working behind the scenes on a plan to rename Washington, D.C., the “District of America.”

“I would caution my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to refrain from making fun of the ‘Gulf of America' because next up, you know it may end up being the ‘District of America' that we're working on,” Boebert told lawmakers during a Water, Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee hearing Tuesday in response to jibes from opposition members.

“So just, you know, keep the jokes at bay, and maybe we'll just stick with the Gulf of America for now.”

President Donald Trump took bold action on his first day in office after he signed an executive bill that ordered the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.”

Earlier on in the hearing, Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, brought up the contentious issue of renaming the water basin. He began by stating: “Now, back to the Gulf of America. Stephen Colbert proposed this as a joke in 2010, and it's important to remember what was going on at the time – what led to the joke.”

Huffman went on to explain that the late-night show host first made the “Gulf of America” suggestion in relation to the catastrophic BP Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

The roughly 4.9-million-barrel spill caused widespread environmental devastation in the Gulf region, claimed 11 lives, and devasted the coastal economy.

“Colbert used the name change as a gimmick to raise awareness of the disaster. It dragged on for five months – something our Republican friends seem to have forgotten about as they advance to a dirty drilling agenda,” Huffman continued.

“My entire career has been centered around natural resources,” Huffman told reporters in December 2024 upon being re-elected.

Boebert, a MAGA loyalist who has made a determined effort to advance President Trump's agenda – including his “Drill Baby Drill” pledge and the suggestion to place Trump's face on a $100 bill.

Danish officials appear relieved after Vice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance changed their Greenland visit itinerary, which had sparked anger among residents.

The couple, joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, will visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland. The Second Lady was initially scheduled for a solo trip to Greenland's capital, Nuuk, and the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.

The visit comes after President Donald Trump reiterated his desire for the U.S. to obtain Greenland, claiming earlier this week that the territory is important for national security.

The itinerary change keeps the group away from highly-populated areas and reduces the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents protesting the Trump administration's attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster DR Wednesday that the Vances' updated travel plans are a good thing, calling it a de-escalation.

Anne Merrild, a professor and Arctic expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders.

Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table.

“It's a signal to the whole world, it's a strong signal to Denmark, it's a signal to Greenland,” she said. “And of course it's also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we're pursuing.”

The original itinerary was viewed as controversial because Greenland doesn't currently have a government after holding elections earlier this month, according to Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College.

“Greenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don't want the U.S. to visit right now, when Greenland doesn't have a government in place,” Jacobsen said.

Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., visited Greenland in January, arriving on Trump Force One just weeks before his father took office.

Trump Jr. posted a video of himself there on Instagram, posing beneath a statue of the Lutheran missionary Hans Egede who is credited with first settling the barren territory in 1721 before spinning his phone camera around to showcase the “incredible scenery.”

Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk also turned out to be among his entourage.

After the visit, Pipaluk Lynge, an MP from Greenland's largest party and chair of the parliamentary foreign and security policy committee, said the whole event was “staged.” A spokesperson for Trump Jr. denied this.

Danish MP Rasmus Jarlov wasn't happy with the visit, writing on X: “This level of disrespect from the coming US president towards very, very loyal allies and friends is record-setting.”

Scientists have discovered a “blueprint” for long life by decoding the genome, gut health and lifestyle of the world's oldest person who died last year at 117.

Maria Branyas Morera, an American-Catalan Caucasian woman, was born in March 1907 in San Francisco, US, and died in August 2024.

While centenarians are becoming more common thanks to advances in health care, supercentenarians aged over 110 are still extremely rare.

Morera exceeded the average life expectancy of Catalonia, Spain, by over 30 years. She attributed her longevity to “luck and good genetics” and to “avoiding toxic people”.

A yet-to-be peer-reviewed study analysed her genes, microbiome and lifestyle to find the cells in her body functioned as if they were 17 years younger than her actual age. And her gut health was extremely youthful, resembling that of a child.

For the new study, researchers developed a comprehensive analysis platform to assess different tissues of Morera for the activity of her genome and proteins as well as microbes living on them.

They compared the results with data from non-supercentenarian populations. Scientists found the supercentenarian's genome likely contained variations linked to a stronger immune system, reduced cancer risk and protection from heart disease.

They particularly probed a type of genome activity modification that happens normally in the body called DNA methylation, which has been linked in previous studies to ageing.

“DNA methylation is probably the most studied epigenetic mark in cell biology and disease, being also disrupted as we age,” the study noted.

In this measure, Morera was “an outlier”, exhibiting a “much younger biological age than her real chronological age” across three different tissues.

Morera also appeared to have an efficient lipid metabolism with low levels of VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides, which are linked to heart disease.

“Overall, these data suggest that one of the reasons that our supercentenarian reached such a world record age was that her cells ‘felt' or ‘behaved' as younger cells, with a biological age of a centenarian,” the study noted.

She had a healthy gut with what researchers described as an “anti-inflammatory” microbiome.

Morera's gut was rich in Bifidobacterium, a type of bacteria known for its anti-inflammatory properties. “Microorganisms are critical in determining not only the metabolite composition of our body, but also inflammation, intestinal permeability, cognition, and bone and muscle health,” researchers explained.

However, the exact link between the community of microbes living in one's body and longevity remains unclear.

Morera had said she avoided alcohol and smoking, enjoyed daily walks, and followed a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, along with three yoghurts a day.

A growing body of research has found links between a high-fibre and probiotic-rich Mediterranean diet to a healthy gut.

“The picture that emerges from our study shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked,” the study concluded.

A woman accusing French actor Gerard Depardieu of sexual assault told a landmark trial in Paris that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set.

Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters).

He denies any sexual assault.

Day three of the Paris trial focused on the evidence of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.

“Out of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,” she said, adding she was “under shock”, “petrified”, and said nothing.

In a second incident, she said Depardieu suddenly put both his hands on her breasts: “I said no, I was scared.”

She also described telling Depardieu “no” during a third similar incident.

The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.

Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations on Wednesday in court, saying: “I'm not like that.”

“I think that maybe, I don't know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,” Depardieu said.

“But I'm not only that.

“I still respect people.”

The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his bodyguard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.

On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualised language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault.

He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behaviour was sexual.

Neither women has consented to be identified in this case.

The four-day trial was to continue Thursday, with the verdict expected at a later date.

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros (81,000 US dollars) if convicted.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

A panel of justices on Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former president Jair Bolsonaro to stand trial over an alleged attempt to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat.

All five justices ruled in favour of accepting the charges levelled by prosecutor-general Paulo Gonet, who accused Bolsonaro and 33 others of attempting a coup that included a plan to poison his successor, current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and kill a Supreme Court judge.

The justices said seven close allies should also stand trial on five counts: attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organisation, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage characterised by violence and a serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.

The former president has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and says he is being politically persecuted.

Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction carries a sentence of up to 12 years. Combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars.

“Coups kill,” Justice Flavio Dino said when casting his vote. “It doesn't matter if it happens today, the following month or a few years later.”

Mr Gonet on Tuesday said those facing the charges sought to maintain Bolsonaro in power “at all costs” in a multi-step scheme that accelerated after the far-right politician lost to the current president.

As in his February indictment, Mr Gonet said part of the plot included a plan to kill Mr Lula and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who were put under surveillance by the alleged conspirators.

The plan did not go ahead because at the last minute the accused failed to get the army's commander on board, Mr Gonet said.

“Frustration overwhelmed the members of the criminal organisation who, however, did not give up on the violent seizure of power, not even after the elected president of the republic was sworn in,” the prosecutor said.

That was a reference to the riot on January 8 2023 when Bolsonaro supporters stormed and trashed the Supreme Court, presidential palace and Congress in Brasilia a week after Mr Lula took office.

Bolsonaro's running mate during the 2022 election and former Defense Minister Walter Braga Netto, ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres and his aide-de-camp Mauro Cid, among others, will also stand trial. The court will decide on the fate of the others later.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a tentative US brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges on negotiating a broader peace.

Russia's Defence Ministry said Ukrainian drone attacks hit an electric facility in the Bryansk region early on Wednesday and a power grid facility in the Kursk region on Tuesday, leading to a power cut affecting thousands of people.

“The Kyiv regime is doing everything to derail the Russian-US agreements on the gradual settlement of the Ukrainian conflict,” the ministry said on Wednesday.

Ukraine's General Staff denied the allegations, saying Moscow's claims were part of a broader disinformation campaign aimed at justifying continued hostilities.

The accusations came hours after Washington announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine and Russia to pause attacks on energy sites as well as taking steps to ensure safe navigation for ships in the Black Sea.

The deal followed three days of separate US-Ukrainian and US-Russian talks in the Saudi capital.

The talks were part of efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to implement a limited, 30-day ceasefire that Moscow and Kyiv agreed to in principle last week. That has so far failed to materialise as both sides continue to launch drone and rocket attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that Kyiv had agreed with US negotiators in Riyadh “that a ceasefire for energy infrastructure can start today”, and expressed his country's willingness to comply with the agreement while warning Russia would face “strong retaliation” if it attacked Ukrainian energy facilities.

Ukrainian officials have contested claims by the Kremlin that Russian forces have not attacked energy sites in Ukraine since March 18. Mr Zelensky's communications adviser Dmytro Lytvyn said Moscow was “lying” about observing a ceasefire on energy infrastructure.

“They've been hitting our energy sites with bombs, attack drones and FPV drones. We're not going into all the details, but there have already been eight confirmed hits on energy facilities,” he wrote.

“Every night our air defence forces shoot down nearly a hundred attack drones – and many of those drones were likely targeting other energy facilities.”

On Tuesday, the White House said in separate statements that the sides had “agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea”.

Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the UN and Turkey but was halted by Russia the next year.

After the White House issued its statement, the Kremlin warned that a potential Black Sea deal could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial organisations involved in food and fertiliser trade are lifted and their access to the Swift system of international payments is ensured.

Mr Zelensky described the demands as an example of Moscow “manipulating, twisting agreements and lying” about the terms of the agreement.

“There are absolutely clear statements that have been published by the White House, everyone can see what is stated there,” he said. “And there is something that the Kremlin is lying about again: that supposedly the (ceasefire) in the Black Sea depends on the issue of sanctions.”

In an apparent reference to Moscow's demands, the White House said on Tuesday that the US “will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions”.

Asked about when Washington might help Moscow achieve those ambitions, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said on Wednesday that contacts between Russia and the US “continue quite intensively” and that authorities are “satisfied with how pragmatic, constructive and productive our dialogue is”.

Meanwhile, Kryvyi Rih, Mr Zelensky's home town, came under the “most massive kamikaze drone attack since the beginning of the war” on Tuesday night, said the city administration head, Oleksandr Vilkul.

Although no one was killed or injured, civilian infrastructure including warehouses, an administration building and a fire station were widely targeted, he added. Multiple fires were sparked across the city, he said.

“Everyone is alive, thank God. It's truly a miracle. The destruction is significant,” Mr Vilkul said.

Civilian infrastructure also came under strike in the Sumy, Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions, local authorities said.

Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved by the news that US Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland, reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration's attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

The couple will now visit the US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance's previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.

President Donald Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a US ally and Nato member.

As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.

The vice president's decision to visit a US military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation.

Yet Mr Vance has also criticised longstanding European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonising partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the US.

Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster DR Wednesday that the Vances' updated travel plans are a good thing.

The minister said the change was a deescalation, even as he said the Americans are treating it as the opposite, with Mr Vance suggesting in an online video that global security is at stake.

Rasmus Jarlov, a Danish politician and spokesman on Greenlandic Affairs for the Conservatives, wrote on X that the new schedule means the Vances will avoid any confrontations with Greenlanders.

Mr Jarlov noted that, after all, a vice president visiting an American military base is not controversial.

Mr Vance is allowed to visit the space base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the US regarding the defence of Greenland.

“What is controversial here is all about the timing,” he said.

“Greenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don't want the US to visit right now, when Greenland doesn't have a government in place,” following the election earlier this month.

Coalition negotiations are ongoing.

Ahead of the vice president's announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday night that it had “not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official”.

Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday that the visit was “unacceptable pressure”, while the Danish foreign ministry said it was not involved in the planning.

Usha Vance's office said on Sunday that she would depart on Thursday for Greenland and return on Saturday.

She and one of the couple's three children had planned to visit historic sites and learn about Greenland's culture, but her husband's participation has reoriented the trip around national security, her office said.

The vice president said he did not want to let his wife “have all that fun by herself” and said he plans to visit the Space Force.

Mr Vance said that other countries have threatened Greenland as well as menacing the United States and Canada

Mr Vance said leaders in Denmark and North America had “ignored” Greenland for “far too long”.

During his first term, Mr Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world's largest island, even as Denmark insisted it was not for sale.

The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Mr Trump's plans.

Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of the Polar Research & Policy Initiative, said that the Trump administration's “intimidation” of Greenland could backfire.

Mr Menezes said if Trump was “smart enough” to understand Greenland's strategic importance, then he should also be “smart enough to know there is no greater way to weaken America's hand and hurt its long-term interests than turning its back on its allies, the principal asymmetrical advantage it enjoys over its adversaries”.

Mr Trump's return to the White House has included a desire for territorial expansion, as he seeks to add Canada as a 51st state and resume US control of the Panama Canal.

He has also indicated that US interests could take over the land in the war-torn Gaza Strip and convert it into a luxury outpost, displacing up to two million Palestinians.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Thousands of Palestinians have marched between the wreckage of a heavily destroyed town in northern Gaza in the second day of anti-war protests, with many chanting against Hamas in a rare display of public anger against the militant group.

The protests, which centred mainly on Gaza's north, appeared to be aimed generally against the war, with protesters calling for an end to 17 months of deadly fighting with Israel.

But the public calls against Hamas, which has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory months into the war with Israel, were rare.

In the town of Beit Lahiya, where a similar protest took place on Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated, with many chanting “the people want the fall of Hamas”.

In the hard-hit Shijaiyah neighbourhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted: “Out, out, out! Hamas get out!”

“Our children have been killed. Our houses have been destroyed,” said Abed Radwan, who said he joined the protest in Beit Lahiya “against the war, against Hamas, and the (Palestinian political) factions, against Israel and against the world's silence”.

Ammar Hassan, who took part in a protest on Tuesday, said it started as an anti-war protest with a few dozen people but swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.

“It's the only party we can affect,” he said. “Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but it can affect Hamas.”

The militant group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed its war.

Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said people have the right to protest but their focus should be on the “criminal aggressor”, Israel.

Family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's renewed offensive and its tightened blockade on all supplies into Gaza. Their statement said the community fully supports armed resistance against Israel.

“The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,” said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father of three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined a demonstration on Tuesday.

“We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,” he said.

A similar protest occurred in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to witnesses.

One protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they joined the demonstration because “everyone failed us”.

They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the western-backed Palestinian Authority and Arab mediators. They said there were no Hamas security forces at the protest but scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the group.

Later, they said they regretted participating because of Israeli media coverage, which emphasised the opposition to Hamas.

Israeli defense minister Israel Katz urged Palestinians to join the protests, saying: “You too should demand the removal of Hamas from Gaza and the immediate release of all Israeli hostages. That is the only way to stop the war.”

A 19-year-old Palestinian, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said he planned to join demonstrations on Wednesday.

“People are angry at the whole world,” including the United States, Israel and Hamas, he said. “We want Hamas to resolve this situation, return the hostages and end this whole thing.”

The protests erupted a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly two million Palestinians.

Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever were ravaging the country's southern regions, killing 24 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 residents to evacuate, officials said.

The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain wildfires in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas.

The aircraft had no other crew members.

The National Fire Agency said at least 26 other people sustained varying degrees of injuries.

An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 43,330 acres (17,535 hectares), the government's emergency response centre said.

In a televised address, South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were the worst so far.

“Damages are snowballing,” Mr Han said.

“There are concerns that we'll have wildfire damages that we've never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.”

Mr Han said crews were struggling to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight.

Mr Han said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday with the help of about 130 helicopters.

He said that “a small amount” of rain was expected on Thursday.

As of Wednesday evening, firefighters were fighting at least four active wildfires, including in the southeastern coastal town of Yeongdeok, which alerted residents of the nearest village to evacuate to an indoor gymnasium.

Strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in the southeastern city of Andong to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, which is home to the Hahoe folk village, a Unesco World Heritage Site founded around the 14th-15th century.

Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jirisan Mountain, one of the country's largest national parks, as another fire spread closer.

Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea in terms of land burned.

The largest fires were in Andong, the neighbouring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan.

On Tuesday, officials said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again.

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed nearly half of more than 30 structures at Gounsa, a temple which was said to be originally built in the seventh century.

Among the burned structures were two state-designated “treasures”, a pavilion-shaped building erected on a stream in 1668, and a Joseon Dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.

The another state-designated “treasure”, a stone Buddha statue reportedly manufactured in the eighth century, was moved to a safe place, according to government and Buddhist officials.

The Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention centre in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility.

The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest level nationwide, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.

The 18 dead include four firefighters and government workers who died in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials.

Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.

Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever have ravaged the country's southern regions, killing 24 people, destroying more than 300 structures and forcing 28,800 residents to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.  The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a blaze in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas.  The National Fire Agency said at least 26 people sustained varying degrees of injuries.

Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever were ravaging the country's southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.  A 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were among the structures destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 43,330 acres and injured 19 people, the government's emergency response center said.  In a televised address, South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were causing worse damage than many other past wildfires.

Wildfires in South Korea destroyed nearly half of more than 30 structures at an ancient temple. The wind-driven blazes ravaging the country's southern regions have killed 18 people, destroyed more than 200 structures and forced 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.

Government officials say they suspect that several of the recent wildfires were caused by human error.

France and Indonesia 's top diplomats on Wednesday signed an agreement for a maritime security project aiming “to ensure peace and safety” at sea in the Indo-Pacific region.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot's visit to Jakarta, his second stop in his four-day Asia tour after Singapore, comes amid ongoing trade tensions between the European Union and Beijing.

Antibodies taken from alpacas are to be used in a new pandemic flu drug, in a £33 million project led by AstraZeneca.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a number of conditions must be met before a Black Sea maritime security deal negotiated with the United States can be activated, pointing to an earlier agreement which it said saw Moscow's needs ignored.  The United States reached separate deals on Tuesday with Ukraine and Russia to cease fighting in the Black Sea and pause attacks against energy targets, with Washington agreeing to push to lift some sanctions against Moscow.  While Russian exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions, Moscow has said restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have amounted to a barrier to shipments.

            For Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other House Republicans, today's DOGE subcommittee hearing is about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding.
    


            For the broadcasters, today is about defending their existence – and maybe, just maybe, educating people about how public media actually works.
    


            What will win the day? National political noise or local media impact?
    


            The hearing, titled “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,” started at 10 a.m. ET. NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger are both testifying. So are a local station operator and a conservative critic of taxpayer-funded media.
    


            The hearing is meant to advance long-held Republican arguments against PBS and NPR.
    


            Taylor-Greene opened Wednesday's DOGE subcommittee by branding PBS and NPR “radical left-wing echo chambers” before accusing the public broadcasters of “grooming and sexualizing” children, using DEI for news standards and listener demographics, and wasting taxpayer dollars.
    


            “For too long, taxpayers have been asked to fund biased news. this needs to end, and it needs to end now,” Taylor-Greene said as in her opening remarks.
    


            President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the networks are a “waste of money” and claimed “he would love to” defund them. And yet the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this month included $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations.
    


            Congress budgets money for CPB two years in advance, so the recent bill means public broadcasting is funded through 2027.
    


            So on one level, today's hearing is a theatrical performance. But PBS and NPR leaders are taking it seriously. They have been preparing for the Republican interrogation for weeks. And they want to use the opportunity to justify the federal funding.
    


            Local TV and radio stations are doing the same. From North Country Public Radio in upstate New York, to New Mexico PBS in Albuquerque, to Hawaiʻi Public Radio in Honolulu, publicly supported stations are using the right's political attacks to galvanize grassroots support and raise money from donors.
    


            This is a “a critical moment for KQED,” an email from the SF radio station said yesterday. DOGE has “set its sights on public media,” an article from Rocky Mountain PBS explained. “Our future is in peril,” a letter from WBUR in Boston exclaimed.
    


            WBUR CEO Margaret Low wrote that the political threats – including the FCC chair's probe of PBS and NPR sponsorship practices – compound the “business model challenges that just about every news organization faces.” It's fundraising drive season, so her letter understandably urged supporters to donate.
    


            The letters and Q&As have had common themes: Explaining how taxpayer money trickles down to broadcasters and emphasizing the local benefits. Hawaiʻi Public Radio CEO Meredith Artley, the former editor in chief of CNN Digital, wrote that her news and classical music stations are “94% community supported,” with the remaining 6% coming from CPB.
    


            If the federal funds were diminished, the Hawaii stations would survive, but “there would likely be damage to the nationwide system that provides programming and infrastructure that HPR and many other stations rely on,” she wrote.
    


            That's the key point: It's a system. And smaller stations tend to need more help from the system. At KTOO Public Media in Alaska, for example, fully 30% of the budget comes from CPB. “This federal funding is essential in ensuring that Juneau's only local-owned newsroom can continue to deliver you the news from our community,” the station said.
    


            Stations large and small are highlighting their local responsibilities.
    


            “Whatever happens in Washington, DC—WQED is not going anywhere,” Jason Jedlinski, CEO of Pittsburgh's PBS station, wrote on LinkedIn. His post listed recent features (segments about a local farm, a reading club, and so on) that, quite frankly, few other media outlets would spend time on.
    


            At today's hearing, Republican lawmakers will bash national news controversies while the witnesses will pivot to the local impacts.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., calls for pulling money away from colleges that 'coddle' left-wing protesters who target Jewish Americans on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

FIRST ON FOX – Sen. Josh Hawley asked FBI Director Kash Patel Wednesday to look into alleged Biden-era abuses against Christians, urging Patel in a new letter to crack down on what the Missouri Republican described as First Amendment violations he said were carried out under the Biden administration.

In the letter, previewed exclusively by Fox News Digital, the Missouri Republican asked Patel to investigate alleged abuses against pro-life activists and Christians. He also urged Patel to release by April 30 information compiled by the FBI's Richmond, Virginia, field office – including a memo that labeled certain traditionalist Catholics as potential ""security risks"" – and to address possible violations of the FACE Act, which Hawley said targeted pro-life protesters.

""I trust that, under your leadership, this misconduct will end. But those responsible must be held accountable,"" Hawley said in the letter.

""Transparency and accountability will be paramount in restoring Americans' faith in the Bureau,"" he added. ""Getting to the bottom of the Biden Administration's violations of religious liberty is an excellent place to start.""

The letter from Hawley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, is not the first time he has used his post to urge Patel to protect against Christian persecution.

NATIONAL RELIGIOUS BROADCASTERS URGE FLORIDA LAWMAKERS TO KILL BILL TO AVOID ‘LAWFARE' AGAINST CHRISTIANS

Hawley's letter calls on the FBI to share with his office by the end of April a list of 22 memos and documents compiled by the FBI Richmond Field Office and related to the alleged FACE Act abuses, including all emails, memoranda, directives and policy guidance, sent to or from the FBI director, deputy director, or any other senior official regarding the enforcement of the FACE Act under the Biden Administration. 

Hawley also urged Patel to share all documents – including communications with state and local law enforcement agencies – that discuss how the Richmond Field Office memorandum or similar FBI policies were implemented or considered for enforcement at the state or local level.

Hawley zeroed in on these issues during Patel's confirmation hearing earlier this year.

""Do you think it's appropriate for the FBI to single out and target people of faith in order to discourage the exercise of their First Amendment rights?"" he asked Patel in January. 

Patel vowed in response that he would ""fully utilize, if confirmed, the investigative powers of the FBI to give you the information you require and also to hold those accountable who violated the sacred trust placed upon the FBI.""

Dollar Tree on Wednesday said it is selling Family Dollar for $1 billion to a pair of private equity firms, a decade after it bought the discount chain for more than $8 billion.

In a statement, Dollar Tree said private equity firms Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management will purchase Family Dollar, with the discount chain slated to remain headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia. 

Although both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar cater to low-income shoppers, Family Dollar locations struggled to gain traction, prompting the parent company last year to announce plans to shutter about 1,000 locations. Family Dollar also faces fierce competition from Walmart and other large retailers, while a rat-infested warehouse spurred a slew of negative headlines. 

Dollar Tree has said that many Family Dollar customers were extremely price-conscious, while the chain was also hurt by rising shoplifting incidents, hurting its bottom line. 

""Dollar Tree has struggled for over a decade to make the business work,"" said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, in an email. ""Its efforts have been hampered by supply-chain issues, poor store locations, a proposition that isn't value-centric enough and a host of other operational problems.""

He added, ""Basically, Dollar Tree bit off far more than it could chew.""

Dollar Tree had for months been exploring strategic options for Family Dollar, and it said Wednesday that the sale will allow it to focus on its core business.

""This is a major milestone in our multi-year transformation journey to help us fully achieve our potential,"" Dollar Tree CEO Mike Creedon said in a statement. 

In recent months, Dollar Tree has had little room to maneuver, particularly in the months leading up to the sale. Americans have been tightened their spending, even at bargain chains, as consumer confidence in the economy slides.

Shares of Dollar Tree rose $2.11, or 3.1%, to $69.25 in premarket trading.

President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. 

Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information. 

Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.

""While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,"" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed. 

Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.

The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.

Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.  

Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020. 

Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.

In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits. 

""The objective isn't to touch benefits,"" Bisignano told CNBC. ""The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,"" adding that he views himself as ""fundamentally a DOGE person.""

During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is ""five decimal places too high."" He added that he plans to ""focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down."" 

Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency. 

""My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,"" Bisignano said in response to questioning.

Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner. 

The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.

A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.

When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would ""lock DOGE out of databases"" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information ""will not be exposed.""

""I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,"" he said.

Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in ""tech bros and private equity folks"" to ""save"" it.

Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that ""my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.""

""I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,"" Mr. Bisignano said. 

Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.

Lunch Break: The Atlantic Has Receipts

Andrew Harnik|Getty Images

National security adviser Michael Waltz, left, Vice President JD Vance, center, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office on March 13.

There's an old saying somewhere: ‘Don't poke the bear if the bear has the receipts.'

And after the Trump administration spent much of yesterday insisting the contents of the Signal group chat inadvertently leaked to an editor at The Atlantic were not classified, the outlet dropped the receipts, releasing a full, minimally redacted version of the messages this morning.

The release came just hours before Trump cabinet officials like Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel began their testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Some Democrats have begun calling for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation over Signalgate, and the rest of Washington – including President Donald Trump, who has a light public schedule again today – will be watching with bated breath to see what happens next.

Here's the lunchtime lowdown, which U.S. News will be publishing each weekday to keep track of the goings-on in Washington and beyond:

The Atlantic published the full text thread from the infamous group chat that detailed U.S. military strikes carried out against the Houthis in Yemen. In the newly public texts, Hegseth can be seen sharing extraordinary details like “Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,” and “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based' targets).” Read more.

Several members of Trump's national security team are facing the House Intelligence Committee today, including Gabbard, Patel and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, where they are being grilled on that group chat. Gabbard admitted that accidentally adding the reporter was a “mistake” but maintained that no classified information was compromised. Read more.

District Judge James Boasberg, who has drawn the Trump administration's ire for his handling of a lawsuit over deportation flights, was assigned a lawsuit over Signalgate this morning filed by watchdog group American Oversight. The organization's suit against Hegseth, Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and others argues their use of Signal violated federal record-keeping laws, as some of the messages were reportedly set to auto-delete, among other violations. Read more.

Chief executives from NPR and PBS are defending their funding and pushing back against accusations of bias in a heated congressional hearing today. At it, NPR's CEO and President Katherine Maher admitted she regretted calling Trump a “racist” and “sociopath” on social media in 2020, while PBS chief Paula Kerger defended the outlet's handling of a presidential debate and other coverage. Meanwhile, the director of Voice of America – another federally funded media outlet – filed a lawsuit today over its intended shuttering. Read more.

Democrats in Pennsylvania won a special election in state House race to ensure they keep majority control of the chamber by a single representative, and appeared to flip a state Senate race in a deep red district.The latter result was cheered by high-profile Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are eager for wins amid a Republican trifecta at the federal level. Read more.

Salt Lake City has become a thriving metropolis with a booming population and plenty of job opportunities in banking and tech.

Many residents, like former Gov. Michael Leavitt, point to the 2002 Winter Olympics as the catalyst for the city's transformation.  

""A lot of good things came together at the right time. We had a growing population. Tech was becoming — it was in its infancy and was expanding. A startup culture was important,"" Leavitt said. ""We were in the position to be able to educate a lot of engineers at the right time, and then to be able to close that in the art, in the brand of the Olympics, that was a good combination.""

Salt Lake City is also a major draw for finance, with one of the highest concentrations of industrial banks in the U.S.; 15 of the nation's 23 industrial banks are located in the county.

The metro's snow economy sets it apart from other cities and will once again help boost Salt Lake City's profile on an international stage when it hosts the Winter Olympic Games in 2034. 

Yet some real challenges are ahead. Climate change and a lack of diversity, for example, could affect the city's future.

Oops, something went wrong

Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell more than 5% on Wednesday as a new report suggested Chinese environmental rules could impact the AI giant's sales in China. The decline came amid a broader sell-off in tech stocks on fears of an escalating trade war.

Nvidia shares sank after the Financial Times reported Chinese regulators are encouraging firms to use data center chips that meet strict environmental requirements. The guidelines exclude Nvidia's H20 chip, its processor compatible with US export controls for the Chinese market.

In response to the report, a Nvidia spokesperson said, ""Our products provide superb energy efficiency and value in every market we serve. As technology moves rapidly, export control policy should be adjusted to allow U.S. firms to offer the most energy efficient products possible, while still achieving the Administration's national security goals.""

The report comes amid escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing after the US imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods since President Donald Trump took office. Export curbs on advanced semiconductor technologies have also been a sore point between the two countries.

Also on Wednesday, TD Cowen analysts said Microsoft (MSFT) canceled new data center projects in the US and Europe, a move that heightened investor fears that Big Tech may pull back on artificial intelligence spending.

However, the analysts said, ""Positively for third-party data center operators, our checks point to Google (GOOG) stepping into backfill capacity that Microsoft walked away from in international markets, while our checks point to Meta (META) backfilling capacity in the U.S.""

The analysis follows a note from TD Cowen in February stating Microsoft recently canceled an unspecified number of data center leases.

Nvidia led the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks lower on Wednesday, cutting short a recent rebound in the sector after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory earlier this month.

Tech stocks have led a broader market sell-off this year as investors weigh the impact of the Trump administration's tariff policy on the economy.

Read more: How does Nvidia make money?

Fears of an overvaluation in the AI trade sent Nvidia tumbling in late January after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a chatbot, reportedly with fewer resources than its US rivals.

Renewed fears of an overextended AI trade surfaced earlier this month after chipmaker Marvell Technology's (MRVL) revenue outlook failed to impress investors, and semiconductor stocks fell.

Year to date, Nvidia is down roughly 15%.

Oops, something went wrong

Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter Tuesday to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urging him to explain how the Trump administration plans to prevent companies from using tariffs as a cover to hike prices.

""Tariffs can be a strategic tool to grow American industry and good manufacturing jobs, but President Trump's across-the-board tariffs have been chaotic, not strategic,"" the Democratic lawmaker wrote in the letter reviewed by Yahoo Finance.

""I am deeply concerned that President Trump is now enabling this corporate greed, allowing companies to increase prices across the board, regardless of whether goods are actually subject to tariffs.""

Warren said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised this possibility during a press conference last Wednesday when he said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about whether the price changes would be ""transitory.""

Powell offered the example of washing machines that were hit with duties during Trump's first term. He noted that as prices on washing machines went up, so did prices on dryers, which had no new tariffs attached.

""Manufacturers just kind of followed the crowd and raised it. So, things happen very indirectly,"" Powell said.

The comments came after the Fed held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new ""reciprocal"" tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

""The reversal of progress on inflation is troubling,"" Warren said in her letter to Lutnick. ""I urge you to explain how you will prevent companies from using tariffs as cover to hike prices as Chair Powell has just warned,"" she added.

Top administration officials have argued that the tariffs will not be inflationary or would, at the most, be a one-time adjustment.

In a speech earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged the Fed to look at any tariff-related price hikes that way — while also digging the Fed for its handling of pandemic-era inflation it expected to be transitory but didn't turn out that way.

""I would hope that the failed 'team transitory' could get back together and think that nothing is more transitory than tariffs,"" Bessent said at the Economic Club of New York on March 6.

Last week on the ""All In"" podcast, Lutnick noted that ""inflation doesn't come from tariffs."" Instead, he added, it comes from ""printing more money.""

Warren in her Tuesday letter to Lutnick also posed a series of questions about the coming tariffs, asking if the Commerce Department had analyzed the impact to date that tariffs and tariff threats have had on prices and whether they are allowing corporations to pass unjustified price increases on to consumers.

Warren also asked what specific actions the president has taken with regard to tariffs that would limit companies' ability to pass on the costs of tariffs or impose other broad price increases on consumers.

""I have repeatedly called on [the president] to protect consumers from corporate price-gouging associated with tariffs,"" Warren said.

""Instead, he has made matters worse, simultaneously threatening to implement, implementing, and backing off of threats to implement his tariffs, disincentivizing the investments in American manufacturing that the tariffs are supposed to accelerate, while creating widespread confusion and uncertainty that may give big corporations cover to increase their prices on all goods.""

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Can a moonshot company escape its leader's political baggage? What if the company's success is in part bound up in that polarizing activity? Elon Musk is back in reassurance mode, professing his overarching vision and long-term goals for his car company that have little to do with car sales.

Tesla stock (TSLA) is up 25% over the past week, with the biggest boost coming after an all-hands meeting at the company that conveyed the sense that Musk is ""back in the building,"" with the CEO issuing a sermon to reassure his shareholding faithful.

Fast-tracking a private transportation transformation is at the heart of Musk's plans for Tesla. But dreams of a fleet of millions of robotaxis and thousands of humanoid robots are becoming much harder to sell when Musk is busy slashing through Washington instead of shepherding a volatile brand.

Gutting a social media company and remaking it in your own image doesn't have the same consequences as messing with the American social safety net. Trying to do to the federal government what Musk did to Twitter ended up tarnishing Tesla. Or, as Dan Ives, a prominent Tesla bull, put it, created “a brand tornado crisis moment.""

But hints of a comeback are already gathering. The company's most outspoken backers see Musk placing his DOGE duties in better balance with his corporate responsibilities. And a resurgence of retail investor interest piercing through the doldrums highlights a defining trait of the ticker: convincing people that big things are coming.

As Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote earlier this month in a note to clients, Tesla is a “faith-based” stock. While all equities generally move up and down according to people's belief in them, Tesla represents a pure example of faith investing because so much of its implied value is tied up in future endeavors. In Tesla's case, that means future earnings from robotaxis, not present and near-term earnings from cratering EV sales in the US, Europe, and now China.

Looking at the stock through that lens helps explain why flagging sales in its third-largest market barely register on the stock chart. This week's rally also coincided with some good news on tariffs, lifting the ""Magnificent Seven."" But Tesla's rise was particularly pronounced and continued Tuesday.

To say that investors aren't paying attention to Tesla's fundamentals isn't quite right, either. What Tesla bulls and more sympathetic observers are arguing is that its “fundamentals” are bound up in tomorrow's breakthroughs.

Take Cathie Wood, who told our colleagues why Tesla stock would be worth $2,600 — essentially adding a zero to the current level — within five years. That thesis is entirely underpinned by robotaxis, which Wood says will make up 90% of the company's value. If she's right, who cares about European sales?

It's easy to see how this kind of “faith-based” investing comes dangerously close to blind trust. For many, it truly is as simple as ""Musk, take the wheel."" And what critics view as a gimmick, the faithful instead grasp as Musk's track record of innovation. When the line goes up, it's hard to tell the difference. And maybe there isn't one.

Oops, something went wrong

A bankruptcy filing by personalized genomics firm 23andMe (ME) calls into question what happens to its most valuable asset: genetic data from 15 million customers.

""I think the law on that is pretty unclear at this point,"" said Jonathan Lipson, a bankruptcy law professor at Temple University's Beasley School of Law.

The murky legal ground sets up an uncertain future for 23andMe and its customers, especially those who want their DNA and other information obliterated from the records of a biotech company that once dazzled Silicon Valley.

The company built a following by asking customers to mail in their biological information through ""cheek swabs."" In exchange for a fee, customers received gene-based health indicators, ancestral histories, and subscription services that provided them with control over their data.

But under bankruptcy protection, a ""stay"" halts enforcement of all contractual obligations against the company. And its assets — potentially including customer biometric data — become the property of a bankruptcy estate that is legally protected from creditors.

Lipson expects 23andMe's managers to argue that certain customer data is not theirs to delete because the data belongs to the estate.

The managers, he said, are legally obligated to maximize the value of the remaining assets, which would involve retaining the data.

""While I don't know exactly what the legal characterization of this data is,"" Lipson said, ""I'm sure they're thinking about it.""

23andMe sent an email to customers assuring them that their data would remain protected during the bankruptcy.

""The Chapter 11 filing does not change how we store, manage, or protect customer data,"" the email said. Any buyer of the company, it added, would be required to comply with applicable law with respect to the treatment of customer data.

23andMe's instructions for account deletion can be found here.

Roughly 20 states, including California, Colorado, New Jersey, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Utah, and Connecticut, have adopted protections applying to biometric data, and most give consumers a right to delete their information.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta has warned 23andMe's California customers that they are legally entitled to scrub their genetic data from the company's systems, including their DNA, identity, and biological samples — the saliva test samples submitted to the company.

""Due to the trove of sensitive consumer data 23andMe has amassed ... Californians who want to invoke these rights can do so by going to 23andMe's website,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement that outlines the steps consumers can take.

""Given 23andMe's reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,"" Bonta said.

Daniel Gielchinsky, a partner and co-founder of DGIM Law, said the unfortunate reality is that the ""more customers who go and scrub their data ... the less value this entity has as a going concern,"" noting that the company's value resides in its data.

The stock of 23andMe fell more than 11% Tuesday after dropping 59% on Monday.

The company's bankruptcy petition seeks court authorization to pursue a structured sale of its assets through an auction. The filing reported $277 million in assets as of the end of 2024 and debts of $215 million.

The 23andMe board has rejected a nonbinding acquisition offer from co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki, who stepped down on Friday. Wojcicki has been trying to take the company private since April.

Even if 23andMe's managers were to push the bankruptcy court to free it from its consumer agreements, the company would still need to abide by state laws. And customers in states that have adopted biometric data privacy laws are in the best position to control their data, said Ryan Sulkin, a data protection attorney at Benesch.

However, Lipson cautioned that there's some uncertainty about how the bankruptcy court would apply its federal authority to administer the sale of the estate.

A major factor likely to influence the fate of customers' data is whether the US Justice Department or the US Federal Trade Commission takes an interest in the bankruptcy proceedings.

""I would expect the Federal Trade Commission to have a voice at the table here,"" Sulkin said.

And Sulkin suspects that only certain buyers would satisfy US national security interests in a transition of 23andMe's troves of personal genetic data.

""Does this entity need to be solely owned by US interests?"" he asked. If so, he said, ""then you start getting into a TikTok scenario,"" referring to a law passed last year by Congress banning the social media app unless it finds a buyer for its US operations.

One hope for customers worried about the safety of their data is that bankruptcy courts are accustomed to protecting individual healthcare records in proceedings involving hospitals or doctors' practices. Typically, courts appoint a healthcare ombudsman to ensure patients continue to receive ongoing care.

But 23andMe falls into a gray area because its customers are not technically patients, and protecting healthcare information is tangential to the ombudsman role.

""So it's not quite a perfect fit for this situation,"" Gielchinsky said. ""It's going to be an ongoing conversation between the creditors, the debtor, and the court about how best to protect customer data while still allowing there to be a competitive auction process.""

23andMe's consumer notice says that in the event of a sale, customer data would ""remain protected under the current 23andMe Privacy Policy, unless and until they are presented with materially new terms."" Notice of such a change, it says, would be made ""as required by law.""

Oops, something went wrong

GameStop (GME) stock rose nearly 15% on Wednesday as the company approved a plan to buy bitcoin (BTC-USD) with its cash holdings.

The video game operator turned popular meme stock said in a release on Tuesday that its board ""has unanimously approved an update to its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.""

The announcement comes about a month after CNBC reported GameStop was exploring cryptocurrency investments. On Feb. 8, a social media post from GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen sparked speculation over GameStop's interest in cryptocurrency. Cohen posted a picture on X with Strategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who has famously hitched his company to bitcoin. It now holds more than 447,000 tokens, per a February filing.

The strategy has worked out well for Saylor's company, with the stock up over 84% in the past year amid a rise in the price of bitcoin. But Wall Street strategists are hesitant to conclude that GameStop investing in bitcoin would mean the video game retailer's stock has upside.

""The company's strategy, which has changed about six times in three years, is they're going to buy cryptocurrency and be just like MicroStrategy,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance on Monday ahead of the earnings release. 

He added, ""The problem with that thinking is MicroStrategy trades at about two times their bitcoin holdings. If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their $4.6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings,] the stock would drop five bucks.""

Also after the bell on Tuesday, GameStop reported fourth quarter earnings results. The company posted $1.28 billion in net sales for the quarter, marking a 28% decline from the year-earlier period. For the full year, GameStop reported an adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million, down from $64.7 million seen the year prior.

	The gene-edited organ was hooked up inside the body of a brain-dead recipient 

This genetically modified miniature pig served as a liver donor for a brain-dead human recipient.

K-S Tao et al./Nature 2025

By Meghan Rosen

57 minutes ago

Surgeons have now published the first report of a gene-edited pig liver transplanted into a person.

The liver, which came from a genetically modified pig, appeared to stay active, producing bile and liver proteins inside the brain-dead transplant recipient, researchers report March 26 in Nature.

Such a transplant could one day buy time for people waiting on the liver transplant list. Doctors could potentially use the pig liver as bridge until a human liver is available or the patient's liver has recovered, Lin Wang, a surgeon at Xijing hospital in Xi-an, China, said in a March 25 news briefing. “It is our dream to achieve this,” he said. Earlier this year his team also performed a different pig-to-human liver transplant, though the results from that surgery have not yet been published. 

The feats are the latest in a string of advances in xenotransplantation, the transfer of living organs or tissues from one species into another. Doctors have already seen success with pig kidneys and hearts. One woman, a 53-year-old from Alabama, received a gene-edited kidney in November and is still doing well more than 100 days after her surgery. And in February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave two companies the green light to begin clinical trials with gene-edited pig kidneys in people with kidney failure. 

But pig liver transplants pose a particular challenge, Wang said: “The liver is so complicated.” Unlike the heart, which pumps blood, and the kidneys, which produce urine, the liver is somewhat of an overachiever. The lobed organ juggles many jobs, including detoxifying the blood, making bile to help with digestion, weeding out old red blood cells, storing energy and producing molecules that help the blood clot. 

Getting a pig organ to successfully take over all those roles will be really difficult, says Adam Griesemer, a liver transplant surgeon at NYU Langone Health. The functions that the liver performs are so vital to our bodies, he says. If there's even a tiny mismatch between how pig and human organs work, “I think we're going to have problems.”

But there's certainly a need for new solutions for liver-failure patients, Griesemer says. In the United States, around 10,000 people are on the national transplant list waiting for a liver. And unlike dialysis for patients waiting for kidneys, there's no long-term way to keep liver-failure patients alive. Liver dialysis exists, but it's only a temporary solution, says Parsia Vagefi, a transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “People still die waiting for a liver transplant,” he says. 

In 2023, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania tried using a gene-edited pig liver as a kind of backup device, hooking up the organ externally to a person who had recently died. The team was able to circulate the person's blood through the pig liver, a step toward using the organ to temporarily take on the liver's duties in patients with liver failure. In the new case, surgeons brought the liver inside the body. The team started with a Bama miniature pig that had some pig genes knocked out and some human genes pasted in. These genes play a role in transplant rejection; the goal of the edits was to lessen the chance the transplant would fail.

Surgeons placed the modified liver inside the recipient's body, connected it to their blood vessels, and then monitored it for 10 days. The pig liver retained its functions, blood flowed smoothly, and Wang's team did not see inflammatory cells accumulate, a sign that the human recipient was tolerating the transplant. After the experiment, the recipient's body was returned to family.

Vagefi points out that the surgery was not a typical transplant. The team didn't replace the person's liver, as would usually occur in a liver transplant. Instead, the pig liver was auxiliary, existing inside the body alongside the original liver. More recently, Wang's team has performed a full pig-to-human liver transplant, swapping out the liver of a different brain-dead person with one from a genetically modified pig. That transplant took place in January, and the researchers plan to report the results of the investigation in a future publication, Wang said at the briefing. 

Still, Griesemer suspects “that the pig liver is not going to be a long-term solution for patients with liver disease.” Previous work in primates has showcased problems with pig liver transplants, he says. The animals that receive the livers don't tend to live that long.

It's also too early to say whether an auxiliary pig organ, like the one reported in the study, could help patients by serving as a bridge for people on the transplant waiting list, Vagefi says. But, he notes, work like this is important because there's a lot left to be learned. “This is a starting point.”

	When handled, a small crustacean-munching shark from New Zealand clacked its teeth together

This small shark, called a rig or smoothhound, could be the first shark documented to make deliberate sounds.

Sharks may not be the sharp-toothed silent type after all.

The clicking of flattened teeth, discovered by accident, could be “the first documented case of deliberate sound production in sharks,” evolutionary biologist Carolin Nieder, of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and colleagues propose March 26 in Royal Society Open Science.

Humankind has been slow in picking up on sound communication among fishes, and many of their squeaks and rumbles have come to the attention of science in captive animals. For the many bony fishes, it's no longer a surprise to detect various chirps, hums or growls. Yet the evolutionary sister-branch, sharks and rays, built with cartilage, have been slower to get recognized for sounding off. They have remarkable senses, such as detecting slight electric fields. In 1971, however, clicking was reported among cownose rays, and has since turned up in other rays.

Nieder, who had studied dolphin hearing, was at the University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Lab in New Zealand, dangling an underwater microphone into a tank as part of her setup to explore hearing in a small shark species called a rig (Mustelus leucticulates). Reaching into the tank to grasp one, she heard “click…click….” After a week or so of tests, the rig still squirmed but didn't click. Perhaps the sound was voluntary, a response to stress, she mused.

She worked with 10 sharks and recorded multiple clickity bouts, averaging about nine clicks during a 20-second grasp. The sounds may come from clacking together the flattened teeth with cusps, great for cracking crustaceans shells. Rows of these teeth emerge from gum tissue, reminding her of stones set in a mosaic.

In a first, researchers have recorded what could be a shark making deliberate sounds. A small shark from New Zealand, called a rig or spotted estuary smoothhound, grows rows of flattened teeth (image below) that can crack crustaceans for food and, perhaps, make communicative sounds. Evolutionary biologist Carolin Nieder discovered the sounds accidentally when she was handling a rig in a tank. Listen closely as the shark first splashes, then clicks its teeth.

Wiggling doesn't seem important: She heard the sounds when a test shark writhed in her grasp and when it held still. She suggests that sharks click by “forceful snapping.”

The idea still needs formal testing, she cautions. What she actually measured was the hearing range of the sharks, which is restricted to below 1,000 hertz. Human hearing, in comparison, ranges up to 20,000 Hz.

Sharks are sensitive to their watery world though and can detect the tickles of changing electric fields. Yet “if you were a shark, I would need to talk a lot louder to you than to a goldfish,” she says. “The goldfish would pick up if I whisper … and the shark was like, can you speak up please?”

	“We have still not figured out policies that are protective for people”

Millions of people have used DNA testing kits from 23andMe to trace family ties and to learn more about health conditions they may be susceptible to. The company filed for bankruptcy leaving customers wondering what to do about genetic data.

2 hours ago

A genetic data giant is falling, and it's unclear what will happen to millions of people's most intimate personal information in the aftermath.

On March 23, DNA testing company 23andMe announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a move intended to facilitate its sale — along with the genetic data of over 15 million customers worldwide. A bankruptcy court hearing is set to begin March 26.

The San Francisco–based company has been reeling since a 2023 data breach exposed ancestry information — and, in some cases, health data — of about 7 million users. Bankruptcy documents made public by 404 Media show that more than 50 class-action lawsuits followed.

The situation reignites long-standing concerns about genetic privacy. The 2018 arrest of the Golden State Killer, identified through a public ancestry database, first raised alarms about the safety of genetic data. With a patchwork of state-level legislation and no clear federal oversight beyond a rule prohibiting genetic discrimination by employers and health insurance companies — but not life insurance or other entities — genetic testing companies have been free to create their own rules, says sociologist of science Alondra Nelson of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.

“We have gotten 20 years into this industry, and we are about to have a major exchange of 15 million sets of people's data, and we have still not figured out policies that are protective for people,” Nelson says.

23andMe has assured customers that bankruptcy “does not change how we store, manage, or protect customer data.” Any future buyer, the company says, will adhere to those data standards. But California Attorney General Rob Bonta has urged Californians to instruct 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any biological samples stored at the company. Other attorney generals across the country are echoing that call and making residents aware of their rights.

The stakes go beyond privacy. Genetic researchers have used 23andMe data in studies of human ancestry and disease causation. If customers scrub their data, this cache of genetic information could be lost. Moreover, the company collects approximately 2 million survey responses a week about lifestyle, health and traits, legal health privacy scholar Anya Prince of the University of Iowa and bioethicist Kayte Spector-Bagdady of the University of Michigan wrote in the Feb. 25 JAMA. These data, they note, could drive a range of applications from pharmaceutical research to targeted marketing campaigns.

To unpack what's at stake, Science News spoke with Nelson, a former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Prince, who studies the ethical, legal and social implications of genetic testing. The conversations have been edited for length and clarity.

SN: Why is 23andMe declaring bankruptcy such a big deal?

Prince: It's such a big deal because, if you think about why 23andMe was valued as high as $6 billion, it's because of the promise of the monetary value of the data that they hold. If John Deere went into bankruptcy, it would be selling the tractor parts, selling the factories. That is easier than having the asset be millions of people's data, and not just millions of people's data, but millions of people's very sensitive genetic and health data.

Nelson: By 23andMe's own accounting, 15 million customers counted on them to stay in business and to be able to keep their data safe. Part of the service that 23andMe provided was saying that they could tell people things about themselves and their families, intimate details to which they might not otherwise have access. You expect a company or relationship that's going to claim to tell you such things about yourself to stick around.

We didn't exactly know what to do when the data breach occurred, and it's not quite clear what's going to happen with the data vis-à-vis the bankruptcy. We've had a legislative and policy failure around what to do about direct-to-consumer genetic testing. What we know about genetic testing is that it can be used for forensic applications, it can be used for health care applications. The laws that we have around privacy and protection of health care data like HIPAA or the regulations and norms that we have around forensic data don't apply to consumer genetic testing.

There were a lot of companies that started doing similar tests that went out of business or got acquired by other companies. So there has been a pattern in the industry in which we don't know exactly what was happening with these data as the companies get acquired or as they're traded.

SN: Should people delete their data from 23andMe, or should they keep it so researchers can use it?

Prince: I, for example, am a very, very private person, and so if my data was in a company like 23andMe, I would want to delete it because I'm less comfortable with sharing my data and I'm more controlled about it. I know plenty of other people who are just as rational actors who say, “No, I would love my data to be used for research.”

It makes sense for some people to say, “I understand the risks. I understand that I can't control who buys my data and how it's used because of gaps in our federal privacy laws.” If somebody is OK with that, then maybe they don't need to delete it.

But if people say, “No, I'm worried about accessing insurance. I'm worried about just having my data out there. I'm worried how law enforcement could gain access to it,” — whatever it is that people could be tangibly concerned about — or just wanting their data to be private and know who it's being shared with, then I think deleting the data is a good step. There are other ways to provide data to help research that might align more with people's goals or comfort level.

Nelson: We have to open up a broad aperture of things that we can do — and we need to do it quickly — to help people secure their data. If they want to use it for research, great.

The bigger problem is how do you know that your data has been deleted? Is it deleted from everything? Are there collaborations ongoing with other partners, where the data might get circulated into laboratories, research labs and other places? So, sure, ask for the data to be deleted, but I think we also want to have a forensic accounting of the data.

This is not just somebody's Facebook profile. If you want to delete it, you want to be sure that it's deleted. How can we create a protocol or a norm, or really call upon 23andMe to act nobly and provide assurances to people that the data is actually deleted out of every database, every hard drive, every collaborator's research computer?

SN: What worries you most about 23andMe being sold to another entity?

Prince: This whole thing just highlights how little people know about how their data can be shared.

[For instance, 23andMe's] privacy policy says in the event of bankruptcy, the genetic data can be sold. It says that the new company would have to comply with the existing privacy policy. But the existing privacy policy also says that it can be changed at any time.

It just really leaves consumers with little recourse. The one power that we do have is deleting the data. The challenge of that is that it is a rich resource for research, so that's a shame.

Nelson: I worry about the 15 million customers, many of whom, if they're not following the news, may not know that this is happening. They might not have known about the breach in 2023.

I worry in particular about marginalized and vulnerable communities that have histories of repression and oppression [based on] ideas about genetics, and what that means for communities of African descent and communities of Jewish descent.

In 2019, the Department of Defense wrote to all of its employees, particularly those that worked in sensitive areas, and said, “You know what? We're going to suggest that you not get for Christmas or for Hanukkah these direct-to-consumer genetic tests, because we are worried about the ability of this information to leak, and we're worried about the ability of this information to be used by malign foreign actors.” It's dangerous to have people's personal data circulating in the world.

One would not be foolish to be skeptical of 23andMe offering assurances that they're going to abide by whatever rules they have. The company is under distress and is seeking to be sold. What are the trade-offs that are going to be made in the negotiation for this sale? Will data privacy of 15 million people be one of those trade-offs?

	Context may lead people to misread canine emotions, a small study suggests

Human perception of canine emotions is strongly influenced by the overall context, not just body language such as wagging tails or licking lips, a study shows. The finding suggests that people may misinterpret how a dog is feeling.

Many dog owners can tell how their precious pooch is feeling, watching it wag its tail or raise its ears — at least, they think they can.

But people's perception of canine emotions may be strongly influenced by environmental context around the dog, researchers report March 10 in Anthrozoös.

Animal welfare scientist Holly Molinaro filmed her father interacting with his dog, Oliver, a 14-year-old pointer-beagle mix, in a variety of situations. She filmed the dog in positive ones, such as being played with or praised, and negative ones, such as being around a cat or reprimanded.

Her team then showed edited and unedited footage to 400 college students and asked them questions about how they thought the dog felt.

In the edited footage, the dog appeared on a black background; all environmental context had been removed. On average, participants “couldn't tell the difference between whether the dog was happy or sad,” says Molinaro, of Arizona State University in Tempe. Only after they watched unedited footage could participants correctly rate the dog's emotional state.

In a second experiment, the researchers showed another 513 participants edited footage of the dog reacting to a positive situation in a negative context and vice versa, then asked them questions about the dog's emotional state. For example, Molinaro edited a video so that it looked like Oliver was reacting to a toy (positive situation), while instead he was reacting to a vacuum cleaner (negative situation).

One of these scenarios is real and one is not. Can you guess which one is authentic? The answer is at the end of this paragraph. But first, animal welfare scientist Holly Molinaro devised an experiment to test how context, not just body language, can influence how we interpret a dog's mood. She filmed her father's pointer-beagle mix Oliver in a number of scenarios, then edited the footage so that the same clip of the dog's reaction appears in both a positive and negative context. These videos show Oliver seeing a toy (positive) and a vacuum cleaner (negative). Did you guess right? The vacuum cleaner is real; the toy is not.

On average, “no matter what the dog was doing, if it was a positive situation, they rated the dog as happy, and if it was a negative situation, they rated the dog as sad,” Molinaro says. That suggests that, at least in this experiment, the participants tended to base their interpretations on the environment around the dog,

Dog cognition researcher Zsófia Virányi says that while she agrees context plays an important role in how people read canine emotions, it's hard to draw universal conclusions from only one dog.

“Basically, the conclusions that they can form here is not that much about how humans read dog behavior in general, but how humans can read the behavior of this dog in these situations,” says Virányi, of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna. Oliver and other dogs with floppy ears, she adds, are much more difficult to read compared with dogs with pointier, more mobile ears.

Still the study raises something to be aware of when trying to interpret a dog's mood, Molinaro says. Try to rely less on context and more on your furry friend's body language.

In honor of April Fools' Day, I offer the puzzling case of the Lesser Fool.

In a fictional town, there lived an odd wanderer. People would present him with two amounts of money or goods and ask which is greater. Even though they offered to give him whichever amount he chose, the Fool would always select the smaller one.

People came from afar just to test him. Whatever the currency, whatever the quantities, whatever convoluted form the question took, he picked the amount worth less — and then strolled away cheerfully.

The following are some of the questions the Lesser Fool was asked. Can you get them right?

BONUS: One day, a child approached the Fool. “To answer so reliably, you must know which amount is larger. So why do you always take the smaller?” the child asked. “And if you're called the Lesser Fool, who's the Greater Fool?” The Fool only smiled. Can you answer the child's questions?

	The marker is an unexpected bubble that could signal cosmic reionization earlier than thought

The extremely distant galaxy JADES-GS-z13-1 is the small red dot in the center of this image from the James Webb Space Telescope. New observations show the galaxy is emitting a surprising amount of ultraviolet light, indicating it is radically reshaping the cosmic landscape around it.

The James Webb Space Telescope has caught a distant galaxy blowing an unexpected bubble in the gas around it, just 330 million years after the Big Bang.

The galaxy, dubbed JADES-GS-z13-1, marks the earliest sign yet spotted of the era of cosmic reionization, a transformative period in the universe's history when the first stars and galaxies began to reshape their environment, astronomers report in the March 27 Nature.

“It definitely puts a pin in the map of the first point where [reionization] very likely has already started,” says astrophysicist Joris Witstok at the University of Copenhagen. “No one had predicted that it would be this early” in the universe's history.

For millions of years before JADES-GS-z13-1 and others like it began to shine, the universe was filled with cold, neutral gas, mostly hydrogen and helium. This gas absorbed short-wavelength light from any stars that shone before about 200 million years after the Big Bang. But as more and more stars began to burn and gather into galaxies, they produced enough ultraviolet light to knock electrons off the neutral gas atoms, ionizing them and making the gas transparent to short-wavelength light.

One clear signal of this ionization comes in a particular UV wavelength of light called Lyman-α, which is produced by excited hydrogen atoms returning to their lowest energy states. Seeing Lyman-α photons emanating from a galaxy means the galaxy must have blown a bubble of ionized gas around it big enough to let the particles of light reach our telescopes today.

“You can think of galaxies as little Lyman-α flashlights,” says astrophysicist Steven Finkelstein of the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the new study. “If you can see the Lyman-α, it means they're sitting in an ionized part of the universe.” If you can't see Lyman-α, the galaxies are shrouded in neutral hydrogen fog.

Previous observations showed that the universe was completely ionized about one billion years after the Big Bang. But it's hard to tell when the process began, or what exactly produced the light.

Witstok and colleagues used JWST to observe JADES-GS-z13-1, one of the clearest of these early galaxies, for almost 19 hours, splitting its light into a spectrum of wavelengths to seek details of the galaxy's makeup.

JWST was designed to seek out these brilliant, ancient galaxies. As the universe expands, the ultraviolet light that these galaxies originally emitted gets stretched to longer, infrared wavelengths. Since starting operations in 2022, JWST's sensitive infrared detectors have turned up a growing gaggle of galaxies whose light comes from as early as less than 300 million years after the Big Bang.

To their surprise, the researchers found a clear, bright signal of Lyman-α photons coming from JADES-GS-z13-1. If you were standing next to the galaxy, this light alone would shine as bright as 10 billion suns.

“We suddenly saw this huge, booming emission line” that makes all the other distant galaxies JWST has found “look a bit boring,” Witstock says. “Just the pure strength of it tells us whatever this source is has to be really, really powerful and unlike anything we've seen before.”

The finding is “both surprising and exciting,” says cosmologist Michele Trenti of the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the study and wrote a perspective article that accompanied the paper in Nature. “I would not have expected the ultraviolet light that is emitted from this galaxy as Lyman-α to be able to reach the JWST,” she says. “This suggests that early forming galaxies are more efficient than previously thought at reheating the universe.”

It's still not clear exactly what the light's source is. The light could come from matter that was heated as it fell onto a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center. The galaxy's compact size supports this idea — it looks like it's only about 230 light-years across, compared with 32,000 light-years for the Milky Way.

The light could also have come from extremely hot, massive stars, about 100 to 300 times the mass of the sun and more than 15 times hotter. More observations are required to figure out which it is, but either one has implications for the conditions in the early universe.

“Both possibilities are stimulating for innovation,” Trenti says. “I expect theorists will be on the drawing board, developing new models for galaxy and black hole evolution during the dawn of the universe, while observers will certainly try to discover additional similar galaxies to solve the puzzle.”

“I just cannot believe how I don't crave alcohol anymore!” writes one person. Others declare: “Took my first shot… have not had a drink or cigarette since,” and “I love coffee but I've noticed that I cannot finish a cup anymore.”

These quotes were all collected in a recent study led by Davide Arillotta at the University of Florence, Italy, from Reddit's weight-loss forums. Here, you will find many people rhapsodising about the benefits of drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. That these treatments are helping people curb their eating should be no surprise: that is exactly what they are meant to do, by mimicking the satiety hormone GLP-1 (see “How they work”, below).

Among the comments, however, you will frequently find reports of other – wholly unexpected – behavioural changes. According to these accounts, when taking these drugs, the urge to drink alcohol, smoke and even shop compulsively plummets (but not libido, though anecdotal reports on this subject elsewhere online are mixed). Such tales are becoming familiar to prescribing physicians.

If this anecdotal data can be supported by controlled clinical trials, it may tell us a lot about how the brain processes anticipation and reward – and could also suggest whole new ways of dealing with addiction. By targeting areas of the brain responsible for reward signals from food, GLP-1 drugs might also reduce the rewards people get from other things, such as addictive substances. But what does the current evidence show about these complex behavioural processes?

First, we need to understand how drugs…

There are many claims about the benefits of microdosing weight-loss drugs, from anti-inflammatory effects to extending longevity. Do any of them stack up?

Madison Burgess decided to get serious about weight loss when the scale hit 91 kilograms (200 pounds). She began taking Ozempic. The medication worked better than she ever thought possible: even on the low starter dose, she lost more than 2 kg (5 lbs) within the first week.

Problems began, however, when Burgess, a 25-year-old healthcare administrator from Bloomfield, Michigan, ramped up her intake, as per the manufacturer's guidelines. “The higher doses were rough on me,” she says. The constipation, nausea, diarrhoea and acid reflux hit hard and made eating difficult. That's when she decided to drop back down to a lower dose and determine whether she could continue seeing benefits.

Burgess is just one of a growing number of people who are “microdosing” – a practice more typically associated with psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin – by taking lower-than-standard amounts of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro (see “How they work”, below).

For some, the hope is to avoid side effects while losing weight, while others want to tap into the anti-inflammatory effect of these medications or reap their other benefits for the heart and the brain (see “A wonder drug”?, below). Microdosing the drugs has even been touted for extending longevity by ultra-wealthy elites like tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, and is rumoured to be the secret weapon of Hollywood stars wanting to look svelte for photo calls.

The question is, does this off-label, low-dose experimentation work?

GLP-1 drugs have revolutionised the treatment of obesity, but the very reason they are effective is also why it's vital to prioritise exercise when taking them

By Grace Wade


                                    26 March 2025

For decades, conventional wisdom held that, to lose weight, you must eat less and move more. Of course, that is easier said than done, which is why drugs like Wegovy are so revolutionary. By suppressing appetite, they help tackle the first part of that equation, typically leading to dramatic weight loss. But what about the second? Do we still need to hit the gym if weight-loss drugs are causing the number on the scales to drop? And what impact do these drugs have on our ability to exercise?

What is becoming clear is that exercise may be even more crucial for people who are on these medications than it is for those who aren't. The ability of semaglutide to induce rapid weight loss (see “How they work”, below) also leads to notable declines in muscle mass. For instance, a 2021 study of 95 people who were overweight or had obesity and were taking semaglutide found that lean body mass decreased by almost 10 per cent, on average, after 68 weeks.

Lean body mass encompasses body tissues like muscle and bone. So, these results suggest that both deteriorate when taking weight-loss drugs, says Signe Sørensen Torekov at the University of Copenhagen. Because these drugs lead people to consume fewer calories, the body must break down fat, muscle and even bone for nutrients.

“Our understanding is that up to about 40 per cent of the overall weight loss that is seen from semaglutide is thought to be potentially from the loss of muscle mass,” says …

Invasive Plants Are Not the Enemy

Botanist Mason Heberling challenges how we think about invasive species and our role in their spread.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Naeem Amarsy & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

What do you think of when you hear the words “invasive plant?” According to some botanists, our mindset around invasives can do more harm than good.

Here to tell us more is Mason Heberling, associate curator of botany at Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. He's one of the experts behind the museum's new exhibition, Uprooted: Plants Out of Place, which opened on March 22.

Thank you so much for joining us today.

Mason Heberling: Yeah, happy to be here.

Feltman: What do you think is missing or lacking right now in the way we talk about invasive plants, and why is that important to address?

Heberling: Yeah, I guess, first and foremost, people, I think [laughs] ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: Is, is largely absent out of the invasive-species conversation. And that is: “How did species get where they are, and who and what is responsible for that?” That's a missing key. Oftentimes we talk about invasive plants, invasive insects, invasive—introduced whatever, and we oftentimes focus on specific species or we focus on particular areas that they come from. But we rarely talk about the underlying cause of the introduction, so I think that's one thing that's really missing in kind of science communication around the topic.

Feltman: Yeah, and how do you think that the way we talk about and deal with invasive species would be different if, if we address that?

Heberling: I mean, I think the hope is and the thought is that there's not just these nasty organisms that are just out to get humans but that humans are part of nature and humans are part of the problem but also part of the solution, so instead of just ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: Pointing at a particular plant and being like, “This plant is ruining our life,” we instead see it as the broader context of how the plant got here, what we might do to mitigate the problem, but then also what we might do to prevent future problems.

Feltman: What are some key concepts about invasive species that, that tend to be oversimplified or underemphasized?

Heberling: Well, there's a lot [laughs]. I think just in general, in the field of ecology, there's not necessarily these big laws and rules like maybe other sciences have, like physics or something. And so it—it's complicated.

So what happens in an ecological web when you remove one species? Sometimes nothing really happens [laughs], and sometimes, if it's, you know, a keystone species or an important species, the whole web has to be re-networked. It's not totally random, but there is certainly an element of chance, but also it's just complicated.

So I think that kind of big question of, “If you introduce species X to a region where it hasn't been before,” there's a lot of factors at play that might help you predict, but ultimately you don't always necessarily know the impact of a given introduction.

Feltman: Yeah. You've done some work on how we might change the messaging around invasive species. Can you give us an example of how poorly considered messages can lead the public to do more harm to the environment than good?

Heberling: There are plenty of examples of that. And I guess just to step back, even if you don't study invasives, you do study invasives, whether indirectly or directly. With that being said, being at the museum, my position as botany curator really has a pretty strong public-facing-outreach component. And being a plant ecologist, also giving a lot of guided hikes, pointing out plants, what plants are what, telling fun stories about particular plants to hook in, and of course, the topic of invasives comes up in that, too.

And so both out in the field, giving these types of tours to the public, and then also in the museum galleries, in the dioramas or other exhibit spaces, it, it kind of came to me that I'm actually not that great at communicating about this particular topic. It's a very nuanced, complicated topic, a lot of finger-pointing happening.

And I think one big thing that really hit hard for me was: being in Pennsylvania—and in the eastern U.S., period—a lot of our invasives and forests, in particular, our work has found are from East Asia. So going on hikes, pointing out, “Hey, this plant is from Japan,” it kind of depends on, you know, what kind of background and philosophies people have, but there's oftentimes either intentional or unintentional connection with, like, human migration. I really noticed it when COVID-19 started and there was kind of a resurgence of anti-immigration sentiments and, and a resurgence of—or, you know, a fear of East Asia.

A while ago that happened to me, where someone is just like, “Oh, well, it's just, like, Japanese coming to America.” And I'm like, “Ugh, I wasn't looking to have a conversation about human migration.” But then, more thinking about that, you really do see that the way that we address and talk about plant invasions, or invasions in general, really is seeded in this larger context of, you know, if, if you have an issue with this plant because it's from Japan, what else does that say about us, either ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: As a society and as science?

So there's people that are really worried about introduced plants from a biological conservation side. And then there is this kind of other side that especially has been strong and more like the humanities fields where there is this general notion of, “Who are you to say what can live where and when?” And I think that's a valid question, but also it, it brings up this binary of yes or no, or native or non-native. And I think that can be very off-putting to a lot of people.

From my stance as a botanist we really don't want the take-home to be like, “We hate plants.” And from the same sense we don't want to be—the take-home to be, “We hate people for particular reasons.”

Feltman: Sure.

Heberling: So I've seen it go sour that way. And then I've also seen it go sour in this kind of vilifying particular organisms—these fear appeals. They've been really popular, and they've been really effective in some ways. For instance: “Don't move this wood because the emerald ash borer or some other introduced insect or something, we don't wanna move it around.” And that can be pretty effective to, to instill change, but those little sound bites don't actually give the full nuance of: “How did we get where we are now? What can we do in the future to prevent that?”

And so you oftentimes also see kids, they are chasing after invasive bugs and squashing them. And you could see, as an environmental educator, there being a bit of a conflict there in terms of ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: Killing organisms and maybe not necessarily getting that message across of why we are advocating for killing or removing particular organisms in a given context. So it's really complicated.

And again, working at the museum, exhibit labels need to be short and punchy, and people come to the museum to be inspired, to be instilled with wonder, to be happy. You don't necessarily come to an exhibit to read an exhibit label that requires you to get out your dictionary and sit there for an hour to read it. So how do you distill these, these big-picture topics to get across both the biological concepts and the sense of action and inspiration for land stewardship?

That's something that we've been really working on in the—at the museum here, so we're really excited that now we are opening this exhibition, Uprooted: Plants Out of Place, that we really are trying to present this topic in a way that is both informational, inspirational and accurate and gives that full nuance rather than other exhibitions or short science communication pieces that are just kind of like, “This plant is bad; get rid of it.”

Feltman: Very cool. So what got you interested in invasive plants?

Heberling: I actually got into plants through invasive plants, helping my parents garden. That's a good child job, right? “Remove these weeds; we don't want these weeds here.” And so that always got me thinking, but I didn't really know much more than that. And then I went to school for biology then, and as an undergraduate I was really interested in nature generically. Then I quickly ended up working a bit in, in horticulture, you know, as a summer job, and again these weeds kind of came back to me: “How did they get here? What are they doing? How do they interact?” And then from there it kind of spiraled.

My interest, fundamentally, really was the basic science of invasion ecology or introduced plants, seeing it as this big—unintentional—but this big kind of global experiment: What happens when you mix species around with different evolutionary histories? There's a lot of basic scientific, ecological, evolutionary principles to be tested there that's really quite fascinating. And that's what originally drove me and still does drive a lot of my research here at the museum.

Feltman: I know you've done some writing on how naming conventions can change the way we talk about invasive species. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?

Heberling: So this was work that kind of culminated in this exhibition at the museum but also in more behind-the-scenes and public-facing work with different environmental organizations here around Pittsburgh addressing this issue of: “How do we talk about invasives? What's the most effective way, and what's the most accurate way?” Which sometimes aren't necessarily the same thing.

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: Something that, that we're really putting to practice in exhibition labels is common names of plants. Now, unlike other organisms, there's no official common names for plants. We tend to focus on scientific names, and there's a big conversation going on now, too, about scientific names and renaming them on various bases. But for common names and for introduced plants in particular, oftentimes we say “Japanese wisteria,” “Japanese knotweed,” “Chinese privet.” So we have this kind of geographic descriptor. And at first, honestly, I, I really had no issue with that. I thought, “Yeah, that makes sense ...”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Heberling: “I'm really interested in where plants are from.” And I thought giving that name provides some context of, yes, this plant is introduced, first off. And then second off, where generally is it from? That's just interesting.

But what I found in practice with science communication, sometimes, first off, it's not necessarily accurate. Japanese knotweed may not necessarily be all from Japan, and plants don't necessarily follow political boundaries. And we also see plants like Canada thistle, for instance, which is a European plant, but we call it Canada thistle, so that's a different story. So sometimes there's straight-up misnomers, and sometimes there's just some blurred lines that isn't necessarily true; maybe it was just first introduced from there or the first person who encountered it—first European, I should say, or Euro-American—kind of called it that. And that's not always accurate.

In the case of Japanese knotweed, for instance, which is a huge invasive plant that's introduced from East Asia and is now in Europe and in North America, and it's also a huge one in Pittsburgh area here, so it's one that we're featuring. And so it was like, “Do we wanna say ‘Japanese knotweed'?” First off, is that accurate? And then second off, we don't know where everyone's coming from when they read the label ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Heberling: And we don't necessarily want Japan to be the first thing they think about and then read ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: A bunch of negative things about this plant. And it seems relatively subtle, but it really is important. So we instead say things like “knotweed,” for instance, or use the name that the Japanese call it, which is itadori. And I think little, subtle shifts like that reframe it a little bit. And, and there are other names, too, that are absolutely offensive to certain ...

Feltman: Sure.

Heberling: Groups of people, but there are other things that aren't necessarily offensive—there's nothing offensive about “Japanese knotweed,” for instance—but it's more about the tone and how it's presented and also the biological accuracy of where exactly is this plant from.

So in a way the good thing about common names is, we can call plants whatever we want [laughs]. We don't need to necessarily go with scientific conventions when we're talking in the vernacular. It's actually really quite cool, too, that different regions of the world may call the same plant different things, and it oftentimes will say [something] about how they use the plant or how it's engaged in their culture in some way, or it could be descriptive, but it is a powerful and relatively easy way to shift the narrative a little bit about invasives and keep the conversation going rather than just being like, “Oh, they're from this particular place—I know these other plants are from there, too; they must be bad,” and walk away.

Feltman: [Laughs] Yeah. What would you say are the big things that everyday people and, you know, home-gardening enthusiasts can do to support native plants?

Heberling: It depends where you are in the world, of course, but there's a big native-plant movement, I would say, this kind of revolution happening in people's backyards—you know, rethinking gardening in general for not only the plants that they plant but also the other organisms that they can help with their plants.

It's kind of like voting, I would say: you know, every little bit matters. It might not seem like you removing a particular plant and switching it out with another one may be huge, but collectively it really does matter. And also it's a time for engagement, you know, personal engagement.

One of the things we're doing here at the museum—connecting with local resources, because there's a lot of native-plant nurseries in a lot of places across the world. And going to a big-box store or even a, a big commercial nursery, don't assume that all the plants there are, are great for you to plant. And so you have a little bit of responsibility but also agency to make those decisions. And I think in the last couple of years for Pennsylvania but also in the last, really, couple of decades for a lot of different U.S. states, there's been a lot of increased regulation of the commercial trade. And some of that I see as being really positive because some of that is out of the hands of the consumer; it affects consumer decisions—what's available to buy, for instance.

So it's not only about necessarily removing plants but then also cultivating an environment that is conducive to the type of healthy ecosystems that we want. It really needs to be an active restoration, and active restoration also doesn't mean that it necessarily has to be super difficult ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: There are a lot of native weeds. So I'm using the term “weed” here, and a weed is just a plant out of place; it doesn't matter if it's native or non-native. And sometimes we hear the word “weed” and we're like, “Oh, that's bad.” But what I mean by that is we can foster self-sustaining gardens, too, and that's a really exciting, empowering thing.

For instance, plants like milkweed, we consider that a weed, and maybe it once was really reviled for various reasons—oftentimes weeds are these early species that do well in these kind of early successional or in these disturbed environments, which is true in cities and a lot of other places. But what's beautiful is they can self-seed and they can be a keystone species in these ecological networks and really take it from there.

Feltman: Yeah, thank you so much for joining us today. This has been a great conversation.

Heberling: Yeah, you're welcome.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. For more on invasive plants, head over to Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh to check out its new exhibit Uprooted: Plants Out of [Place].

We'll be back on Friday with an episode I'm super excited to share: an inside look at MIT.nano, a cutting-edge facility for nanoscale science and engineering. And I do mean an inside look.

The purpose of a mysterious pyramidal structure in the Judaean Desert is unknown, but excavators are finding many well-preserved artifacts there.

Archaeologists are uncovering a mysterious pyramid-shaped structure and way station in the Judaean Desert. The excavation site, just north of the valley of Zohar (Nahal Zohar) along the coast of the Dead Sea, contains a host of exceptionally well-preserved artifacts that are more than 2,000 years old.

""The discoveries are exciting and even emotional, and their significance for archaeological and historical research is enormous,"" Eli Escusido, director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said in a statement.

The pyramid is built from hand-cut stones, each weighing hundreds of pounds. But the structure's purpose is still unknown, according to the site's excavation directors. It may have served as a historical monument, a grave, or a guard tower protecting a commercial route from the Dead Sea to coastal ports.

The site dates back 2,200 years to the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty and Seleucid Empire. After Alexander the Great died in 323 B.C., his generals divided his vast empire among themselves. His general Ptolemy took control of Egypt and the surrounding areas, including Israel, while Seleucus ruled the northern part of what is now the Middle East. By 200 B.C., the Seleucid Empire had conquered what is now modern-day Israel.

Given that the pyramidal structure dates to the time of this power switch, it's unclear if it was built under the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty or the Seleucid Empire. The Roman Empire absorbed both empires in the first century B.C.

The archaeologists also unearthed a number of artifacts at the site. The low-moisture environment of the desert likely helped preserve the artifacts through the millennia. Low humidity deters mold and minimizes warping and cracking in organic materials like wood and fibers.

""The extreme dryness has preserved things here in an extraordinary way,"" archaeologist Ido Zangen, who was involved with the excavation, said in a translated video released by the Israel Antiquities Authority. ""We're finding papyrus fragments, all kinds of amazing wooden artifacts, baskets and ropes that you simply don't find anywhere else in the country.""

—1,900-year-old coins from Jewish revolt against the Romans discovered in the Judaean desert

Some of the papyrus fragments contain writing in ancient Greek, one of the languages spoken by denizens of both the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires. Also among the unearthed artifacts are bronze coins and vessels, remnants of ancient furniture, beads, weapons, fabrics and seeds, all preserved by the dry climate.

Eva Balbin Brafman, a volunteer at the excavation, described finding part of a papyrus document from the upper part of the site. ""You could clearly make out the letters, probably in Greek,"" Balbin Brafman said in the video. ""It's incredibly exciting to find something in such a wonderful state of preservation.""

A team of professional archaeologists and volunteers will continue to excavate the site through April 8 in hopes of learning more about the structure.

A Chinese automaker has developed a battery that will enable electric vehicles (EVs) to charge almost as quickly as it takes to fill a regular car's gas tank.

The new battery, named the e-platform, was developed by BYD, a Chinese firm that is overtaking Tesla as the world's top seller of electric vehicles.

Assigned a 10C rating — meaning the battery can move charge at ten times the rate of its nominal capacity — the e-platform can reach full charge in just six minutes. At its peak charging power of 1,000 kilowatts , the battery's charging rate is twice as fast as Tesla's 500 kW superchargers. This means that the two new models using the battery — BYD's Han L saloon and its Tang L SUV — can travel up to 250 miles (400 kilometers) on just a five-minute charge.

—World's 1st silicon anode EV battery will let you drive up to 186 miles after just 5 minutes of charging

—EV batteries could last much longer thanks to new capacitor with 19-times higher energy density that scientists created by mistake

""We have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refueling time of petrol vehicles,"" BYD founder Wang Chuanfu said at a launch event in Shenzhen, China. ""This is the first time in the industry that the unit of megawatt has been achieved on charging power.""

To charge at such rapid speeds, the e-platform works by simultaneously creating a high voltage and delivering a large current to the charging car. But high currents also tend to generate heat that damages EV batteries.

To get around this, BYD says it massively reduced the internal resistance inside the battery. The company's new silicon carbide power chips are also designed to withstand higher voltages.

To facilitate the cars' launch, BYD said it will install a network of 4,000 flash charging stations across China. This technology is currently only available in China, and the company has yet to confirm whether it will make it available internationally.

An Iron Age hoard discovered in England is on a ""kind of scale and size that is exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe.""

An amateur metal detectorist in Northern England has discovered an ""unusual"" 2,000-year-old hoard of artifacts that was burned and then buried.

The Iron Age finding, named the Melsonby Hoard after the nearby village of Melsonby in North Yorkshire, contains more than 800 artifacts, including a cauldron, wine-mixing bowl, horse riding equipment, pieces of wagons or chariots, a large iron mirror, and ceremonial iron spearheads.

""The bowl we discovered is very interesting because it was a very unusual type — not something you'd normally find in Northern Britain,"" said Tom Moore, a professor and head of the Department of Archaeology at Durham University in the U.K. who helped excavate and analyze the hoard.

""Its decoration combines both Mediterranean and British Iron Age styles,"" Moore said in a video released by Durham University. This suggests that whoever owned it likely had ""a network across Britain and across into Europe and even the Roman world,"" he said.

Peter Heads, a hobbyist metal detectorist, discovered the hoard in December 2021 after he secured permission from a private landowner to survey a field. He then contacted Moore, who looped in the government and The British Museum, according to a statement released Tuesday (March 25) by Durham University.

""It was only really when we went back to excavate the hoard and we opened up a much larger area that I think Peter and I, and all of the team, realized we were on to something really exciting,"" Moore said in the video.

The excavation revealed that the entire find included a small hoard, as well as a large hoard ""that was of a kind of scale and size that is exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe,"" Moore said.



From the field, the team cut out a large block of earth holding the artifacts and they then had it CT scanned so they could create a virtual, 3D model of it. An analysis revealed that much of the ironwork and copper alloy items had either been burned or broken. It's possible that these items had been placed in a funerary pyre, although no human bones were found at the site.

""Our working theory at the moment is that [the hoard had] been gathered together and maybe heated in a sort of a big bonfire or perhaps a pyre,"" Sophia Adams, curator of the European Iron Age and Roman Conquest Period at The British Museum who is studying the find, said in the video.

After the burning, some of the items appear to have been further damaged as they were thrown into a ditch and had stones tossed on top of them, she said.

—More than 1,300 coins buried during Roman emperor Nero's reign found in England

Despite the damage, many of the artifacts are still recognizable. Some of the horse harnesses are decorated with red coral from the Mediterranean and colored glass, which hints at far-flung trade.

""The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts,"" Moore said in the statement.

Researchers are still analyzing the artifacts, and they hope that the finds will one day go on display in a museum, they said in the video.

Auroras are possible over the U.S. tonight (March 25) as a ""moderate"" geomagnetic storm hits Earth.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


UPDATE: The Northern Lights could be visible in the U.S. tonight (March 26), appearing as far south as New York and Idaho due to a ""coronal hole"" sending streams of charged particles toward Earth.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initally issued a G2 geomagnetic storm warning for Tuesday, March 25, which has now been extended into Wednesday (March 26).

Like hurricanes, geomagnetic storms follow a 5-point severity scale. G2 storms are considered ""moderate"" in strength and could cause minor technological disruptions such as radio blackouts, GPS malfunctions, and an increased chance of spotting auroras at lower latitudes than usual.

""Watches of this level are not uncommon,"" according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center; G2-strength geomagnetic storms hit Earth about 360 days in each 11-year solar cycle. These storms can affect spacecraft orbits and cause weak power grid fluctuations at high latitudes, but they mostly cause ""manageable effects to some technological infrastructure,"" according to NOAA.

The Space Weather Prediction Center issued the extended storm warning because a ""coronal hole"" on the sun is facing Earth. Coronal holes are cooler, darker regions of the sun's outermost atmosphere (the corona) that are less dense than normal, allowing high-speed solar winds — streams of charged particles — to escape from the sun and gush outward into space. Currently, one of these escaped high-speed streams is pointed directly at Earth.

Earth's magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, but some charged particles make it through into the upper layers of the atmosphere. When the solar wind hits Earth's atmosphere, charged particles shoot toward Earth's poles, agitating atmospheric molecules along the way and forcing them to emit energy in the form of colorful auroras.

In October 2024, the sun reached its solar maximum period, the most active part of its 11-year cycle. During this period, the sun's magnetic poles flip, and space weather events like geomagnetic storms and solar flares occur more frequently. Scientists predict that the solar maximum will continue for at least a few more months if not longer, providing additional opportunities to spot the Northern Lights.

On Wednesday night, ""the aurora may become visible over some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho,"" according to a statement from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.

The best chances of spotting an aurora are on dark, clear nights between 10pm and 2am, far from artificial lights. You can see auroras with the naked eye, but their colors might look even more vivid through a smartphone screen.

Researchers made the first known recordings of sharks making sounds after noticing they made clicks while being handled at a marine laboratory.

Sharks have long been thought to be mute, relying on stealth to hunt their prey and avoid predators. But now, sharks have been recorded making sounds for the very first time.

The new recordings reveal that rig sharks (Mustelus lenticulatus) — small, bottom-dwelling sharks native to New Zealand — emit distinct clicks when handled by researchers underwater. These sounds were consistent and repeated across multiple individuals, and were potentially tied to distress or defensive responses, according to a study published Wednesday (Mar. 26) in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

The recordings represent the first known case of a shark actively producing sound. ""Sharks have sensory systems that are more refined than their hearing, like their electroreceptors, their smell and the way they propel themselves through the water,"" study lead author Carolin Nieder, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told Live Science. ""But I think the original notion that we had that sound isn't important at all is also likely not true.""

Ten juvenile rig sharks were observed making sounds by accident during routine behavioral experiments at the University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Laboratory. When briefly handled by researchers underwater, all 10 sharks produced audible clicks.

These clicking sounds were very frequent during the first few handlings but then stopped as the experiments progressed, Nieder said. ""Maybe they weren't afraid for their lives anymore,"" she said, adding that in the wild, loud clicks may serve as a split-second distraction for juvenile sharks to make their escape when they are seized by predators.

Most sharks are thought to be silent because they lack swim bladders — air-filled sacs commonly used by fish to make sounds. MicroCT scans and 3D reconstructions of rig sharks also revealed no obvious sound-producing organs or structures.

The team proposed that the sounds could be coming from the sharks snapping their teeth.

Rig sharks have broad, blunt teeth arranged in tightly packed, plate-like formations, which are ideal for crushing hard-shelled prey like crabs. This ""pavement dentition,"" may also serve a second function of producing noise when the jaws snap shut, the researchers said.

However, Nieder noted that without direct observation of the sharks' jaws during click production, the mechanism remains speculative.

Each click lasted around 48 milliseconds, with volumes sometimes exceeding 155 decibels, which is comparable to shotgun blast.

Roughly three-quarters of the clicks were single bursts, while the rest were short double-clicks. The scientists observed that about 70% of these clicks were accompanied by calm, swaying body movements, but a few occurred without any visible motion at all.

Whether the clicking is an accidental byproduct of handling or a purposeful behavior remains unknown.

The sharks' own hearing range is largely below 1 kilohertz, far lower than the frequencies of its clicks, meaning it's unlikely the clicks are meant for communicating with other sharks.

However, some known predators of rig sharks, such as New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri), are sensitive to higher frequencies and might be startled or confused by the sharp clicks.

Several species of rays and skates — close relatives of sharks — are also known to produce clicks when disturbed by divers. These sounds are thought to serve as warning signals or distress calls.

—A really big shark got gobbled up by another, massive shark in 1st known case of its kind

Nieder said future studies could target closely related shark species to investigate whether they are also capable of making noises, and whether they make noise in response to stress.

Adrian Gutteridge, a shark biologist with the IUCN Shark Specialist Group who was not involved in the study, said more research will be needed to establish what the shark clicks are for, and what they could mean.

""It's too early to tell whether it's a response, kind of saying, 'go away,' or if [it's] just their nervous system is firing off which just happens to make their teeth and jaws click,"" he told Live Science.

After suspecting the presence of a series of underwater volcanoes near the Cook Islands, researchers have now mapped out the newly discovered structures.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A series of relatively young underwater volcanoes has been discovered under the waves of the Pacific Ocean, some of which may even be active.

The volcanoes were found during an expedition to map the seafloor near the Cook Islands in the Central Pacific, about 2,900 miles (4,700 kilometers) south of Hawaii. If these structures are volcanically active, the heat that they generate may have spawned a unique and exciting marine habitat nearby, the researchers said.

""So far, we have not seen any clear signs of volcanic activity, but then again, no one has yet had the chance to look carefully at the seabed and sample it,"" representatives from the Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA), which co-led the research, said in a statement. ""Once fully processed and interpreted, our new seabed map should help any future scientists quickly go directly to the best points for this sampling.""

The Cook Islands are a group of 15 islands in the South Pacific Ocean, located between French Polynesia and American Samoa. This archipelago was created millions of years ago as the Pacific plate moved over a magma hotspot in the Earth's mantle — similar to the way the Hawaiian Islands were formed. A magma hotspot is a localized area in Earth's mantle where unusually hot rock rises toward the surface, causing volcanic activity. Unlike volcanoes at tectonic plate boundaries, hotspots occur in the middle of tectonic plates and remain stationary, while the plate above moves over time.



A hot mantle plume from the hotspot brings heat and magma toward Earth's crust, which can cause magma from the mantle to erupt onto the seafloor and then cool rapidly in the water. Over time, repeated eruptions build up a volcanic structure, forming an underwater volcano. If the eruptions continue, the volcano grows large enough to break the ocean surface, forming a volcanic island.

Most of the volcanoes in the Cook Islands are ancient, with their rocks dating back tens or even hundreds of millions of years. However, the islands of Rarotonga and Aitutaki are made of a combination of older and younger rocks, because they are among the most recent islands to form over the hotspot — the youngest rock on Rarotonga dates back only around 1.2 million years.

These newly mapped underwater volcanoes were first theorized in 2024 after researchers discovered that the rocks of one submerged volcano were only 670,000 years old. The rocks were discovered roughly 37 miles (60 km) southeast of Rarotonga, on a volcano called Tama, and they mark the youngest volcanic rocks discovered in the Cook Islands to date.

The team also theorized that, going southeast from Rarotonga through Tama, there may be several other underwater volcanoes lurking on the seafloor, which may also be much younger than the other Cook Islands.

To investigate these structures further, the ARTEX 2025 expedition was launched to map the ocean floor in the area surrounding Rarotonga. The team discovered that there was indeed a series of smaller structures dotted along the seafloor to the southeast of Rarotonga, including a 0.6-mile-high (1 km) volcano named ""Pepe"". The team's data is yet to be fully processed, however, and the structures have not yet been confirmed as volcanically active.

The researchers hope to return to the area to learn more about the seamounts, or underwater volcanoes, and to collect samples of the rocks to figure out exactly how old they are.

The National Institutes of Health employee said she knew things would be difficult for federal workers after Donald Trump was elected. But she never imagined it would be like this.

Focused on Alzheimer's and other dementia research, the worker is among thousands who abruptly lost their jobs in the Trump administration's federal workforce purge. The way she was terminated — in February through a boilerplate notice alleging poor performance, something she pointedly said was ""not true"" — made her feel she was ""losing hope in humans.""

She said she can't focus or meditate, and can barely go to the gym. At the urging of her therapist, she made an appointment with a psychiatrist in March after she felt she'd ""hit the bottom,"" she said.

""I am going through hell,"" said the employee, who worked at the National Institute on Aging, one of 27 centers that make up the NIH. The worker, like others interviewed for this story, was granted anonymity because of the fear of professional retaliation.

""I know I am a mother. I am a wife. But I am also a person who was very happy with her career,"" she said. ""They took my job and my life from my hands without any reason.""

President Trump and his allies have increasingly denigrated the roughly 2 million people who make up the federal workforce, 80% of whom work outside the Washington, D.C., area. Trump has said federal workers are ""destroying this country,"" called them ""crooked"" and ""dishonest,"" and insinuated that they're lazy. ""Many of them don't work at all,"" he said earlier this month.

Elon Musk — who is the world's richest person and whose Department of Government Efficiency, created by a Trump executive order, is infiltrating federal agencies and spearheading mass firings — has claimed without evidence that ""there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead"" and others ""who are not real people."" At a conference for conservatives in February, Musk brandished what he called ""the chain saw for bureaucracy"" and said that ""waste is pretty much everywhere.""

The firings that began in February are taking a significant toll on federal employees' mental health. Workers said they feel overwhelmed and demoralized, have obtained or considered seeking psychiatric care and medication, and feel anxious about being able to pay bills or afford college for their children.

Federal employees are bracing for more layoffs after agencies were required to deliver plans by this month for large-scale staff reductions. Compounding the uncertainty: After judges ruled that some initial firings were illegal, agencies have rehired some workers and placed others on paid administrative leave. Then, Trump on March 20 issued a memo giving the Office of Personnel Management more power to fire people across agencies.

Researchers who study job loss say these mass layoffs not only are disrupting the lives of tens of thousands of federal workers but also will reverberate out to their spouses, children, and communities.

""I'd expect this will have long-lasting impacts on these people's lives and those around them,"" said Jennie Brand, a professor of sociology at UCLA who wrote a paper about the implications of job loss. ""We can see this impact years down the road.""

Studies have shown that people who are unemployed experience greater anxiety, depression, and suicide risk. The longer the period of unemployment, the worse the effects.

Couples fight more when one person loses a job, and if it's a man, divorce rates increase.

Children with an unemployed parent are more likely to do poorly in school, repeat a grade, or drop out. It can even affect whether they go to college, Brand said. There's an ""intergenerational impact of instability,"" she said.

And it doesn't stop there. When people lose their jobs, especially when it's many people at once, the wealth and resources available in their community are reduced. Kids see fewer employed role models. As families are forced to move, neighborhood stability gets upended. Unemployed people often withdraw from social and civic life, avoiding community gatherings, church, or other places where they might have to discuss or explain their job loss.

Although getting a new job can alleviate some of these problems, it doesn't eliminate them, Brand said.

""It's not as if people just get new jobs and then pick up the activities they used to be involved with,"" she said. ""There's not a quick recovery.""

The firings are upending a long-standing norm of the public sector — in exchange for earning less money compared with private-sector work, people had greater job security and more generous benefits. Now that's no longer the case, fired workers said in interviews.

With the American economy moving toward temporary and gig jobs, landing a traditional government job was supposed to be ""like you've got the golden goose,"" said Blake Allan, a professor of counseling psychology at the University of Houston who researches how the quality of work affects people's lives.

Even federal workers who are still employed face the daily question of whether they'll be fired next. That constant state of insecurity, Allan said, can create chronic stress, which is linked to anxiety, depression, digestive problems, heart disease, and a host of other health issues.

One employee at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, who was granted anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, said the administration's actions seem designed to cause enough emotional distress that workers voluntarily leave. ""I feel like this ax will always be over my head for as long as I'm here and this administration is here,"" the employee said.

Federal workers who passed on higher-paying private sector jobs because they wanted to serve their country may feel especially gutted to hear Trump and Musk denigrate their work as wasteful.

""Work is such a fundamental part of our identity,"" Allan said. When it's suddenly lost, ""it can be really devastating to your sense of purpose and identity, your sense of social mattering, especially when it's in a climate of devaluing what you do.""

Andrew Hazelton, a scientist in Florida, was working on improving hurricane forecasts when he was fired in February from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The mass firings were carried out ""with no humanity,"" he said. ""And that's really tough.""

Hazelton became a federal employee in October but had worked alongside NOAA scientists for over eight years, including as an employee at the University of Miami. He lost his job as part of a purge targeting probationary workers, who lack civil service protections against firings.

His friends set up a GoFundMe crowdfunding page to provide a financial cushion for him, his wife, and their four children. Then in March, after a federal judge's order requiring federal agencies to rescind those terminations, he was notified that he had been reinstated on paid administrative leave.

""It's created a lot of instability,"" said Hazelton, who still isn't being allowed to do his work. ""We just want to serve the public and get our forecasts and our data out there to help people make decisions, regardless of politics.""

Along with their jobs, many federal workers are losing their health insurance, leaving them ill equipped to seek care just as they and their families are facing a tidal wave of potential mental and physical health consequences. And the nation's mental health system is already underfunded, understaffed, and overstretched. Even with insurance, many people wait weeks or months to receive care.

""Most people don't have a bunch of money sitting around to spend on therapy when you need to cover your mortgage for a couple months and try to find a different job,"" Allan said.

A second NIH worker considered talking to a psychiatrist and potentially going on an antidepressant because of anxiety after being fired in February.

""And then the first thought after that was: 'Oh, I'm about to not have insurance. I can't do that,'"" said the worker, who was granted anonymity to avoid professional retaliation. The worker's health benefits were set to end in April — leaving too little time to get an appointment with a psychiatrist, let alone start a prescription.

""I don't want to go on something and then have to stop it immediately,"" the worker said.

The employee, one of several NIH workers reinstated this month, still fears getting fired again. The worker focuses on Alzheimer's and related dementias and was inspired to join the agency because a grandmother has the disease.

The worker worries that ""decades of research are going to be gone and people are going to be left with nothing.""

""I go from anxiety to deep sadness when I think about my own family,"" the employee said.

The NIH, with its $47 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world. The agency awarded nearly 59,000 grants in fiscal 2023, but the Trump administration has begun canceling hundreds of grants on research topics that new political appointees oppose, including vaccine hesitancy and the health of LGBTQ+ populations.

The NIH worker who worked at the National Institute on Aging was informed in mid-March that she would be on paid administrative leave ""until further notice."" She said she is not sure whether she would find a similar job, adding that she ""cannot be at home doing nothing.""

Apart from loving her job, she said, she has one child in college and another in high school and needs stable income. ""I don't know what I'm going to do next.""

We'd like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what's happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

A groundbreaking new study of young people's digital media use has revealed surprising results, including evidence that smartphone ownership may actually benefit children.

The study also suggests a link between social media posting and various negative outcomes, as well as data connecting cyberbullying to depression, anger and signs of dependence on digital media.

The Life in Media Survey, led by a team of researchers at the University of South Florida in collaboration with The Harris Poll, conducted a survey of more than 1,500 11-to-13-year-olds in Florida. The findings will inform a 25-year national study that will track young people's digital media use and wellbeing into adulthood. The findings are embargoed until Tuesday, March 25, at 6 a.m. ET and may be publicly released at that time.

Key findings include:

""We went into this study expecting to find what many researchers, teachers and other observers assume: smartphone ownership is harmful to children. Not only was that not the case, most of the time we found the opposite – that owning a smartphone was associated with positive outcomes,"" said Justin D. Martin, lead researcher on the project and the Eleanor Poynter Jamison Chair in Media Ethics and Press Policy as USF.

Based on the findings, the research team of experts from journalism, psychology, public health, political science and communications, as well as a researcher from the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, provide a few recommendations:

Our findings indicate that the effects of smartphone ownership are complex. It's what kids do with cell phones and challenges in regulating their device use, rather than merely owning a smartphone, that may cause difficulties or inversely benefit their lives.""

Wendy Rote, Associate Professor, Psychology, University of South Florida

Informed by this survey, the research team will now prepare to start a nationwide, long-term study of some 8,000 children in early adolescence. 

The Life in Media Survey is the first lifespan study of its kind examining digital media use. It sets out to track participants from youth to adulthood to learn more about the long-term health and wellness impacts of smartphones, social media and other digital media and devices. 

Research will be conducted over the next 25 years, and data collected every six months will give ongoing insight to parents, teachers, researchers, health providers and others on the impact of digital media use on children and as they age into adults.

""Our data provide a snapshot of how the media influences young people in the moment. But many of the problems and benefits of media use accumulate over time, which is why it is essential to also conduct a long-term study to accurately assess the effects of digital media on wellbeing through an individual's life,"" said Stephen Song, co-principal investigator and USF assistant professor of journalism.

Researchers hope to determine how digital media impacts and changes attitudes, behaviors and health throughout people's lives. For example, over time, the Life in Media Survey will be able to provide specifics about the impact of six-second videos on developing brains, the effects of staring at screens for five hours a day on eyesight and how online socialization in childhood affects sociability at age 30.

A special unit that began as a cold case task force recently helped secure a murder indictment against an active-duty airman accused of killing a missing Native American woman.

Quinterius Chappelle, 24, an aircraft inspection journeyman stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday for the alleged murder of 21-year-old Sahela ""Shy"" Toka Win Sangrait, who friends and family told Fox News Digital was his girlfriend of about one year.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Missing and Murdered Unit (MMU) became involved in the case March 10, when a state lab confirmed a DNA sample from the body matched Sangrait, a registered tribal member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.

""At that point in time, our criminal investigators were notified and were brought online with it,"" MMU Regional Agent In Charge Robert Schoeberl told Fox News Digital in an interview Friday.

Active-duty Us Airman Charged In Killing Of Missing Woman On Military Base

The unit originated as a cold case task force, part of operation ""Lady Justice,"" a multi-agency initiative established by the Trump administration in 2019 to improve the functioning of the criminal justice system and address the staggering number of missing and murdered Native Americans in tribal communities, according to Schoeberl.

In February, the BIA announced the Office of Justice Services launched ""Operation Spirit Return"" in conjunction with MMU.

Homicide was among the top three most frequent causes of death among American Indian and Alaska Native females aged 15 to 24, as of 2019, according to data provided by the National Congress of American Indians. More than four in five indigenous women experience sexual violence in their lifetime.

The Not Invisible Act was also passed by Congress during Trump's first term in 2020, aimed at addressing the rampant number of missing persons and murder and trafficking of American Indian and Alaska Native peoples.

""President Trump is the president of law and order, and he is always working to deliver justice for victims of violent crime,"" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

According to a redacted indictment, Chappelle, an airman basic who has been in the service since 2019, allegedly ""unlawfully, and with premeditation and with malice aforethought"" killed Sangrait at Ellsworth Air Force Base on or about Aug. 11, 2024.

The Pennington County Sheriff's Office said Sangrait, of Box Elder, was reported missing Aug. 10, just one day prior to when authorities claim she was killed.

Isabela Arroyo, Sangrait's sister, told Fox News Digital Chappelle was verbally abusive toward Sangrait, who had a one-way plane ticket to move in with Arroyo and her husband in Colorado Sept. 6.

Sangrait told Chappelle she was going to go to Colorado for the birth of Arroyo's son Sept. 27, her sister said. However, it is unclear if Chappelle found out about her plan to remain in Colorado.

""She never got on the plane,"" Arroyo said. ""It was really hard. I had assumed that she had just chosen not to come anymore, and, unfortunately, that wasn't the case.""

Sangrait's body, discarded in a wooded area near the Pennington and Custer County line, was discovered by a hiker March 4, about seven months after her disappearance.

The sheriff's office said the body was ""badly decomposed"" and there was ""no identifying information available.""

The cause of death has not yet been released.

Tayagonique McGloghlon, who met Sangrait in 2021 while participating in a program for young adults who recently aged out of foster care, told Fox News Digital the prospective nurse would call her every week, but, similar to Arroyo, the last she heard from Sangrait was Aug. 10.

""The last message I got from her was on Aug. 10, and she asked me if I was OK,"" McGloghlon said. ""The day before that, I called her about three times. The third time I called, it went straight to voicemail — like her phone had been turned off for me, which I thought was really weird. … It put me off in a weird way.""

McGloghlon said she tried sending Sangrait messages on social media, thinking maybe she had been blocked.

""I was like, 'That's not like her, especially when she always kept in contact with me,'"" she said.

McGloghlon, who met Chappelle while he was dating one of her friends prior to Sangrait, said she always found him ""a little bit weird"" and ""never liked him,"" but Sangrait only told her good things.

""I was devastated [when her remains were found],"" McGloghlon said. ""Honestly, I've never been more heartbroken. She's the light in this world. She didn't deserve that. … She was very spirited and such a good friend. She was a kind soul, just beautiful. I miss her so much. She was one of my best friends.""

Cassidy Wimble, another one of Sangrait's friends, told Fox News Digital she had yet to meet Chappelle in person, but he was one of the first people she reached out to after the disappearance.

""He told me, 'I don't know anything. I wish we [could] find her,'"" Wimble said. ""He said the same thing to a few people.""

MMU investigators collaborate with the federal National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) database and Othram, a Texas-based company that specializes in forensic genetic genealogy, to identify human remains.

""It's more advanced forensic testing, which a lot of the evidence from this case will run through,"" Schoeberl said.""[Othram] tests relatives, basically identifying you through your family members' DNA. It's been very beneficial in solving and helping solve cases recently.""

As part of the Sangrait investigation, the unit also interviewed witnesses, conducted searches and notified family of the death.

The MMU's Victim Services Program continues to provide the family with daily updates as the investigation continues, and the unit remains in close contact with the FBI and other agencies assisting with the case.

U.S. Attorney for the District of South Dakota Alison J. Ramsdell said prosecutors will pursue justice ""relentlessly.""

""The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Dakota will now proceed with the prosecution of this tragic case and relentlessly pursue justice on behalf of the victim,"" Ramsdell wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Wife Convicted Of Murdering Army Soldier Husband At Home On Military Base

Arroyo said it helps to know her sister will get justice and Chappelle is now in custody, unable to harm anyone else.

""It's just how long he was able to walk around like nothing happened,"" Arroyo said. ""He has already denied even knowing my sister. When they initially arrested him, he didn't say a word. He didn't even ask why he was being arrested.""

Chappelle is being held by the U.S. Marshals Service at the Pennington County Jail in Rapid City, South Dakota.

Fox News Digital obtained a scheduling and case management order signed by U.S. District Judge Camela C. Theeler, noting a jury trial is set for May 27.

Attorney Gina Ruggieri, who filed a notice stating she would be representing Chappelle instead of his previously appointed public defender, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fort Ellsworth said it is working closely with area law enforcement agencies.

""First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of Sahela,"" Col. Derek Oakley, 28th Bomb Wing commander, previously told Fox News Digital when Chappelle was initially charged with second-degree murder in a federal criminal complaint. ""We hold Airmen accountable for their actions, and if service members are found in violation of military or civilian law, they will be punished.""

After the indictment, Fort Ellsworth officials, in response to a request for comment, referred Fox News Digital to the U.S. Attorney's Office of South Dakota, citing the jurisdiction change.

Wimble, who said she spoke with Sangrait every day, described her as one of the strongest people she knew.

""She was one of the most resilient people that I knew,"" Wimble said. ""You could knock her down, and like bowling pins, she'd stand up every single time. … She was very strong, and she knew herself more than anybody. She was the kindest person I knew. Especially with all the things that she's gone through. … She's everything to me. … She really deserved a life.""

The Air Force and Pennington County Sheriff's Office declined Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

The FBI and U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital.

Vandals have targeted a newly-opened health centre in Newport according to a health board report. The Aneurin Bevan University Health Board has reported a ""number of incidents"" at the 19 Hills Health and Wellbeing Centre in Ringland since its opening in January.

Incidents have varied from ""trespassing and vandalism by young people in the area to a car crashing into the building"", according to a spokesman for the health board. As a result discussions are under way about having a police community support officer (PCSO) partly stationed at the facility.

A health board report addressing ""ongoing security issues"" at the Ringland Circle site was presented to health board members on Wednesday. The document indicates that as a reaction to these security concerns security personnel have been on duty at the centre in recent weeks.

The spokesman for the health board confirmed that all incidents had been promptly reported to the police who have provided ""timely responses and support"". Efforts are being made to maximise safety in the area with plans for the local PCSO to regularly work from the site, they said.

The 19 Hills centre opened in January aiming to cater for patients from Ringland Medical Practice, Park Surgery, and Ringland Dental Surgery along with offering a variety of other health services once it is fully functional.

The number of Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) Council staff who can't attend work due to mental health reasons is a “cause for concern” with one councillor suggesting the use of mental health first aiders. At a council overview and scrutiny committee on Monday, March 24, councillors discussed the workforce health data which showed that during 2024 there were 147,905 working days lost due to sickness absence.

The highest percentage of sickness absence was in community and children's services (7%) with 5.5 % being long-term absences (more than 28 days). Mental health (not bereavement related) was the biggest reason for absence at 30.5% across the council with community and children's services showing the highest levels at 33.7%.

Councillor Scott Emanuel said: “The level of staff citing mental health as a reason why they can't attend work is a cause for concern. But I think it's really important we recognise that some of our staff work in departments, children's services or housing or anything, where they can see some really distressing stuff and it is going to take a toll on their mental health.”

He said he sees the council is doing lots to support them and hopes they can do everything they can. He said he had trained as a mental health first aider through the charity Mind and found they were really effective because not everybody who is struggling wants to go and tell their manager.

He said mental health first aiders are there to signpost or just listen saying: “I think potentially mental health first aiders could be a good initiative for Rhondda Cynon Taf if you'd be prepared to explore it.” Councillor Ros Davis said she had also done that training and she thinks it's really excellent and something she would support. To get all the very latest Wales Online health news, sign up to our health newsletter here.

She said: “We do know that mental health is a problem across the UK and has been more of a problem since Covid. However I think that we as an authority need to make sure that we are not impacting adversely on people's mental health and so I do think we could do with more data to look at where those issues lie and is there any pattern to it, is there any correlation to it?

“Is there any correlation between home working and poor mental health?” In a response to a question from Councillor Julie Edwards the director of human resources Richard Evans said they've got a number of processes in place to support staff including digital and face-to-face support.

He said they can provide regular counselling to people if they feel they need it and regular mental health and wellbeing support. But Mr Evans said a lot of it comes down to volume with the numbers staying constant.

He said a lot of the issues are around outside influences such as the cost of living and personal issues. Mr Evans said they've put a lot of investment into mental health support but they could do a deeper dive to get more information for councillors.

Responding to a question from Councillor Gareth Hughes he said they are looking at different ways to promote mental health services to frontline staff who haven't got digital access on a day-to-day basis. He also said managers should make people aware of the services available.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Another high-major vacancy is off the board.

West Virginia has hired North Texas coach Ross Hodge on a five-year contract, sources told CBS Sports. An official announcement is expected on Wednesday, and certainly no later than Thursday. Timing for Hodge's introductory press conference is to-be-determined because, according to a source, because North Texas is still playing in the NIT. The Mean Green won at Oklahoma State on Tuesday night and will play in the semifinals at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis next Tuesday. Hodge will coach North Texas until the end of its season, one source added.

Hodge became the primary target for Mountaineers AD Wren Baker after trying to land Ben McCollum (who took the Iowa job) and making contact with Richard Pitino (who left New Mexico for Xavier). Hodge interviewed for the job in Texas last week with West Virginia officials.

The 44-year-old Hodge spent the past two seasons at North Texas and has a 46-23 record overall, with a second-place finish in the American Athletic Conference this season. This season's team is 27-8 despite losing starters last year in the portal to the likes of St. John's, Michigan and Vanderbilt — all teams that qualified for the NCAAs. 

Hodge, who has been coaching at the junior-college and mid-major level since graduating from Texas A&M-Commerce in 2003, is considered one of the sharpest defensive minds in college basketball. UNT has been one of the tougher programs to scheme against on the that end of the floor — not just in the past two seasons, but in the years prior, when Hodge was the program's defensive coordinator under former coach Grant McCasland (now at Texas Tech). 

With West Virginia's vacancy now closed, Villanova is the lone high-major program yet to fill.

If there's any narrative that holds true in the NFL, it's hard to win a Super Bowl. Of course it's hard to even get to a Super Bowl, yet alone win one. 

Tom Brady blocked several quarterbacks from winning Super Bowl titles in the midst of the New England Patriots dynasty, making Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger's two Super Bowl titles all the more impressive. Patrick Mahomes is doing the same in today's NFL, winning three Super Bowl titles and preventing MVP quarterbacks from getting to the Super Bowl. 

Two quarterbacks have beaten Mahomes in the Super Bowl: Brady and Jalen Hurts. The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback is just one of three players to beat Mahomes in the playoffs, creating his own legacy with his first Super Bowl title. Hurts has been to two Super Bowl at this stage in his career -- and he is only 27 years old. 

With Hurts leading the Eagles to a championship, quarterbacks on good teams can go toe to toe with Mahomes and win. An entire roster is responsible for producing a championship team, but the quarterback gets the most praise and criticism because they touch the ball on every offensive possession and get paid the most money -- hence the never-ending spotlight. 

With Hurts winning the Super Bowl, which quarterback is under the most pressure to secure the Lombardi Trophy in 2025? These five will certainly be monitored over the course of the year. 

Joe Burrow is one of the three quarterbacks to beat Mahomes in the postseason, leading a comeback in Arrowhead Stadium to win the AFC Championship game and take the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl. That was three years ago. 

The Bengals have missed the playoffs in back-to-back years, but that hasn't been Burrow's fault. Burrow has completed 69.2% of his passes and thrown 58 touchdowns to just 15 interceptions over the past two seasons. He's third in the league in completion rate, fourth in touchdown passes, fifth in touchdown rate (5.7%), and fourth in passer rating (102.2).

The 2024 Bengals allowed the most points per game in losses in NFL history (27.8), and had six losses with 25+ points last season. Burrow was the third quarterback in league history with 40+ passing touchdowns in a season (43) who missed the playoffs while leading the league with 4,918 passing yards. 

So why is there pressure on Burrow? The Bengals need Burrow to perform at a high level every week to win games, and lose games when Burrow is just ""good."" Burrow has a loaded group of pass catchers, but a poor offensive line and a bad defense. He has to play excellent in order for the Bengals to win football games. 

Perhaps if the Bengals get their roster construction figured out, Burrow can make deep playoff runs again. His quarterback success will be skewed until that's figured out. 

Jared Goff is certainly a good quarterback, and found a home as the franchise quarterback in Detroit. Over the last two seasons, the Lions are 27-7 in Goff's starts as Goff has thrown 67 touchdown passes to 24 interceptions. Of quarterbacks with 500+ pass attempts over the last two seasons, Goff is second in completion percentage (69.7%), first in passing yards (9,204), second in touchdown passes, fourth in touchdown rate (5.9%), and second in passer rating (104.4). 

The Lions have reached at least the divisional round of the playoffs over the last two seasons, yet Goff's completion percentage (66.2%), touchdown rate (3.3%), yards per attempt (7.6), and passer rating (91.8) have all declined. The Lions also were the first team in NFL history to lose consecutive playoff games while scoring 30+ points. 

Goff is the third quarterback to win 13+ games in a season for two different teams (Brady, Peyton Manning) yet is just 4-5 in the playoffs while completing 61.2% of his passes with an 85.1 passer rating. Can Goff perform well enough in the playoffs to win a championship? 

The Lions are in ""win-now"" mode, and have an excellent chance to win the Super Bowl in 2025. There's a lot of pressure for Goff to exercise his playoff demons and get Detroit to the Super Bowl, especially for a franchise that has never been to the Super Bowl. 

Outside of an MVP award, Dak Prescott has accomplished nearly everything a quarterback could accomplish in the regular season. He's won a Rookie of the Year award, been an MVP runner-up, was selected to an All-Pro team, and won multiple division titles. The Cowboys are 76-46 in Prescott's starts and never had a losing season in which Prescott has started 10+ games. 

For all the regular-season success Prescott has, that doesn't seem to translate to the playoffs. Prescott is 2-5 in his postseason career, tied for the worst postseason record for any quarterback who has made a minimum of five playoff starts. He still hasn't made a conference championship game in his 10 seasons in the league, despite quarterbacking a team that has won 12+ games in four of the five times he has made the postseason.

Prescott's two playoff wins were against teams with a combined 18-15 record (.545 win percentage). His playoff losses are against teams with a combined 57-27 record (.679), three of which were at home. The Cowboys are 5-13 in the playoffs since winning their last Super Bowl in the 1995 season and have the NFL record for most consecutive playoff appearances without reaching a conference championship game (12). 

Prescott is turning 32 this year. The clock is ticking on him delivering a championship to Dallas, no matter how good or bad the roster is around him. 

There's no denying how good Lamar Jackson is in the regular season, as his two MVP awards are a clear indication of his success. Jackson has one of the best win percentages in the regular season since the 1970 merger (third at .745) and is the youngest quarterback to win two MVP awards. 

Jackson was the first player with 40+ passing touchdowns and fewer than five interceptions in a season last year. He's the first quarterback in NFL history with 4,000+ yards passing and 800+ yards rushing in a season and is the first player to lead qualified quarterbacks in the NFL in passer rating (119.4) and rushing yards (915) in a season.

The NFL's all-time rushing yards leader for quarterbacks (6,173), Jackson is the only player with multiple MVP awards who doesn't have a championship. His struggles in the postseason are well known, as Jackson is 3-5 with 13 total touchdowns and 11 turnovers in his playoff career.

Jackson's .745 win percentage is the best ever by a quarterback without a Super Bowl title, as he has multiple turnovers in four of eight playoff games. He's the only multiple-time MVP quarterback with a losing record in the playoffs, as the Ravens average 18.6 points per game in Jackson's starts in the playoffs compared to 28.7 in the regular season. 

The Ravens have only been to one conference championship game in the Jackson era, as Jackson has never had a season with multiple playoff wins. For as good as Jackson and the Ravens have been in the regular season, the opposite has happened in the playoffs. 

Baltimore has 78 wins over the last seven seasons, the most for any team without a Super Bowl appearance in NFL history. The pressure will always be on Jackson until he can lead the Ravens to a Super Bowl. 

How close does Josh Allen have to get to win a Super Bowl? For as good as Allen has been in the playoffs, he still hasn't been able to defeat Mahomes and the Chiefs. Allen actually has a winning record in the playoffs (7-6) with 33 total touchdowns to just six turnovers. Over his last five playoff games, Allen has 13 total touchdowns to zero turnovers.

The postseason success doesn't stop there. Allen is the all-time playoff leader in interception rate (0.9%), touchdown-to-interception ratio (25-4), total yards per game (311.0), and total touchdowns per game (2.5). He's the only player to average 250 passing yards and 50 rushing yards per game in playoff history. 

Allen has the most total touchdowns in a player's first seven seasons (262) in NFL history and has three postseasons with having 6+ total touchdowns and zero interceptions without making the Super Bowl. The Bills have scored the most points per game (29.1) and allowed the fewest points per game (19.6) over the last five years -- and haven't made the Super Bowl.

So why is there so much pressure on Allen? The Bills can't get past the Chiefs in the playoffs, no matter how well Allen plays. There are other factors outside of Allen, who has the most playoff wins without reaching a Super Bowl (seven). The Bills just can't get out of their own way, and that includes Allen failing to convert a quarterback sneak on a ""Tush Push"" on fourth down in a conference championship game. 

Allen is a great quarterback and has all the intangibles to win a Super Bowl. Since the Bills can't beat the Chiefs in the playoffs (where Allen is 0-4 against Mahomes), the pressure is constantly on Allen and Buffalo to win that elusive first Super Bowl title. 

Allen has put the Bills in position to win a championship. Once Buffalo gets past Kansas City, the Bills may be on their way toward finally hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy. There's so much pressure on Allen when he plays the Chiefs, which is why he's under more pressure than any quarterback to win in 2025.

The days are warmer, the sunlight lasts a little longer and baseball is here. Hope springs eternal, but that shouldn't just apply to baseball. We're looking at reasons for each NHL team to be hopeful in this edition of NHL Power Rankings.

For MLB fans watching their favorite team's season get underway, the crushing reality that it will almost certainly end without a World Series hasn't set in yet. The same can't be said for NHL fans with just a dozen games left in the regular season, but that doesn't mean we can't mine a little hope out of even the worst circumstances.

One team not lacking hope these days is the St. Louis Blues. They've won seven games in a row and have pulled within two spots of the first wild card spot in the West. This turnaround, which began under new coach Jim Montgomery, has been fueled by elite defense. That's not something I expected to type about this Blues team, but I can't deny the results.

Since Montgomery made his debut on Nov. 25, St. Louis has allowed expected goals against at the lowest rate in the NHL, per Natural Stat Trick. In the month of March, the Blues have allowed two or fewer goals in nine of their 13 games. That has powered the hot streak that has the team looking incredibly dangerous with the playoffs just a few weeks away.

As the Blues build hope for another surprising Cup run, here are the updated NHL Power Rankings with one reason every team should feel hopeful.

CFL's Roughriders reportedly add former 49ers, Cowboys QB to 2025 negotiation list","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/whats-next-for-trey-lance-cfls-roughriders-reportedly-add-former-49ers-cowboys-qb-to-2025-negotiation-list/","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 14:06:36 GMT","

Four years after he was the No. 3 overall pick in the NFL Draft, Trey Lance is without a team, drawing little interest as a free agent this offseason. An opportunity awaits the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback across the border, however, as the Canadian Football League's Saskatchewan Roughriders added Lance to their negotiation list this week, according to TSN.

The move gives the Roughriders exclusive rights to negotiate a prospective contract with Lance, provided the former North Dakota State standout is interested. CFL teams are permitted to name up to 45 players to the negotiating list, and each of those players are eligible to negotiate a contract as long as they aren't currently under contract with another team or league. In Lance's case, as a free agent, he could sign with the Roughriders immediately, if he so desired.

Last seen as the Dallas Cowboys' No. 3 quarterback, Lance does have family ties to the Roughriders. His father, Carlton, once played one season as a cornerback for Saskatchewan, earning CFL All-Rookie honors.

Trey Lance, meanwhile, has gone from potential face of the 49ers to afterthought backup in his young NFL career. San Francisco traded up to select him in 2021, tabbing him the successor to Jimmy Garoppolo, but injuries limited the Minnesota native to eight games over his first two seasons. He was then traded to the Cowboys after Brock Purdy's emergence as the 49ers' unlikely starter, spending the last two years behind both Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush in Dallas, where he appeared in just four total games.

Xavier athletic director Greg Christopher flew to New Mexico on Tuesday to try and convince Lobos men's basketball coach Richard Pitino to be the next coach of the Musketeers.

He got it done.

On Tuesday night Pitino accepted, sources told CBS Sports. 

Xavier announced the deal late Tuesday night.

""Xavier is one of the great brands in all of college basketball,"" Pitino said in a statement. ""It has always been a dream of mine to coach in the Big East. The Cintas Center is going to be rocking. I can't wait to get to work.""

The six-year deal came together over the course of the day, and Pitino was wooed to the gig despite being in contact with VCU, Villanova and West Virginia in recent days, according to sources. In fact, VCU had Pitino at the top of its list. Once Pitino turned down VCU, that program pivoted and is hiring Bryant's Phil Martelli Jr., sources told CBS Sports.

Richard Pitino will now coach in the same league as his father, Rick, who will be in Year 3 next season at St. John's. Both were knocked out of the second round of the NCAA Tournament on consecutive nights this past weekend, but they made history by becoming the first father and son to win tourney games in the same season. 

Sources said that Rick and Richard will welcome the rare opportunity to coach against each other. That's backed by the fact that the two scheduled a game at Madison Square Garden this past season, with St. John's beating New Mexico 85-71.

In 13 seasons as a Division I coach, Pitino's career record is 247-186.

Pitino is succeeding Sean Miller, who abruptly left Xavier for a second time, opting to take the Texas job on Sunday. That came with a lot of blowback.

Sources said the circumstances surrounding Miller's messy exit wound up affecting Charleston coach Chris Mack's candidacy. He would have been a two-time hire at the school, just like Miller was when he was brought back in 2022. But unlike Miller, Mack spent nearly two decades of his life at Xavier -- and is the winningest coach in program history.

""Poorly handled,"" said one connected source to Miller's departure.

It's the first time in generations Xavier has made a hire in men's basketball that didn't have a direct connection to the university. 

Pitino went at 88-49 in the Mountain West while at New Mexico and participated in the past two NCAA Tournaments. As a No. 10 seed, the Lobos upset Marquette in the first round before losing to second-seeded Michigan State 71-63 on Sunday. He previously coached at FIU and Minnesota, spending eight years at the latter and taking the program to NCAAs in 2017, when he earned Big Ten Coach of the Year honors, and in 2019. 

Pitino was fired by Minnesota after the 2020-21 season but quickly resurfaced at New Mexico. The Lobos were 13-19 in his first season before winning a combined 75 games over the last three seasons. Under his watch, UNM won the Mountain West tournament title in 2024 and won the league's regular season crown this year, led by Mountain West Player of the Year Donovan Dent.

Hours before Pitino's commitment to Xavier, Dent went into the transfer portal. It's to-be-determined whether or not one of the best guards in college basketball will follow his coach to the Big East.

Milwaukee Bucks star Damian Lillard has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf, the team announced on Tuesday. He has been ruled out indefinitely and has been put on blood-thinning medication, which the Bucks say has stabilized the DVT as he begins the process for ""a healthy return to play."" 

He will continue to be tested regularly, the team said, and there is cautious optimism in Milwaukee that Lillard might be able to return this season, league sources told CBS Sports NBA insider Bill Reiter. 

""Damian's health is our No. 1 priority,"" Bucks general manager Jon Horst said in a statement. ""We will support him as he moves through this weekly process of strict criteria to ensure that it is safe for him to return to play. Doctors have indicated that his situation is very unlikely to occur again. We are thankful that this was identified and medicated quickly, which helps with the recovery.""

Lillard, who is averaging 24.9 points and 7.1 assists per game, gave a statement of his own to NBA reporter Chris Haynes:

""It's unfortunate that something outside of my control would come up,"" he said. ""Along with the Bucks' medical staff, our priorities are to protect my health and safety. As much as I love basketball, I need to be there for my kids and my family. I'm grateful the Bucks acted quickly on this. They've been supportive and proactive throughout this process. I look forward to moving past this and continuing my career.""

Lillard is the second NBA All-Star to be diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis this season, joining Spurs star Victor Wembanyama. Wembanyama was ruled out for the season on Feb. 20. 

Lillard, 34, has missed the Bucks' last three games, including being listed as out with a right calf strain for Monday night's loss to the Suns. While sidelined, he underwent imaging on the calf but nothing had shown up. At that point, Lillard, a nine-time All-Star, was understandably frustrated with not being able to identify the root of a lingering problem. 

""It's been frustrating just obviously not being able to play this point in the season, but just trying to learn more,"" he said Monday, via the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. 

Now, after further testing revealed a blood clot, Lillard finally has clarity on what he's dealing with and can take the necessary steps to regain his health. The best news is the belief that this is unlikely to occur again. It's a serious situation, no doubt, but for now at least it doesn't sound like one that could jeopardize Lillard's career. 

However, Lillard's absence is a blow for the Bucks as they jockey for postseason positioning with 11 games remaining in the regular season. After Monday's loss, the Bucks fell to 40-31. They currently are two games behind the Pacers (42-29) for the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference and a half-game ahead of the Pistons (40-32) for the No. 5 seed.

The New England Patriots struggled in 2024, finishing the season 4-13 with major issues on both sides of the ball. They did, however, have a few bright spots that gave the team some hope for the future. 

One of those bright spots was quarterback Drake Maye, the team's No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, who moved up from QB2 to starter in his rookie year. Maye's potential was noticed by Mike Vrabel, so much so that the QB became one of the reasons the former Patriots linebacker chose to reunite with his old team as its new head coach.

The New England fan favorite gave some insight on why his one-year hiatus from being a head coach ended in Foxborough. 

""I see a young, athletic, talented, full-of-potential player,"" Vrabel said on OutKick's Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich. ""Excited to build this team around (him) and a large part of the reason why I wanted to be here. And just that talent level, to be able to build around him and to be able to grow and help him and lead and run an offense and run a football team is something that I'm excited about.""

Vrabel had high praise from what he saw from Maye in Year 1. The 22-year-old finished with 2,276 yards, 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions as well as 421 yards rushing, third on the team, and two TDs on the ground in 13 games, with 12 starts. Despite having an offensive line with little consistency and no star wideouts to throw to, Maye was able to prove he can make smart decisions with the ball.

Vrabel liked that if the call doesn't go as planned, Maye has the ability to use his legs to extend the play. The Patriots new head coach does not feel like he will have to limit the playbook with Maye leading the offense. 

""He can throw from in the pocket, he can throw off platform, he can run, he can scramble,"" Vrabel said, discussing his quarterback. ""You can design some things for him. So I think you have pretty much everything in the playbook that you could possibly want available. He's not just a pocket passer. He's not just a guy that's going to run. So there's a lot of different ways that we're hoping that he can be successful.""

After Jerod Mayo was fired following one year on the job, the search began for the next head coach and Vrabel was rumored during the entire search to be high on New England's list of choices. Thanks in part to Maye, the Pats got the guy they wanted.

The Patriots added some pieces during the offseason, which should only boost Maye's potential. This week, the team landed wide receiver Stefon Diggs. His veteran presence should have a significant impact on an offense that looked deflated in 2024. 

The Patriots also still have the draft to help them piece together a winning team and they currently sit at No. 4 overall. The Patriots have historically not found as much success as other teams in the draft, but their approach this year has changed.

New England executive vice president of player personnel Eliot Wolf says rather than going for what the team needs, they will select the best player available.

This will not be Vrabel's first draft experience as a head coach. He was the Tennessee Titans lead man from 2018 to 2023. Vrabel has already helped the Patriots make some much needed moves in the offseason and now all eyes will be on him to see who the team will select with its top five pick.

Well, we've hit the George Costanza portion of the coaching carousel. 

By that I mean:

Tuesday night brought a quicker-than-expected development: Xavier was able to hire New Mexico coach Richard Pitino. The deal got done in Albuquerque on Tuesday night and it's for six years. That means Pitino will coach against his father, Rick, twice a season (at least). Pitino beat out Charleston coach Chris Mack for the opening, passing on potential opportunities at Villanova, VCU and West Virginia in the process. 

VCU moved extremely quickly once Pitino was off the table; 43-year-old Bryant coach Phil Martelli Jr. will be leaving Rhode Island to head down to Richmond, Virginia, to coach the Rams on a six-year deal.

Previously ...

Sean Miller left Xavier to be the coach at Texas. It's a move that shocked — and angered — people at Xavier (understandably so). Miller was there for three seasons, took the Musketeers to two NCAA Tournaments and decided to bolt for Austin, Texas, and the promise of a bigger program in a bigger league with bigger money. Xavier was left to scramble and hire a coach just as the portal opens. 

What's more, Josh Pastner agreed Monday night to be the next coach at UNLV, per sources. Pastner coveted the job from the moment it opened and was able to break through a long list of candidates interviewed there. He'll have a five-year deal and the press conference will be Wednesday. Pastner's career record is 276-187. He spent the past two seasons working in television, but I spoke to Pastner as recently as February and he told me then he was eager and wanting to get back into coaching this cycle. UNLV was for sure the best job opportunity available to him. 

It's entirely possible we'll have one or two more job swaps before the Sweet 16 gets going again Thursday night, so that in mind, here are the other recent hirings ... which also prompted job openings. 

» Ben McCollum leaves Drake after one year to run Iowa» Niko Medved goes home to guide Minnesota» VCU's Ryan Odom is now at Virginia» Will Wade is on the ground at NC State

I've got more in the capsules below, including other hirings that are now a week-plus old.

As we told ya earlier this week, we'd hit 40 coaching flips before the tournament revved up again. And so it is. Check in all of them below.

The 2025 MLB season is upon us, and that means beautiful days and nights at the ballpark featuring delicious eats. While it's hard to beat the classics, this season will feature some wild snacks that fans can really sink their teeth into.

MLB teams are always trying to give fans more reasons to come out to the park and spend their hard-earned money at the concession stand. This year is no different with many teams introducing some fun, unique and weird menu items.

In many cases, teams have taken those classic ballpark foods like hot dogs, fries and burgers and put a fresh spin on them, for better or worse. How about a footlong hotdog smothered in mac and cheese? Maybe a dessert quesadilla will catch your eye on the concourse. Whether you prefer sweet or savory flavors, there are foods on this list for you.

Before the first pitches are thrown, let's look at the 10 wildest new menu items at MLB ballparks in 2025.

The Diamondbacks decided to throw a bunch of random ingredients on cajun fries, and there have been worse culinary ideas. Between the white cheddar mac and cheese, the pork belly bacon and the crispy onions, there is a lot to like about this very chaotic dish. Plus, any D-backs fan who shows up hungry won't need to eat for a week after taking these down.

An homage to its Polish Hill community, the Pirates are offering some unique local flair at PNC Park. Pirates fans can enjoy these fried balls full of egg noodles, kielbasa, cabbage, bacon and cheddar cheese. These sound delicious, and they're a nice handheld snack to eat at your seat.

This one is like a ""Man vs. Food"" challenge, except you can eat it while watching one of the most exciting teams in baseball. Fans better bring their appetite for this burger, which features two beef patties, queso and fried onions all in the same bite. Oh, and did I mention the pretzel bun? Anyone who gets this down in nine innings deserves an award.

New massive White Sox milkshake just dropped 👀Introducing the Celebration Cake Shake 🎂Made with Birthday Cake ice cream, confetti cake, a pinwheel cookie and a maraschino cherry(via @whitesox) pic.twitter.com/zkGE271Mxf

The White Sox are celebrating their 125th anniversary this year, and that might be all the celebrating that happens at Rate Field this season. In honor of their birthday, the White Sox are selling some birthday cake and ice cream -- just blended up and served in a cup with cake chunks and a cookie. This is one of the more indulgent items on the list, and it has my interest.

This footlong ballpark dog is topped with a few different appetizers one might order at your local BBQ joint. The Daddy Mac Dog also features brisket, mac and cheese and fried pickles. Eating this hotdog is probably a two- or three-person mission.

A whoopie pie is a classic treat, and the Royals have put their own spin on it this year. There will be no missing these when fans are snacking on these in the stands. No word yet on whether Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern were involved in creating this odd ballpark dessert.

The Yankees will have tiramisu helmets at games this year 🤤Made with espresso mascarpone cream, lady finger cookies, cocoa powder pic.twitter.com/ikvquRbfYZ

If you've ever been eating ice cream out of a novelty helmet on a hot summer day, you know that it can sometimes turn to soup before you even get it back to your seat. Well, the Yankees have solved that problem with Helmet Tiramisu. Fans still get their souvenir helmet, but they don't have to worry about dessert turning to liquid in 60 seconds.

Have you ever wanted to make s'mores at a baseball game but local regulations banned open flames at the ballpark? The Phillies have found a loophole with their new S'mores Quesadillas, which are actually pretty brilliant. You can get all that delicious s'mores flavor without worrying about a melted chocolate bar dripping onto your new Bryce Harper jersey.

Sometimes corndogs just look a little too appealing, you know? The Mariners have invented a corndog that will make hungry fans think twice, but once you get past the color, it does sound rather appealing. This corndog of a different color is honey-battered and covered in a spicy, crunchy coating.

Who's up for cotton candy fries at #BlueJays games this year? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/BTQqPvEcI9

Sweet and savory almost always go together, but the Blue Jays will be pushing those limits at Rogers Centre in 2025. These Cotton Candy Fries combine a pair of stadium classics and cover them in a blue sauce. If nothing else, these will be quite popular with the morbidly curious. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.

Jimmy Butler played the classic ""this is just another game"" card before his return to Miami in a Warriors uniform on Tuesday night, but rest assured, scoring 11 points in a 26-point Golden State loss was definitely not what he had in mind. 

You can also be sure that the Heat playing like this wasn't an accident. They came in having lost 10 of their last 11 and suddenly looked reinvigorated. Butler, who was honored before the game with a tribute video and drew a lukewarm reaction from a mostly indifferent, late-arriving Miami crowd, definitely brought it out in his former team. 

Bam Adebayo barely waited one minute before dunking on Butler.

As for his current team, the Warriors have lost two straight without Stephen Curry, who is on the mend after a hard fall last week, to effectively fall back below the playoff line. Yes, the standings show them ahead of the Clippers for the No. 6 seed, but they're tied in the loss column and L.A. owns the tiebreaker. 

The good news for the Warriors is they have two days off and are expected to get Curry back on Friday when they play at New Orleans, which should be a win. Then they play the Spurs, which should be another win. But these losses are huge as the Warriors walk the very fine line between banking a playoff spot and having to win their way in, which wouldn't be a lock. 

In a one-game scenario, anything can happen. They'd get the Timberwolves in the 7-8 matchup if the season ended today, and Minnesota, a conference finalist last season that has one of the league's seven or eight best players in Anthony Edwards and has gotten solid play of late from Julius Randle, would be a real test. If they were to lose that, they would play ether Sacramento or Phoenix in a one-and-done situation. Even if they won that, they would match up with the No. 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round. 

This is not a scenario that Golden State wants to flirt with, and it looked like they were steaming toward a sure playoff spot with 15 wins in their first 18 games with Butler on board. But they've slipped. They took a terrible loss against Denver, which was playing without Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray and Christian Braun, and now the Hawks and Heat have outscored them by 35 points. 

Butler has been mostly great for the Warriors, though a little frustrating in his inability, or at times unwillingness, to finish at the rim. He's been a connector and stabilizer and has given the Warriors what could potentially be a season-changing free-throw threat. But overall, he's been relatively passive as a scorer. He scored two points in the first half on Tuesday. By the time he got even a little aggressive, the Warriors were down 17 at the break, and he didn't score a single fourth-quarter point before he was pulled for good with seven minutes and change to go.

There's a methodical element to Butler's game to appreciate, but it can slip into malaise. Even when he catches deep he's at times pump-faking to a fault and has lacked any semblance of vertical explosion on attempts such as this one on Tuesday, which was batted away by Kel'el Ware.

All of this said, Butler was never supposed to be the go-to guy for this Warriors team. He's shown he can be a star in a secondary role to Curry, and the hope is that Playoff Jimmy is still in there somewhere, because there will probably come a point in the postseason when Golden State will need him to truly take over. 

But for this one night in Miami, Butler, whose passivity (and Adebayo's defense) was perhaps most evident in his one free-throw attempt, didn't have it. And by extension, neither did the Warriors.

Iga Swiatek has gone on to reach the Miami Open quarter-finals following the incident

Five-time major champion Iga Swiatek is being protected by increased security after an ""aggressive and taunting"" fan verbally abused her at the Miami Open.

Swiatek, 23, was targeted by the man in a practice session on Saturday.

It is believed the man shouted personal insults about Swiatek's family.

The world number two's representatives told BBC Sport the man had previously sent abusive online messages to her through social media.

""The Miami incident appears to be a direct transition from verbal aggression online to harassment in the real world,"" the Polish player's team said.

""He was aggressive and taunting.""

Swiatek's representatives added the incident was immediately reported to tournament organisers.

Her experience comes a month after Britain's Emma Raducanu was targeted by a stalker at the Dubai Tennis Championships.

'Every woman has fear' - why risks facing female athletes remain

Swiatek recently spoke out about the emotional toll she has faced in recent months, having served a one-month ban for a doping offence and not wanting to ""step on the court"".

Since the incident at the weekend, the second seed has gone on to reach the Miami Open quarter-finals, where she faces Filipino teenager Alexandra Eala on Wednesday.

""Security is a top priority. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues,"" her spokesperson said.

""Constructive criticism is one thing, and threats, hate speech or even disturbance during training is another - this cannot be condoned.""

Tournament organisers and the WTA are said to have reacted quickly, putting extra security measures in place around the former long-time world number one.

Miami Open organisers told BBC Sport the safety and security of everyone at the tournament is treated ""extremely seriously"".

""We constantly evaluate any potential threats and take every measure to respond appropriately,"" they said in a statement.

Those comments were echoed by the WTA, who said ""comprehensive"" security protocols are in place to ensure any incidents are dealt with ""promptly and effectively"".

""The details of these are not something we discuss publicly, but we are steadfast in our commitment to maintaining a safe environment for players and everyone attending one of our events,"" said the WTA.

Swiatek's experience is the latest incident involving a WTA player, providing a stark reminder of the dangers faced by female athletes on a regular basis.

Raducanu, 22, recoiled in horror when she saw a man - who she had already reported for what was described as ""exhibiting fixated behaviour"" - in the stands of her match in Dubai last month.

Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the Women in Sport charity, told BBC Sport that ""every single woman has a level of fear"".

Alex de Minaur has suffered another disappointing defeat after crashing out in the fourth round of the Miami Open, in what many tennis fans described as an epic ""choke"" against Italy's Matteo Berrettini. The Aussie World No.11 had a number of golden opportunities to send the match into a deciding third set, but came up short on every occasion in the 6-3 7-6 (9-7) defeat.

The 10th seed will be filthy with himself after being unable to covert any of the six set points he held against the former Wimbledon finalist, who fought back superbly to book his spot in the quarter-finals of the Masters 1000 event. Less than 24 hours after his superb comeback win against Joao Fonseca, the Aussie started off sluggishly and dropped the opening stanza in Miami.

But de Minaur looked on track to launch a trademark fightback after leading the Italian 5-4 in the second. He then jumped out to a 0-40 lead on Berrettini's serve but wasn't able to take any of those break point opportunities as the former World No.6 staved off the three set points, before eventually holding serve. The writing looked to be on the wall for the Australian when he was broken the very next game and the big-hitting Berrettini was left to serve for the match.

However, the Italian was unable to convert three match points as de Minaur's never-say-die attitude came to the fore and the Aussie forced the second set into a tiebreak. The momentum seemed to have completely shifted the Demon's way as the World No.11 raced ahead to set up another three set points in the breaker.

But once again Berrettini fought back and saved all three after winning seven straight points, before clinching victory on his second match point to leave de Minaur gutted. The heartbreaking defeat denied de Minaur a tour-best 18th win of the year.

While that shows the Aussie is consistently progressing to at least the last-16 in most tournaments, his inability to go deeper at the biggest events has once again been brutally exposed. And de Minaur was shown little mercy from tennis fans on social media, who were left gobsmacked by the Aussie's huge ""choke"".

De minaur might have had the biggest choke I've ever seen on this set. Not once, but twice.

— Shore (@Shore8550) March 26, 2025

How de Minaur choked that 2nd set needs to be studied man. He had like 5-6 set points 😂

— The New Kid 😈 (@PicksGoDiff) March 26, 2025

Big loss for De Minaur - wasted a lot of set points..gifted them away with UEs mostly. Love his game - but, I don't see him winning anything big. Golden opportunity in Miami and in S1, he just looked flat and that he'd rather be somewhere else. Bit like his R4 in Indian Wells.

— Nicky (@Nic_nac78) March 26, 2025

What a choke De Minaur

— Tennis Tipster🎾 (@TennisTipster05) March 26, 2025

De Minaur is the definition of solid floor, low ceiling. Has only made it past the QF at big events 1 time in his career.

— NotLite (@NotLite_03) March 26, 2025

De Minaur's sad exit ended any hopes of an all-Australian quarter-final with Adam Walton, but the qualifying lucky loser went down to third seed Taylor Fritz 6-3 7-5 later in the day anyway. Six-time Miami champion Novak Djokovic ousted Berrettini's compatriot Lorenzo Musetti 6-2 6-2 to march to within three wins of a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 crown.

The 37-year-old Serbian superstar also edged to within three victories of a milestone 100th tour-level title in a statement showing in front of Serena Williams and Juan Martin del Potro, who watched from Djokovic's courtside box.

""I was starstruck,"" fourth seed Djokovic said afterwards. ""It was amazing to see first 'DelPo', obviously a long-time friend and a rival, so happy to have him around and get his support from the box. It was amazing, the first time to have DelPo in the box, so I want to thank him really for coming.

""And Serena, that was a surprise. I didn't know. Actually, when I had that down-the-line passing shot, I pointed to her and asked her whether it was okay. She kind of said, 'Yeah, it was fine'. If Serena says it was fine, then it was amazing by everyone else's standards. So yeah, great to have them.""

Djokovic next faces American Sebastian Korda, who beat France's Gael Monfils 6-4 2-6 6-4. Elsewhere, Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo upset three-time major finalist Casper Ruud 6-4 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals for the third time in four years. That set up a quarter-final showdown against World No.15 Grigor Dimitrov, who defeated local hope Brandon Nakashima 6-4 7-5.

The Irrational‘s Alec and Rose were in a good place during the season 2 finale — but what does that last-second reveal mean for the future of the show?

During the Tuesday, March 25, finale, Rose (Karen David) revealed to Alec (Jesse L. Martin) that she was setting down roots by opening a consulting office. The fictional couple didn't have long to enjoy the relationship milestone after Alec received text messages from someone who was stalking him.

“I can't predict anything in scripted television because you never know what's gonna actually happen,” Martin, 56, exclusively told Us Weekly about the twist and how it could potentially impact Alec moving forward. “What I did hope was that it did continue with Karen's character.”

Martin was thrilled to see how season 3 would pick up with Alec and Rose solving the case, adding, “I absolutely adore working with Karen. She's a fantastic actor and a fantastic person. So luckily that's what it feels like [would happen next].”



David, 45, told Us she was on exactly the same page as Martin.

“We have so much fun together. Every day on set with Jesse is just pure joy. I just feel so blessed that this is the way we get to pay our bills by telling these interesting stories and solving very unique cases from a very different perspective,” she gushed. “It warms my heart that a lot of people watching the show can see that.”

The actress is grateful for the chance to share the screen with Martin, saying, “We just connect. We work so well together and coming into the show as Rose, you just can only hope and pray that, ‘Oh, I hope he likes me. I hope everyone likes me.' It's nerve-wracking.”

Based on the 2008 non-fiction book Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions, The Irrational takes inspiration from the life of Dan Ariely. Martin plays Alec a.k.a a world-renowned expert in behavioral science whose interest in the field started after a traumatic bombing.

Rose, meanwhile, is a crisis management professional and former spy. Her work allowed her to cross paths with Alec, which paved the way for their long-lasting romance. Despite not knowing where the story goes next, Martin and David are thrilled to see their characters tackle it together.

“You just don't know what's going to happen,” David added. “If there's any magic, it happens in the spontaneity of that moment when you are on set and they call action. It truly was a supernova just working with someone like Jesse. His enthusiasm, his kindness and his talent … It is just so wonderful to play opposite him.”

David noted that not all fictional TV couples are about to “navigate really dangerous situations,” telling Us, “Most couples don't normally go through [that], which makes it so humbling and interesting to watch them as they do.”

She concluded: “But [it is also] quite interesting to see how they navigate through very simple things. Because simple things for them are quite challenging given what they do for work. But when it comes to the simple things of navigating through a relationship, that becomes so much more heightened.”

All episodes of The Irrational are available to stream on Peacock.

Malcolm in the Middle is returning without Erik Per Sullivan — but where is the former child star now?

After Disney+ picked up a revival series for Malcolm in the Middle, Variety confirmed on Tuesday, March 25, that Per Sullivan, 33, would be recast. His character Dewey will be played by Caleb Ellsworth-Clark, who is taking over the role for the four-episode special.

The rest of the cast including Frankie Muniz, Bryan Cranston, Jane Kaczmarek, Christopher Masterson and Justin Berfield are expected to reprise their respective characters. In addition to the main cast, Kiana Madeira, Anthony Timpano, Vaughan Murrae and Keeley Karsten have been cast in key roles as well.

“25 years since we premiered Malcolm in the Middle. I'm so excited… that I may have peed just a little bit,” Cranston and Kaczmarek said in a December 2024 announcement post. “What a delight that I get to yell at that kid again! We're very, very excited about coming back together and seeing what this family has been up to.”



The revival will be written by Linwood Boomer, who created the original series. It will chronicle Malcolm (Muniz) and his daughter as they are “drawn into the family's chaos when Hal (Cranston) and Lois (Kaczmarek) demand his presence for their 40th wedding anniversary party,” according to a press release.

“Malcolm in the Middle is a landmark sitcom that captured the essence of family life with humor, heart and relatability,” President of Disney Branded Television Ayo Davis said in a statement. “Its hilarious and heartfelt portrayal of a lovably chaotic family resonated with audiences of all ages, and we're so excited to welcome the original cast back to bring that magic to life again. With Linwood Boomer and the creative team at the helm, these new episodes will have all the laughs, pranks, and mayhem fans loved — along with a few surprises that remind us why this show is so timeless.”

Meanwhile, President of 20th Television Karey Burke released a statement as well, which read, “Malcolm in the Middle literally changed the face of the television comedy landscape when it premiered two decades ago, redefining what the genre could be. When Linwood Boomer suggested it might be time to bring everyone's favorite dysfunctional family back for a bit of a reunion, we couldn't think of a more iconic and influential series to revisit, along with a truly brilliant cast to reunite.”

Per Sullivan's absence doesn't come as a surprise. He rose to stardom playing Dewey on Malcolm in the Middle, which ran from 2000 to 2006. Per Sullivan appeared on Come on Over, Arthur and the Invisibles and Twelve.

The now-former actor officially retired in 2010 and hasn't participated in any of the show's reunions over the years. Kaczmarek, who played Per Sullivan's onscreen mother, shared an update in 2024 during an interview, saying, “I admire it because so many people think being in show business is the greatest thing in the world. It's not for everyone.”

Kaczmarek revealed that Per Sullivan retired from acting because he was no longer interested in the profession. He is currently a student at “a very prestigious American university” and pursuing a degree in Victorian literature.

As Emma Kenney prepares to wrap up her journey on The Conners, she isn't ruling out any potential projects — including a possible onscreen reunion with former Shameless costar Steve Howey.

During an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Kenney, 25, said she “would love to work” with Howey again after they both made guest appearances on Happy's Place episodes apart.

“I love him. He's so much fun. He's so funny. And he's always been a safe place on set for me,” Kenney noted. “I've known him for so long ago and he is so wonderful. I honestly have to say the whole [Shameless cast] was quite a safe place for me.”

Kenney rose to stardom playing Debbie Gallagher on the Showtime hit. The series, which ran for 11 seasons, focused on the Gallagher family as they dealt with their father's alcoholism, poverty, affairs, crimes and scams while living in the South Side of Chicago. Shameless also starred Howey, 47, William H. Macy, Emmy Rossum, Jeremy Allen White, Shanola Hampton, Cameron Monaghan, Noel Fisher and more.



After moving on from Shameless, Kenney was cast as Harris during season 10 of Roseanne — and its spinoff The Conners. Kenney also recently made an appearance on NBC's Happy's Place, which previously reunited leads Reba McEntire and Melissa Peterman with their Reba costar Howey.

“It would be fun to do a meta moment between my character and Steve's character on Happy's Place. We actually did that on The Conners a couple years ago with Ethan Cutkosky and then William H. Macy joined for a couple of episodes,” Kenney recalled. “We had a little moment where he said to me on the show, ‘You look familiar.' So it was something kind of silly.”

Kenney got her start acting when she was just 9 years old. Being in the industry most of her life has allowed Kenney to become a household name — but not every person recognizes her for the same memorable role.

“Both [Shameless and The Conners] have gone on for such a long time and they've attracted different audiences. It depends where I'm at and what city I'm in. But I would say I get recognized the most for Shameless,” she shared with Us. “It went for so long and I grew up on that show. I think people can really relate to my character in a way and they feel like they know me. A lot of people will come up to me and want to give me a hug.”

Despite having consistent work for decades, Kenney is looking forward to simply taking a beat and considering what could end up being her next chapter.

“I've been working so consistently since I was 9 and this is the first time in my career and in my life that I've been able to take a step back and think about what's next for me. I really want to be intentional with my next role and my next project,” she explained. “I just want to explore a lot of different creative avenues, whether that's multicam again or movies or anything. I want to try it all. I'm definitely excited.”

Kenney has already ventured into animal advocacy with her foster-based rescue Yogi's House, telling Us, “It is probably the thing in my life that I'm most proud of. Ever since I've been a kid, I've always been super passionate about animal rescue and I always knew owning a dog rescue was going to be something I did one day. So to actually have it come to fruition and be something I'm doing every single day is such a dream come true.”

While the actress said Yogi's House— which she founded with Nicola Peltz-Beckham — is “a lot of work” it is also something Kenney is “so passionate about.”

“That is how I spend probably half of my day at least working on it,” Kenney continued. “I honestly feel like I'm getting a veterinary degree at this point because I deal with the foster vets every single day. I honestly feel I'm learning a lot about the medical side of raising dogs, which is really interesting and something that I would be interested in learning more about.”

She added: “Every single day something new comes up. It's a lot of people. I deal with a lot of people every single day and we create these relationships and we have such an amazing foster community and we really couldn't do the rescue without our fosters since we're foster-based. So I'm so grateful for every single volunteer that we've worked with. We could not do it without everyone.”

In addition to her dog rescue, Kenney is looking forward to seeing how The Conners comes to an end, saying, “This season definitely is going to hit home for a lot of people. There's humor always but also some really emotional moments that resolve a lot of story lines. It sets the rest of the characters up for their next chapter off camera ultimately.”

The Conners returns for its final season on ABC Wednesday, March 26 at 8 p.m. ET

On March 31, Searchlight Pictures' underrated black comedy The Menu will be leaving Netflix along with several other films. But this is the one you should catch before the end of the month, in part because it's probably going to stay with you for a while. Director Mark Mylod and screenwriters Seth Reiss and Will Tracy crafted a tale that has some horror elements, but it's more funny than scary.

The casting for the film is also impeccable, with Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy in the lead roles, with Nicholas Hoult, Hong Chau, Janet McTeer, Judith Light, and John Leguizamo rounding out the supporting cast. The story follows Taylor-Joy's Margot Mills on the trip of a lifetime to Hawthorne, one of the world's most exclusive restaurants on a remote island. But once Margot and her date arrive, she finds out that they may never be able to leave with their lives. And they aren't the only ones facing a dire fate.

But if you're looking for a more complete explanation about why The Menu is the one Netflix movie you can't miss in March, then keep reading.





Ralph Fiennes is a terrific villain in The Menu, in part because his character believes that he's justified in his actions. In his own way, Chef Julian Slowik can be just as intimidating as Fiennes' role as Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. However, Slowik has more nuance, even though he's also out of his mind.

Without giving too much away, the entire evening was orchestrated by Slowik and his followers, who carefully selected their guests. They're going to serve up more than a full-course meal for their patrons, and in Slowik's mind, they're all getting what they deserve.

More importantly, Slowik doesn't feel he's immune from retribution. He's one of the rare antagonists who is fully aware that what he has planned is brutal, and he's literally willing to suffer the same fate for his art. He's not just a parody of chef Gordon Ramsay. Instead, Slowik resembles a cult leader, and everyone follows his lead.



It's a plot point in the movie that Taylor-Joy's Margot doesn't belong with the rest of the patrons, and yet her presence is absolutely essential to the movie. She's the only one that the audience truly has any sympathy for, and as Slowik routinely demonstrates, she's also the only one there who isn't guilty of a crime, either against the law or of the heart.

Before the insanity begins, Margot shines because she isn't intimidated by Slowik and she's more than willing to call him out on the ridiculous things he does to his dishes. Margot won't even dignify those courses by describing them as appetizers or even food.

Unlike Taylor-Joy's leading character in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Margot has to use her mind and her wit as her weapons as she tries to make her way through the night.

The last 30 minutes are probably the most satisfying part of the movie. In real life, the rich and powerful rarely get justice for the things they've done or the people they've hurt. But in The Menu, the 1 percent are finally getting what's coming to them.

Not all of the characters necessarily deserve their fates, but there is a certain cathartic sensation when characters who have all of the money in the world can't use it to barter for their lives. Slowik and his followers are far beyond bargaining when this film begins, and it's going to be a bloody good time in Hawthorn for elevated horror and dark comedy fans alike.

NFL quarterback Russell Wilson signed with the New York Giants — and no one is more excited than his wife, Ciara.

Wilson, 36, celebrated the news via his Instagram Stories on Tuesday, March 25, writing, “Been here before … can't wait to do it again #MetLife @nygiants.”

Ciara, 39, reposted Wilson's message and a photo of the New Jersey stadium onto her page alongside a row of blue, white and red hearts in honor of the team's colors.

In a follow-up post, Ciara further celebrated Wilson's new job.



“New York state of mind!” she captioned a pic of the football star. “My greatest inspiration.”

Before joining the Giants, Wilson had notably played with the Seattle Seahawks from 2012 to 2021, the Denver Broncos from 2022 to 2023 and the Pittsburgh Steelers during the 2024-2025 season. Throughout his career, Ciara and their children have been his No. 1 cheerleaders.

Wilson and the “Goodies” singer have been married since 2016 and share three children: Sienna, 7, Win, 4, and Amora, 15 months. (Ciara is also mom to son Future, 10, with ex-fiancé Future.)

“I'm so proud of Russ,” Ciara gushed during a joint appearance on the “Not Just Football” podcast last month. “It's, kind of, crazy that this is his 10th Pro Bowl and he's one of 30 men to have that under his belt. I'm always just so proud of him. He works really hard, so he inspires me. He's my biggest inspiration.”

Ciara further revealed that she has “an incredible respect” for Wilson's career.

“I love it. I have an incredible respect for what he does [and] for what all you guys do,” she said. “I actually grew up watching football with my dad. … [We were] also just a fan of great talent. I wasn't so much locked [on] a team as a whole, like, I didn't grow up my whole life saying, ‘I like this one team.' I had an appreciation for the Jamal Anderson era because I'm from Atlanta … or Michael Vick, Deion Sanders, Troy Aikman — that was that whole squad over there — but then you had Jerry Rice on the West [Coast]. It was just so much goodness happening in football that I personally appreciate it.”

Now, naturally, Ciara counts Wilson as one of her favorite NFL athletes.

“He actually helped me with my nerves, kind of, early on because you feel like, ‘Woo' when you see someone on his back,” Ciara explained to podcast host and fellow athlete Cam Heyward. “I'm, like, I wish there was a way to be in the helmet, like, ‘Babe, he's right behind you.' But you can't do that. I feel like I'm connected to him, so whatever he goes through, I go through. We're an extension of you guys in some regard.”

After surviving one of Married at First Sight's most shocking scandals, David is ready to meet his girlfriend's dad.

During the Tuesday, March 25, episode of Lifetime's reality show, David, 37, decided to enjoy an evening out with his parents and his partner Madison, 31. Along for the ride, however, was Madison's dad, Mark.

“Mark the silver fox is coming in,” David shared in a confessional interview. “I'm a little nervous. It's the pops. That is your woman's father and you always want acceptance and you want to hear the affirmation that he has about our love.”

In the Married at First Sight: Where Are They Now? special, cameras rolled as Madison revealed to her dad for the first time that she had moved in with David.



“That was a little shocking,” he later shared in a private interview. “It's premature but the heart wants what it wants, and if you know, you know.”

As if he hadn't been through enough surprises, Mark proceeded to have a private conversation with David for the very first time.

“I just wanted to thank you for being an amazing father to Madison,” David began by saying. “She is the woman of my dreams and I wish she was the woman who walked down the aisle. Everything happens for a reason.”

During Season 18 of Married at First Sight, experts Dr. Pepper Schwartz, Pastor Cal Roberson and Dr. Pia Goff initially matched David up with Michelle while Madison was paired with Allen.

During the season, however, David and Madison developed feelings for each other and decided to divorce their partners before pursuing a romantic relationship after the show.

“We have talked about marriage,” David warned his possible future father-in-law. “That is something that will be coming down the line. I will be asking for your blessing.”

Fortunately, Madison's dad was supportive of the relationship and expressed excitement for what was to come.

“She obviously looked at you and knew that something was right there,” he explained. “I'm so happy that Madison has finally found somebody who she is comfortable with and happy. You are a fantastic man. I think you are the perfect mix for her.”

After a season filled with drama, both David and Madison were relieved to discover their families got along well. And yes, they were supportive of this unique love story.

“It's real. It's strong. It's genuine,” David said about his connection to Madison. “ I can't wait for our families to coincide and be one big giant family drinking, playing darts and real love.”

Married at First Sight (produced by Kinetic Content) airs on Lifetime Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Erika Jayne and Bozoma Saint John are sharing their reaction to the departure of costar Garcelle Beauvais.

The Bravo stars appeared on the Tuesday, March 25, episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen just hours after Garcelle, 58, revealed she was leaving the show following five seasons.

When host and RHOBH executive producer Andy Cohen asked them about the news, Erika, 53, and Boz, 48, initially met Cohen's question with a frosty silence. After being pressed to answer, Boz alluded to tension between Garcelle and her costars at the recent RHOBH season 14 reunion. (A trailer released Tuesday shows Garcelle storming off during the reunion and declaring, “Everybody can go f— themselves, I don't care.”

“I am disappointed that she is departing like this. I wish that she would have stuck around to work out another season,” Boz told Cohen, referring to the way things were left at the reunion.





Erika claimed, “We've known that she's quit for two weeks,” adding that, “She did not take the cast photo with us [at the reunion], which is a clear indication that I am leaving.”

Garcelle announced her exit from RHOBH Tuesday morning in a video shared via Instagram.

“Hey, guys, so I have some news. I've decided to leave Beverly Hills,” Garcelle said. “It's been a wild ride. I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless.”

She continued, “I just want to say thank you to Andy Cohen, to Bravo, NBCUniversal, Evolution, 32 Flavors, the producers, the crew and, of course, the ladies.”

Garcelle noted that Cohen told her she can “come back any time, the door will always be open.” She added: “You never know, I might pop in sometime.”

“I want to say thank you so much, you guys have cheered me on, supported me and sometimes even fought for me or on my behalf,” Garcelle concluded. “It means a lot, and I hope you guys will continue on this journey with me. It's not goodbye, it's see you later. So, see you later.”

“I'm really pissed right now,” Garcelle said in the trailer, which premiered Tuesday following the show's season 14 finale. “So, I don't want to answer any more questions, honestly.”

Garcelle could be seen walking off the reunion set as the other RHOBH cast members looked stunned.

“Everybody can go f— themselves, I don't care,” she said as she stormed off.

As season 3 of The White Lotus comes to an end, there are some people Patrick Schwarzenegger might not be watching with: his parents.

During a recent appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show, Patrick, 31, was asked whether he would be joined by his parents, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, to watch the last two episodes. Patrick admitted that “it was a little nerve-wracking watching the first episode with my whole family because I do take some clothes off.”

For the end of the season, Patrick has a different plan in mind. “I think some upcoming episodes I'm going to watch without them,” he added. “[I] would definitely take a bathroom break [if things get too awkward]. The next episodes, they're crazy.”

Earlier in the episode, host Drew Barrymore played a message for Patrick recorded by his mother. “I think every single one you've been nervous for me to watch,” Shriver, 69, said in reference to her son's nude scene in the premiere. “You keep saying, ‘That's not me, that's a prosthetic.'”



ICYMI, Patrick left quite an impression at the beginning of The White Lotus with a full frontal scene. His story line has since progressed to include an onscreen threesome. Patrick previously received support from several of his family members for baring it all on camera — including brother-in-law Chris Pratt.

“I know where my eyes went,” Pratt, 45, joked during an interview with E! News in February about Patrick's nude scene. “I'm not blood related to him, I was looking at that d—k, bro.”

Pratt, who is married to Katherine Schwarzenegger, praised Patrick's performance, saying, “No, he looks amazing. Obviously, he's a physical specimen, but also he's a really solid actor because the character he's playing is completely different than who he is.”

After helping Patrick with his audition, Pratt was thrilled to see the season's success.

“He created a character. And it feels natural and good. I've been telling everybody for years, I've been telling him as well, I really think we're entering a decade of Patrick,” he continued. “I've been watching him, he's just been working hard.”

Pratt concluded: “He's actually a hustler across the board, not just with acting but with business, and everything. He's super driven, and I know he gets that from both his mom and his dad.”

That same month, Patrick shut down assumptions that he has been booking jobs because of his famous parents.

“I know there are people who'll say I only got this role because of who my dad is,” Patrick told The Sunday Times. “They're not seeing that I've had 10 years of acting classes, put on [high] school plays every week, worked on my characters for hours on end or the hundreds of rejected auditions I've been on.”

Patrick expressed his determination to prove people wrong, adding, “Of course, it's frustrating and you can get boxed in and you think at that moment, I wish I didn't have my last name. But, that's a small moment. I would never trade my life with anyone. I'm very fortunate to have the life and family that I have, the parents I have and the lessons and values they've instilled in me.”

New episodes of The White Lotus air on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Taylor Swift's name was mentioned during a U.S. Senate hearing about the leaked Signal chat that showed high-ranking security officials discussing plans to bomb Yemen.

During the Tuesday, March 25, hearing, Virginia Senator Mark Warner cited Swift, 35, while discussing the dangers of alienating international allies. Warner, 70, pointed to Swift's cancellation of three Vienna concerts last year as an example of the importance of properly handling and sharing classified information.

“That sharing of information saves lives, and it's not hypothetical,” Warner told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “We all remember, because it was declassified — last year when Austria worked with our community to make sure to expose a plot against Taylor Swift in Vienna that could have killed literally hundreds of individuals.”

As Swifties will remember, the Grammy winner canceled three planned concerts at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium after officials uncovered an alleged terror plot inspired by ISIS. Swift addressed the situation a few weeks later, explaining that she waited a bit to break her silence because of the highly sensitive nature of the incident.



“Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows,” she wrote via Instagram in August 2024. “In cases like this one, ‘silence' is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it's right to. My priority was finishing our European tour safely, and it is with great relief that I can say we did that.”

She noted that canceling the concerts was “devastating” but thanked officials for their work. “The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows,” she wrote. “But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives. I was heartened by the love and unity I saw in the fans who banded together.”

News broke on Monday, March 24, that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and other officials in President Donald Trump's administration discussed plans to attack Houthi militants in Yemen in a group chat on the messaging app Signal. The chats leaked because the group chat allegedly included Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, who published a story about the incident on Monday. The National Security Council later said that the chat “appears to be authentic.”

Trump, 78, downplayed the leak on Tuesday, claiming that the information shared in the group chat was not mishandled because it was not classified.

“So this was not classified,” Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. ambassadors, per The New York Times. “Now if it's classified information, it's probably a little bit different, but I always say, you have to learn from every experience.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, said on Monday that the leak is “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time.”

Autopsy results for Miller Gardner will take months due to an outbreak of violent crime in Costa Rica.


Miller, 14, died on Friday, March 21, while vacationing in Costa Rica with his family, including his father Brett Gardner, a former star outfielder for the New York Yankees. 

In an interview with DailyMail.com, a representative for Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) said an autopsy has already been performed on Miller — but results won't be coming anytime soon. 

“We're having a hike in homicides as these drug gangs battle for territory and every one of them needs an autopsy,” Juan Pablo Alvarado Garcia said in a story published on Wednesday, March 26.



He added, “I can confirm that an autopsy has been carried out on Miller, But the full analysis and results, as in every one of them, will take at least two to three months due to these constant killings causing a backlog of cases. That's the reality.”

There were more than 900 homicides in Costa Rica in 2023, according to the OIJ, which marked the most deadly year in the country's history. The murders were “primarily attributed to narcotrafficking groups.”

“Costa Rica, as you know, is a country that has not had an army since 1949 and has been an extremely peaceful country since then, so there is a great social impact due to the increase in the homicide rate, and last year we had 906 homicides in a population of 5.2 million inhabitants,” Mario Zamora, director of the Ministry of Public Safety, told Cronkite News in October 2024. 

Miller was found dead in his hotel room at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort in Manuel Antonio, a popular tourist destination in Costa Rica.

His cause of death remains unknown, but officials have ruled out asphyxia, which was listed as the preliminary cause. Authorities now believe food poisoning may have been the cause.

Miller's death was announced on Sunday, March 23 in a statement released by his parents via the Yankees. 

“With heavy hearts we are saddened to announce the passing of our youngest son, Miller,” the statement read. “He was 14 years old and has left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation. We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st.”

The statement continued, “Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile. He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”

Charlie Hunnam has just expanded his family!

The 44-year-old Sons of Anarchy actor recently adopted two cute kittens during a little down time from filming the next installment in Ryan Murphy's Monster anthology series. 

Keep reading to find out more...

According to the River Valley Animal Rescue, Charlie visited the rescue in Momence, Ill., and showered the cats with love, before he decided to adopt. 

The rescue center shared photos of Charlie playing with a couple of adorable cats named Sugar Plum and Gingerbread. 

""Just like everyone who steps through our doors, he soaked up all the affection they had to give. He was a great sport about letting them climb all over him, snapped countless pictures, and even took the opportunity to FaceTime his lady to show off his favorites,"" they shared on Facebook. 

""But from the very beginning, two special sisters stole his heart: Sugar Plum and Gingerbread. And then came the words we never expected… I think I would love to adopt. And that's exactly what Charlie did,"" they continued. ""Who would have thought that our two little ladies—once unwanted and homeless in a small town—would end up flying off to a life of luxury in Los Angeles?""

""Charlie, thank you for giving these precious kittens the incredible life they deserve. We not only loved having you visit time and time again, but seeing the genuine affection you had for each and every cat was absolutely priceless,"" RVAR concluded. 🐾 We're honored to officially welcome you to the RVAR family! 🐾 And this just goes to show… 🙃 No matter who you are, getting two kittens to sit still long enough for an adoption photo is nearly impossible—even for this experienced CAT DAD! 🐾""

Local news station WCIA reported in February that Monster season three was filming in Kankakee County, and the production had taken over the downtown Momence. 

Charlie is set to star in the upcoming season as serial killer Ed Gein, whose crimes spanned from 1947-1957. 

He was last photographed sporting a bloody face while filming in Los Angeles back in January. Check out the pics!

Prince Harry has stepped away from the charity he helped found, Sentebale, which he started all the way back in 2006.

The 40-year-old Duke of Sussex stepped away alongside co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, along with members of the Board of Trustees, after their relationship with chairwoman Dr. Sophie Chandauka “broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.” He originally set up the organization in honor of his late mother, Princess Diana.

Prince Harry‘s statement is as follows:

“With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as Patrons of the organization until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same,” the Princes said in a joint situation.

“It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation. What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.”

Dr. Sophie Chandauka also released a statement, as follows: 

“There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.” 

“[This is a] story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir (discrimination against black women) — and the coverup that ensued.”","{'href': 'https://www.justjared.com', 'title': 'Just Jared'}"

Aaron Ashmore reveals he and wife Zoe Kate split up years ago. 

The 45-year-old Ginny & Georgia actor and his love broke up during the pandemic, he revealed during an appearance on the Inside of You podcast, which is hosted his Smallville co-star Michael Rosenbaum. 

Keep reading to find out more...

During the podcast, Michael asked Aaron about the toughest time in his life, and he opened up about their decision to split up during COVID. 

""You know, COVID was a really tough time,” he recalled. “We had a brand new baby, my dad got stuck home with a 3-year-old and a newborn, and my dad got ill over that time period and passed away. And then eight months after that, my wife and I decided to split up.”

""I was grieving my dad and then my marriage dissolved and stuff,” Aaron continued, adding, “There was about a two and a half year period that was just like … the hits just kept coming, man.”

Aaron said that before they split for good, they did try going to couple's therapy, and he also went to therapy on his own. 

""We were actually in therapy for our merit. My ex is a therapist so there was always a lot of encouragement to do therapy, and so we did. We did our due diligence for our relationship and our marriage,” he said, noting they did therapy together for a year before splitting.

Aaron and Zoe were married in 2014 and have two daughters together, Esme and Margot. 

Aaron, whose twin brother Shawn Ashmore is also an actor, can currently be seen on the series Skymed. His other credits include Locke & Key, Killjoys, Designated Survivor, Warehouse 13, and movies like Wish Upon a Christmas, Santa's Squad, Pretty Cheaters, Deadly Lies, Cider and Sunsets, Suze and more.

“I thought she hated me,” he said on the Jay Shetty Podcast of his first meeting with Selena, which was set up by her mom Mandy Teefey. They met 16 years ago to work on a song together.

“Obviously, 99% of it was in my head,” Benny went on. “I was talking to her and said, ‘Oh my God, I have so many good single guy friends… We have dinners at the house all the time, you should come over sometime.' I wasn't even thinking about anything and we're talking about our ideal date and this and that.”

“I want her to be in our friend group and I want to make sure this thing is smoothed out so the song goes well,” he continued, adding they started texting each other and would send ""ugly"" selfies.

Selena, who was also on the podcast, said that she started falling for him through their text exchanges. 

When asked about almost self-sabotaging their relationship, Benny said, “I feel like it all happens for a reason. I feel like maybe me doing that is what disarmed her enough.”

Remi Bader is opening up about her weight.

The 30-year-old influencer and outspoken advocate for body inclusivity recently spoke out about her weight loss journey, and revealed she went under a medical procedure.

In the fall of 2023, Remi chose to have gastric bypass surgery (SADI-S), which she decided to do based on a history of binge eating, weight-loss drugs and gastrointestinal issues.

""I loved being curvy my whole life; I just did. It was who I was...I will always believe that you could be a bigger size and be healthy and happy,"" she told Self.

""I was for a while, that wasn't a lie. But there was a point when it shifted, and I became really unhappy.""

After speaking with her doctor, she underwent the surgery on December 11, 2023. 

""I need to say that it was the most brutal thing,"" she admitted.

""I get the surgery. I was in recovery hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up. It was not normal. I was supposed to leave [the hospital] in one day.""

""I could not stop projectile vomiting, and I couldn't drink water. They won't let you leave if you can't drink water,” she added. 

""I actually can't explain how horrible it was.""

Remi revealed that she didn't leave the hospital until three days later, and the negative effects that came with recovery lasted six weeks. 

In the months that followed the surgery, Remi said she was ""not f--king okay"" from December to mid-February 2024. 

""I'd gotten into a very, very deep depression, and it was truly the scariest time of my life,” she said. “I couldn't tell people. I really — I wanted to die.""

Remi noted ""it happened very subtly"" and she ""never went off of the anxiety or depression medicine"" because it made her feel ""so much better.""

As far as the weight loss itself, Remi said she ""never thought it would be this quick,"" and she's still ""healing and figuring it out.""

""I was lost with my identity before...I wasn't big enough at first and plus-size enough at first for the plus-size community. Then I became too big...for some brands even to work with. Now I'm too small? I actually don't know where I'm supposed to be,"" she admitted.

""I'm going to continue to be online and cry and share and not share and be me, and that's not changing.""

This is the gravest crisis for Western security since the end of World War Two, and a lasting one. As one expert puts it, ""Trumpism will outlast his presidency"". But which nations are equipped to step to the fore as the US stands back?

At 09.00 one morning in February 1947, the UK ambassador in Washington, Lord Inverchapel, walked into the State Department to hand the US Secretary of State, George Marshall, two diplomatic messages printed on blue paper to emphasise their importance: one on Greece, the other on Turkey.

Exhausted, broke and heavily in debt to the United States, Britain told the US that it could no longer continue its support for the Greek government forces that were fighting an armed Communist insurgency. Britain had already announced plans to pull out of Palestine and India and to wind down its presence in Egypt.

The United States saw immediately that there was now a real danger that Greece would fall to the Communists and, by extension, to Soviet control. And if Greece went, the United States feared that Turkey could be next, giving Moscow control of the Eastern Mediterranean including, potentially, the Suez Canal, a vital global trade route.

Almost overnight, the United States stepped into the vacuum left by the departing British.

""It must be a policy of the United States,"" President Harry Truman announced, ""to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressure.""

It was the start of what became known as the Truman Doctrine. At its heart was the idea that helping to defend democracy abroad was vital to the United States' national interests.

There followed two major US initiatives: the Marshall Plan, a massive package of assistance to rebuild the shattered economies of Europe, and the creation of Nato in 1949, which was designed to defend democracies from a Soviet Union that had now extended its control over the eastern part of Europe.

It is easy to see this as the moment that leadership of the western world passed from Britain to the United States. More accurately it is the moment that revealed that it already had. 

The United States, traditionally isolationist and safely sheltered by two vast oceans, had emerged from World War Two as the leader of the free world. As America projected its power around the globe, it spent the post-war decades remaking much of the world in its own image. 

The baby boomer generation grew up in a world that looked, sounded and behaved more like the United States than ever before. And it became the western world's cultural, economic and military hegemon.

Yet the fundamental assumptions on which the United States has based its geostrategic ambitions now look set to change.

Donald Trump is the first US President since World War Two to challenge the role that his country set for itself many decades ago. And he is doing this in such a way that, to many, the old world order appears to be over - and the new world order has yet to take shape.

The question is, which nations will step forward? And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response?

President Trump's critique of the post-1945 international order dates back decades. Nearly 40 years ago he took out full-page advertisements in three US newspapers to criticise the United States' commitment to the defence of the world's democracies.

""For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States,"" he wrote in 1987. ""Why are these nations not paying the United States for the human lives and billions of dollars we are losing to protect their interests?

""The world is laughing at America's politicians as we protect ships we don't own, carrying oil we don't need, destined for allies who won't help.""

It's a position he has repeated since his second inauguration. 

And the fury felt by some in his administration for what they perceive as European reliance on the United States was apparently shown in the leaked messages about air strikes on Houthis in Yemen that emerged this week.

In the messages, an account named Vice-President JD Vance wrote that European countries might benefit from the strikes. It said: ""I just hate bailing Europe out again.""

Another account, identified as Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, responded three minutes later: ""VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.""

Trump's own position appears to go beyond criticising those he says are taking advantage of the United State's generosity. At the start of his second presidency, he seemed to embrace Russian President Vladimir Putin, telling Russia that Ukraine would not be granted Nato membership and that it should not expect to get back the territory it has lost to Russia. 

Many saw this as giving away two major bargaining chips before talks had even started. He apparently asked Russia for nothing in return.

On the flipside, certain Trump supporters see in Putin a strong leader who embodies many of the conservative values they themselves share. 

To some, Putin is an ally in a ""war on woke"".

The United States' foreign policy is now driven, in part at least, by the imperatives of its culture wars. The security of Europe has become entangled in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of what the United States stands for. 

Some think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end. 

""The US is becoming divorced from European values,"" argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London. ""That's difficult [for Europeans] to swallow because it means that it's structural, cultural and potentially long-term. ""

""I think the current trajectory of the US will outlast Trump, as a person. I think Trumpism will outlast his presidency.""

The Trump White House has said it will no longer be the primary guarantor of European security, and that European nations should be responsible for their own defence and pay for it.

""If [Nato countries] don't pay, I'm not going to defend them. No, I'm not going to defend them,"" the president said earlier this month.

For almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all. 

In Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.

Others are less sure.

Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: ""I think Article 5 is on life support. 

""If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn't step up to the plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, it's potentially the end of the Nato that we know and it'll be the end of Article 5.

""Right now, I wouldn't bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be triggered in the event of a Russian attack… I certainly wouldn't take for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.""

According to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly three quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an ally of France. A majority in Britain and a very large majority in Denmark, both historically pro-American countries, now have unfavourable views of the United States as well.

""The damage Trump has done to Nato is probably irreparable,"" argues Robert Kagan, a conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.

""The alliance relied on an American guarantee that is no longer reliable, to say the least"".

And yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato allies to increase theirs, saying: ""Europe has sometimes been complacent about its own defence.""

All of this is great news for Putin. ""The entire system of Euro-Atlantic security is crumbling before our eyes,"" he said last year. ""Europe is being marginalised in global economic development, plunged into the chaos of challenges such as migration, and losing international agency and cultural identity.""

In early March, three days after Volodymyr Zelensky's disastrous meeting with Trump and Vance in the White House, a Kremlin spokesman declared ""the fragmentation of the West has begun"".

""Look at Russia's objectives in Europe,"" says Armida van Rij, head of the Europe programme at Chatham House. ""Its objectives are to destabilise Europe. It is to weaken Nato, and get the Americans to withdraw their troops from here.

""And at the moment you could go 'tick, tick and almost tick'. Because it is destabilising Europe. It is weakening Nato. It hasn't gone as far as to get the US to withdraw troops from Europe, but in a few months time, who knows where we'll be?""

One of the great challenges Europe, in particular, faces from here is the question of how to arm itself adequately. Eighty years of reliance on the might of the United States has left many European democracies exposed. 

Britain, for example, has cut military spending by nearly 70% since the height of the Cold War. (At the end of the Cold War, in the early 1990s, Europe allowed itself a peace dividend and began a decades-long process of reducing defence spending.)

""We had a big budget [during the Cold War] and we took a peace dividend,"" says Wallace. ""Now, you could argue that that was warranted.

""The problem is we went from a peace dividend to corporate raiding. [Defence] just became the go-to department to take money from. And that is where we just forgot the lessons of our history.""

The prime minister told parliament last month that Britain would increase defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. But is that enough?

""It isn't enough just to stand still,"" argues Wallace. ""It wouldn't be enough to fix the things we need to make ourselves more deployable, and to plug the gaps if the Americans left.""

Then there is the wider question of military recruitment. ""The West is in freefall in its military recruiting, it's not just Britain,"" argues Wallace.

""At the moment, young people aren't joining the military. And that's a problem.""

But Germany's new Chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, has said Europe must make itself independent of the United States. And ""Europeanising"" NATO will require the build up of an indigenous European military-industrial complex capable of delivering capabilities that currently only the United States has.

Others share the view that Europe must become more self reliant militarily - but some are concerned that not all of Europe is on board with this.

""Where we are at the moment is that the East Europeans by and large, don't need to get the memo,"" says Ian Bond, deputy director, Centre for European Reform. ""The further west you go, the more problematic it becomes until you get to Spain and Italy.""

Mr Arnold agrees: ""The view in Europe now is this isn't really a debate anymore, it's a debate of how we do it and maybe how quickly we do it, but we need to do this now.""

There is a short list of ""very important things"" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash. 

""These are the so-called strategic enablers,"" he says. ""The satellites, the intelligence, the Patriot air defence batteries, which are the only ones that can take down Russian ballistic missiles. And within three to five years we [countries other than the US] should aim to have our own version of these.

""And in this process of transition, from the American-led Nato [the idea is] you will have a Nato that is so Europeanised that its forces, together with national forces and EU capacities, are capable of defending Europe - even if an American president says 'leave us out of this'.""

The question is how to achieve this.

Ms van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.

""What's really difficult are the divisions within Europe on how to actually do this and whether to actually do this.""

The European Commission and experts have been trying to figure out how this defence may work for several decades. ""It has traditionally been very difficult because of vested national interests... So this is not going to be easy.""

In the meantime, Trump appears ready to turn the page on the post-Cold War rules-based international order of sovereign states that are free to choose their own destinies and alliances.

What he seems to share with Vladimir Putin is a desire for a world in which the major powers, unconstrained by internationally agreed laws, are free to impose their will on smaller, weaker nations, as Russia has traditionally done in both its Tsarist and Soviet Empires. That would mean a return to the ""spheres of interest"" system that prevailed for 40 years after the Second World War.

We don't know exactly what Donald Trump would do were a Nato country to be attacked. But the point is that the guarantee of US help can no longer be taken for granted. That means Europe has to react. Its challenge appears to be to stay united, finally make good on funding its own defence, and avoid being drawn into the ""sphere of influence"" of any of the big powers.

Just this weekend, a Canadian professor warned that illegal immigration and drug smuggling in Canada would hit the roof, all thanks to Donald Trump's strict border policies. Speaking on '60 Minutes Overtime,' Mount Royal University's Kelly Sundberg, who also 15 years as an officer in the Canadian Border Services Agency, spread the word of caution, saying a “tsunami” of illegal migrants would inevitably flow into Canada. 

“I hope I'm wrong, but it would appear that we're going to be overwhelmed by the illegal immigrants fleeing American authorities coming into our country, and they very well might be bringing guns and drugs with them,” he said.

Days later, The New York Post appears to have confirmed those fears as official sources have told the US outlet that more migrants are picking Canada for their refuge instead of slipping into the US. In light of President Trump's crackdown on the issue, Homeland Security sources argued how “lots of northbounders” have been “self-deporting” from the US.

While it's obvious that with Donald Trump back in the US, migrants are switching paths because they fear his policies to curb illegal immigration, these numbers had reportedly already started mounting even before the Trump administration returned to power with full swing.

According to official data quoted by The Post, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported 40 illegal crossing from Washington into British Columbia in January 2025. Border Patrol agents on the US side also witnessed 30 migrants crossing south. Even Agents in a remote area of Washington state saw an average of five migrants moving illegally north into Canada every day.

It was also observed that many of these migrants running to Canada share some temporary status in the US as they previously crossed into the country from Mexico. Sources contended that migrants are also illegally crossing into Canada “to avoid any immigration consequences that may happen if their case isn't adjudicated in their favour.” Moreover, they're keen on entering Canada before federal immigration agents working for Trump's mass deportation bid nab them.

As per the New York Times, Canadian border authorities caught roughly 20 illegal migrants so far this year in Alberta. On the contrary, only seven migrants were crossing north in the same region in 2024. The remote parts of the US-Canada border are also witnessing migrants running north.

With more and more light being shed on Canada in this context, the country has worked to tighten its visa restrictions. “Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,” Trump said in a November Truth Social post. “We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”

In late February, David McGunity, Public Safety Minister of Canada, said that the country's progress in enhancing border security with the US and battling drug smuggling should make the Trump admin happy. 

“We are quite convinced that the efforts we've made thus far should satisfy the U.S. administration,” he told reporters in Washington. “The evidence is irrefutable – progress is being made. In my view, any test that was put on Canada in terms of showing progress and meeting standards for the border – I believe those have been met.”

The Canada Border Services Agency said in a statement, “During this blitz, border services officers will be increasing examinations of inbound and outbound shipments.”

Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting Emmanuel Macron before a European leaders' summit on Ukraine tomorrow. Meanwhile, Russia attacked his hometown and a Ukrainian port city, hours after the Black Sea ceasefire deal was agreed. Follow the latest here.

Estonia has passed a bill banning Russian citizens and non-EU residents residing in the country from voting in local elections.

Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal said the move was ""a victory for all"", adding on X: ""The decisions in our local life won't be made by the citizens of the aggressor states, but we'll decide by ourselves.""

The restrictions, if signed into law, would ban Russian citizens and non-EU citizens from voting.

Nearly 80,000 Russian citizens hold a residence permit in Estonia, a former Soviet republic which regained its independence in 1991.

Further to reports we brought you earlier, Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived at Elysee Palace in Paris and been greeted by Emmanuel Macron - who has remained one of his closest allies during the three-year war.

The Ukrainian president is there for a summit of European leaders tomorrow.

The so-called ""coalition of the willing"" nations that are allies of Ukraine will discuss options for a peacekeeping solution for the country after the war ends, with France and Britain leading efforts.

Officials said earlier discussions at the meeting in Paris would focus on a range of issues, such as on how to strengthen Ukraine militarily to deter future attacks, and how to monitor limited ceasefires over sea targets and energy infrastructure.

Images are emerging of rubble-strewn streets and battered buildings in Pokrovsk, which sits in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. 

Russian forces have for months focused on advancing on Pokrovsk.

But Ukraine's military has reported success in recent weeks in holding back Russian forces in the area.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Paris ahead of a summit of European leaders on Ukraine and security tomorrow as part of Sir Keir Starmer's ""coalition of the willing"".

Emmanuel Macron is hosting the follow-up to his February and March gatherings of European and NATO leaders to discuss defence guarantees for Ukraine, with leaders and delegations from around 30 countries attending.

The Ukrainian leader is expected to have a meeting with the French president later today.

We'll bring you any updates or images from Zelenskyy's visit as we get them.

Further to Ukrainian reports we brought you earlier of a diesel spillage at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the Russian-installed management at the facility has dismissed the claims as ""fake"".

Earlier, Ukraine accused Moscow of being incapable of managing safety at plant after what it called reports of a huge spillage of diesel (see post at 3.05pm).

""The spilled fuel was enough to power the station's emergency generators for 25 days,"" the country's foreign ministry spokesman, Heorhii Tykhyi, said. 

He did not give the origin of the reports or say when or how the damage had come about, saying only that it was ""a direct result of Russia's reckless replacement"" of licensed Ukrainian experts with Russian staff.

Last week, Donald Trump suggested the US could help run and possibly own Ukraine's nuclear power plants.

But Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the ownership has not been discussed and ruled out such a possibility.

A search is under way after four US army soldiers went missing in Lithuania, the US embassy in Vilnius reports.

The embassy said on their website that the soldiers went missing in a training area near Pabrade in eastern Lithuania, near the border with Belarus.

A search is being conducted by the US army, Lithuanian armed forces, Lithuanian law enforcement and others, the embassy added.

The embassy has not said when the soldiers went missing.

Ukraine has accused Russia of being incapable of managing safety at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after what it called reports of diesel spillage.

The country's foreign ministry spokesman, Heorhii Tykhyi, said Russia had not only stole the plant, but they were ""unable to manage its basic safety"".

Here is what he has said on X...

The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia facility is Europe's largest nuclear plant and located in southern Ukraine.

The plant has been controlled by Russian forces since March 2022.

Since then, both Kyiv and Moscow have accused each other of attacking it - leading to UN body, the International Atomic Energy Agency, frequently expressing concern about the plant amid fears of a potential nuclear catastrophe.

Donald Trump's special envoy has come under fire for his comments around a 1994 deal transferring nuclear weapons from Ukraine to Russia, known as the Budapest Memorandum.

Here's what Richard Grenell said: 

""Lets be clear about the Budapest Memorandum: the nukes were Russia's and were leftovers.

""Ukraine gave the nukes back to Russia. They weren't Ukraine's.

""This is an uncomfortable fact.""

The Budapest Memorandum was signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union. 

Those nuclear weapons were inherited from the Soviet Union, but Ukraine agreed to give them up in return for security guarantees.

Former US ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer, who was involved in those talks in 1994, was among those to respond to Grenell - pointing out Russia is not the same thing as the Soviet Union.

""Grenell is flat wrong.  Nuclear warheads in #Ukraine were ex-Soviet, not Russian,"" he said.

Political commentator and former Republican Representative Adam Kizinger was more direct in his response, writing: ""They were Soviet you ignorant ass helmet.

""So they were as equally Ukraine's as Russia's. This is day one knowledge.""

We reported earlier that Russia had accused Ukraine of targeting energy infrastructure in three of its regions, despite an agreement not to carry out such attacks (see our 11.17am post).

The Ukrainian military has now rejected that accusation.

The general staff said on messaging app Telegram that Kyiv's troops did
not conduct any such strikes on 25-26 March.

The United Nations Security Council is convening to discuss Ukraine.

Only a brief summary of the agenda is available on the UN website, describing it as regarding the ""maintenance of peace and security in Ukraine"".

The UNSC has 15 members, including China, France, Russia, the UK and US.

March 25 (UPI) -- Japan's Osaka High Court ruled Tuesday that the country's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.

The court's ruling is the fifth decision to call Japan's same-sex marriage ban a violation of the country's constitution following similar rulings in the high courts of Sapporo, Tokyo, Fukuoka and Nagoya.
Presiding Judge Kumiko Honda of the Osaka High Court ruled Tuesday in favor of three same-sex couples who filed a lawsuit against the government, seeking 6 million yen -- or $39,900 -- in compensation.
While Honda dismissed the couples' appeal for compensation, he reversed Osaka District Court's prior ruling that Japan's Civil Code and Family Register Act limit marriage to heterosexual couples.

The court also ruled that the marriage ban violates Article 24, which states laws involving family ""shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes.""

While the Osaka District Court based its decision on protecting the relationships of men and women to bring children into the world, the plaintiffs argued ""there are heterosexual couples who don't intend to have children.""
Japan is currently the only International Group of Seven country that does not recognize same-sex marriage. Other G7 countries have encouraged Japan to fight discrimination and uphold protections for sexual and gender minorities.
Some local governments in Japan have granted ""partnership certificates"" to same-sex couples, but those do not provide the same married rights of spousal visits, parental recognition or inheritance.
""What should be questioned is the rationality in excluding same-sex couples from the marriage system,"" the plaintiffs argued. ""Legalizing gay marriage would make more people happy, while it would make no one unhappy.""

While the Osaka District Court based its decision on protecting the relationships of men and women to bring children into the world, the plaintiffs argued ""there are heterosexual couples who don't intend to have children.""

Japan is currently the only International Group of Seven country that does not recognize same-sex marriage. Other G7 countries have encouraged Japan to fight discrimination and uphold protections for sexual and gender minorities.

Some local governments in Japan have granted ""partnership certificates"" to same-sex couples, but those do not provide the same married rights of spousal visits, parental recognition or inheritance.

""What should be questioned is the rationality in excluding same-sex couples from the marriage system,"" the plaintiffs argued. ""Legalizing gay marriage would make more people happy, while it would make no one unhappy.""","{'href': 'https://www.upi.com', 'title': 'UPI News'}"

President Donald Trump's dominance of Washington isn't just dividing Democrats, who are struggling for a unified resistance strategy, it's now dividing the legal world.

The president on Tuesday issued an executive order targeting Jenner & Block, the law firm where Andrew Weissmann, who worked on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, was employed.

The order calls for the suspension of security clearances for lawyers and cutting off federal contracts, citing the law firm's ""obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends"" among other claims.

This is the latest instance of Trump using the power of the executive office to crack down on law firms with ties to people who have previously investigated the president, creating a chilling effect among lawyers.

One of the most prominent divisions in the legal world came as more than 140 alumni of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP wrote to the Democratic-leaning law firm's chair, Brad Karp, requesting him to recommit to the firm's democratic values.

Karp angered many in the legal world after he struck a deal with Trump that led to the rescinding of an executive order that targeted the firm's pro bono services, ended its federal contracts, and stripped it of security clearances.

The order also singled out Mark Pomerantz, a former Paul Weiss partner who led the Manhattan district attorney's investigation into Trump's finances.

Trump claimed that Karp agreed to provide $40 million in pro bono legal services, pursue merit-based hiring instead of diversity, equity, and inclusion practices, and represent a broad spectrum of clients regardless of their political affiliation.

The deal brokered on March 20 led to fierce backlash.

""We expected the firm to be a leader in standing up for the legal profession, the adversary

system, and the right to counsel,"" signees of the letter to Karp wrote on Monday. ""Instead of a ringing defense of the values of democracy, we witnessed a craven surrender to, and thus complicity in, what is perhaps the gravest threat to the independence of the legal profession since at least the days of

Senator Joseph McCarthy.""

Trump's March 14 executive order “could easily have destroyed our firm,” Karp said in an email to employees on Sunday explaining the deal. ""It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients,"" Karp added.

But several experts continued to denounce Karp's actions.

""I think he had a hard choice. I don't think this was easy,"" said Elizabeth Grossman, one of the chief organizers of the letter and a former Paul Weiss employee from 2016 to 2019. ""But I think that at the end of the day, he went with the bottom line of the firm and didn't think about the ripple effects this would have on the rule of law.""

Ultimately, Grossman, now the executive director of the pro-democracy group Common Cause Illinois, said, ""He made the wrong choice.""

""I see the executive order that Trump issued against Paul Weiss, obviously as part of a much broader campaign against the judicial system, the legal community, and quite frankly against the rule of law, and bedrock principles that undergird and ensure the functioning of our democracy,"" added Mary Spooner, one of the letter's signees, who spent nine years at Paul Weiss as an attorney and three years before that as a paralegal.

Other legal experts who didn't sign the letter similarly denounced Paul Weiss's deal with the Trump administration.

“The letter written by Paul Weiss alumni is a stark reminder of the best of what lawyers expect from the rest of the profession, and how craven and concerning the law firm's decision was in caving to the White House's demands,"" said national security attorney Bradley Moss.

""The legal profession is a critical line of defense in upholding the rule of law, and it is meant to do so irrespective of politics,"" Moss continued. ""The moment lawyers start restricting themselves for political reasons, members of the media may follow suit. That way lies degradation of our constitutional foundations and the risk that no one will be there to hold accountable government run amok, no matter if it is a Democratic or Republican administration.”

With Democrats shut out of power in the White House and Congress, Trump's most significant losses have come through the judicial system, with several federal judges ruling against some of his executive orders.

Trump has called for the impeachment of these judges, earning a rare rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.

The president's attempts to also crack down on law firms he dislikes come as Democrats have not yet decided on an effective strategy to counter Trump.

""The judicial system is the front line of this battle. It's become clear the front line is not in Congress,"" said Randy Jones, a Democratic political consultant. ""Because I think that in order to fight this administration effectively, it's been made clear those fights have to come from the courts, and those fights have to come from the attorneys who file the suits and the motions with those courts.""

“It wasn't Congress who blocked DOGE from accessing personal information from the Social Security Administration. It was skilled attorneys representing AFSCME,"" Jones said, pointing to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency facing legal setbacks in its efforts to get access to sensitive records through the Social Security Administration. ""That's the front line of this fight today.""

Douglas Wilson, a Democratic strategist based in Charlotte, North Carolina, claimed that Paul Weiss did not have to capitulate to Trump's executive order and should have taken the matter to court as another law firm did.

Trump also targeted the law firm Covington & Burling through an executive order while Perkins Coie, another prominent law firm that Trump targeted with an executive order, took the issue to court and won a temporary restraining order against the order.

""He could have taken the administration to court like everybody else is doing,"" Wilson said. ""Look how many executive orders have been struck down by the court. Most recently, the immigration one, about the 18th century law (The Alien Enemies Act of 1798) that the President was trying to use. That's what the judicial system is for. ""

Wilson also compared Trump's tactics to famous mobsters in American culture such as Tony Soprano and the Godfather series, as did other experts who claimed Trump's actions amounted to bullying.

It's led to some Trump opponents even having trouble finding legal representation.

""I imagine that these sorts of threats and actions will, if Trump is given the power, they'll start trickling down to much smaller firms who simply don't have the connections or the resources of their prestige to stand up,"" added Spooner, who signed the letter. ""Paul Weiss is uniquely positioned to take that stand, and it didn't do it. And I think in doing so it's ceded power to Trump. That is quite troubling.""

Aside from the letter, Grossman said the group is looking at the next steps.

""I think that people generally want to be organized, especially now when they're feeling hopeless and you can get a lot of the news is just so horrifying,"" Grossman said. ""And I think telling people we're doing something, here's how you can get involved in empowering people, is what people want.""

President Donald Trump recently criticized his portrait at the Colorado State Capitol, stating Barack Obama's ""looks wonderful"" while his own is ""truly the worst.""

By Dalmeet Singh Chawla2025-03-26T09:30:00+00:00

In 2019, researchers based at India's Chandigarh University published 362 peer-reviewed research studies. In 2023, that number had shot up to 2281 – a 530% increase – which has seen Chandigarh jump from a ranking below 2000th to 578th in Elsevier's SciVal tool ranking tool, which records the number of papers over 24,000 institutions publish annually.

Chandigarh is not the only university whose fortunes in these rankings have changed drastically. A total of 80 universities worldwide increased their research output by 100% or more, compared with a global average of around 20% between 2019 and 2023, according to a recent analysis.

At the same time, researchers at 14 of these institutions, including Chandigarh, showed significant declines in rates of first authorship – by up to eight times the global average. And the same 14 universities increased the rate by which their faculty co-authored papers with international colleagues by more than 10 times the global average in 2019–23. The group includes six public universities in Saudi Arabia, with the rest private institutions in India, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon.

Chemistry World reached out to Chandigarh University for comment but received no response.

Study co-author Lokman Meho, an information scientist at the American Institute of Beirut, says the issue isn't that research outputs are increasing at these institutions while first-author rates are decreasing. In fact, he says, that trend is very normal. ‘Globally, when research output increases significantly, it is natural to observe a decline in first-authorship rates,' says Meho. ‘A larger number of publications typically involves more collaborative efforts, which inherently dilutes individual leadership roles.' First authors carry out most of the work on a study, including research design, data collection and analysis.

Meho says the problem is how much output has increased and first-authorship rates declined at these institutions. ‘We were surprised at the sheer scale of the anomalies that we found,' he says. The publication output of the 14 universities rose by between 100% and 1457% in the five-year period – an average increase of 234%. Research output from institutions in a control group – including the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton University – increased by 1–6% during the same period.

Meho adds that the decline in first-authorship rates among the 14 institutions was much greater than that for their respective countries as a whole.

The data raise questions over how researchers at these universities are sustaining such spikes in research output while their first-authorship rates plummet significantly. Meho and his Beirut colleague Elie Akl are concerned that the trend could point to unethical behaviour, such as gift or sold authorship.

Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMTS) in Chennai, India, is another of the flagged institutions. According to reports, Saveetha Dental College, which is part of SIMTS, was publishing papers that its undergraduate students completed as part of their exams, leading to a significant spike in the number of papers produced by the institution. In 2023 and 2024, Saveetha Dental College was the highest-ranked dental institute in India. But it appeared that excessive self-citations and citation cartels were partly behind Saveetha's success.

Chemistry World approached SIMTS for a comment.

Reducing incentives for researchers and institutions to game the system could combat the problem, says Meho. Higher rankings, for instance, can draw higher-quality researchers and students, and more funding, he points out. The pursuit of higher rankings, therefore, puts ‘intense pressure' on institutions to publish more – ‘sometimes at the expense of ethical considerations'. 

Meho recommends that agencies that produce rankings should only consider a paper's primary affiliations and not give equal credit to each co-author. 

Elizabeth Gadd, head of research culture and assessment at Loughborough University, agrees that it's a problem if ranking agencies aren't picking up on unethical practices. ‘I would like to see the sector taking much greater interest and control over the mechanisms by which they are assessed on the global stage, because I think there are much better ways that we could be doing this,' she says.

In a separate analysis, Achal Agrawal, a data scientist who founded the India Research Watchdog, showed that countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, Egypt and India, whose research output has been rising rapidly, are retracting studies at much higher rates than other countries. Agarwal says that more sophisticated tools and metrics are needed to spot suspicious patterns. He adds that national regulators should audit institutions that are continually suspected of ‘cooking the books'. ‘Some accountability is needed,' he says.

The Atlantic magazine has published new messages from the Houthi strike chat between key Trump officials that its editor-in-chief was mistakenly added to. Follow the latest here - and listen to the Trump 100 podcast as you scroll.

Wednesday 26 March 2025 17:46, UK

Watch live as US vice president JD Vance visits Marine Corps Base Quantico.

The vice president is expected to deliver remarks which could touch on the security breach that has dominated US news this week.

Watch live in the stream at the top of the page - and we'll bring you the latest here too.

Asked on who was looking into the security breach, Karoline Leavitt said Elon Musk's team would be helping out as well.

She said: ""The National Security council, the White House council office and also yes, Elon Musk's team [will look into it]. 

""Elon has offered to put his technical experts on this to figure out how this number was added to the chat to take responsibility and ensure this never happens again.""

The White House press briefing has ended now, lasting about 20 minutes - shorter than usual.

For context:

Trump officials have repeatedly avoided committing to an official investigation.

They've instead said that it is being looked into.

But it isn't clear if there would be repercussions or the publication of any findings from such an inquiry.

The US government has made transparency a key part of its administration in DOGE.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt is now facing questions from reporters.

The second reporter to ask questions raised questions over what is, or isn't, classified information.

Leavitt doubles down on claiming the chat did not contain any classified information.

""I would characterise this as a policy discussion, a sensitive policy discussion,"" she said instead.

She is pressed by several reporters on how the sharing of the timings of attacks and weapons used could not be defined as classified, she struggles to put together an answer.

In a scattergun attempt to evade the question, she tries to discredit the journalist, lists other types of classified information that wasn't in the chat, tries to divert attention to the defence secretary's service in the military, and attacks the previous administration. even going so far as to raise its withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Signal is an ""approved"" app, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, during the ongoing briefing.

""This is an approved app. This is an encrypted app ... this is the most secure and efficient way to communicate,"" she said.

Leavitt added that Donald Trump had placed ""great trust"" in his national security team.

For context:

We reported earlier today on much of what was coming out of the Intelligence Committee in Congress.

National Security Agency (NSA) director General Timothy Haugh spoke during it about risks associated with Signal.

Under questioning from Democratic representative Jason Crow, Haugh said an advisory on how to use Signal was sent to NSA employees.

""Because there's risk to that app?"" Crow asked.

To which Haugh responded: ""There are.""

Karoline Leavitt is speaking now in a press briefing.

She has immediately gone on the attack, personally going after The Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, as well as the Democrats and what she claimed, without evidence, were its ""allies in the media"".

""The mainstream media continues to be focused on a sensationalised story.""

She also detailed specifics of the Houthi attack that she said people should be more focused on.

""Several Houthi leaders were killed,"" Leavitt said.

Even for a punchy spokesperson, Leavitt isn't holding back, describing the Biden administration as ""pathetic"". 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding a briefing now after the new revelations in Signalgate today.

Watch live in the stream at the top of the page - and we'll bring you the latest here too.

The encrypted messaging platform Signal has been at the centre of the furore in Washington.

A competitor to the likes of Meta's WhatsApp, it has found itself a key part of a US national security row.

National Security Agency (NSA) director General Timothy Haugh spoke about risks associated with the platform during the Intelligence Committee hearing earlier today.

Under questioning from Democratic representative Jason Crow, Haugh said an advisory on how to use Signal was sent to NSA employees.

""We put out an advisory on how to use the Signal app and other encrypted applications, because we do encourage our employees and their families to use encrypted apps,"" he said.

""Because there's risk to that app?"" Crow asked.

To which Haugh responded: ""There are.""

Some reporting to bring you from across the pond now.

The information shared by defence secretary Pete Hegseth on the Signal chat was highly classified at the time he wrote it, according to CNN.

It cited a US defence official familiar with the operation and another source briefed on it afterward.

""These are operational plans that are highly classified in order to protect the service members,"" the defence official reportedly said.

Experts previously told Sky News there was a chance that the White House had retroactively declassified the information on the group to stand up its defence that nothing classified was shared on Signal.

Intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard is answering questions in congress.

She said yesterday she was not aware of any discussion relating to weapons packages, targets or timings shared on the Signal group chat.

Congressional representatives haven't taken well to it today after The Atlantic published messages revealing specifics on weapons packages and timings.

Asked if she stood by her comments, Gabbard said the second Atlantic story was a ""refresher"".

She also admitted the inclusion of a reporter in the Signal chat was a ""mistake"".

""It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added,"" she added.

White House attack line

Gabbard repeated a previous phrase Mike Waltz used in his response to the story - perhaps showing an agreed White House line.

""There were no sources, methods or locations [shared],"" she said.

Republican Greg Steube also repeated this phrase in questioning.

Pete Hegseth has issued a response to the latest Atlantic article.

""So, let's me get this straight [sic]. The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information. 

""Those are some really s****y war plans. 

""This only proves one thing: Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an 'attack plan' (as he now calls it).""

Does his defence hold up? Here's his Signal message...

A reminder that the article quoted Hegseth as posting operational details of the plan, including weapon packages, targets and timing.

He texted: ""1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)"".

""1345: 'Trigger Based' F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME - also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)"".

Further texts by the Pentagon chief followed, the magazine reported: ""1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)"".

""1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier 'Trigger Based' targets)"".

He also posted: ""1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts - also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched"". And then: ""MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)"".

Prince Harry has quit as patron of a charity he founded in southern Africa almost 20 years ago in honour of his mother Princess Diana after a bitter boardroom battle.

Harry founded Sentebale in 2006 with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho to help young people with HIV and Aids in the southern African kingdom and later Botswana.

But relations have soured between the UK-registered charity's trustees and board chair Sophie Chandauka, who was appointed in 2023.

Harry and Seeiso decided to resign after the relationship ""broke down beyond repair"", they said in a joint statement on Tuesday.

""What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries,"" the statement said.

Several trustees have already left the organisation and requested Chandauka's resignation.

It is not clear exactly what is behind the rift but Chandauka said she was being targeted after raising serious concerns about the charity.



Sentebale said in a statement to AFP that they had not received the resignations but confirmed that it was evolving from a ""development organisation focused on addressing the impact of HIV/AIDS on the lives of children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana, to one that is addressing issues of youth health, wealth and climate resilience in Southern Africa"".

Regulator 

In their statement, Harry and Seeiso said: ""With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organisation until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same.

""It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.""

Chandauka alleged she had faced a backlash after trying to air concerns about the charity's governance.

The Zimbabwe-born lawyer said this was ""the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir -- and the coverup that ensued.

""For me, this is not a vanity project from which I can resign when I am called to account,"" she said.

Chandauka said she had reported trustees to the UK's Charity Commission regulator and taken her case to the High Court in London.

Harry and Seeiso said Chandauka had ""sued the charity"" to remain in her position after trustees asked her to step down, adding that they would also share their concerns with the Charity Commission.

The regulator told AFP it was ""aware of concerns about the governance of Sentebale"".

""We are assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps,"" it said.

                A goal from Enzo Fernandez helped Argentina to a memorable victory over Brazil as they secured their qualification for next year's World Cup.
            

In the end, Argentina's spot at the 2026 World Cup was confirmed before they kicked a ball, due to Bolivia's draw with Uruguay in an earlier kick-off, but the Albiceleste made sure they would be heading to the tournament in style by brushing old rivals Brazil aside with a comprehensive 4-1 home win.

Fernandez, featuring as a striker for Argentina in this match, put his side two goals ahead 12 minutes in with a confident strike inside the box, then provided the cross for Alexis Mac Allister to get their third before half-time.





Defending world champions Argentina never looked back, as they became the first South American side to seal their qualification, joining Japan, New Zealand, Iran and the host nations Canada, Mexico and the USA in being assured of a place at the next World Cup.

Estevao, who will join Chelsea after his 18th birthday, was an unused substitute for Brazil, who dropped down to fourth in the table but remain on course for a spot at the World Cup, with the top six teams in South America qualifying automatically.





Another beneficiary of that result were Ecuador, after Moises Caicedo captained them to a 0-0 draw away at Chile. Combined with their win over Venezuela last week and Brazil's loss, that leaves Ecuador second in the table and well placed to qualify, despite starting the campaign with a three-point deduction.

There was little in the way of goalmouth action as they earned this point in Chile, although Ecuador did have a goal ruled out by VAR, but it was a result which benefited Caicedo and Ecuador far more than their opponents. Kendry Paez, another who will join the Blues after turning 18, was among the Ecuador substitutes.

Britain's Royal Society has decided the scientific academy will not take any action against a famous member, U.S. tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, after fellows met to discuss potential disciplinary measures, British media reported on Wednesday.

The Royal Society, which began in 1660 and is the oldest national scientific academy in continuous existence, said last month that it would hold a meeting to discuss ""principles around the public pronouncements and behaviours of fellows"" after thousands of scientists expressed their concerns about Musk's membership.

Musk, who owns X and has been a close aide to Donald Trump since the US president took office in January, was elected as a fellow in 2018 for his technological achievements in space travel and electric vehicles.

The Guardian newspaper said Adrian Smith, the Royal Society's president, had written to members to rule out disciplinary proceedings. Past fellows of the Society have included Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking.



In a statement, The Royal Society said any issues about the behaviour of its fellows were dealt with in strict confidence.

But it added that the view of its governing council was ""that making judgements on the acceptability of the views and actions of fellows, particularly those that might be regarded as political, could do more harm than good to the Society and the cause of science in general"".

Almost 3,500 scientists had signed an open letter expressing dismay at what they described as ""continued silence and apparent inaction"" from the Royal Society over Musk's fellowship.

They said Musk's behaviour, including what they said was embracing conspiracy theories, breached the Royal Society's code of conduct, while the situation had become more serious because of his position in Trump's administration, which they said had engaged in ""an assault on scientific research"".

Musk has not commented on X, his usual place for public remarks, on the scientists' letter.

Groups of protesters demand an end to the conflict in Gaza in a rare public show of opposition to Hamas, while the militant group claims the situation is being exploited by ""suspicious political agendas"".

Wednesday 26 March 2025 15:39, UK

Anti-Hamas chants have been heard in a rare sign of dissent in northern Gaza during a protest in which hundreds of Palestinians called for an end to the war.

Footage and images shared on social media showed people chanting, ""Hamas out"", as they marched down a street in Beit Lahiya surrounded by buildings damaged in the conflict.

People were also shown chanting, ""We don't want war"", while holding banners saying, ""We are dying"" and 'Stop the war"".

One witness, who did not want to be named, said: ""It was a spontaneous rally against the war because people are tired and they have no place to go.

""Many chanted slogans against Hamas, not all people, but many, saying 'out Hamas'.

""People are exhausted and no one should blame them.""

Middle East correspondent

The protests in Gaza are potentially significant, but too complicated to be portrayed as being simply anti-Hamas demonstrations.

Whilst some of the protestors have been seen openly calling for Hamas to go, others are calling for an end to the killing of women and children by Israel, and some are angry at inflated food prices because of the ongoing humanitarian blockade. It is a mixed picture. 

Although they remain small, and only in a handful of districts for now, any dissent against Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2006, is unusual and therefore notable.

It suits Israel to claim this is a sign that military pressure against Hamas is working, and to a limited extent that might have some merit, but Hamas's rivals, Fatah, also have reason to exaggerate anti-Hamas feeling amongst Palestinians.

Further complicating things, many Palestinians have historically opposed Hamas as a governing body, but at the same time supported them as a resistance to Israeli occupation.

There are some external indicators that suggest ongoing moves to replace Hamas in Gaza – an Israeli red line if the war is to end.

There have been reports, as yet unconfirmed, that Jordan and other Arab countries have been examining plans to relocate up to three thousand Hamas leaders and fighters, although there is no suggestion where they would go.

The White House, and Israel, have criticised a joint Arab plan for the future of Gaza because it doesn't include any suggestion to replace Hamas, so there is an incentive for that to be addressed if the plan is to be adopted.

If the protests grow and spread, then there is a dangerous risk of intra-Palestinian violence in Gaza, and I would expect a number of players – Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Arab governments – to seize the energy of opposition as they pursue their own competing agendas for the future of Gaza.

Videos and photographs shared on social media were said to have been taken on 25 March.

Senior Hamas official Basem Naim said people had the right to protest at the suffering inflicted by the war.

But he denounced what he claimed were ""suspicious political agendas"" exploiting the situation.

He said: ""Where are they from, what is happening in the West Bank?

""Why don't they protest against the aggression there or allow people to take to the streets to denounce this aggression?""

The comments, reflecting tensions among Palestinian factions over the future of Gaza, came several hours after the rival Fatah movement called on Hamas to ""respond to the call of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip"".

Fatah leads the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the protest showed Israel's decision to renew its offensive was working in Gaza, where Hamas police - the group's enforcers - have again disappeared after emerging during a ceasefire.

More than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli campaign in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.

The Hamas-run authority does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but has previously said more than half of those killed in the conflict were women and children.

The war began when Hamas militants carried out a cross-border raid into southern Israel on 7 October 2023, killing 1,200 people and capturing around 250 hostages.

Israel responded with an air and ground offensive in Gaza.","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

 MADRID, - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez suggested on Wednesday his government could roll over the budget for a second year and start working on a new bill for 2026, as the chances of passing one this year in the fragmented lower house dwindle. 

 Spain's centre-left minority coalition faces a balancing act in every vote as it weighs concessions to several other parties from across the spectrum that support it on a vote-by-vote basis and which have often opposing demands, such as the hard-left Podemos and centre-right Junts. 

 Such a balance is even harder to achieve now Sanchez has pledged to increase Spain's defence spending in line with the rest of the European Union, an issue that has split his cabinet. 

 The government had initially promised to submit a budget bill before the end of the first quarter, but it wants to have secured the support of all its allies before doing so. In the meantime, Spain is rolling over its 2023 spending plan, as it did last year. 

 However, Sanchez did not completely rule out submitting a 2025 spending plan - which would need to happen before the end of May. 

 ""If we have time to get a budget this year, we will do it, and if not, we'll start working on the 2026 budget,"" he told lawmakers after announcing he would outline and start implementing a plan to boost the defence sector before the summer. 

 Sanchez was replying to opposition leader Alberto Nunez Feijoo, who told the premier he should not leave the parliament without saying if he was going to submit a budget for 2025. 

 ""The budget is the first point of any defence plan,"" Nunez Feijoo said. He said it should not be seen as normal ""to face this context with an expired budget of a majority that no longer exists"". 

 Sanchez has said he could increase defence spending without going through parliament, drawing criticism from the opposition.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday denounced the latest attacks from Russia, which launched over a hundred drones overnight, hours after agreeing to outlines of a Black Sea ceasefire.

Zelensky spoke after the US said it brokered the agreements during talks with both sides in Saudi Arabia, as President Donald Trump pushes for a quick end to the Russian invasion, which has stretched for over three years.

But questions over implementation remained as the Kremlin said the agreement to halt strikes on the Black Sea could come into force only after the lifting of restrictions on its agriculture sector.

""Launching such large-scale attacks after ceasefire negotiations is a clear signal to the whole world that Moscow is not going to pursue real peace,"" Zelensky said on social media.

Russia launched 117 drones over Ukraine overnight, out of which 56 were downed and 48 were lost from radar without causing damage, the air force said.

But drones damaged buildings in the central city of Kryvyi Rig and in the border region of Sumy, according to the regional administrations, which published photos of buildings ablaze.

Frontline regions also came under fire, including in the eastern Donetsk region where three people were killed in the past 24 hours, according to governor Vadym Filashkin.

""There must also be clear pressure and strong action from the world on Russia -- more pressure, more sanctions from the United States -- to stop Russian strikes,"" Zelensky said.

“Finding Shadi” follows the story of Suleiman al-Youssef, a father in Damascus, as he searches for his missing son, Shadi, who disappeared into Syria's prison system more than a decade ago.

 Shadi was 25 years old when he was arrested at a checkpoint in 2013. His family said he hadn't been politically active, but like many young men during the country's uprising, he was taken by security forces without explanation and never heard from again. For years, Shadi's family attempted to trace his whereabouts in the vast network of secret detention sites maintained by the oppressive Assad regime.  On Dec. 8, 2024, Damascus was liberated and Bashar al-Assad's regime overthrown; the doors of prisons were suddenly opened, allowing prisoners who had been held for years to walk free. Videos of released detainees began circulating online, offering glimpses of hope for families like Suleiman's, who had no word of their detained loved ones for years. In one of those videos, Sulieman saw a quick glimpse of a gaunt man in a black sweatshirt rushing out of Saydnaya prison. “When I saw the video, I knew,” Suleiman said. “It's my son. Even if he was among millions of people, I'd still be able to recognize him.” We met Suleiman in a hospital in central Damascus just days after the liberation. We followed him as he embarked on a winding and emotionally charged search across the city, trying to retrace the steps of the man in the video by interviewing shopkeepers, bystanders and anyone who might have seen him after his release. Suleiman's story is just one of hundreds of thousands like it in Syria. More than 100,000 Syrians remain forcibly disappeared by the Assad regime, according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights. Saydnaya prison, where Suleiman thinks his son may have been held, became internationally known as one of the most brutal and secretive detention sites in the country. Since the start of the Syrian civil war, tens of thousands of detainees are believed to have died in custody from torture, starvation, illness or execution. As we documented Suleiman's search, our team did our own investigation. We spent months scouring missing persons groups online, meeting with activists, former detainees and experts on Syria's prison system to find leads that could identify the man in the video and bring answers to Suleiman's family. Suleiman's personal journey mirrors the experience of so many Syrians trying to trace loved ones in a country long defined by secrecy, trauma and mass incarceration. What began as a search for one man became an exploration of identity and memory as Syria and its citizens attempt to rebuild. Write to Ben C. Solomon at ben.solomon@wsj.com

With Russian troops ravaging their native Kharkiv, Nikita Demydov and his wife Alina were offered a way out when the United States welcomed them and their five-year-old daughter as part of a humanitarian program.

But that welcome is now being withdrawn under President Donald Trump, whose administration has suspended ""Uniting for Ukraine,"" which allowed more than 200,000 Ukrainians to legally reside in the country.

""We have IDs, a Social Security number, a work permit,"" said Demydov, 39, who has put down roots and started several small construction businesses in San Diego.

""If the new government cancels it, we'll lose everything again, one more time, and start from scratch again.""

The humanitarian program was begun under then-president Joe Biden in April 2022 to offer safety to some of the thousands of Ukrainians fleeing the Russian advance.

Many of them had found their way to the US southern border, joining desperate people from Central and Southern America seeking asylum in the US.

Biden also established admission programs for people fleeing authoritarian regimes in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua.

But almost as soon as Trump took power, he began making good on his promise to shut the border and drastically reduce migration.

The programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans have been terminated, while that for Ukrainians has been paused.

That stoppage has left tens of thousands of Ukrainians in limbo and in fear.

""This program gave Ukrainians the chance for stability,"" said Ester Miroshnychenko, an 18-year-old high school student who moved to the United States with her parents and eight siblings in 2022.

""If I have to leave everything, it's gonna be really hard for me. It's gonna be like everything that I achieved is gonna be destroyed,"" said Miroshnychenko, who didn't speak English when she arrived in the United States.

""I would say to them... think about actual people who worked hard, who left everything behind, and they still find motivation to continue even after war.

""Taking away those opportunities... for what?""

Demydov says the winds of anti-migrant intolerance blowing from Washington are completely out of step with his daily experience in a country where he has always felt welcomed.

""You will not see it from the regular people,"" he said.

""American people are happy to have us here. But at the highest level... I'm a little bit... not even confused. I'm scared.""

Vlad Fedoryshyn, who settled in the United States in 2020 and became a liaison and supporter for Ukrainians who arrived under the humanitarian program, receives between 20 and 30 calls a day from people fretting about what will happen to them.

Many are beginning to see the impact of the program's pause, with their work permits and other applications paralyzed.

""People are very worried,"" he said.

""When you hear from the government that, hey, we're not going to have (this) program for you anymore... what does that mean?"" asked Fedoryshyn, who works for a mailing company.

""It was super hard for them to rent an apartment, to find a job, to just establish their life here,"" he added. ""And when this thing happened, they don't know what's going to happen with their parole, they start feeling unsafe.""

Fedoryshyn, 26, believes the Trump administration does not really understand what is happening on the ground in Ukraine, where civilians come under frequent attack from invading Russian forces.

The sudden about-face in US policy towards his country is upsetting and disorientating.

""We are a small country,"" said Fedoryshyn, who learned in textbooks that the United States and other European countries were allies and protectors of Ukraine.

For him, seeing Trump rebuke President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House last month was very difficult to swallow.

""We were always relying on this protection. And right now, when Trump was talking to the President like that... I almost was crying.""

Fedoryshyn says he finds it difficult to believe that other countries, which opened their doors to Ukrainians at the beginning of the war, will want to welcome more migrants.

But returning is almost impossible.

""Are you going to want to go back to Ukraine, where the war continues, where missiles could fall or a drone could hit your house any day?"" he said. ""They just want to be safe.""

 LONDON, - Britain's Prince Harry said he was ""in shock"" after quitting as a patron of Sentebale, a British charity he set up to help young people with HIV and Aids in Lesotho and Botswana, following a row between trustees and the chair of the board. 

 Harry, the younger son of King Charles, co-founded Sentebale in 2006 in honour of his mother Princess Diana nine years after she was killed in a Paris car crash. Sentebale means 'forget-me-not' in the local language of Lesotho in southern Africa. 

 Co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, as well as the board of trustees, joined Harry in leaving Sentebale following a dispute with chair Sophie Chandauka, who has taken legal action to try to retain her position. 

 ""It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,"" Harry and Seeiso said in a joint statement published on Sky News on Wednesday. 

 Harry, who lives in California with his wife Meghan and two children, stopped working as a member of the royal family in 2020. He has been heavily involved in causes in Africa for many years and visited Nigeria last year. 

 The trustees had acted in the best interests of the charity in asking the chair to step down, the joint statement said. 

 ""Although we may no longer be Patrons, we will always be its founders, and we will never forget what this charity is capable of achieving when it is in the right care,"" it added. 

 Reuters has contacted Britain's Charity Commission and Sentebale for comment.

 Sweden will increase defence spending by about 300 billion kronor over the next decade, the prime minister said Wednesday, calling it the nation's biggest rearmament push since the Cold War. 

 The Nordic country drastically slashed defence spending after the Cold War ended and in the early 2000s, but reversed course following Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea. 

 The aim was to increase defence spending to 3.5 percent of GDP by 2030, up from the current 2.4 percent. 

 ""We have a completely new security situation... and uncertainties will remain for a long time,"" Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told reporters, adding that it marks Sweden's ""biggest rearmament since the Cold War"". 

 The Nordic country dropped two centuries of military non-alignment and applied for membership in NATO in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, becoming its 32nd member in March 2024. 

 Sweden has already decided on investments that are expected to put defence spending at 2.6 percent of GDP in a few years, Kristersson said, noting this already put it above NATO's two-percent spending target. 

 ""That is not enough,"" Kristersson said. ""Our assessment is that NATO and especially European NATO countries need to take major steps in the coming years."" 

 Kristersson said that his country expected that NATO would decide to increase the spending target at an upcoming summit of the alliance in June and was aiming at what it was believed that new target would be. 

 In March 2022, after Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, Stockholm announced it would increase spending, aiming to dedicate two percent of GDP to defence ""as soon as possible"". 

 While previous defence spending increases have been financed through the country's regular budget, Kristersson said that in order to rearm in such short time it was necessary to borrow funds for defence during a ""transitional period"". 

 ""Today's announcement can really be summed up as a larger, faster and stronger total defence, both civilian and military,"" Deputy Prime Minister and Energy Minister Ebba Busch said, speaking alongside Kristersson.

 US President Donald Trump has turbocharged a drive for Europe to rearm by casting doubt on Washington's central role in NATO and his overtures towards Russia on Ukraine. 

 Earlier this month, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen unveiled an initiative to help ramp up military budgets that she says could mobilise up to 800 billion euros. 

 Jacob Westberg, an associate professor at the Swedish Defence University, told AFP that, while 3.5-percent-of-GDP target was a sharp increase compared to the low spending levels seen in the early 2000s, it was still comparable to what was spent in the 1970s. 

 Westberg noted that Sweden spent over four percent of GDP in the 1950s and in fact at the time had the world's fourth largest air force and eighth largest navy. 

 ""We could mobilise between 600,000 and 800,000 men during the Cold War,"" Westberg said. 

 He also added that while 300 billion kroner over a decade was a considerable addition, Sweden's defence budget had already been tripled, to 120 billion a year, in 2024, compared to a decade earlier. 

 In addition, while funding was returning to previous levels, rebuilding a country's military takes time, Westberg said. 

 ""In some areas, such as buying ammunition or equipment... you can relatively easily convert funds into military capacity,"" the associate professor said. 

 But when it comes to the issue of expanding the size of the military, which has been Sweden's ambition since it reintroduced conscription in 2017 after a seven year pause, that is more time-consuming. 

 ""As such, you can't expect these funds to have an immediate effect comparable to the amount of additional funds,"" Westberg said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news","South Korea Wildfires Kill 18, Cause ""Unprecedented Damage""","https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/south-korea-wildfires-kill-at-least-18-declared-national-emergency-8012583","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:08:11 GMT","

At least 19 people have been killed in one of South Korea's worst wildfire outbreaks, with multiple raging blazes causing ""unprecedented damage"", the acting president said Wednesday.

More than a dozen fires broke out over the weekend, scorching wide swathes of the southeast, forcing around 27,000 people to urgently evacuate, with the fire cutting off roads and downing communications lines as residents fled in panic.

Overnight into Wednesday, the death count jumped to 19 as wind-driven flames tore through neighbourhoods and razed an ancient temple.

Eighteen people were killed in the wildfires and a pilot in a firefighting helicopter died when his aircraft crashed in a mountain area, officials said.

According to the interior ministry, the wildfires have charred 17,398 hectares (42,991 acres), with the blaze in Uiseong county alone accounting for 87 percent of the total.

The government has raised the crisis alert to its highest level and taken the rare step of transferring thousands of inmates out of prisons in the area.

""Wildfires burning for a fifth consecutive day... are causing unprecedented damage,"" South Korea's acting president Han Duck-soo said.

He told an emergency safety and disaster meeting that the blazes were ""developing in a way that is exceeding both existing prediction models and earlier expectations.""

""Throughout the night, chaos continued as power and communication lines were cut in several areas and roads were blocked,"" he added. 

In the city of Andong, some evacuees sheltering in an elementary school gym told AFP they had to flee so quickly they could bring nothing with them.

""The wind was so strong,"" Kwon So-han, a 79-year-old resident in Andong told AFP, adding that as soon as he got the evacuation order he fled.

""The fire came from the mountain and fell on my house,"" he said.

""Those who haven't experienced it won't know. I could only bring my body.""

'Most devastating'

Authorities had been using helicopters to battle the blazes, but suspended all such operations after a helicopter crashed Wednesday, killing the pilot on board.

Authorities said changing wind patterns and dry weather had revealed the limitations of conventional firefighting methods.

Thousands of firefighters have been deployed, but ""strong winds reaching speeds of 25 metres per second persisted from yesterday afternoon through the night, forcing the suspension of helicopter and drone operations,"" acting president Han said.

The fires are ""the most devastating"" yet in South Korea, Han said.

By Wednesday, one of the fires was threatening historic Hahoe Folk Village -- a UNESCO-listed world heritage site popular with tourists but now under an emergency alert.

Huge plumes of smoke turned the sky over the village grey, AFP reporters saw, with fire trucks and police cars lined up at the edges of the historic site.

'Fireballs'

Last year was South Korea's hottest year on record, with the Korea Meteorological Administration saying that the average annual temperature was 14.5 degrees Celsius -- two degrees higher than the preceding 30-year average of 12.5 degrees.

The fire-hit region had been experiencing unusually dry weather with below-average precipitation, authorities have said, with the South experiencing more than double the number of fires this year than last.

Some types of extreme weather have a well-established link with climate change, such as heatwaves or heavy rainfall.

Other phenomena, such as forest fires, droughts, snowstorms and tropical storms can result from a combination of complex factors.

""We can't say that it's only due to climate change, but climate change is directly (and) indirectly affecting the changes we are experiencing now. This is a sheer fact,"" Yeh Sang-Wook, professor of climatology at Seoul's Hanyang University, told AFP.

""Wildfires will become more frequent,"" he added. 

""Basically, as the atmosphere becomes warmer due to climate change, the water vapour in the ground evaporates more easily, so the amount of moisture contained in the ground decreases. So, all this creates the conditions wildfires can occur more frequently.""

The major fire in Uiseong was reportedly caused by a person tending to a family grave who accidentally ignited the blaze.

Apple farmer Cho Jae-oak told AFP that he and his wife had sprayed water around their house all day in a desperate bid to protect it.

""We kept spraying and guarded. When the fire was burning on the mountain, fireballs flew here,"" he said, adding that the encroaching flames eventually forced them to leave.

A Chinese woman who had been drinking wastewater for five years due to a pipe mix-up suffered liver damage. Ms Li from Shanghai claimed to have experienced irregular periods for the previous six months and reportedly suffered minimal liver damage, which was confirmed during a hospital visit a month ago,  South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported.

""No wonder I've had diarrhoea so often in recent years and had abnormal results in my check-ups. I never suspected the issue could be with the water source,"" Ms Liu said.

She added the wastewater, which contains plenty of chemical materials, might have harmed her health. ""But I do not have evidence to prove the connection between the wastewater and my health issues,"" she added.

In September 2020, Li got a water purifier installed by Xiaomi, the top consumer goods producer in China. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that she purchased a ""water quality pen"" equipment and noticed anomalies.

The tester revealed the water coming from her purifier was worse than what the tap provided.

The purifier's water had a density of 600, more than twice that of the tap water, per the device that measures TDS (total dissolved solids), a crucial indicator of purity.

There are reportedly 321 mg/L of TDS in the tap water in her region. And, the purifier's manufacturer claims the machine's water should have TDS levels of 24 mg/L. However, Ms Liu was appalled when the tester reported 607 mg/L.

She called a technician and found the two pipes had been connected incorrectly by the first technician. It meant the cleaned water was discharged into the sewer, but the ""concentrated water,"" a type of wastewater, was what Ms Liu drank in the last five years.

According to reports, the purifier's manufacturer assured to pay Ms Liu back the full price she paid for the device. But she rejected the offer of a settlement. She is currently seeking medical evidence that the plumbing error was the actual cause of her illnesses.

Xiaomi agreed to replace a filter element in the machine, said a Xiaomi employee with the last name Zhang. The company is currently debating how to handle the situation. Zhang claimed the employee who initially installed the purifier five years ago left the company and was unreachable.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

India and China have made progress on the modalities to resume Kailash Manasarovar Yatra in 2025, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said following the official consultation between the Foreign Ministries of India and China, held in Beijing on Wednesday.

Gourangalal Das, Joint Secretary (East Asia) at the MEA held a consultative meeting with Liu Jinsong, Director General of the Department of Asian Affairs of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during which the two sides reviewed the action taken by them to implement the strategic direction as also the specific steps agreed in the meeting between Foreign Secretary and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister in January 2025 to stabilise and rebuild ties.

""They took positive note of the developments in bilateral relations since the meeting of the leaders of India and China in October 2024. In the intervening period, the Foreign Ministers have met twice, while the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question have held their 23rd meeting. These high-level meetings have provided strategic guidance to stabilise and further develop relations,"" read a statement issued by the MEA.

""They agreed to continue efforts to further facilitate and promote people-to-people exchanges, including arrangements for resumption of direct flights, interaction of media and think-tanks, and celebration of the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations. The two sides have made further progress on the modalities to resume Kailash Manasarovar Yatra in 2025,"" it added.

The MEA stated that both sides also took stock of the planned exchanges and activities this year, discussing resumption of dialogue mechanisms in a step-by-step manner to utilise them to address each other's priority areas of interest and concern and move relations on to a more stable and predictable path.

On Tuesday, India and China comprehensively reviewed the situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the India-China border areas and early resumption of cross-border cooperation - including trans-border rivers and Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra - during the 33rd meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) held in Beijing.



While Das led the Indian delegation at the meeting, Hong Liang, Director General of the Boundary and Oceanic Affairs Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, headed the Chinese delegation.

The meeting, the MEA said, was held in a ""positive"" and ""constructive"" atmosphere.

""Peace and tranquility on the border are critical for the smooth development of overall bilateral relations. The two sides explored various measures and proposals to give effect to the decisions taken during the 23rd meeting of the Special Representatives on the India-China boundary question in Beijing in December 2024 and to advance effective border management,"" read a MEA statement issued after the meeting.

""The two sides agreed to maintain and strengthen relevant diplomatic and military mechanisms towards this end. They also exchanged views on early resumption of cross-border cooperation and exchanges, including on trans-border rivers and Kailash-Mansarovar Yatra,"" it added.

During the meeting, both countries agreed to work together to make substantial preparations for the next meeting of the Special Representatives (SR), which will be held in India later this year. The Indian delegation leader also paid a courtesy call on China's Assistant Foreign Minister Hong Lei.

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had visited Beijing on January 26-27 for a meeting of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Foreign Minister mechanism between both countries, following which both countries announced their decision to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in the summer of 2025.

The meeting was held to review the state of India-China bilateral relations, as agreed between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in Kazan last October.

During their discussions, Foreign Secretary Misri and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong agreed to take certain people-centric steps to stabilise and rebuild ties.

Both sides also agreed, in principle, to resume direct air services between the two countries with the relevant technical authorities on the two sides to negotiate an updated framework for the purpose at an early date.

 JAKARTA, Indonesia — France and Indonesia 's top diplomats inked Wednesday a new maritime security project aiming “to ensure peace and safety” at sea in the Indo-Pacific region. 

 French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot's visit to Jakarta, his second stop in his four-day Asia tour after Singapore, comes amid ongoing trade tensions between the European Union and Beijing. 

 He told reporters on Wednesday that the Indo-Pacific Port Security Project ""is close to my heart,” promising France's support. 

 Neither he nor his Indonesian counterpart Sugiono shared what the project will entail. 

 Earlier this month, during a discussion of the project at the Ottawa Conference on Security and Defence, Indonesia's naval chief of staff, Admiral Muhammad Ali, said it would address various maritime security challenges, including piracy, terrorism, and illegal activities at sea, and would likely involve collaboration among countries in the Indo-Pacific. 

 Sugiono, who like many Indonesians uses a single name, said the “maritime collaboration is important to realize a stable, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific.” 

 Barrot said the project will support Indonesia as the world's largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands, with a focus on two Indonesian ports in Jakarta and Surabaya cities “in their sustainability and security.” 

 The two diplomats, who signed the project's agreement at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations headquarters in the Indonesian capital, said they also discussed strengthening their strategic partnerships and enhancing cooperation in various fields. 

 Military cooperation between France and Indonesia has grown in recent years. 

 French air force planes made a stopover in July In Jakarta as part of a visit to Southeast Asia that was meant to display France's commitment to security in the Indo-Pacific region. 

 Last year, Indonesia purchased 42 Rafale and Dassault Aviation fighter jets and is expected to receive the first Rafale jets under the contract in 2026. It also announced the purchase of two French Scorpene Evolved submarines and 13 Thales Ground Control Interception radars. Five of the radar systems are expected to be installed in the country's future capital, Nusantara, on Borneo island. 

 Barrot's visit is also expected to help lay the groundwork for a meeting between Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto and French President Emmanuel Macron who is expected to visit the Southeast Asian country in May. 

 The French diplomatic set to travel to Beijing and economic powerhouse Shanghai on Thursday and Friday.

A bug is affecting the image-generation capabilities of ChatGPT and it will be fixed, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said. His response came to a social media post on X, pointing out that ChatGPT's latest model could create images of ""sexy men"" but refused to generate anything when told to draw ""sexy women.""

The chatbot, asked to ""draw a sexy woman,"" responded it ""couldn't generate that image because it goes against our policy,"" according to a screenshot shared by the X user.

It further said, ""If you have another idea or a different kind of image in mind-artistic, fantasy-themed, stylish, or anything else-I'd be happy to help! Just let me know what you're thinking.""

The post soon received a response from Mr Altman, who wrote: ""That's a bug, should be allowed, will fix.""

Then, in a tongue-in-cheek remark, the Open AI CEO said: ""Hot guy though!"" He was talking about the image generated by ChatGPT's latest model, GPT-4o, which comes with an integrated image generation tool.

hot guy though!

The 39-year-old had earlier announced that the image feature in ChatGPT was launched but some users may face delays, for the rollout was still in progress.

He asked people to try again in some time as the feature becomes more widely available. He wrote, ""The new version of images in ChatGPT is still rolling out, so please try again later today if you don't get a great one.""

OpenAI's new feature allows ChatGPT users to create images using its advanced AI model. Mr Altman called GPT-4o a powerful tool that gives people more control over how their images look.

The new image-generation function was made feasible by training GPT-4o on both proprietary data from its collaborations with companies such as Shutterstock and ""publicly available data,"" according to a statement released by OpenAI to the Wall Street Journal.

A ceasefire will cover the Black Sea after the US held separate talks with Russia and Ukraine. But what are the details of the agreement?

Wednesday 26 March 2025 11:06, UK

Russia and Ukraine have agreed to a Black Sea ceasefire deal.

The agreement came after Ukraine and US delegations held talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

But what is the Black Sea deal - and is it a full ceasefire?

Follow live: Kyiv and Moscow dispute Black Sea ceasefire details

What is in the Black Sea ceasefire deal?

These are the main aspects of the deal set out by the US:

• The US and Russia have agreed to safe navigation in the Black Sea, which had been a key focus of talks this week• Additionally, they agreed to work together on measures banning strikes on energy infrastructure in Russia and Ukraine• Washington will also help to restore Russia's access to global markets for agricultural and fertiliser exports, the White House said - although where this leaves Western sanctions against Russia is unclear at this stage.

The US also said it has agreed it will remain committed to returning forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.

Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov confirmed the agreement, but added that Kyiv maintains any movement by Russian military vessels outside of eastern part of the Black Sea will constitute violation of the spirit of this agreement.

""In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence,"" he said.

He added: ""All parties agreed to develop measures for implementing the presidents' agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities of Ukraine and Russia.""

Kirill Dmitriev, one of Russia's negotiators, welcomed it on X as ""a major shift toward peace"".

The Kremlin has confirmed that it has agreed to the ceasefire - but complications have already arisen.

Immediate disputes over ceasefire deal

Just hours after the ceasefire deal was announced, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Kremlin were at odds over the timing and conditions.

The Ukrainian president said he understood the ceasefire came into effect immediately upon the US announcement, but Moscow said it would only come into force after Western sanctions were lifted against companies involved in food and fertiliser exports.

The US had said it agreed to ""help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions"".

Donald Trump later said his administration was ""looking into"" Russian requests to lift sanctions.

The sanctions it wants lifted include those against:

On Wednesday morning - the day after the agreement was reached - Ukraine reported downing seven Russian drones over the port city of Mykolaiv, while Russia said it had destroyed nine Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea - though it was not immediately clear whether they were aimed at Black Sea targets or just flying over the waters.

No deaths or injuries were reported by either country.

How significant is the ceasefire deal?

The deal won't do much to end the war, according to Sky News' security analyst Michael Clarke.

He says Russia will be quite happy dragging the US through peace talks without making any meaningful concessions.

The deal is one the US ""can boast about"" - without it changing much on the ground for Ukraine, he says.

""The Russians will be quite happy about that because they'll just keep going down more and more rabbit holes and they'll present little gains for the US,"" he explains.

""But they won't address the central issue,"" he says.

No real deal can be agreed unless Donald Trump starts putting meaningful pressure on Vladimir Putin, he says.

""Unless the Americans are prepared to pressure Russia as opposed to just keeping offering them more advantages, the war will just go on.""

He also says Mr Trump will stay interested until it ""gets difficult"", at which point he'll ""just go onto something else"".

""He's a disrupter, but when disruption becomes hard to follow through, he goes on to the next topic, and I think that's what will happen.""

Why is Russia willing to agree to a ceasefire at sea now?

Under the ceasefire at sea, Russia would once again be able to export farm produce and fertiliser through the Black Sea, getting relief from sanctions imposed by Western countries.

The US even referred to helping Russia access the world market for agricultural products again.

According to Prof Clarke, Russia is happy to continue fighting on land, where it is slowly making gains, while signing up to something that protects its ships at sea - where Ukraine has been growing in confidence and damaging Russian vessels.

And it helps with Russia's goal of getting its equipment out of the Black Sea.

Why is the Black Sea so important to Russia?

The agreement has come in the midst of negotiations between Russia, the US and Ukraine in Riyadh in recent days centred on the Black Sea.

But the basis of the negotiations was a deal to secure shipping there that collapsed more than 18 months ago.

That UN-backed deal was negotiated in July 2022 between Turkey, the UN and Russia as a way of ensuring that Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world, could keep exporting grain via its southern ports without being attacked.

It was known as the Black Sea grain initiative.

That deal benefited Russia, as it also allowed for greater Russian agricultural exports - but but Moscow pulled out of the initiative in July 2023 after accusing the West of reneging on this part of the agreement.

This meant Russia stopped granting safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine, and the country's grain exports subsequently slumped.

But Russia is now said to be keen to revive parts of the grain deal.

What happened the last time Ukraine and Russia had a ceasefire agreement?

Last week, Mr Putin agreed to an immediate 30-day pause in strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

However, within 24 hours Ukraine and Russia accused the other of breaking the pledge.","{'href': 'https://news.sky.com', 'title': 'Sky News'}"

So, about that Signal chat.

On Monday, shortly after we published a story about a massive Trump-administration security breach, a reporter asked the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, why he had shared plans about a forthcoming attack on Yemen on the Signal messaging app. He answered, “Nobody was texting war plans.

At a Senate hearing yesterday, the director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, and the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, John Ratcliffe, were both asked about the Signal chat, to which Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, was inadvertently invited by National Security Adviser Michael Waltz. “There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal group,” Gabbard told members of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Ratcliffe said much the same: “My communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.”

President Donald Trump, asked yesterday afternoon about the same matter, said, “It wasn't classified information.”

These statements presented us with a dilemma. In The Atlantic's initial story about the Signal chat—the “Houthi PC small group,” as it was named by Waltz—we withheld specific information related to weapons and to the timing of attacks that we found in certain texts. As a general rule, we do not publish information about military operations if that information could possibly jeopardize the lives of U.S. personnel. That is why we chose to characterize the nature of the information being shared, not specific details about the attacks.

Read: The Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans

The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump—combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts—have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions. There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared.

Experts have repeatedly told us that use of a Signal chat for such sensitive discussions poses a threat to national security. As a case in point, Goldberg received information on the attacks two hours before the scheduled start of the bombing of Houthi positions. If this information—particularly the exact times American aircraft were taking off for Yemen—had fallen into the wrong hands in that crucial two-hour period, American pilots and other American personnel could have been exposed to even greater danger than they ordinarily would face. The Trump administration is arguing that the military information contained in these texts was not classified—as it typically would be—although the president has not explained how he reached this conclusion.

Yesterday, we asked officials across the Trump administration if they objected to us publishing the full texts. In emails to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, and the White House, we wrote, in part: “In light of statements today from multiple administration officials, including before the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the information in the Signal chain about the Houthi strike is not classified, and that it does not contain ‘war plans,' The Atlantic is considering publishing the entirety of the Signal chain.”

We sent our first request for comment and feedback to national-security officials shortly after noon, and followed up in the evening after most failed to answer.

Late yesterday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emailed a response: “As we have repeatedly stated, there was no classified information transmitted in the group chat. However, as the CIA Director and National Security Advisor have both expressed today, that does not mean we encourage the release of the conversation. This was intended to be a an [sic] internal and private deliberation amongst high-level senior staff and sensitive information was discussed. So for those reason [sic] — yes, we object to the release.” (The Leavitt statement did not address which elements of the texts the White House considered sensitive, or how, more than a week after the initial air strikes, their publication could have bearing on national security.)

A CIA spokesperson asked us to withhold the name of John Ratcliffe's chief of staff, which Ratcliffe had shared in the Signal chain, because CIA intelligence officers are traditionally not publicly identified. Ratcliffe had testified earlier yesterday that the officer is not undercover and said it was “completely appropriate” to share their name in the Signal conversation. We will continue to withhold the name of the officer. Otherwise, the messages are unredacted.

Listen: Jeffrey Goldberg on the group chat that broke the internet

As we wrote on Monday, much of the conversation in the “Houthi PC small group” concerned the timing and rationale of attacks on the Houthis, and contained remarks by Trump-administration officials about the alleged shortcomings of America's European allies. But on the day of the attack—Saturday, March 15—the discussion veered toward the operational.

At 11:44 a.m. eastern time, Hegseth posted in the chat, in all caps, “TEAM UPDATE:”

The text beneath this began, “TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.” Centcom, or Central Command, is the military's combatant command for the Middle East. The Hegseth text continues:

Let us pause here for a moment to underscore a point. This Signal message shows that the U.S. secretary of defense texted a group that included a phone number unknown to him—Goldberg's cellphone—at 11:44 a.m. This was 31 minutes before the first U.S. warplanes launched, and two hours and one minute before the beginning of a period in which a primary target, the Houthi “Target Terrorist,” was expected to be killed by these American aircraft. If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests—or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media—the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds. The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.

The Hegseth text then continued:

Shortly after, Vice President J. D. Vance texted the group, “I will say a prayer for victory.”

At 1:48 p.m., Waltz sent the following text, containing real-time intelligence about conditions at an attack site, apparently in Sanaa: “VP. Building collapsed. Had multiple positive ID. Pete, Kurilla, the IC, amazing job.” Waltz was referring here to Hegseth; General Michael E. Kurilla, the commander of Central Command; and the intelligence community, or IC. The reference to “multiple positive ID” suggests that U.S. intelligence had ascertained the identities of the Houthi target, or targets, using either human or technical assets.

Six minutes later, the vice president, apparently confused by Waltz's message, wrote, “What?”

At 2 p.m., Waltz responded: “Typing too fast. The first target – their top missile guy – we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed.”

Vance responded a minute later: “Excellent.” Thirty-five minutes after that, Ratcliffe, the CIA director, wrote, “A good start,” which Waltz followed with a text containing a fist emoji, an American-flag emoji, and a fire emoji. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.

Later that afternoon, Hegseth posted: “CENTCOM was/is on point.” Notably, he then told the group that attacks would be continuing. “Great job all. More strikes ongoing for hours tonight, and will provide full initial report tomorrow. But on time, on target, and good readouts so far.”

It is still unclear why a journalist was added to the text exchange. Waltz, who invited Goldberg into the Signal chat, said yesterday that he was investigating “how the heck he got into this room.”

The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Biden administration effort to regulate “ghost gun” kits that allow people to easily obtain parts needed to assemble firearms from online sellers.

The decision by a court that often backs gun rights resolves the legal dispute over whether the kits can be regulated the same way as other firearms.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is requesting information from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff about whether they used Signal on personal devices as part of their jobs and is questioning whether the two were abroad during the chat involving The Atlantic's editor-in-chief. 

In a letter to the two Trump administration officials, Schiff wrote that he has grave concerns about their ""participation in highly sensitive Principals Committee deliberations about a planned military operation using the commercial messaging service Signal while you were both on foreign travel.""

“The national security breach caused by sharing sensitive military information over an unclassified messaging application is compounded by the fact that both of you, who are prime targets for foreign intelligence services, were traveling in high-threat environments that pose significant counterintelligence risks to U.S. personnel and devices,"" Schiff wrote. 

Schiff noted that public records show that Gabbard was on a multination tour to Asia that included stops in Japan, Thailand and India during the time of the Signal chat involving The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. 

The Democratic senator also said in his letter that reporting has revealed that Witkoff was in Russia at the time, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

""This means that Mr. Witkoff appeared to be receiving sensitive national intelligence information while in Moscow and, based on this timeline, may have been in direct meetings with the Kremlin when some of the messages were exchanged,"" Schiff said. 

Schiff asked that they respond to a number of questions in the letter by March 31, including whether they have used Signal for work-related purposes on their personal devices since Trump's inauguration.

The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow it to terminate about $600 million in Education Department grants.

The administration previously tried to terminate the grants, but a district judge blocked the move and ordered that the administration immediately reinstate the funds. The Trump administration is now asking the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court's decision.

""This case exemplifies a flood of recent suits that raise the question: 'Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever)' millions in taxpayer dollars,"" the government wrote.  

The group that originally sued to block the grant termination, authorized by Congress, argued that the funds are necessary to ""address nationwide teacher shortages and improve teacher quality by educating, placing, and supporting new teachers in hard-to-staff schools, especially in rural and other underserved communities, and in hard-to-staff subjects, such as math and special education.""

Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., told reporters today that he and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., are asking the administration for an “expedited” inspector general report into a Trump Cabinet-level chat that revealed military strike information to a journalist who was inadvertently included in the discussion. 

“We are signing a letter today asking the administration to expedite an IG report back to the committee,"" Wicker said. ""We're sending a similar letter to the administration in an attempt to get ground truth. We certainly want to know if the transcript that has been published is accurate.” 

Wicker said he is confident the Pentagon will follow through with a report despite Trump's firing of the Defense Department's inspector general, along with several other of the independent watchdogs at major departments, shortly after he took office. 

Asked if he thinks the information discussed in the Signal app chat was, or should have been, classified, Wicker said, “The information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.”

Wicker said he will also request a classified briefing for committee members from a “senior person” in the administration. Asked if that person should be Hegseth, Wicker said, “We will want someone that that actually has the facts and can speak on behalf of the administration.”

A majority of American voters are generally disappointed with the people President Donald Trump has appointed to posts in his administration, according to an NBC News poll earlier this month — a record share in a question NBC News has measured at the start of four previous administrations.

The survey was conducted March 7-11, before The Atlantic published a story Monday revealing that a number of senior Trump administration officials — including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, national security adviser Mike Waltz and others — participated in a Signal chat thread about plans to launch airstrikes against Houthi militants, in which Hegseth shared plans including the timing and types of aircraft used. 

The Signal thread included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, as well as Hegseth, Waltz, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and others.

Gabbard defended the group chat by reiterating an argument that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth can declassify information.

""Secretary Hegseth has the classification and declassification authority over DOD information,"" Gabbard said, referring to the Defense Department.

Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Penn., urged Gabbard to investigate the situation, speculating that it is ""likely to be more than just this chat.""

Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., pressed Gabbard about whether she stood by her testimony before the Senate yesterday that she did not recall discussions of specific weapons, timing or targets.

""My response in the Senate yesterday, yes, I stand by that response,"" Gabbard said. ""Obviously the release of the screenshots that came from that chat group today were a refresher on what happened. As I said earlier, I was not involved with that portion of the chat, so it did not come to my recollection yesterday.""

Gomez noted shortly after that the administration has said they want to ""drain the swamp."" ""But you have become that swamp in a matter of days,"" Gomez said. ""Not weeks or months. Days.""

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., defended the Trump administration officials who participated in the Signal chat that revealed sensitive military information to The Atlantic, even after the contents of the discussion were released this morning by the magazine. 

Cotton said he doesn't think Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth broke the law in discussing pending attacks in Yemen.

“There was no locations listed there,"" Cotton said. ""There were no sources of methods. There's no specific targets. Certainly, there was nothing called war plans, which was an embellishment and exaggeration by a known left-wing partisan opponent of the president.”

Cotton also said he doesn't see his committee investigating the security breach because “to the extent there was any allegation of classified information here, that was not information that was coming from either Tulsi Gabbard or John Ratcliffe. So, as far as I know, it's outside of our jurisdiction.”

When pressed on whether intelligence officers or the Department of Defense should share this kind of information on Signal in the future, Cotton noted that Ratcliffe said yesterday that the Signal messaging app had been installed on his computer at CIA.

“I'm sure the administration, like all administrations, will continue to review how it communicates inside and deliberates consistent with the requirements of operational security and presidential record-keeping rules,"" he said. ""But I think here the real story is the incredibly successful strikes in Yemen that has protected our sailors and protected our friends in Israel and international shipping, and that's where we should focus.”

Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., questioned Ratcliffe and Gabbard about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's drinking habits during his line of questioning about the Signal group chat information leak at this morning's House Intelligence Committee hearing. 

“The main person who was involved in this thread, that a lot of people want to talk to, is Secretary of Defense Hegseth, and a lot of questions were brought up regarding his drinking habits in his confirmation hearing,” Gomez said. “To your knowledge, do you know whether Pete Hegseth had been drinking before he leaked classified information?”

Ratcliffe denied that Hegseth had been drinking before texting detailed plans of the strike in Yemen over Signal and called Gomez's line of questioning “offensive.”  

“You don't want to focus on the good work the CIA is doing, the intelligence community…” Ratcliffe said in a raised voice, prompting Gomez to shout over him to “reclaim his time” for questions. 

“I have huge respect for the CIA, huge respect for men and women in uniform,” Gomez said. “But this was a question that's on the top of minds of every American right. He stood in front of the podium in Europe holding a drink. So of course, we want to know if his performance is compromised.”

At this morning's House Intelligence Committee hearing, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., cited the Trump administration's own language in pressing the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency on the administration's claim that a high-level Signal chat that revealed sensitive information on military strikes was unclassified. 

Krishnamoorthi read a Trump administration executive order on classified information, which holds that “information should be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations."" 

“We clearly have weapons systems that have been identified, that is classified information,” Krishnamoorthi said, pointing to a blown-up picture of the plans texted by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Signal group chat. “The reason why it's important that this information not be disclosed is that we don't want the adversaries to know what's about to happen.” 

.

The DIA director, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, argued that the military terms used in Hegseth's texts lacked specific context and could have been used in any number of operations.  

But Krishnamoorthi countered that “Secretary Hegsth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information,"" adding, ""He needs to resign immediately and a full investigation needs to be undertaken with regard to whether other similar Signal chats are occurring.”

Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, quipped about the emojis used in the Signal chat reacting to the Yemen strikes.

""I will note I always use fire emojis when I see terrorists getting killed,"" he said.

After the strikes in Yemen, Waltz responded in the group chat with the fist, American flag and fire emojis.

The judge who the government has argued can't be trusted with sensitive information in the Alien Enemies Act case has been assigned to a case about top government officials appearing to share sensitive information on the commercial messaging application Signal.  

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg in the District of Columbia has been assigned to oversee the case of American Oversight against top officials involved in a Signal group chat about an attack in Yemen. The lawsuit seeks to make sure the officials are not using the app to get around federal record-keeping requirements.    

“Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations,” the plaintiffs argue. 

Gabbard is one of the defendants in the case, and used the suit as argument for why she couldn't answer some questions about the group chat in today's House hearing. 

""As a result of that pending litigation, I'm limited in my ability to comment further"" on the case, she testified.  

Boasberg is overseeing a separate civil case in which alleged Venezuelan gang members have sued to stop from being deported under Trump's invocation of the rarely used Alien Enemies Act. The administration has refused to answer some of the judge's questions about the initial March 15 deportations in the case and suggested in a filing it did not believe the court could be trusted with such sensitive information. 

Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly bashed the judge for issuing a temporary restraining order in the case.

The Espionage Act, the law that often has been used in criminal cases involving leaks or mishandling of classified information, contains a provision making it crime to disclose national defense secrets “through gross negligence.” 

The law does not require that the information be classified, because it was written before the classification system existed. The law refers simply to “national defense information.”

The specific provision reads: “(e) whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blue print, plan, map, model, note, or information, relating to the national defense, through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be list, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.”

Brad Moss, an attorney whose practice is devoted to issues of security clearances and classified information, said that is “the most reasonably applicable provision from the Espionage Act both for Secretary Hegseth and for national security adviser Waltz,” referring to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and top Trump aide Mike Waltz, who took part in a high-level group chat onYemen strike plans that inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief.

This provision was cited by critics of the decision by the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton in connection with the classified information she and her aides discussed on an unsecure private email system.  

“In order to give Mrs. Clinton a pass, the FBI rewrote the statute, inserting an intent element that Congress did not require,” legal scholar Andrew McCarthy wrote for National Review, including bold type for emphasis. “The added intent element, moreover, makes no sense: The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets; when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence, they are guilty of serious wrongdoing.""

Moss said another law that seems to apply here is 18 USC 1924, which makes it a crime to remove classified information to retain it “at an unauthorized location.” While the law does require the material in question to be classified, Moss said there could be no doubt that the material disclosed in the Trump administration officials' group chat was classified.

“There's no way any reasonable person would think that military operational details or real time intelligence about military strikes is not classified, and if they do, they're not qualified to hold senior positions in the U.S. government,” he said.

Under normal circumstances, Moss said, the DNI would be conducting a damage assessment to figure out exactly information was shared in these chats on a non-government platform and to determine what information reached the reporter, and likely a criminal referral to the Justice Department would follow. 

Moss said he does not think that will happen under this administration. 

Trump officials have repeatedly said the messages in the Signal app chat included no classified information, and in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this morning, Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, continued to insist on that point. Gabbard also said the National Security Council was conducting a review of the incident. 

There is precedent for high-level officials getting in trouble for leaks or mishandling secrets. When the name of an undercover CIA officer was leaked during the George W. Bush administration, a special prosecutor was appointed that resulted in criminal charges against the vice president's chief of staff, Scooter Libby. In recent times, former CIA Director John Deutsch and former national security adviser Sandy Berger were among those disciplined for mishandling incidents. And former CIA Director David Petraeus was prosecuted a decade ago after he gave notebooks containing military secrets to someone writing a book about him.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said it was a ""lie"" to say that information discussed in the Signal chat would not be considered classified.

Castro asked National Security Agency Director Timothy Haugh whether similar information intercepted from China or Russia would have been considered classified information.

""We would classify based off of our sources and methods,"" Haugh answered.

Earlier, Castro said that ""the idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee, would not be classified, y'all know is a lie.""

""That's ridiculous. I've seen things much less sensitive be presented to us with high classification, and to say that it isn't is a lie to the country,"" he continued.

The government has repeatedly said there was no classified information in the group chat.

The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., pressed National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard on her reposting of tweets from a known right-wing Russian state media personality despite representing the United States intelligence community on the world stage in her official capacity. 

“I have one last question for you, because I think people really listen to what you have to say,” Himes said. ""You, on March 15, as DNI, retweeted a post from Ian Miles Cheong, who is listed on RT, that's Russia Today's website, as ‘a political and cultural commentator' who has contributed content to RT since at least 2022.” 

Russia Today is a known source of Russian state propaganda and has long been used as a tool of soft power to promote Russian interests on the world stage. The Department of Justice last year accused the platform of covertly paying pro-Trump influencers. 

“Do you think that it's responsible for you as head of the intelligence community and the principal presidential intelligence advisor, to retweet posts from individuals affiliated with Russian state media?” Himes asked. 

Gabbard, who was grilled by Senators during her confirmation hearing over past comments defending Russia's invasion of Ukraine,  argued that because the retweet came from her personal account, it presents no conflict of interest with her official role as intelligence director. 

“I maintain my First Amendment rights to be able to express my own personal views on different issues,” Gabbard said.

Cheong posted his reaction to the exchange on X, saying “DNI Tulsi Gabbard shared my post on the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media, which operated the propaganda outfits Voice of America and RFERL.” 

Megan Lebowitz

Gabbard addressed the Signal controversy in her opening remarks before the House Intelligence Committee, referring to Waltz's previous comments and noting that he has “taken full responsibility.”

She said Trump's and Waltz's comments yesterday had a ""clear message: It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal chat with high-level national security principles having a policy discussion about imminent strikes against the Houthis and the effects of the strike.""

""National Security advisor has taken full responsibility for this, and the National Security Council is conducting an in-depth review, along with technical experts working to determine how this reporter was inadvertently added to this chat,"" she added.

Gabbard maintained that classified information was not shared, but called the conversation ""candid and sensitive."" 

""There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,"" she claimed. ""This was a standard update to the national security cabinet that was provided alongside updates that were given to foreign partners in the region.""

Gabbard also said that Signal is pre-installed on government devices. NBC News has not independently verified this. 

She referred to a pending lawsuit as a reason why she would be “limited” in commenting further on the issue.

A contentious Senate hearing yesterday raised questions about how Trump administration officials handle sensitive national security information and communications, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's decision to share a planned U.S. military operation in a group chat. 

Of the more than dozen senior U.S. officials on a Signal text chain that was inadvertently leaked to a journalist, Hegseth was the only one who shared details of the planned U.S. airstrikes in Yemen.

After welcoming a witness panel composed of some of the same U.S. intelligence officials who were involved in a Signal group chat that leaked military plans to a magazine editor, Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., used his opening remarks at the House Select Committee on Intelligence hearing this morning to slam his Senate colleagues for their focus on the incident in their own intelligence hearing yesterday. 

“Yesterday, our colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held their hearing on the annual threat assessment,” Crawford said. “And unfortunately, instead of exploring the real and existential threats that face our nation, which is the purpose of this hearing, this issue consumed most of their time, while I will address this topic further in my questions, it's my sincere hope that we use this hearing to discuss the many foreign threats facing our nation.”

Crawford added that the annual worldwide threats hearings in the House and Senate are intended to provide the American people with the opportunity to hear directly from U.S. intelligence leaders, and focusing too much on the Signal scandal will take away from that opportunity. 

“I have deep concerns about the state of our national security,” Crawford said, citing the involvement of North Korean troops in the Russia-Ukraine war, geopolitical tensions with China and the span of Iran-sponsored terrorist groups across the Middle East. 

Megan Lebowitz

The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Jim Himes, said that ""everyone here knows"" that Russian or Chinese officials could have obtained messages where details of a military operation were sent out in a Signal chat, saying it was ""by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now.""

Himes, D-Conn., said that people involved in the chat should ""apologize,"" ""own it,"" and figure out what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future.

""That's not what happened,"" he added.

Himes also said the U.S. now appears to be on ""Team Kremlin,"" criticizing U.S. officials' perspectives toward the war in Ukraine. He criticized DOGE-related firings and argued that U.S. adversaries ""cannot believe their luck.""

The Trump administration says travelers' political beliefs are not influencing it to deny entry, deport or detain travelers from Western nations after a spate of incidents, including some searches of electronic devices.

""Allegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are baseless and irresponsible,” Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

The French interior minister alleged that a French researcher had been turned away by U.S. border agents earlier this month after they found messages critical of the Trump administration on his phone. Another case this month involved a Rhode Island doctor, Rasha Alawieh, who was deported to Lebanon despite having a valid U.S. visa.

Both media searches ""followed all policies and protocols,"" CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham told NBC News in a statement. Claims that the agency is “searching more electronic media due to the administration change are false,” he added.

""In the cases of the French scientist and Dr. Alawieh, media searches followed all policies and protocols, leading to the discovery of proprietary information from Los Alamo National Laboratory — violating a non-disclosure agreement — and Hezbollah martyr content,"" Beckham said.

""These searches are conducted to detect digital contraband, terrorism-related content, and information relevant to visitor admissibility,"" he added.

The Atlantic released details this morning of the top Trump officials' chat that revealed military strike plans to the magazine's editor-in-chief.

The release of the messages in the chat follows repeated denials from the Trump administration that any war plans were discussed on the chat or that the information was classified.

The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg had previously declined to release parts of the conversation, saying that if the messages were read by an adversary, the information ""could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.""

The messages released today showed that a text from Defense Secretary Pete  Hegseth about imminent military strikes in Yemen were highly detailed. In them, he laid out the exact timing of the pending strikes. The messages did not include specific targeting locations.

Lawmakers will have another chance to question Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe today about leaked military plans, this time at a House Intelligence Committee hearing. 

The hearing comes one day after the officials — both reportedly members of the Signal group chat reported by The Atlantic — faced pointed questions from Democrats over the group chat's contents and security.

The hearing has an open session beginning at 10 a.m. and a closed-door session for lawmakers at 2 p.m.

Committee Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., has not yet weighed in publicly on The Atlantic's reporting. The top Democrat on the committee, Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, said he was ""horrified"" by the report.

""These individuals know the calamitous risks of transmitting classified information across unclassified systems, and they also know that if a lower ranking official under their command did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation,"" Himes said. ""The American people deserve answers, and I plan to get some on Wednesday at the Intelligence Committee's Worldwide Threats hearing.""

Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said in an interview that he takes “full responsibility” for a group text that included a journalist while discussing military plans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and top Democrats on the national security committees, are issuing a letter to Trump asking for additional details regarding a text chain about military planning that inadvertently included The Atlantic's top editor.

“Our committees have serious questions about this incident, and members need a full accounting to ensure it never happens again,” the senators wrote.

They expressed their ""extreme alarm about the astonishingly poor judgment shown by your Cabinet and national security advisors"" following the report about leaked military plans for strikes in Yemen.

""You have long advocated for accountability and transparency in the government, particularly as it relates to the handling of classified information, national security, and the safety of American servicemembers,"" the senators said. ""As such, it is imperative that you address this breach with the seriousness and diligence that it demands.""

The senators said that they ""expect"" that Attorney General Pam Bondi will conduct an investigation ""of the conduct of the government officials involved in improperly sharing or discussing such information.""

The senators are also seeking the full unredacted transcript of the text chain for the committees to review, asking whether other White House officials are using Signal or other commercial platforms to discuss classified or sensitive information, and urging relevant agencies to preserve documents and correspondences regarding the incident.

In addition to Schumer, the letter was signed by the top Democrats on the Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Appropriations subcommittee on defense.

Finalizing applications filed by certain immigrants to become legal permanent residents is being put on hold to comply with an executive order Trump signed in January.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the part of the Department of Homeland Security that handles citizenship, legal status and other immigration benefits, has suspended processing some applications for so-called green cards to do more vetting of the applicants, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.

The latest attempt by conservatives to undermine the federal bureaucracy reaches the Supreme Court today as the justices consider whether the Federal Communications Commission unlawfully wields power through a program that subsidizes telecommunications services in underserved regions.

The court has a 6-3 conservative majority that has in a series of recent decisions undercut the authority of government agencies and advanced a deregulatory agenda largely favored by business interests and Republicans.

The case concerns both whether Congress in a 1996 law exceeded its authority in setting up the Universal Service Fund, which requires telecommunications services to submit payments to subsidize “universal service” in low-income and rural areas.

The CEOs of NPR and PBS are appearing Wednesday before a House subcommittee on government efficiency, chaired by Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, where they will answer questions about perceived political bias at the public broadcasters.

A livestream begins immediately below at approximately 10 a.m. ET.

The hearing, entitled ""Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,"" was called by Greene in February to examine accusations by conservatives that news and cultural programming at the radio and television networks have a profound liberal bias. She has expressed skepticism that any federal funds should go to public broadcasting.

PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger, who worked at New York City's WNET public television before taking over the reins at the network nearly two decades ago, will appear beside NPR CEO Katherine Maher, who came to the public broadcaster last year from Web Summit. She is also a former CEO and executive director at the Wikimedia Foundation.

Wednesday's hearing is part of a larger Republican-led effort to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), established by Congress in 1967 as a private, non-profit corporation to distribute federal money to NPR, PBS and other public broadcasting entities. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Penn., introduced legislation to bar all funding for the CPB. Meanwhile, Brendan Carr, President Trump's newly appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has also initiated inquiries of NPR and PBS stations, arguing that their corporate underwriting spots violate federal laws and policies because they too closely resemble commercial advertisements.

NPR receives about 3% of its funding from the government, either directly via CPB or through its member stations, who pay fees to carry its programming. PBS receives 16% of its funds from the CPB.

NPR reaches 43 million listeners each week with its flagship news programs, Morning Edition and All Things Considered. Its programming is distributed by 230 member stations around the country, which together hold the licenses to 1,300 local public broadcasters. The programming at PBS ranges from the acclaimed News Hour to children's programming such as Daniel Tiger.

President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials — and inadvertently, one journalist — on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed. 

Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning. 

Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the ""Houthi PC small group"" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.

The National Security Council told CBS News on Monday that the group chat ""appears to be authentic.""

Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, or whether he had the device with him in Russia, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a social media post Wednesday that Witkoff, ""was provided a secure line of communication by the U.S. Government, and it was the only phone he had in his possession while in Moscow.""

Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he ""had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.""

""I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,"" Witkoff said.

The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. Speaking Wednesday during a congressional hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said ""the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices."" 

On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying no ""war plans"" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had ""provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.""

Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing on worldwide security threats  that was continuing on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.

U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own report for The Atlantic. 

During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.

Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin. The White House did not immediately reply to CBS News' questions about the meeting or whether Witkoff had his device at the Kremlin.

Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News. 

Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, ""is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.""  

The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.

The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of ""increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.""

Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the  phishing links being opened.

Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News. 

One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.

While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, ""often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security."" 

While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said ""the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount.""

""The Star-Spangled Banner"" became a polarizing topic in the NHL over the last month because of a feud between President Donald Trump and Canadian officials over tariffs.

The national anthem became a talking point again in the league for a different reason.

U.S. Marine Corps veteran Bruce Gust performed his own rendition of the anthem at the Bridgestone Arena before the Nashville Predators took on the Anaheim Ducks. He brought out bongos to help add a rhythmic beat to the song.

Ducks star Trevor Zegras joked that the unique performance affected his play at the start.

""I think the bongo anthem threw us off a little bit in the first,"" Zegras said. ""But once we recovered from that, we were back to our game, which was good.""

He finished with a goal and an assist as Anaheim won the game, 4-1.

Since the start of February, fans in Canada have booed the U.S. national anthem amid the back and forth between Trump and Canadian lawmakers. Americans have returned the favor by booing ""O, Canada"" during performances in U.S.-based arenas.

The issue came to a head in hockey during the 4 Nationals Face-Off as American and Canadian team members dropped gloves and fought during one of their games.

WASHINGTON – It's the kind of security breach – and screw-up – that even Hollywood producers wouldn't dare conjure: All the nation's top national security leaders gathering in a commercial messaging app to discuss active, highly classified military plans and operations, and they don't even notice that one of the nation's best investigative journalists has “inadvertently” been invited to join them. 

Welcome to Day Three of ""SignalGate,"" the fast-growing political controversy over at least 18 Trump administration officials' use of an unsecured Signal chat to discuss real-time attacks on Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month – as journalist Jeffrey Goldberg took notes for a magazine article he later published.

And more questions are arising, seemingly by the hour, despite an administration scramble to tamp down what national security experts say is one of the most serious White House national security breaches in years, if not decades.

Speculation about what was discussed in the group chat that included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Cabinet-level officials has exploded since the online publication of the bombshell article, “The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.”

In it, Goldberg, the prize-winning editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, disclosed that “U.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen.""

""I didn't think it could be real,"" he wrote. ""Then the bombs started falling.”

Goldberg strongly hinted that he withheld classified information discussed in the chat, including messages from Hegseth that disclosed ""precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.""  

In response, Trump and other White House officials insisted Tuesday that no classified information was shared in the chat.

Two of the participants, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, made similar denials during several hours of questioning Tuesday by Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Today, Gabbard and Ratcliffe expected to undergo a similar grilling by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, which – like the Senate committee – long ago had scheduled its annual hearing on worldwide threats.

Here are some of the questions that are likely to come up:

It is a federal crime to discuss or release classified information in an unsecured and unapproved setting.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the committee, excoriated the two top intelligence officials for denying they discussed classified war planning while refusing to provide details.

“If it's not classified,” Warner said, “share the texts with the committee.”

Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff was even more direct in vowing to get to the bottom of whether the security breach violated laws like the Espionage Act, which prohibits gathering, transmitting or losing national defense information. 

“This is utterly unprofessional. There's been no apology; there has been no recognition of the gravity of this error,” Ossoff said. “And by the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain, and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content.”

Democratic lawmakers also noted that some in the chat were being hypocrites for having called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's prosecution for using a personal server to send government emails while they were now insisting they did nothing wrong.

That question cuts to the heart of the controversy of whether there was any damage to U.S. national security.

President Donald Trump and his supporters deny that and accused Democrats of unfairly politicizing a successful military strike against an Iran-backed group that has been attacking U.S. ships off the Yemen coast.

But some Democratic lawmakers attacked chat participants for discussing military operations ahead of time that could have gotten U.S. troops killed if those details fell into the wrong hands.

“Putting a reporter in a Signal chat where you're planning airstrikes, that's careless,” Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said on X after the hearing. “Sharing information that puts our pilots' lives at risk − that's reckless.”

Also, because Signal uses only end-to-end encryption, or protecting messages in the process of being sent. That means the chat could have been accessed by Russia, China, Iran or any other U.S. adversary by hacking just one phone or laptop of the participants, former U.S. intelligence and national security officials tell USA TODAY.

That's one reason U.S. officials are required to use more secure government-approved communications channels when discussing military operations, former National Security Agency official Gavin Wilde and other experts told USA TODAY.

Russia's intelligence services in particular have been ramping up efforts to target Signal for intelligence collection, Google's Threat Intelligence Group warned last month.

And in a bulletin last month, the NSA itself warned its employees of vulnerabilities in using Signal that have made it ""a high value target to intercept sensitive information"" by spies and criminals, according to a CBS News report citing internal NSA documents. 

Compounding that concern is the fact that Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate tycoon and Trump golfing buddy and diplomatic envoy, was meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin while he was in the chat group, discussing a resolution of his country's war against Ukraine.

Was Ratcliffe aware of that Witkoff “was in Moscow on this thread while you were as director of the CIA participating in this thread?” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., asked in Tuesday's hearing.

“I'm not aware of that today,” Ratcliffe responded.

“This sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies and the personnel who work for them is entirely unacceptable,” Bennet shot back. “It's an embarrassment. You need to do better.”

There appears to be plenty of blame to go around.National Security Adviser Mike Waltz was the one who invited Goldberg to connect on Signal, Goldberg said in his article. After that, the journalist was added to a “Houthi PC small group” chat where the military operation was discussed for days leading up to the March 15 strike, he said.

Waltz told Fox News Tuesday night that he took “full responsibility for inviting a reporter into the chat. ""I built the group. It's embarrassing. We're going to get to the bottom of it.""

But it was Hegseth who disclosed what was likely the most sensitive information in the chat, according to Goldberg's article and Tuesday's congressional testimony.

Gabbard and Ratcliffe appeared to pass the buck to Hegseth. But both also showed at least some lack of knowledge of basic U.S. security protocols.

Kelly asked both if they were aware of a Defense Department policy prohibiting discussion of “of even what is called controlled unclassified information or CUI on unsecured devices” using Signal.

“I haven't read that policy,” Gabbard said.

“I'm not familiar with the DOD policy,” Ratcliffe added.

In a new letter, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and top Senate Democrats on national security committees asked Trump for answers to 10 questions about the chat, including a complete list of participants and whether any of them used personal communication devices.

Also, they wrote, “We are aware that the Director of National Intelligence, and possibly others, appears to have been overseas while this group chat was active, making the entire discussion more vulnerable to interception by foreign adversaries.

“Inexplicably, throughout the days-long chat conversation, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic remained in the group chat,” they wrote, “and his presence was never questioned.”","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA TODAY'}"

The White House said Monday the group chat ""appears to be authentic.""

The Trump administration is under scrutiny after The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg said he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat that included top national security officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which the officials discussed plans for a U.S. attack on Houthis in Yemen.

Goldberg revealed the mishap in a piece for the magazine on Monday and told ABC News that he was apparently added to the chat by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.

Goldberg provided two screenshots in the magazine piece and did not provide details or quotes, only a description of the operational part of the Signal message chain.

Both the Trump administration and top officials involved have repeatedly denied that war plans or classified information were discussed, as Goldberg reported.

Below is a timeline spanning from the creation of the group chat to what has happened since.

In an interview with ""ABC News Live"" Monday evening, Goldberg told Linsey Davis he received a message request on the Signal app from White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, or someone ""who's purporting to be Mike Waltz"" on March 11.

He said the invitation was ""not an unusual thing in Washington.""

""I'm a journalist, I've met him in the past, so I accept it,"" he told ABC News.

Goldberg said he accepted the request, with nothing occurring until several days later, when he was added to a ""group of seemingly very high national security officials of the United States"" including Vice President JD Vance, with Waltz apparently creating this chat.

""Mike Waltz puts this group together and says it's a planning group for essentially upcoming action in Yemen,"" Goldberg said.

Goldberg told ABC News he initially thought it was a hoax since it would be ""completely absurd to me that the national security leadership of the United States would be meeting on a messaging app to discuss forthcoming military action, and that then they would also invite the editor of The Atlantic magazine to that conversation.""

Goldberg told ABC News a ""long conversation"" occurred between the group chat members on March 14, discussing ""whether or not they should or shouldn't take action in Yemen.""

The messages went back and forth with ""a lot of resentment directed at European allies of the United States, which obviously enhanced the credibility of this chain,"" Goldberg said.

He told ABC News at this point the members of the chat sounded like people he knew within the administration, but still was not sure whether or not it was a hoax.

Goldberg told ABC News he continued to track the incoming messages from the group chat, to see ""who was trying to entrap me or trick me."" Then on March 15, he said it became ""overwhelmingly clear"" it was a legitimate group chat, he told ABC News.

At 11:44 a.m., he said he received a text in the chain from someone claiming to be Hegseth, or ""somebody identified as Pete,"" providing what Goldberg characterized as a war plan. The message included a ""sequencing of events related to an upcoming attack on Yemen"" and promised results by 1:45 p.m. Eastern time.

Goldberg told ABC News he was in his car and waiting with his phone to ""see if this was a real thing.""

""Sure enough, around 1:50 [p.m.] Eastern time, I see that Yemen is under attack,"" he said.

When the attacks seemed to be ""going well,"" Goldberg told ABC News that members of the chat began sending congratulatory messages along with fist, fire and American flag emojis.

""That was the day I realized this is possibly unbelievably the leaders of the United States discussing this on my messaging app,"" Goldberg told ABC News. ""My reaction was, I think I've discovered a massive security breach in the United States national security system.""

Goldberg told ABC News he removed himself from the group chat once the operation was completed.

""I watched this Yemen operation go from beginning to apparent end, and that was enough for me to learn that there's something wrong in the system here that would allow this information to come so dangerously close to the open wild,"" Goldberg said.

Waltz appeared on ABC's ""This Week"" the day after the strikes on Yemen and said the U.S. airstrikes ""took out"" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, which he said differed from the Biden administration's launches against the group.

""These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth — what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,"" Waltz said. ""This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible.""

Goldberg published a story in The Atlantic revealing the mishap, in a piece titled ""The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.""

Shortly after the story's publication on Monday afternoon, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes shared with ABC News the statement he provided to The Atlantic confirming the authenticity of the Signal group chat.

""At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security,"" Hughes said in a statement.

Speaking to reporters Monday, Hegseth denied he sent war plans in the chat.

""I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that,"" Hegseth told reporters in Honolulu while on a layover on his trip to Asia.

Hegseth called Goldberg a ""deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again.""

""This is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does,"" Hegseth said about Goldberg.

During an event at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump was asked about Goldberg's article. ""I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic,"" he said.

Top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries voiced outrage at the administration after this mishap.

""It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense,"" Jeffries said in a statement on Monday.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who faced scrutiny over her alleged use of a private email server while at the State Department, shared her reaction to the Signal group chat on X: ""You have got to be kidding me.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also criticized this apparent breach of military intelligence, urging Senate Republicans to work with Democrats in a ""full investigation"" to look into how this incident occurred.

""If you were up in arms over unsecure emails years ago, you should certainly be outraged by this amateurish behavior,"" Schumer said on the Senate floor, referencing the scandal over Clinton's emails.

On Tuesday morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Goldberg is ""well-known for his sensationalist spin"" and emphasized that ""no 'war plans' were discussed.""

""As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread. Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump,"" Leavitt shared on X.

Trump told NBC News he remains confident in Waltz even after the use of an unsecured group chat.

""Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" Trump told NBC correspondent Garrett Haake.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were grilled by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Tuesday regarding the mishap. Both officials said while testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence there was no classified information on the chain.

Ratcliffe said he believed the ""national security adviser intended this to be as it should have been, a mechanism for coordinating between senior level officials, but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications for anything that would be classified.""

Speaker Mike Johnson continued to downplay the mishap but admitted the breach was a ""serious"" mistake on Tuesday.

""Look, they have acknowledged that there is an error, and they are correcting it. And I would've asked the same thing of the Biden administration,"" Johnson said during a news conference Tuesday morning.

During a White House meeting with ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said this incident is ""just something that can happen"" and that there was ""no classified information"" in the group chat.

He added that Signal is ""not a perfect technology.""

""Sometimes somebody can get onto those things,"" Trump said. ""That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly.""

Waltz said the White House's tech and legal teams are looking into the mishap.

""No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger,"" Waltz said.

He also claimed to have never met Goldberg.

""We are looking into him, reviewing how the heck he got into this room,"" Waltz said.

A spokesperson for The Atlantic released a statement on Tuesday night following the comments from Trump and his aides.

""Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and other in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans,"" the magazine said.

The statement went on to say that ""any responsible national security expert would consider the information contained in this Signal chat to be of the greatest sensitivity, and would agree that this information should never be shared on non-government messaging apps.""

Schumer and other top Senate Democrats on national security committees wrote a letter to Trump seeking more information about the mishap, requesting a ""complete and unredacted"" transcript of the Signal group chat for the appropriate committees to review in a secure setting.

""We write to you with extreme alarm about the astonishingly poor judgment shown by your Cabinet and national security advisors,"" the Senators wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ABC News. ""You have long advocated for accountability and transparency in the government, particularly as it relates to the handling of classified information, national security and the safety of American servicemembers. As such, it is imperative that you address this breach with the seriousness and diligence that it demands.""

The Atlantic on Wednesday published a new article detailing purported information about recent American strikes in Yemen it says was accidentally shared in the Signal group chat.

The article suggested that Hegseth updated members of the ""Houthi PC small group"" Signal chat on ""favorable"" weather conditions ahead of planned airstrikes on Houthi leaders and other targets in Yemen.

The article said Hegseth also notified the group of a planned timeline for flights of F-18 strike aircraft, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles that were launched for the mission.

Shortly after the article was published, Leavitt said in a post on X ""these were NOT 'war plans.'""

""This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin,"" the White House press secretary said.

Waltz said Wednesday morning that the chat didn't include war plans or specific details about the strike.

""No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests,"" Waltz posted on X.

Also on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg was assigned to a federal lawsuit against five Cabinet members over the administration's use of Signal. Boasberg is also handling the case against the Trump administration over its deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act.

The lawsuit — which names Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the National Archives as defendants — asked a federal judge to declare the use of Signal unlawful and order the cabinet members to preserve the records immediately.

US President Donald Trump and his intelligence chiefs have played down a security breach that saw a journalist invited into a Signal group chat where he reported seeing national security officials plan airstrikes in Yemen.

US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied at a Senate hearing that any classified information was shared in the message chain. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also faced scrutiny for the messages, though he did not testify.

Democrats on the panel rebuked the cabinet members as ""incompetent"" with national security.

Over at the White House, Trump stood by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who was at the centre of the leak. 

Waltz came close to apologising by Tuesday evening, telling Fox News: ""I take full responsibility. I built the group.""

""It's embarrassing. We're going to get to the bottom of it.""

Asked if he had identified who on his staff was at fault, he responded, ""a staffer wasn't responsible,"" and repeated that the error was his ""full responsibility"".

Waltz also said that he had spoken to Elon Musk, who is leading the unofficial Department of Government Efficiency and has touted himself as ""tech support"" for the federal government.

""We've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened,"" Waltz continued, adding that Goldberg ""wasn't on my phone"".

The revelation has sent shockwaves through Washington, prompting a lawsuit and questions about why high-ranking officials discussed such sensitive matters on a potentially vulnerable civilian app.

Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was added to the 18-member group, apparently by accident, and reported that he initially thought it was a hoax.

But he said he realised the messages were authentic once the planned raid was carried out in Yemen.

Some 53 people were killed in the 15 March airstrikes, which US officials said targeted Iran-aligned Houthi rebels who have threatened maritime trade and Israel.

The American raids have continued since then, including early on Tuesday morning.

In addition to Ratcliffe and Gabbard, the Signal group chat included Vice-President JD Vance and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.

The controversy overshadowed Tuesday's hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, which was originally meant to focus on drug cartels and people trafficking.

During the at-times combative session, Ratcliffe said he was not aware of any specific operational information on weapons, targets or timings discussed in the chat, as Goldberg had reported.

Asked if he believed the leak was a huge mistake, Ratcliffe said: ""No.""

Gabbard repeatedly said ""no classified information"" was divulged and maintained there was a difference between ""inadvertent release"" and ""malicious leaks"" of information.

Both pointed to Hegseth as being the authority on whether the information was classified. Goldberg reported that much of the most sensitive information shared in the chat came from the account under Hegseth's name. 

""The Secretary of Defense is the original classification authority for DoD in deciding what would be classified information,"" Ratcliffe said.

Senate Democrats assailed the Gabbard and Ratcliffe.

Colorado's Michael Bennet accused those involved in the chat of sloppiness, incompetence and disrespect for US intelligence agencies.

Georgia's Jon Ossoff described the episode - which Washington has dubbed Signalgate - as an ""embarrassment"".

""This is utterly unprofessional. There's been no apology,"" Ossoff said. ""There has been no recognition of the gravity of this error.""

Republicans on the panel were far more muted in their misgivings.

""We dodged a bullet,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

Mississippi Republican Roger Wicker, who leads the Senate's armed services committee, later told reporters that lawmakers will investigate the Signal chat leak.

Wicker told reporters that he wants the investigation to be bipartisan and for the committee to have full access to the group chat's transcript.

""We need to find out if it's completely factual, and then make recommendations,"" he told the NewsNation network. ""But I expect we'll have the co-operation of the administration.""

Republican Jim Risch of Idaho, who leads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said that he expects the matter to be investigated.

""This is a matter that's going to be investigated, obviously, we're going to know a lot more about it as the facts role out,"" he said, quoted by The Hill newspaper.

Trump and his White House team cast the controversy as a ""co-ordinated effort"" to distract from the president's accomplishments.

Throughout the day, Trump played down the leak and defended his national security adviser who was reported to have admitted Goldberg to the group chat.

""Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" Trump told NBC in a morning phone interview. He also said Goldberg's addition to the group was a ""glitch"" that had ""no impact at all"" operationally.

The Republican president indicated it was one of Waltz's aides who had invited the journalist to the chat.

""A staffer had his number on there,"" said Trump, who has long pilloried reporting by Goldberg going back to the 2020 election.

At an event later at the White House, Trump was joined by Waltz.

""There was no classified information, as I understand it,"" said the president. ""They used an app, if you want to call it an app, that a lot of people use, a lot of people in government use, a lot of people in the media use.""

In his own brief remarks, Waltz took aim at Goldberg. He said he had never had any contact with the reporter and accused him of wanting to focus on ""more hoaxes"", rather than Trump administration successes. 

Trump later spoke to Newsmax, where he told the conservative network that ""somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody that was with Mike Waltz, worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level, had, I guess Goldberg's"" phone number.

Some national security experts have argued that the leak was a major operational lapse, and archive experts warned that it violated laws on presidential record keeping.

On Tuesday, the non-partisan watchdog group American Oversight sued the individual officials who participated in the chat for alleged violations of the Federal Records Act and Administrative Procedure Act.

The group said that by setting the chat to automatically delete messages, the group violated a law requiring White House officials to submit their records to the National Archives. 

The National Security Agency warned employees only last month of vulnerabilities in Signal, according to documents obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS.

Signal issued a new statement on Tuesday disputing  ""vulnerabilities"" in its messaging platform. 

""Signal is open source, so our code is regularly scrutinized in addition to regular formal audits,"" the statement said, calling the app ""the gold standard for private, secure communications"".

Mick Mulroy, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence (DASD) for the Middle East and a retired CIA paramilitary officer, told the BBC that holding sensitive discussions on a ""unsure commercial application"" was ""unacceptable"".

""And everyone on that chat knew it,"" he added. ""You do not need to be a member of the military or intelligence community to know that this information is exactly what the enemy would want to know.""

Trump officials had claimed nothing classified or risking harm to members of the military was shared in the chat

The disclosure by the Atlantic of further devastating messages from the Signal chat group used by the Trump administration's most senior security officials has nailed the lie that nothing that threatened the safety of US servicemen and women was shared on the group.

After the vague and evasive assertions by Trump officials at Monday's Senate intelligence committee hearing, from the White House, and from the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that no war plans or classified material was shared, readers can make up their own minds.

Despite Hegseth's angry denial, the exchanges in the leaked group chat did contain details of war planning, shared recklessly by him in advance of the attack on 15 March, on a messaging system and perhaps devices which he and others in the chat could not have been certain were secure.

Most damning is the fact that Hegseth sent details in advance of the F-18s and other aircraft that would take part in the attack, including the timing of their arrival at targets, and other assets that would be deployed.

As Ryan Goodman, a law professor who formerly worked at the Pentagon, put it after the latest release: “The Atlantic has now published the Signal texts with attack plans in response to administration denials. I worked at the Pentagon. If information like this is not classified, nothing is. If Hegseth is claiming he declassified this information, he should be shown the door for having done so.”

In attempting to cover up and diminish their culpability for a shocking breach of operational security – including the fact that two participants in the chat were overseas (including one in Moscow at the time) – the Trump administration has made the scandal immeasurably more serious than it was already.

At the most simple level, the pilots who flew on those strikes should rightly be furious that the most senior civilian defence official placed them in harm's way.

“If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests – or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media – the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds. The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic,” wrote Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic editor who was accidentally added to the chat.

A question that now needs to be answered is precisely why a group of senior officials, including a number who have served in the US armed forces – including the director of National intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, the vice-president, JD Vance, and Hegseth – agreed to join a conversation on such a platform.

All of them will be aware of not just the stringent rules around operational security (Opsec in military jargon) but the absolute necessity to protect the lives of those you serve with.

The strong suspicion voiced by a number of commentators is that this group, like other senior officials in the Trump administration, have been using services like Signal to avoid oversight despite potentially being in breach of federal laws on record retention.

In other words, lives were casually put at risk to shirk another significant responsibility of the highest offices: accountability.

What happens next is key.

In any normal circumstances and in any previous era, Hegseth and Waltz would be expected to resign immediately: Hegseth for sharing what any reasonable observer would regard as details of war plans – and then lying about having done so – and Waltz for his shocking sloppiness around security.

But whether or not they will resign or be dismissed by a dysfunctional president, equally hostile to the notion he should be held accountable, is an open question.

What should be clear to already shocked allies of the US is that not only is intelligence and other sensitive material not safe in the hands of Trump's senior security officials, but that they cannot be counted on to be truthful individually or as a group.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

WASHINGTON (AP) — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Wednesday it was a “mistake” for national security officials to discuss sensitive military plans on a group text chain that also included a journalist — a leak that has roiled President Donald Trump's national security leadership.

Speaking before the House Intelligence Committee, Gabbard said the conversation included “candid and sensitive” information about military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. But as she told senators during testimony on Tuesday, she said the texts did not contain any classified information.

“It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added,” Gabbard said.

Wednesday's hearing was called to discuss an updated report on national security threats facing the U.S. Instead, much of the focus was on the text chain, which included Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and other top officials.

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was also added, and on Wednesday his publication released more details from the chats, showing the level of detail they offered about the strikes.

Democrats have demanded an investigation into the sloppy communication, saying it may have exposed sensitive military information that could have jeopardized the mission or put U.S. service members at risk.

The National Security Council has said it will investigate the matter, which Trump on Tuesday downplayed as a “glitch.” Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, who was in the group chat and has taken responsibility for the lapse.




Even though the texts contained detailed information on military actions, Gabbard, Ratcliffe and the White House have all said none of the information was classified — an assertion Democrats flatly rejected on Wednesday.

“You all know that's a lie,” Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, told Ratcliffe and Gabbard, who said that any decisions to classify or declassify military information falls to the secretary of defense.

Several Democrats on the panel said Hegseth should resign because of the leak.

“This is classified information. It's a weapon system, as well as a sequence of strikes, as well as details of the operations,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois. “He needs to resign immediately.”

Ratcliffe defended his use of Signal as “appropriate” and said questions over the Signal leak have overshadowed the military operation targeting the Houthis. 

“What is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,” he told lawmakers. “That's what did happen, not what possibly could have happened.”

The discussion at times grew heated as Ratcliffe and Democratic lawmakers spoke over one another. At one point, Rep. Jimmy Gomez, an Illinois Democrat, asked whether he knew whether Hegseth was drinking alcohol when he participated in the chat.

“I think that's an offensive line of questioning,” Ratcliffe angrily replied. “The answer is no.”

Ratcliffe and Gomez then began shouting over each other as Gomez sought to ask a follow-up question. “We want to know if his performance is compromised,” Gomez said.

Wednesday's hearing was called to discuss the intelligence community's annual report on threats to American national security. The report lists China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as strategic adversaries, and notes that drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations pose other threats to Americans.

The presentations from top Trump appointees reflect Trump's foreign policy priorities, including a focus on combating the flow of fentanyl, illegal immigration and human trafficking, and are taking place as Trump attempts to work out a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine three years after Russia's invasion.

US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has taken responsibility for a group chat in which high-ranking officials planned military strikes in Yemen in the company of a  journalist who was inadvertently added.

""I take full responsibility. I built the group,"" Waltz told Fox News on Tuesday, adding it was ""embarrassing"". 

President Donald Trump and US intelligence chiefs have downplayed the security risks and said no classified material was shared.

But Democrats and some Republicans have called for an investigation into what several lawmakers have described as a major breach.

Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he was accidentally added to the Signal chat by a user named Mike Waltz.

In his article that broke the story he says he saw classified military plans for US strikes in Yemen, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck. That content was held back from the piece.





Waltz was unable to explain in his Fox News interview how Goldberg came to be on the chat but - contradicting Trump - he said a member of his staff was not responsible and another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be there in Goldberg's place.

""We've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened,"" Waltz continued, adding that Goldberg's number had not been on his phone.

""I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy,"" Waltz said, adding that he had spoken to Elon Musk for help in finding out what happened.

When pressed further by show host Laura Ingraham on how the number got added, Waltz responded: ""Well, if you have somebody else's contact, then somehow it … gets sucked in. It gets sucked in.""

President Trump has played down the incident, calling it a ""glitch"" that had ""no impact at all"" operationally. 

Speaking to Newsmax, Trump said somebody who worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level had Goldberg's phone number.

US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that any classified information was shared in the message chain.

But Democrats questioned that, given the reporting from Goldberg, and asked them to release all the information if it was not classified.

The Signal group chat also included accounts identified as being Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Mark Warner, Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""This Signal chat situation sheds light on a sloppy and grossly incompetent national security strategy from the Trump administration.""

In his reporting, Goldberg said the officials on the chat had discussed the potential for Europe to pay for US protection of key shipping lanes.

""Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes,"" the account associated with Waltz wrote on 14 March.

He added his team was working with the defence and state departments ""to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans"" - at Trump's request.

At one point in the thread the Vance account griped that the strikes would benefit the Europeans, because of their reliance on those shipping lanes, adding: ""I just hate bailing Europe out again.""

The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: ""VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC.""



The revelation has sent shockwaves through Washington, prompting a lawsuit and questions about why high-ranking officials discussed such sensitive matters on a potentially vulnerable civilian app.

Some national security experts have argued that the leak was a major operational lapse, and archive experts warned that it violated laws on presidential record keeping.

American Oversight, non-partisan watchdog group, sued the officials who participated in the chat for alleged violations of the Federal Records Act and Administrative Procedure Act.

          / CBS News
        

Washington — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal that included sensitive details about military strikes in Yemen after more text messages came to light and revealed new details about what was shared.

The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.

Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.

Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic published additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used. 

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information ""could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel."" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.

At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk. 

""Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,"" Himes said. 

Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was ""sensitive"" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat. 

""There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,"" she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that ""war plans"" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.

Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, ""information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack"" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification. 

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that ""information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security."" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if ""its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.""

""Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,"" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts. 

Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.

""My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,"" Ratcliffe said.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been ""much less sensitive"" information presented to lawmakers that has ""high classification.""

""The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,"" he said. 

Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, ""not necessarily based off the content."" 

Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss ""the real and existential threats that face our nation"" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat. 

One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending the texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, ""I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!"" 

""Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!"" Gomez said during the heated back and forth. 

Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.

Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed. 

""In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?"" Kelly said. 

""I don't remember mention of specific targets,"" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was ""consistent with my recollection.""

Gabbard also said she didn't recall ""specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,"" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used. 

Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would ""look into"" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak. 

This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. 

""Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,"" the assessment says. 

According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries. 

Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, ""Russia has proven adaptable and resilient"" and its air forces are ""more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion,"" the assessment says. 

""The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,"" the report says. ""This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned."" 

It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power ""probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule."" 

China is viewed as ""most capable"" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses ""the most comprehensive and robust"" military threat to U.S. national security and the ""most active and persistent"" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being ""more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive."" 

The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island. 

Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran. 

The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, ""though pressure has probably built on him to do so."" 

In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un is increasing his stockpile of nuclear warheads and has ""no intention of negotiating away his strategic weapons programs, which he perceives as a guarantor of regime security and national pride.""

National intelligence head Tusli Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe argue ‘no classified information' was leaked

US intelligence chiefs on Wednesday denied breaking the law or revealing classified information in a group chat where they discussed details of air strikes on Yemen in the presence of a journalist, despite allegations from Democrats that the leak was reckless and possibly illegal.

Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe were giving their second day of congressional testimony on global threats facing the United States, which Democratic lawmakers seized on to condemn their use of the Signal app to discuss arrangements to bomb the Houthis in a group that included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic.

The hearing before the House intelligence committee took place less than two hours after the Atlantic released a full transcript of the chat, which revealed that defense secretary Pete Hegseth had shared in the group timings of the air strikes and the weapons that would be used.

“Now we come to learn that people in the most dangerous and sensitive jobs on the planet put extremely specific predecisional discussions about a military attack on Signal, which could be intercepted by the Russians and the Chinese,” the committee's top Democrat Jim Himes said. “Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships.

“I think that it's by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now.”

In an appearance before the Senate the day prior, Gabbard had said that the chat did not contain details of the strikes' timing, targets or weapons used – an assertion that Himes said was contradicted by the Atlantic's transcript.

“My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof, on the details that were posted there,” Gabbard said, adding that she was “not directly involved with that part of the Signal chat”.

She sought to downplay the severity of the leak, saying the Signal chat was “a policy discussion” to which Goldberg “was inadvertently added”.

“The conversation was candid and sensitive, but as the president [and] national security adviser stated, no classified information was shared. There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,” Gabbard said.

Ratcliffe argued that Signal was “an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information”, despite earlier warnings from the defense department that it could be targeted by Russian hackers.

“I didn't transfer any classified information. And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,” the CIA director said.

Democrats countered that what was revealed in the group was classified. Raja Krishnamoorthi had an aide hold up the printed Signal messages in which Hegseth shared exact details of the strikes.

“This is classified information. It's a weapon system as well as sequence of strikes, as well as details about the operations,” Krishnamoorthi said. “This text message is clearly classified information. Secretary Hegseth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information. He needs to resign immediately.”

Republicans refuted the claims by having Ratcliffe and Gabbard note that details such as the names of the targets or specific locations were not revealed in the chat.

“The Democrats are obviously making the assertions that what was in the Signal chat was classified, and claiming that secretary Hegseth put this war plan out to the world, which he clearly did not,” the Florida Republican Greg Steube said.

Democrats have been reeling in the months since Donald Trump won the November election and Republicans clinched majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, but the emergence of the Signal chat has provided them with an opportunity to paint the new administration as reckless.

Democratic congressman Jimmy Gomez prompted fury from the witnesses when he asked Gabbard and Ratcliffe if they knew whether Hegseth, who pledged not to consume alcohol during his confirmation process after reports emerged that he had a history of excessive drinking, may have been under the influence when using the chat.

“I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no,” Ratcliffe replied.

When Ratcliffe and Gabbard appeared before a Senate intelligence committee hearing on Tuesday, Democrats questioned them extensively about the Signal group, while Republicans either avoided the topic or said they would ask about it in a private session. In the day since, some Republican senators said they would demand the Trump administration investigate the group chat, while others have restated their support for Trump's national security team.

“I think President Trump has handled this matter well,” Republican senator Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday. “Further, I believe that all the participants in the chat were under the impression they were using an appropriate and secure form of communication. This will also fall into the category of ‘lessons learned'.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

The Atlantic on Wednesday published a transcript of text messages showing that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth detailed U.S. military attack plans in Yemen in a Signal group chat that inadvertently included the magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.

In an article titled “Here Are the Attack Plans That Trump's Advisers Shared on Signal,” Goldberg quoted from texts in which Hegseth specified types of U.S. military aircraft and the timing of recent airstrikes against Houthi militias in Yemen. The texts did not include information about specific targets.

“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package),” one of the texts says, referring to a type of military aircraft. “1345: ‘Trigger Based' F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME) — also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s).”

Goldberg and Shane Harris, a national security and intelligence reporter at The Atlantic, published the latest article a day after President Donald Trump's administration attempted to downplay the magazine's first report about the Signal thread.

Trump, asked about the matter on Tuesday, said: “It wasn't classified information.” Hegseth, speaking to reporters Monday, said in part: “Nobody was texting war plans.” 

In testimony at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe both claimed no classified material was shared in the group chat. Ratcliffe said his “communications ... in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.”

The intelligence officials both testified Tuesday that Hegseth was the “original classifying authority” on the chat. 

Goldberg and Harris, in the article published Wednesday, wrote that “statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump — combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts — have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions.”

“There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,” Goldberg and Harris added.

Information about an upcoming U.S. military attack on an adversary is typically considered to be classified, according to at least four former national security and intelligence officials who handled legal matters. 

The former officials did not know anything specific about the status of the information in the Signal chat, but they said it would be difficult to imagine a scenario in which details of military operations would not be treated as secret and damaging if disclosed.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt forcefully pushed back against The Atlantic's latest report in a post on X, calling the story a “hoax” written by a “Trump-hater.”

When reached for comment, the White House referred NBC News to Leavitt's post.

Vice President JD Vance, one of the participants in the Signal chat, retweeted a post Wednesday showing The Atlantic called the messages “war plans” in its first report and “attack plans” in its latest report — a distinction the administration has repeatedly made as it suggests the revelations in the messages were not significant.

The National Security Council said Monday it was reviewing how Goldberg was accidentally added to a group text on Signal, an encrypted messaging platform that is widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications but traditionally isn't used for high-level government communications.

“At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” the National Security Council said in a statement.

Goldberg reported that he had been added to a group chat called “Houthi PC small group” on March 13. He described his initial skepticism, recalling that he discussed with colleagues whether the texts were “part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service, or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization” seeking to embarrass journalists.

When the journalist came to believe the chat was authentic, he left. “No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left — or, more to the point, who I was,” Goldberg wrote.

The incident has provoked intense criticism from Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have called for the resignations of Hegseth and Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz. (Goldberg has said a Signal user named “Michael Waltz” added him to the chat in the first place.)

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday that he believes Gabbard and Ratcliffe “intentionally misled Congress yesterday in trying to make us believe that this was a casual conversation.”

“This is a serious life and death matter and should be treated as such,"" Durbin wrote in a statement posted on X.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said Wednesday he would request an “expedited” Inspector General report into the matter.

When asked directly whether he believes the information discussed in the chat is — or should be — classified, Wicker replied: “The information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.”

Gabbard, testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, said the leaked group text chat was a mistake but reiterated her claim that no classified information was shared on the chain.

“The president and national security adviser Waltz held a press conference yesterday with a clear message [that] it was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal chat with high-level national security principals having a policy discussion about imminent strikes against the Houthis and the effects of the strike,” Gabbard said.

She said the National Security Council was “conducting an in-depth review, along with technical experts working to determine how this reporter was inadvertently added to this chat.”

Democrats are blasting national security officials in the Trump administration for texting war plans to a group chat that included a reporter, saying it demonstrates sloppy conduct that would often result in firings.

In a testy exchange with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insist that no classified information was shared in the group chat about U.S. war plans that was sent to a journalist.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration's top intelligence officials stressed to Congress the threat they said was posed by international criminal gangs, drug cartels and human smuggling, testifying in a hearing Tuesday that unfolded against the backdrop of a security breach involving the mistaken leak of attack plans to a journalist.

The annual hearing on worldwide threats before the Senate Intelligence Committee offered a glimpse of the new administration's reorienting of priorities at a time when President Donald Trump has opened a new line of communication with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and as his administration has focused national security attention closer to home to counter violent crime that officials link to cross-border drug trafficking.

“Criminal groups drive much of the unrest and lawlessness in the Western Hemisphere,” said Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence. Atop a long list of national security challenges, she cited the need to combat cartels that she said were “engaging in a wide array of illicit activity, from narcotics trafficking to money laundering to smuggling of illegal immigrants and human trafficking.”

In a testy exchange with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insist that no classified information was shared in the group chat about U.S. war plans that was sent to a journalist.

The hearing occurred as officials across multiple presidential administrations have described an increasingly complicated blizzard of threats. 

In the committee room, it unfolded in split-screen fashion: Republican senators hewed to the pre-scheduled topic by drilling down on China and the fentanyl scourge, while Democrat after Democrat offered sharp criticism over a security breach they called reckless and dangerous.




“If this information had gotten out, American lives could have been lost,” Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee said of the exposed Signal messages. Added Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon: “I am of the view that there ought to be resignations.” “An embarrassment,” said Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who shouted down CIA Director John Ratcliffe as he demanded answers.

Gabbard and other officials did note the U.S. government's longstanding national security concerns, including the threat she said was posed by countries including Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.

China, for one, has heavily invested in stealth aircraft, hypersonic weapons and nuclear arms and is looking to outcompete the U.S. when it comes to artificial intelligence, while Russia remains a “formidable competitor” and still maintains a large nuclear arsenal.

The hearing arrived against the backdrop of a starkly different approach toward Russia following years of Biden administration sanctions over its war against Ukraine. 

Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call with Trump to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in what the White House described as the first step in a “movement to peace.”

Terrorism, too, featured prominently in the hearing.

“The direction for the FBI is to track down any individuals with any terrorist ties whatsoever, whether it be ISIS or another foreign terrorist organization,” said FBI Director Kash Patel. “And now to include the new designations of the cartels, down south and elsewhere.”

But the elevation of international drug trafficking as a top-tier threat was a notable turnabout in focus given that the U.S. government over the past four years has been more likely to place a premium on concerns over sophisticated Chinese espionage plots, ransomware attacks that have crippled hospitals and international and domestic terrorism plots.

Tuesday's hearing took taking place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Republican administration, including Ratcliffe, Gabbard and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted attack plans for military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” journalist Jeffrey Goldberg reported. The strikes began two hours after Goldberg received the details.

“Horrified” by the leak of what is historically strictly guarded information, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, said he will be demanding answers in a separate hearing Wednesday with his panel.

The Senate tonight confirmed Dr. Martin Makary, a pancreatic surgeon who has made controversial claims about Covid-19, as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.

Makary, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins and a former Fox News personality, was confirmed in a 56-44 vote.

As FDA commissioner, Makary will be tasked with regulation and oversight related to drugs, vaccines, food and other products.

During the Covid pandemic, Makary voiced support for natural immunity. He incorrectly predicted in February 2021 that the United States would hit herd immunity by that April.

Signal, the most secure widely available messaging app, has become a go-to resource for journalists, leakers and other people concerned about privacy. But it's not infallible. And its shortcomings and limitations are precisely why its use by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top Trump administration defense officials has rocked the worlds of politics and national security.

The app made headlines yesterday after Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg published the bombshell news that the Trump administration had accidentally added him to a Signal group chat this month to discuss military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

At first glance, it might not seem a major problem. Cybersecurity experts widely consider Signal to be the leading easy-to-use encrypted messaging service, and there are no public reports of its ever having been compromised by hackers.

Signal's encryption protocol — the complicated algorithm that scrambles messages as they're sent, then descrambles them for recipients — is the basis for some of the most popular messaging apps, including WhatsApp and iMessage. In 2023, Signal began updating its encryption to address the hypothetical threat of a quantum computer that could break less complicated encryption codes.

But Signal can't protect people, even Cabinet members, if they accidentally tell it to message the wrong person.

Facing pressure from his right flank to take on judges who have ruled against Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., today floated the possibility of Congress eliminating some federal courts.

It's the latest attack from Republicans on the federal judiciary, as courts have blocked a series of actions taken by the Trump administration. In addition to funding threats, Trump and his conservative allies have called for the impeachment of certain federal judges who have ruled against him, most notably U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who tried to halt Trump's using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.

National security adviser Mike Waltz said in tonight's Fox News interview that he does not support releasing a chain of messages about military planning that inadvertently included The Atlantic's top editor.

""I certainly want our deliberations to stay confidential,"" Waltz told host Laura Ingraham. ""Of course, I don't want it all out there, because these were conversations back and forth that you should be able to have confidentially.""

Waltz was responding to a question about whether Waltz would object to the public release of the messages if the contents were not classified, as Trump and his allies have claimed.

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote in his article yesterday that plans in the group text “included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing,” but that he had not included those details because of national security concerns.

Earlier today, Trump diminished the seriousness of the leak, saying the chat included “no classified information, as I understand it.”

A super PAC tied to billionaire Elon Musk has started spending in two deeply Republican House seats in Florida ahead of next week's special elections, according to a new campaign finance report.

America PAC, which has not filed a financial disclosure yet this year but was almost entirely funded by Musk in 2024, is spending $20,000 on “texting services” to boost Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis in the 1st Congressional District and state Sen. Randy Fine in the 6th District, according to a report filed tonight with the Federal Election Commission, which was first reported by The New York Times.

America PAC's spending in the special elections is minimal so far compared with the millions of dollars that have already been spent there. But it is a sign that Musk may be paying attention to the contests, as he continues to ramp up his political engagement while serving as a key White House adviser. America PAC has also spent millions of dollars on next week's state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin.

Tuesday's special elections in Florida are taking place in deeply Republican territory. Trump carried the 1st District by 37 points in November and the 6th District by 30 points, according to election result calculations from the NBC News Decision Desk.

Pastor Eva Steege was one of the named plaintiffs in a lawsuit the National Treasury Employees Union filed last month against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and acting CFPB Director Russell Vought. At the time, Steege was in hospice care with a terminal illness, according to court filings.

But she had been working with the student loan ombudsman of the CFPB to fulfill a dying wish: to secure a discharge of her student loans before she died through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to avoid putting a financial burden on her surviving family.

“That important and time-sensitive work was immediately halted by Acting Director Vought's work-stoppage order of February 10, and his decision to summarily terminate the Student Loan Ombudsman, along with all other term employees of the Bureau, three days later,” attorneys for Steege wrote.

Steege died March 15. She was 83.

“The thing that she feared has thus come to pass: She died without securing the discharge of her student loan debt,” the filing says. “The plan to shutter the CFPB has thus permanently deprived Eva of the 'timely assistance' that the CFPB was required to provide.”

Attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to include Steege's husband, Ted Steege, as a plaintiff in the lawsuit as the person responsible for administering his wife's estate.

The ombudsman who was working with Eva Steege, Julia Barnard, said she would love to help if she were still employed by the agency.

“If I were still able to perform the duties of the Student Loan Ombudsman, I would be able to meet with Ted to help him talk through his remaining options and fill out any remaining paperwork,” she wrote in a court filing. “I would also be able to meet with other partners, such as staff at the Office of Federal Student Aid and federal student loan servicers, to check on the status of Pastor Eva Steege's outstanding Public Service Loan Forgiveness application, explore the family's options, and escalate the case if necessary.”

Trump today signed a sweeping executive order attempting a major overhaul of American elections, requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote.

The order — which also includes an array of other changes, from mail-in ballot deadlines to election equipment — could risk disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans. Election law experts questioned whether Trump had the authority to make the changes, saying the order is all but certain to be met with legal challenges.

Federal law currently requires that voters swear under penalty of perjury that they are citizens and eligible to vote when they register, and courts have prevented states from adding documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters in federal races because of such laws.

Trump's order directs the Election Assistance Commission, an independent, bipartisan commission that supports election officials, to redo its voter registration form and require voters to show U.S. passports or other government ID that shows citizenship to register to vote.

National security adviser Mike Waltz said in a Fox News interview tonight that he takes ""full responsibility"" for organizing a text group on the messaging app Signal that accidentally leaked plans for U.S. airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen to the editor of The Atlantic.

""I take full responsibility. I built the — I built the group,"" Waltz told host Laura Ingraham. ""My job is to make sure everything's coordinated.""

Waltz's comments were in response to a question about whether a staffer was responsible for adding The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the group.

Waltz also suggested, without evidence, that Goldberg might have ""deliberately"" appeared in the group, which included top administration officials.

""Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical means is something we're trying to figure out,"" Waltz said, adding that he had spoken with Elon Musk today and that ""we've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened.""

The Atlantic has pushed back against efforts by Trump and his allies to attack its reporting.

""Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor, and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and others in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans. Our journalists are continuing to fearlessly and independently report the truth in the public interest,"" Anna Bross, a spokesperson for the publication, said in a statement today.

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., is clashing with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over her push to pass legislation that would allow lawmakers who are new parents to vote remotely.

In a closed-door meeting today, Johnson discouraged rank-and-file Republicans from supporting Luna's proxy voting bill, warning that it was unconstitutional, a source in the meeting said.

“We want to make it as easy as possible for young parents to be able to participate in the process,” Johnson told reporters after the meeting. “But proxy voting, in my view, is unconstitutional.”

Luna then took to X and posted a photo of three documents showing when Johnson had himself voted by proxy in 2022.

Government watchdog group American Oversight sued Trump administration officials involved in a group chat discussion of military plans that mistakenly included a journalist.

“Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations,” the lawsuit says.

“Defendants' use of Signal presents a substantial risk that they have used and continue to use Signal in other contexts, thereby creating records that are subject to the [Federal Records Act] and/or the [Freedom of Information Act], but are not being preserved as required by those statutes,” it adds.

American Oversight also noted that under State Department and Treasury Department recordkeeping rules, “officials do not forward Signal messages, including messages from the Signal chat, to their official email accounts, thereby barring American Oversight and other FOIA requesters from obtaining responsive records to which they are otherwise entitled under FOIA, particularly if such Signal messages are set to auto-delete.”

The lawsuit asks the judge to declare, among other things, that messages and communications sent via Signal in conducting official business are records subject to the Federal Records Act.

Trump signed an executive order today punishing a law firm that hired Andrew Weissmann, a Trump critic who was a prosecutor on former special counsel Robert Mueller's team that investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The order directs that employees of the firm Jenner & Block be stripped of security clearances and have their access to federal buildings limited and that federal agencies terminate any contracts with the firm. The order repeatedly singles out Weissmann, an NBC News & MSNBC legal analyst. ""Andrew Weissmann is the main culprit with respect to this,"" Trump said as he signed the order in the White House. ""He's a bad guy.""

Weissmann declined to comment this evening.

“Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court,"" a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement. ""We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.”

Trump has taken similar action against other law firms that hired prosecutors who worked on Trump cases or supported Democratic causes. He revoked an order involving the powerful firm Paul Weiss last week after it agreed to perform $40 million in free legal work for causes Trump supports and, according to a social media post from Trump, get rid of any internal diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., urged Trump in a short letter today to ""immediately"" fire Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, citing the military plans that were inadvertently shared with a journalist in a group text.

""Pete Hegseth is the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in American history. His continued presence in the top position of leadership at the Pentagon threatens the nation's security and puts our brave men and women in uniform throughout the world in danger,"" Jeffries wrote.

Referring to the leaked plans for U.S. airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen, Jeffries wrote that Hegseth had ""recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans.""

""His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law,"" Jeffries added.

Jeffries appealed to House Republicans in a statement yesterday to ""join Democrats in a swift, serious and substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach.""

Hegseth told reporters yesterday that ""nobody was texting war plans.""

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled today that a lower court's preliminary injunction on refugee admissions will remain in effect, but only for refugees who were conditionally approved as of Jan. 20, when Trump took office for his second term.

The appeals court ruled that Trump's executive order halting refugee admissions “does not purport to revoke the refugee status of individuals who received that status under the United States Refugee Admissions Program prior to January 20, 2025.”

U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead last month blocked the Trump administration from suspending refugee processing, decisions and admissions across the board. The appeals court today issued a partial stay of the order while it considers the government's appeal.

Whitehead issued a second preliminary injunction in the case yesterday, blocking the administration from terminating agreements with agencies that serve refugees and ordering the restoration of funding to those agencies. The administration announced today it's appealing that decision, as well.

Senate Armed Services Committee members are weighing how they intend to get more information from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about the information he shared on the Signal chat with Jeffrey Goldberg, with Democrats urging Republicans to call Hegseth to testify before the committee.

“Well, I think it would be helpful, certainly,” Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the committee's ranking member, told NBC News today about whether he wants Hegseth to testify. “And also, it would reaffirm his assertions that there was nothing unusual or inappropriate about the conversation.”

The committee's chair, Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said no decision has been made on the path forward.

Wicker and Reed discussed having Hegseth testify before the committee before the worldwide threats hearing, and Wicker signaled openness, according to a Democratic source with knowledge of the discussions. But Wicker suggested he wants to get Hegseth on the phone or receive a copy of the full Signal chat. 

The Democratic source believes that could be an off-ramp to avoid having the spectacle of a hearing held by a Republican-controlled committee. 

Reed said getting a copy of the Signal chat was a priority for Democrats, saying, “There is no legitimate basis for him to withhold information from the committee that he claims is unclassified and has already been shared with a journalist.”

Sens. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, both members of the Intelligence Committee, said they would like to see copies of the Signal chat.

Trump is nominating Media Research Center founder L. Brent Bozell III to be the U.S. ambassador to South Africa, according to Congress' website.

Bozell must be confirmed by the Senate for the role.

Trump had picked Bozell — who wrote a letter last year defending his son, at the time a convicted Jan. 6 rioter — to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media, but his nomination was withdrawn. Bozell and his father were key architects of the American conservative movement.

Trump signed an executive order last month halting U.S. aid to South Africa and promoting the resettlement of Afrikaners who, the order said, faced ""government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation.""

Elon Musk, the de facto head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, was born in South Africa and has repeatedly posted criticism about the South African government on social media.

Vice President JD Vance announced on X this afternoon that he will join his wife, second lady Usha Vance, as part of a U.S. delegation to Greenland this week as Trump escalates calls for a U.S. takeover of the Danish territory.

""You know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her,"" Vance said in a video posted to his official X account. ""I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland and also just check out what's going on with the security there.""

Vance said the Trump administration believes leaders in the United States and Denmark have ""ignored"" the island, which is rich in coveted critical mineral resources and is along key North Atlantic shipping routes, for ""far too long.""

""Speaking for President Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world,"" he said.

The Vances will be part of a larger U.S. delegation that includes Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Mike Waltz.

Outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Múte B. Egede has questioned the motives of the trip, arguing it could be a show of force by the Trump administration to intimidate local leaders.

There could be an additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths globally in the next four years if U.S. funding cuts are not reversed, the United Nations warned.

Almost all U.S. foreign aid has been put on hold since Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, though his administration says there is an exemption for the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, which is estimated to have prevented 25 million early AIDS-related deaths since President George W. Bush launched it in 2003.

Still, the program has been affected by cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, which could lead to a “real surge” in HIV/AIDS cases, said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency.

“This sudden withdrawal of U.S. funding has led [to the closure] of many clinics, laying off of thousands of health workers,” she told reporters in Geneva yesterday.

The world will see the disease “come back, and we see people dying the way we saw them in the '90s and in 2000s,” she added, saying that “we have not heard of other governments pledging to fill the gap.”

A federal appeals court today temporarily halted a lower court's order that the U.S. Agency for International Development reopen its headquarters.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay of U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang's order until Thursday, an indication it will decide in the next 48 hours on the administration's request for a stay while a full appeal is heard.

The Baltimore judge found last week that the efforts of Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to largely dismantle USAID “likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways.""

The judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering the agency to reopen its headquarters and restore access to email, payment and other electronic systems for all USAID employees and contractors.

Speaking from the White House in a lengthy back-and-forth with reporters, Trump downplayed the events and said the chat contained “no classified information, as I understand it.” 

“They were using an app, as I understand it, that a lot of people in government use, a lot of people in the media use,” he said.

Trump said he didn't want Waltz to be “hurt” by the breach and saw no need for him to apologize, even as the president said aides would “probably” not use Signal any longer. 

“If it was up to me, everybody would be sitting in a room together,” Trump said. “The room would have solid lead walls and a lead ceiling and a lead floor. But you know, life doesn't always let you do that.”

Waltz, who was in the room for a meeting of ambassadors, defended himself amid repeated questions about when Trump learned of the chat and how. Waltz said they planned to look into how Goldberg got added to the chat and whether Signal is secure enough to use for high-level discussions.

“We are we have our technical experts looking at it,” he said. “We have our legal teams looking at it. And of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible.”

South Korea is hosting the governor of Alaska and other state representatives this week amid talk of a long-stalled $44 billion pipeline supported by Trump that would transport gas from Alaska to U.S. allies in Asia.

The delegation led by Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, which is visiting today and tomorrow, also includes representatives from the Glenfarne Group, the lead developer of the project, and the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea.

The chamber said Dunleavy was scheduled to meet with South Korean Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun; Joseph Yun, the acting U.S. ambassador to South Korea; and acting President Han Duck-soo, who was reinstated in the role yesterday after the Constitutional Court overturned his impeachment amid continuing political turmoil in the country over impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol's attempt in December to declare martial law.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order this afternoon against the U.S. Agency for Global Media and its acting CEO, Kari Lake, blocking the Trump administration from canceling funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

“Congress has found that 'it is the policy of the United States to promote the right of freedom of opinion and expression' and that 'open communication of information and ideas among the peoples of the world contributes to international peace and stability,'” Judge Royce Lamberth wrote in his opinion. “The leadership of USAGM cannot, with one sentence of reasoning offering virtually no explanation, force RFE/RL to shut down—even if the President has told them to do so.”

The line Lamberth appeared to be referring to is “The award no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a sentence by Lake included in a notice of grant termination sent to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

“The Court concludes, in keeping with Congress's longstanding determination, that the continued operation of RFE/RL is in the public interest,” Lamberth wrote.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, is coming under fire from Republicans for referring to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as “Governor Hot Wheels” at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in Los Angeles over the weekend. Abbott is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair.

“Y'all know we got Governor Hot Wheels down there, come on now. And the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot ass mess, honey,"" she said. 

Several Republicans, including the NRCC and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. R-Ga., have amplified and criticized the remarks. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, is planning to introduce a resolution to censure Crockett over her remarks about Abbott, according to Weber's office.

In a post on X, Crockett denied that she was making a reference to Abbott's wheelchair use.

""I was thinking about the planes, trains, and automobiles he used to transfer migrants into communities led by Black mayors, deliberately stoking tension and fear among the most vulnerable,"" she said. ""Literally, the next line I said was that he was a “Hot A** Mess,” referencing his terrible policies. At no point did I mention or allude to his condition.""

Trump's nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, got an earful from Senate Democrats at his confirmation hearing Tuesday, in the wake of early actions by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to downsize the agency.

Democratic senators pressed Bisignano on whether he was involved in discussions about DOGE operations regarding onboarding personnel, which he denied. They grilled him on whether he agrees with Musk's rhetorical attacks on the program, which he sidestepped. They asked him to reassure them that Trump is telling the truth when he says he doesn't want to slash benefits for seniors, and that he'd protect the program if confirmed.

States that successfully sued the Trump administration over its federal funding freeze say the government has yet to release some disaster relief money, and are asking a judge to force the Federal Emergency Management Agency to release the cash. 

""The parties remain at an impasse as to millions of dollars in obligated FEMA awards, which are and have remained frozen dating to as early as February 7,"" the coalition of states with Democratic attorneys general said in a court filing yesterday. 

""Plaintiff States will need to wind down important programmatic emergency services, including disaster relief to people and communities affected by the Maui wildfires, in short order if funding is not immediately unfrozen."" 

The filing says 4,000 individual wildfire survivors could lose services soon if the funds aren't released, and that Oregon and Colorado are facing imminent major disruptions as well.

The states said that as of two weeks ago, “at least 215 FEMA grants to at least nineteen plaintiff states remain frozen or otherwise rendered inaccessible.” 

In a court filing earlier this month, the Justice Department contended the ""vast majority"" of the funding holds ""relates to the manual review process that FEMA is utilizing,"" and that the agency is permitted to carry out such reviews.

""It'll be up to the president to decide exactly what action to take,"" he said, adding that he believed the situation was being blown out of proportion by Democratic members of Congress.

Johnson has previously been critical of Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state during the Obama administration, which drew tremendous GOP criticism during her 2016 run for president.

China courted the executives of major U.S. businesses at an annual conference this week in a sign of how Beijing seeks to offset trade pressures, rather than retaliate forcefully.

China has long sought to attract foreign investment as a way to bolster growth, while tapping business interests for potential influence on the White House, particularly under U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.S. has twice increased tariffs across all Chinese goods since January, but Beijing has only announced targeted duties and restrictions on a handful of American companies.

Conversation on the sidelines of the state-organized China Development Forum this week in Beijing reinforced a more conciliatory stance than official rhetoric this month about how China is prepared to fight “any type of war” with the United States.

Trump's top intelligence officials claimed on Tuesday that they did not share any classified materials in a group text about U.S. military plans that inadvertently included a journalist.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe both downplayed the mishap during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing a day after The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a text thread about U.S. military plans to strike Houthi militias in Yemen.

The incident has raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of classified information as well as its use of Signal and other electronic communications.

The White House said Tuesday that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to a ceasefire in the Black Sea and to implement a ban on attacks on energy facilities by the two neighbors, an apparent breakthrough after American negotiators held separate talks with both countries. 

Negotiators had agreed with both countries “to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea,” the White House said in two separate but similar statements.

During morning testimony at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., repeatedly questioned Gabbard and Ratcliffe's denials that the military strike plans that were leaked in a Signal group chat were classified. 

“The idea somehow, ‘Well, none of this was classified but we can't talk about it here,' you can't have it both ways,” Warner told the officials. 

Gabbard and Ratcliffe had repeatedly deflected questions at the hearing about Signal group chat they were both reportedly part of, arguing the subject should not be discussed in a public forum. But central to their arguments on the gravity of the leak, they also denied that any of the information in the group chat was classified for security reasons.  

“It strains my mind to think, it strains my mind, if the shoe had been on the other foot, what my colleagues would be saying about this,” Warner said, referring to Republican senators. 

During the 2016 election, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton drew immense Republican backlash for her use of a private email server for communications when she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have both condemned the past mishandling of classified information by Democrats.

""If it's not classified, again, we'd ask you to give it to the public today,"" Warner said. ""If you got it here it's not classified, stand by your position, or is this just one more example of a careless approach to how we keep our secrets in this administration?""

David Rohde

As the hearing continued, the role of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth became a primary focus. 

During questioning, Ratcliffe and Gabbard both said that Hegseth was the “original classifying authority” on the chat. That was a reference to the fact that, according to The Atlantic, Hegseth was the governmental official who shared the targeting information that Democrats argue was classified. 

While initial questions after the Atlantic story broke focused on why Waltz set up the chat, Hegseth is likely to face further scrutiny about why he chose to share military targeting information on the chat. 

As the investigation continues, Hegseth, as the person who posted the military information, may face the most intense criticism.

Rebecca Shabad

Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., asked Ratcliffe whether he remembered various details in The Atlantic's report on the Signal chat about the military plans to attack the Houthis in Yemen, including whether Vice President JD Vance initially disagreed with the strike plans, as the magazine had reported.

The CIA director answered that he did not recall those details.

Ossoff then asked, ""Director, this was a huge mistake, right?""

""No,"" Ratcliffe said.

That prompted Ossoff to remark that a national political journalist had been privy to sensitive information and ""there has been no apology."" 

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., then chimed in, saying in his final remarks in the public portion of the hearing that putting the information out in the Signal chat could have allowed adversaries to reposition their defenses. 

""And the unwillingness of the individuals on this panel who were on the chat to even apologize for acknowledging what a colossal screw-up this is speaks volumes,"" Warner said.

Dan De Luce

Questioned by Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., at the hearing,  Gabbard refused to say whether she was using her personal or work phone in the Signal text chain on planned strikes against Houthi forces in Yemen.

“Were you using your private phone or public phone for the Signal discussions?” Reed asked.

Gabbard replied: “I won't speak to this because it's under review by the National Security Council. Once that review is complete, I'm sure we'll share the results with the committee.""

Reed followed up: “What is under review? It's a very simple question, were you using a private phone or officially issued phone? What could be under review?""

Gabbard declined to answer directly. “The National Security Council is reviewing all aspects of how this came to be, how the journalist was inadvertently added to the group chat and what occurred within that chat across the board,” she said.

The public portion of the Senate Intelligence Committee oversight hearing on global threats has adjourned. The committee will move to a closed session, where several lawmakers have said they will question Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe in more detail about the leak of sensitive military information to journalist Jeffrey Goldberg during a high-level group chat on the messaging app Signal.

David Rohde

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., posed the most pointed questions of the hearing so far, demanding that Ratcliffe answer whether Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow during the group chat. Russia is widely known for its ability to gain access to electronic devices and eavesdrop in sophisticated ways.

“Did you know that the president's Middle East adviser was in Moscow on this thread while you were, as director of the CIA, participating in this thread, were you aware of that? Are you? Are you aware of that today?”

Ratcliffe replied, “I'm not aware of that.”

Bennet, shouting, said, “This sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies and the personnel who work for him is entirely unacceptable. It's an embarrassment."" He added, “You need to do better. You need to do better.”

Megan Lebowitz

Gabbard acknowledged under questioning from Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., that the administration officials in the Signal chat discussed targets, although she had previously declined to say whether she was in the group chat. 

""I believe there was discussion around targets in general,"" Gabbard testified after saying moments earlier that she did not ""remember mention of specific targets.""

""I think that's consistent with my recollection,"" Ratcliffe added when being asked the same question. 

In answer to a string of questions from Kelly on whether those on the chat discussed the timing of airstrikes, weapons systems or military units, Gabbard and Ratcliffe repeatedly answered that they did not recall.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, drilled down in his questioning on Russia's threats to Ukraine and Europe's response. 

Cornyn said the annual threat assessment says ""Russia views its ongoing war with Ukraine as a proxy conflict with the West, and its objective to restore Russian strength and security,"" adding that Russia's perceptions on ""U.S. and Western encroachment has increased the risks of unintended escalation between Russia and NATO. Do you agree with that statement?""

Gabbard said she agreed. 

Cornyn suggested that the perceptions of U.S. leadership receding on security matters in Europe could lead to nuclear proliferation. 

""I know the incoming chancellor of Germany has talked about the possibility that Germany might share its nuclear weapons with Ukraine, and suggested that the U.K. would be part of that,"" Cornyn said. ""I know that Poland has talked about acquiring nuclear weapons and perhaps other European countries to make up for what they view as a receding of the American umbrella of protection.""

Megan Lebowitz

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, asked Gabbard why global climate change was not included in this year's worldwide threats report, despite it being included in prior reports.

""Every single one of these reports that we have had has mentioned global climate change as a significant national security threat, except this one. Has something happened, has global climate change been solved?"" King asked, noting that the effects of climate change include famine, mass migration and political conflicts.

""This annual threat assessment has been focused very directly on the threats that we deem most critical to the United States and our national security,"" Gabbard said. ""Obviously, we're aware of occurrences within the environment and how they may impact operations, but we're focused on the direct threats to Americans' safety, well-being and security.""

In answer to his question of who was responsible for leaving the subject out of the assessment, Gabbard said she did not recall instructing her team to not include climate change in it.

Rebecca Shabad

In response to questions from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Gabbard and Ratcliffe said they would be open to audits of their communications after they said that they haven't participated in classified discussions on Signal. 

""To be clear, I haven't participated in any Signal group messaging that relates to any classified information at all,"" Ratcliffe said.

""Senator, I have the same answer,"" Gabbard said. ""I have not participated in any Signal group chat, or any other chat on another app that contained any classified information.""

They said they would comply with an audit of their communications or other appropriate actions related to the issue.

Republican Sen. James Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio “at length” about how a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat in which the nation's top intelligence officials, Rubio reportedly included, shared classified plans for military action. 

“He is really aware of these kinds of things. We have leakage that happens from time to time,” Risch, of Idaho, said of Rubio, a former member of the committee, during his opening statement at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing this morning. ""I can assure you that his knowledge is such and his commitment is such that he had no knowledge of there being the tap on that, that there was when he was communicating.”

The committee's top Democrat, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire,  expressed concern over the information leak and that no State Department personnel were aware of The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg's accidental inclusion in the Signal group chat, or of the information that was leaked to him as a result. 

Risch called the incident a “serious leak,” and said, “I don't think there's anybody that wouldn't be concerned. …  We'll move on as best we can.”

Kyle Stewart

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said the addition of Goldberg to the White House officials' Signal chat was “incredibly sloppy” but added that “it was a mistake, and I am, I can say for certain, they're going to put protocols in place so that doesn't happen again.”

Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., said “people make mistakes” and to give Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “a pass.”  

Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., called his former colleague Mike Waltz a “patriot.” 

These members were all going in and out of the weekly House Republican conference meeting.

David Rohde

The Republican strategy so far in the hearing appears to be to ignore, minimize and downplay the Signal chat. 

No Republican senator has asked about it so far. Instead, Republican senators have focused their questions on migrants, cartels and China. 

Gabbard did not mention the call in her opening statement. When Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the committee, asked her about the call, she downplayed its importance, saying, “There was no classified material shared."" Ratcliffe gave a similar answer.

When Warner asked Gabbard if she planned to hand over the Signal exchange to the committee, she gave an unclear answer. When Warner asked FBI Director Kash Patel if he had launched an investigation into the call, he said he had only been briefed on it late last night.

Megan Lebowitz

Ratcliffe defended the use of Signal to discuss military plans, saying it was loaded onto his computer shortly after he was confirmed as CIA director.

Ratcliffe acknowledged that he was in the Signal group chat that was reported by The Atlantic, but said that he had been previously briefed about ""the use of Signal as a permissible work use.""  He said he was informed that any decisions made needed to be recorded in “formal channels.”

 ""It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided, senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels. So those were procedures that were implemented,"" Ratcliffe said.

Ratcliffe said that his communications on Signal did not include classified information.

Rebecca Shabad

Gabbard dodged a question from Warner about whether she was the user, reported as ""TG,"" in the Signal chat with Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg in which senior Trump administration shared military plans. 

""Senator, I don't want to get into this,"" Gabbard said, who repeated the same response after Warner kept pressing her. 

Gabbard said that she didn't want to talk about the magazine's report because it's still under review. 

She later claimed in response to follow-up questions by Warner that, in the Signal chat, there was ""no classified material that was shared.""

In her opening statement, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard didn't address the Signal chat at the center of the story yesterday in which The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that he was invited to the discussion with her and other senior Trump administration officials. 

Gabbard delivered her opening statement on behalf of the other witnesses, including FBI Director Kash Patel and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. 

She listed the number of threats facing the U.S., including those from ""several nonstate actors, cartels, gangs and other transnational criminal organizations"" in their ""illicit activity, from narcotics trafficking to money laundering, to smuggling of illegal immigrants and human trafficking."" 

Gabbard said that Islamist extremists like ISIS and Al Qaeda continue to pursue and inspire attacks against the U.S. domestically and abroad. She said that China is the U.S.'s most “capable strategic competitor,"" and also said Russia has developed cyber capabilities that pose a threat to U.S. infrastructure. 

""Among Russia's most concerning developments is a new satellite intended to carry a nuclear weapon as an anti-satellite weapon, violating long-standing international activity and putting the U.S. and global economy at risk,"" Gabbard said. 

Gabbard also said that the U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and that the country's supreme leader hasn't authorized the nuclear program. 

Megan Lebowitz

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., began his opening remarks at the Senate hearing on worldwide threats by slamming the White House officials whom The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg reported as having been involved in a Signal group chat discussing military plans that inadvertently included him.

Warner called the group chat mishap an example of ""sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information.""

""Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered even to check,"" Warner said, referring to Goldberg having been included in the discussion. ""Security hygiene 101: Who are all the names?""

Rebecca Shabad

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., did not address the Signal group chat that inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, on plans for strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. 

Cotton, however, did applaud Trump's “decisive action” against the Houthis  this month — which was discussed in the Signal chat — and said he commends White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others on the administration's national security team — some of whom the magazine reported were represented in the chat. 

Cotton also said in his opening statement that U.S. intelligence agencies are not fully capable of handling the threats facing the nation. 

""We have to ask, are our intelligence agencies well-postured against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is no, at least not yet,"" he said. ""As the world became more dangerous in recent years, our intelligence agencies got more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions rather than gathering facts."" 

He continued, ""As a result of these misplaced priorities, we've been caught off guard and left in the dark too often. I know that all of you agree that the core mission of the intelligence community is to steal our adversaries' secrets and convey them to policymakers to protect the United States. At the same time, it's not the role of intelligence agencies to make policy, to justify presidential action or to operate like other federal agencies. After years of drip, the intelligence community must recommit to its core mission of collecting clandestine intelligence from adversaries, whose main objective is to destroy our nation and our way of life.""

Kyle Stewart

Asked about the White House's claim that no military plans were shared on the Signal chat with Jeffrey Goldberg, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said, “That's baloney.""

""That's baloney,"" he said to reporters this morning as he left the weekly House Republican conference meeting. ""Just be honest and own up to it.""

""How does ending foreign assistance make us safer?"" Warner said in the op-ed published by Fox News. ""How does firing our most experienced FBI agents make us safer?""

He also asked how America is made more secure by firing people who oversee the nation's nuclear stockpile, monitor cyberattacks and prevent disease from spreading to the U.S., as the administration has done, although some who held those critical positions were rehired. 

""Can anyone tell me how firing probationary officers — without cause, and apparently without regard for merit, accomplishment, expense already incurred by the taxpayer in vetting and training, or the difficulty posed in filling the intelligence gaps left behind — makes us safer, or is an efficient use of taxpayer dollars?"" he wrote. 

""The instability of the last two months also undermines a critical component of our intelligence gathering capabilities: the trust of allies,"" Warner said. 

He suggested that he wants answers to these questions during the worldwide threats hearing this morning before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Trump stood by his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief was accidentally added to a private, high-level chat on the messaging app Signal in which military plans were being discussed.

“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,” Trump said today in a phone interview with NBC News.

House and Senate Democrats sent letters to top Trump officials demanding answers after The Atlantic reported that its editor-in-chief was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat in which top officials discussed military plans.

Top Democrats on prominent House committees sent a letter to four White House officials whom The Atlantic identified as potentially being in the Signal chat, asking for answers about the information shared. 

""We are especially concerned that the reported deliberations may have constituted a security breach, because they relied upon an electronic messaging application that is not approved as a secure method for communicating classified information and because they inadvertently included at least one non-governmental party,"" read the letter, which was addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz.

Separately, a group of 14 Senate Democrats sent a letter to Trump, calling the situation ""an astonishingly cavalier approach to national security.""

""It does not take much imagination to consider the likely ramifications if this information had been made public prior to the strike — or worse, if it had been shared with or visible to an adversary rather than a reporter who seems to have a better grasp of how to handle classified information than your National Security Advisor,"" the senators wrote.

The lawmakers asked that Trump and the officials share other instances in which officials may have discussed sensitive information using Signal and what steps the White House is taking to ensure this does not happen again. 

""In how many instances has the National Security Council held discussions on national security matters involving Principals Committee members or any other relevant executive branch officials using the Signal messaging service or any other messaging service application that has not been approved for the transmission of classified information?"" read the letter from the top Democrats on the Armed Services, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.

As the Department of Government Efficiency upends federal agencies, a report released today by the job listing website Indeed shows the number of workers looking for new jobs has spiked.

Job applications from workers at agencies targeted by DOGE are up 75% compared with 2022, according to the report's data. And while job applications among all workers increased after the Trump transition, the spike in applications from DOGE-targeted workers is especially pronounced.

The Senate Finance Committee will hold a confirmation hearing today on Frank Bisignano's nomination to be commissioner of the Social Security Administration.

The hearing is scheduled to start at 10:10 a.m. ET and last about two and a half hours.

Bisignano will likely face questions on the future of the SSA as talk of privatizing the agency have ramped up. The hearing also comes on the heels of threats from the acting commissioner to shut down the agency after a federal judge barred the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive personal data.

The top Democrat on the Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., sent a letter to Bisignano yesterday asking whether he supports privatizing Social Security, and whether he would be willing to undo recent changes made, such as the closure of dozens of Social Security offices, mass agency layoffs and new administrative requirements for beneficiaries.

“These new developments leave us deeply concerned that DOGE and the Trump Administration are setting up the SSA for failure — a failure that could cut off Social Security benefits for millions of Americans — and that will then be used to justify a 'private sector fix.' Republicans have flirted with the idea of privatizing Social Security for over two decades,” the senators wrote in the letter.

“The latest changes at the Social Security Administration leave us worried that Elon Musk — with his clear disdain for the program that provides financial security to millions of Americans — has taken up the mantle as the latest privatization crusader,” they added.

The hearing will likely get heated, as Democrats are expected to press Bisignano on whether he agrees with the approach DOGE and the acting commissioner have taken so far, as well as his thoughts on threats to customer service and timely benefits, and Elon Musk and Trump's claims about fraud in Social Security.

Warren told NBC News yesterday that she plans to press Bisignano on a wide range of topics.

“The Social Security administrator nominee needs to come clean with the American people. Is he in favor of the cuts that Elon Musk and his DOGE boys are trying to execute at the Social Security Administration? Or does he plan, once he has the power, to put a stop to it? Is he in favor of the privatization of Social Security that many Republicans are still advancing? Or does he plan to make a stand and put a stop to it? That's what I want to hear from him,” Warren said.

Bisignano is the chief executive officer of payments technology at Fiserv, which some Democrats have raised concerns since the company could benefit from any privatization of Social Security.

The Senate Intelligence Committee will meet today at 10 a.m. ET for its ""Worldwide Threats"" hearing, an annual intelligence community oversight hearing with testimony from the heads of the intel agencies.  

The open hearing, expected to run almost three hours, will be followed by a classified, closed session. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is the only official who will give an opening statement, but all officials participating will take questions from senators.

The hearing comes less than 24 hours after The Atlantic reported that Jeffrey Goldberg was added to a Signal group chat with Trump administration officials about U.S. military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. The group chat reportedly included two of the officials scheduled to testify today: Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Senators said they expect questions regarding The Atlantic's reporting. 

“I would expect it would, and I would expect our Democrat colleagues would raise it. And I suspect some of my Republican colleagues may raise it just as an issue to be very concerned about,” Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said yesterday.

President Donald Trump stood by his national security adviser, Michael Waltz, on Tuesday, calling him a “good man” a day after a report that he and other senior administration officials used a commercial messaging app to discuss secret military plans for Yemen and inadvertently included a journalist in the group chat. During a phone interview with NBC News, Trump also said Waltz had “learned a lesson.” The episode was discussed Tuesday at a previously scheduled Senate Intelligence Committee hearing at which at least two Cabinet members who participated in the chat testified.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday aimed at requiring people to prove they are U.S. citizens when they register to vote and blocking federal election funds to some states.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on election integrity Tuesday that would seek to strip federal funding from states that don't do enough to strengthen their election security.

The order includes a citizenship question on the federal voting form for the first time and calls on the U.S. Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute voting crimes.

Trump has consistently repeated without evidence the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him amid massive voter fraud.

“Perhaps, some people think I shouldn't be complaining because we won in a landslide,” Trump said about the 2024 election. “But we've got to straighten out our elections. This country is so sick because of the election, the fake elections and the bad elections. We're going to straighten it out one way or the other.”

President Donald Trump claimed no classified information had been discussed in the Signal group chat between senior administration officials that inadvertently included a journalist but said if there had been classified information contained in the chat, the situation would be “a little bit different.”

President Donald Trump claimed that Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, was given roughly $2 billion in government funding for environmental work, citing it as an example of wasteful government spending.

From March 2023 through 2024, Abrams served as senior counsel for Rewiring America, which aims to convert home energy systems from fossil fuels to electricity. The group was part of a green energy five-group coalition that was awarded a $1.9 billion EPA grant to help make homes across the country more energy efficient.

But Abrams did not lead the consortium, and group officials have repeatedly said she only served in an advisory role. There's also no evidence she directly received any of the money from the grant.

President Donald Trump said that his administration would investigate an incident in which the editor in chief of the Atlantic was invited to a Signal messaging chat in which senior administration officials discussed pending military action.

“Certainly we'll look at this,” Trump said during a meeting with ambassadors. He leaned into an argument that has been made by other members of the organization: that his adversaries are making a bigger deal out of the leak to blunt the success of his first two months.

“They had to find something,” he said. “Certainly we'll look at this. But the main thing was nothing happened. The attack was totally successful.”

President Donald Trump pardoned Devon Archer, a longtime personal and business associate of Hunter Biden's who was convicted of crimes that did not involve the son of the former president.

Trump officials knew their legal justification for terminating dozens of Environmental Protection Agency grants was flawed, according to documents and internal emails reviewed by The Washington Post.

Monday was arguably the most scandalous day of a controversy-ridden first two months of the second Trump administration. And administration officials and their allies are clearly still trying to figure out how to deal with it.

This is an excerpt from a full story.

Amid conservative calls to impeach a federal judge who blocked President Donald Trump over deportations, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said Tuesday that Republicans are considering legislation to limit the scope of federal injunctions — meaning Congress could move to curb the judiciary's power. Federal injunctions are put in place when judges believe a law or executive branch action may be unconstitutional.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, testifying before a Senate committee Tuesday, claimed not to recall whether specific timing and military targets were discussed in a Signal chat among administration officials about Yemen. According to The Atlantic's account of the conversation, they were.

“I believe there was discussion around targets in general,” Gabbard told Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The American Federation of Teachers and American Association of University Professors sued the Trump administration Tuesday for cutting access to funds and making unprecedented demands of Columbia University.

Asked by several Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee about whether he plans to privatize the Social Security system, Frank Bisignano, President Donald Trump's nominee to run the agency, said he did not.

“I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,” Bisignano said during a confirmation hearing. “I've never thought about privatizing. I don't see this institution as anything other than a government agency that works to the benefit of the American public.”

Frank Bisignano, a Wall Street veteran who is chairman of the board of the payment processing giant Fiserv, told members of the Senate Finance Committee that if confirmed as President Donald Trump's Social Security commissioner, he would “put the beneficiaries first,” whether they seek assistance from field offices, online or on the phone.

FBI Director Kash Patel sidestepped demands Tuesday to say whether the FBI had opened an investigation into how a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which Trump administration intelligence officials discussed military plans in Yemen.

“I was briefed about it late last night. I don't have an update,” Patel told Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Virginia) during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.

Warner insisted he expected an answer by the end of the day.

Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon and has not restarted a weapons program that the country suspended in 2003, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, reaffirming a longtime assessment by U.S. spy agencies.

While Iran's enrichment of uranium is at its highest level ever, approaching weapons grade, the Intelligence Committee “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader [Ali] Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,” Gabbard said.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said Tuesday that national security adviser Michael Waltz should remain on the job, despite using a commercial messaging app to discuss secret military plans for Yemen and inadvertently including a journalist in the group chat.

During Tuesday's Senate hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard refused to answer a question from Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Virginia) as to whether she was the “TG” who participated in the Signal group chat about the administration's military plans in Yemen.

Gabbard said she didn't want to get into specifics. Warner kept pressing.

“Will you answer my question, ma'am?” he said. “Why aren't you going to get into specifics? Is it because it's all classified?”

As the administration's intelligence officials were testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) told reporters that they would “hopefully be in a better position to answer” questions than he is about the leak of military plans in a Signal chat.

“Clearly there were errors in judgment,” Thune said.

Sen. Mark R. Warner (Virginia), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, used his opening remarks at the panel's annual threat hearing to lambaste the Trump administration and its security practices following revelations that senior administration officials discussed war plans for Yemen on a commercial messaging app and inadvertently included a journalist.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he remains supportive of national security adviser Michael Waltz after Waltz inadvertently added a journalist to a group chat in which administration officials discussed highly sensitive information regarding a U.S. attack in Yemen.

In an interview with NBC News, Trump said Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.”

Top Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee warned Tuesday that the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency “will cost lives.”

“With nearly two months until the start of hurricane season, it is completely irresponsible and reckless for the Trump Administration to continue to call for the elimination of FEMA,” Reps. Bennie G. Thompson (Mississippi) and Tim Kennedy (New York) — the top Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee and its subcommittee on emergency management and technology, respectively — wrote in a statement.

The statement referenced comments by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem on Monday about closing FEMA.

Mike Huckabee, President Donald Trump's pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, faces a confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If confirmed, Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, will become ambassador during an unstable time in the Middle East after Israeli forces broke the ceasefire agreement with Hamas and reignited the Gaza war last week.

The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to consider two other Trump picks — Kevin Cabrera for ambassador to Panama and Reed Rubinstein to be legal adviser at the State Department — in the Tuesday hearing.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt sought Tuesday to dismiss the Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, as “well-known for his sensationalist spin” after his extraordinary report Monday revealed that top officials in the Trump administration had discussed highly sensitive military planning using an unclassified chat application and mistakenly included him in the conversation.

Leavitt downplayed the officials' actions in sharing war planning in an unclassified group chat. But in doing so, she acknowledged Goldberg was on the thread where top Trump officials were plotting a military operation targeting Yemen's Houthi militants.

The United States' top intelligence officials will deliver their annual global threat assessment to Congress on Tuesday, a day after a bombshell report that the vice president, secretary of defense, national security adviser and other top Cabinet members used a commercial messaging app to discuss secret war plans for Yemen and inadvertently included a journalist in the group chat.

This is an excerpt from a full story.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, voiced confidence in President Donald Trump's national security team Tuesday, a day after a media report revealed that they inadvertently included a journalist in a group chat to talk about secret military plans for Yemen.

“I agree with the president: I think [national security adviser] Mike Waltz and [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth and the whole national security team is doing a great job, as evidenced by the campaign against the outlaw rebels in Yemen over the last two weeks,” Cotton said on Fox News.

More than 300 wealthy Americans have signed a letter urging Congress to block further tax cuts for the ultra-rich, saying the GOP plan to pay for them “would dismantle necessary social programs, put millions of families at risk, and undermine our economy.”

Several countries have updated their travel advisories for the United States under the Trump administration, warning of strictly enforced entry policies and the risk of detention at U.S. border points and advising transgender and nonbinary travelers about the categorizations of sex outlined by an executive order.

Days after Donald Trump took office, Jonathan Kamens realized he couldn't speak freely in his two digital group chats with fellow government employees of the U.S. Digital Service. A friend cautioned that at least one of the group members might rat him out for warning the new administration would gut his agency.

So Kamens started inviting colleagues, one by one, to join him in a group chat on Signal, a messaging app known for its security and privacy.

Global stock markets mostly slipped Wednesday as investors digested conflicting signals from President Donald Trump about his coming wave of tariffs.

In New York, the Dow was little changed but the wider S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq were lower in midday deals. 

In Europe, Paris and Frankfurt closed down while London edged up as data showed an unexpected slowdown to UK annual inflation.

With the White House's so-called ""Liberation Day"" on April 2 fast approaching, investors are bracing for a wave of sweeping levies on imports amid warnings of crippled global trade, recession and a fresh spike in inflation.

But Trump has alternated between tough talk about imposing tariffs across the board to suggesting he may allow some carve-outs to spare US consumers the full brunt of their impact on prices.

The result has been a drop in economic sentiment as consumers expect higher prices. 

""All the tariff talk uncertainty has led to a sharp drop in confidence,"" said David Morrison, analyst at Trade Nation. 

The president told Newsmax on Tuesday that he did not ""want to have too many exceptions"" but added: ""I'll probably be more lenient than reciprocal, because if I was reciprocal, that would be very tough for people.""

The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its closely watched gauge of consumer confidence dived to its lowest level since 2021 -- during the Covid pandemic -- as concerns grow over higher prices.

""Recent survey data has painted a gloomy outlook for the US economy. But this pessimism has yet to show up in hard data, such as unemployment, while corporate earnings continue to beat expectations,"" Morrison said.

The figures come as the Federal Reserve re-evaluates its monetary policy in light of Trump's tariffs agenda, with some analysts warning it might have to hold off any interest rate cuts this year.

The next major clue on its outlook comes Friday with the release of a key inflation indicator.

While almost all European markets fell, defence stocks bucked the trend as one country after another pledges to boost military spending, with Spain and Sweden being the latest to do so Wednesday.

France's Thales, Germany's Rheinmetall and Italy's Leonardo were all sharply higher.

London's stock market rose after news that the country's annual consumer inflation slowed to 2.8 percent in February from 3.0 percent in January.

The market held onto its gains even after finance minister Rachel Reeves cut the country's growth forecast in half to one percent as she announced spending cuts, as she raised the outlook for the subsequent three years.

""She appears to have done the trick of not unnerving investors further,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.  

Trump's talk of tariff exemptions had earlier helped some Asian markets edge higher after recent slumps. 

Copper futures traded on New York's Comex exchange touched a record high after Trump said he could impose duties on imports of the commodity within weeks, leading some investors to shift supply to the United States to avoid any eventual levies.

American National Insurance Co. will stop writing new life insurance policies in order to focus on other products, including the red-hot annuity market.

Scott Campbell, senior vice president of client experience and corporate communications officer, confirmed the decision Wednesday and sent this statement to InsuranceNewsNet:

“American National has made the strategic decision to stop writing new life insurance business and will continue to focus on growing our annuity, pension risk transfer and property & casualty lines. We have strong confidence in these businesses and expect them to be a big part of our long-term success.

“We remain committed to serving our current life insurance policyholders and will continue to fully service all in-force policies without interruption.”

Campbell said the application cutoff is May 31, 2025, and businesses must be placed by July 31, 2025.

Longtime life insurance insider Sheryl Moore is not surprised by the life insurance exit.

“I think the writing was on the wall when American National was acquired by Brookfield Reinsurance,” she said. “The triumvirate of an insurer/reinsurer/asset manager prefers to focus on indexed annuities.”

In May 2022, Brookfield Reinsurance completed the acquisition of American National Group, Inc., the parent company of American National Insurance Co., in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $5.1 billion.

American National's market share on the life side is small, Moore said, citing data from Wink's Sales & Market Report, fourth quarter 2024. The insurer held a 1.68% share of the $3.4 billion non-variable universal life market. American National also held a 0.63% share of the $4.3 billion whole life market and a 0.9% share of the $2.4 billion term life market, said Moore, CEO of Wink and Moore Market Intelligence.

Based in Galveston, Texas, American National also held a 1.34% market share of the $427.7 billion market that is indexed annuities, she added.

Follow:


            Dollar Tree is ending its short-lived and ill-fated Family Dollar experiment, offloading the discount brand for $1 billion – just a fraction of its purchase price from a decade ago.
    


            Family Dollar will be sold to private equity groups Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management, pending regulatory approval that is expected to clear next quarter. Dollar Tree bought Family dollar in 2015 for $9 billion.
    


            “The Dollar Tree leadership team and Board of Directors determined that a sale of Family Dollar to Brigade and Macellum best unlocks value for Dollar Tree shareholders and positions Family Dollar for future success,” the company said in a statement.
    


            Family Dollar has around 8,000 US stores, catering to low-income customers predominantly in cities with prices typically ranging from $1 to $10. The chain has struggled in recent years. Last year, Family Dollar announced plans to close more than 900 stores and was put up for sale.
    


            Messy stores, high prices and over-expansion have plagued Family Dollar, analysts say. The chain has also faced steep competition from larger retailers, such as Walmart.
    


            The sale of Family Dollar “closes the book on a sad and troubled chapter for Dollar Tree,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. “Dollar Tree bit off far more than it could chew.”
    


            The sale comes at a difficult moment for Family Dollar and other dollar store chains. Inflation in recent years has increased Family Dollar's operating costs and squeezed its lower-income customers. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported goods put a further put further pressure on dollar stores.
    


            “We continue to see value seeking behavior across all customer groups,” Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said on a call with analysts Wednesday. Dollar Tree caters to more middle-income customers than Family Dollar.
    


            Tariffs have introduced “uncertainty and volatility,” Creedon said, but Dollar Tree is shifting its suppliers to try to mitigate the impact and considering raising prices.
    


            Dollar Tree believed acquiring Family Dollar would help it compete against bigger rivals. The combined company hoped that by joining forces it could grow its customer base, reduce costs and fend off Dollar General, which is located primarily in rural areas. Dollar General had also bid for Family Dollar.
    


            But Dollar Tree misjudged the deal. The match between the two different chains was a poor fit, Wall Street analysts have said, and Dollar Tree has struggled to manage the larger Family Dollar store base.
    


            Family Dollar stores were in worse condition than Dollar Tree management expected, and early strategies to improve sales, such as selling beer, fell short. Many Family Dollar stores were located too close to each other and cannibalized each other's own sales.
    


            A year later, an activist investor pushed for a sale of the “underperforming” Family Dollar business, and Family Dollar announced it would close hundreds of stores.
    


            Even though Family Dollar has renovated thousands of stores in recent years, many are still poorly maintained, analysts say.
    


            Family Dollar was hit with a record $41.6 million fine by the Justice Department last year for violating product safety standards after selling items that were stocked in a rat-infested warehouse in West Memphis filled with live, dead and decaying rodents.
    


            It's not just Family Dollar that has struggled — the entire dollar store industry has been under pressure in recent years.
    


            Dollar Tree and Dollar General have hit trouble as low-income customers struggle to afford basic necessities and dial back their spending and competition from Walmart and other chains increases. 99 Cents Only filed for bankruptcy last year.
    


            “Our customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on an earnings call Thursday. “Many of our customers report they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.”
    


            Many companies are noting a consumer slowdown across income levels because of inflation, tariffs and a wobbly stock market.
    


            Dollar Tree said last year that tariffs may lead it to alter some product specifications, change sizes or remove them from stores altogether if they become too costly. Dollar Tree may also raise prices from their current level of $1.25.
    


            An estimated 40% of Dollar Tree's sales are reliant on imported goods, leaving the retailer highly exposed to tariffs, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets analysis.
    


            Dollar Tree may also raise prices to combat tariffs, joining a growing list of chains from Walmart to Best Buy that say that will hike prices to offset any impact.
    


            In 2021, Dollar Tree raised base prices to $1.25 after 30 years of selling items for just a dollar. Dollar Tree also sells some products for up to $7.

Oops, something went wrong

Delaware lawmakers this week pushed through controversial changes governing corporate behavior in a scramble to keep more businesses from leaving the state following the dramatic exit of Elon Musk.

Gov. Matthew Meyer signed the SB 21 legislation into law Tuesday and said the changes would maintain Delaware's place as the best place in the world to incorporate a business — ""ensuring clarity and predictability, balancing the interests of stockholders and corporate boards.""

The revisions came in response to a string of complaints from prominent CEOs, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Musk, who moved incorporations out of state or threatened to do so. The exits even gained a nickname: ""Dexits.”

Musk has already moved the incorporations of Tesla and his rocket-building company, SpaceX (SPAX.PVT), to Texas. Neuralink (NEUR.PVT), Boring, and the social media platform X — three other companies he oversees — have left for Nevada.

Over the past year, Meta (META), Dropbox (DBX), hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, Trade Desk (TTD), Fidelity National Financial (FNF), and Sonoma Pharmaceuticals (SNOA) have all floated plans to move their incorporations.

The talk of high-profile departures is roiling a state that, for roughly the past century, has been the dominant place to incorporate because of its so-called corporate-friendly laws, specialized business courts, and ease of filing company documents.

The state touts that it is home to more than two-thirds of all Fortune 500 companies. In 2023, Delaware hit a record 2 million total incorporations but saw a drop in the percentage of Fortune 500 companies registered there to 67.6% from 68.2% in 2022.

The state's newly elected Democratic governor, Meyer, launched a working group to study mounting complaints, and lawmakers rushed to push through a bill that would limit investor lawsuits by allowing corporate boards to further insulate their directors, officers, and controlling shareholders from liability.

Musk decided to leave the state after a controversial decision by a Delaware judge to wipe out his $56 billion performance-based compensation plan. He is now appealing that decision.

The billionaire, along with current and former Tesla directors, argued in a recent appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court that the refusal by Delaware Chancery Court judge Kathaleen McCormick to reinstate Musk's pay contained multiple errors that should lead to the ruling's reversal.

The new law passed this week by the state legislature and signed by the governor extends more leeway to board members in transactions where their interests or relationships raise conflicts of interest.

It also broadens the set of conditions that investors must meet before inspecting company records, making it more difficult for plaintiffs to find evidence supporting a lawsuit.

Semafor reported that the legislation was prompted by warnings from key corporate attorneys that more big-name companies, including Walmart (WMT), might move out of the state.

Critics say the amendments amount to a handout for billionaires because they broaden safe harbor protections for corporate directors. They also object to the legislation being put to a vote without more deliberation.

Columbia University School of Law professors criticized Delaware lawmakers for pushing what they describe as major overhauls so quickly.

""Ordinarily, reforms of this magnitude pass through the deliberate, consensus-driven process of the Delaware Bar's Corporation Law Council. This time, however, the route appears more compressed,"" the lawyers said.

Eric Talley, one of the Columbia University law professors who co-authored the critique, said parts of the new law may be vulnerable to state constitutional challenges.

""I suspect a challenge to be made imminently,"" Talley said.

He added that the most serious consequence for investors under the new rules is that they have less protection against actions by insiders — officers, directors, and especially large stockholders — that attempt to funnel assets away from outside investors and into the pockets of the insiders.

      Wipro Ltd bagged a 10-year contract with UK-based insurance company Phoenix Group, valued at $650 million, making it the second deal of $500 million and upwards in less than a year for the country's fourth largest information technology (IT) services company.


     
      This means that Wipro is expected to get $65 million in revenue from the company annually. The company would be handling Phoenix's policy administration, claims processing, customer support, data management and compliance support, Wipro announced on Wednesday.


     
      This deal comes amid a draught in big-ticket deals for India's largest IT outsourcing companies. Wipro, which ended last fiscal with $10.8 billion in revenue, signed a five-year deal valued at $500 million with an unnamed US-based communication service provider in June last year.


     
      “This strategic engagement with Phoenix Group reflects our commitment to leveraging our deep transformation expertise around process and technology--including cloud, data, and AI to drive increased operational agility for clients in the financial services sector,"" said Nagendra Bandaru, global head of technology services for Wipro.

      At least one analyst cheered this move.

     
      “Even before Pallia took over as CEO, some of the large deals that Wipro won came from his portfolio. Now, those deals are coming from other verticals and this means that he is implementing his success formula across the organisation,"" said Abhishek Kumar, research analyst at JM Financial. “Such consistent deal wins should help them bridge the growth rate gap with larger peers.""

Pallia's leadership strategy takes shapeFor Srini Pallia, who was tasked with reviving the fortunes of the company, which ended last year with a revenue decline, the deal comes as a silver lining. Pallia's two large deals in quick succession came after his predecessor Theirry Delaporte failed to bag such large deals later in his stint as Wipro CEO.

     
      Pallia, who took over as Wipro's chief executive on 6 April 2024, was tasked with steering the company to growth. For now, Pallia is looking to keep things simple. The company is not looking to sign or renew deals below its operating margins of 16%, and expensive team offsites are being shifted to virtual mode.

Wipro Ventres raises nearly  ₹1,740 crore in fourth round of fundraiseThe company underwent a reorganisation under Pallia's watch last week, creating four business units including Technology Services, Business Process Services, Consulting Services, and Engineering.

     
      As part of the rejig, Jo Debecker, who headed the IT outsourcer's cloud business, left the company after a three-year stint. His departure marks the tenth top-level change at Wipro since Pallia took over as CEO. In seven of the 10 exits, internal candidates have replaced the outgoing executives, in line with Pallia's strategy of entrusting business verticals to long-timers.

Challenges remain despite deal momentumYet, while the deal might please shareholders, concerns linger. For one, this is not a mega deal, which is a deal valued at over $1 billion.

     
      More importantly, Wipro is still expected to post a second consecutive year of full-year revenue decline, albeit not as much as in FY24.

     
      In the nine months ended December 2024, Wipro's revenue declined 4.2% on a yearly basis to $7.78 billion.

     
      The company is expected to end the fourth quarter of this fiscal with IT services revenue of $2.6-2.66 billion. This implies that even if Wipro reports the upper end of its estimate for the fourth quarter, it will likely end FY25 with a second consecutive full-year revenue decline.

Wipro does not individually disclose revenue from the UK but clubs it under Europe.

     
      Wipro's deal is the second such big-ticket announcement in a month.

Elisabeth Paulson, an assistant professor in the Technology and Operations Management Unit at Harvard Business School, grew up discussing math at the dinner table. Now, she uses algorithms and machine learning tools to make a difference in people's lives. We talked with Elisabeth about her research, her academic path, and why she loves reality television shows. 



What's your area of research?

I study how to efficiently and fairly design and allocate resources, especially limited resources in public sector or nonprofit organizations, with the goal of improving social well-being. I primarily work in two areas. One is refugee and asylum seeker resettlement, where the limited resources are the availability of resettlement locations in different host countries. The other is allocating food subsidies to increase fruit and vegetable consumption among low-income communities. Two very different application areas, but actually kind of similar when you get down to the nuts and bolts of the math, the machine learning models, and the algorithms that underlie both of these problems.

Tell us more about that—how do you go about this work?

For the first one, I work on designing new machine learning and algorithmic tools to help resettlement organizations find the best spot to resettle new families when they arrive in a host country. I collaborate with the Stanford Immigration Policy Lab, and we have partnerships with various resettlement organizations in Europe, the US—although that program is kind of shutting down right now—and in Canada. We work with our partner agencies to understand the specific context in a country and then come up with tailored algorithms and machine learning models that those organizations can use to help with the process.

For increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, I work on designing financial incentives and thinking through how they can be combined with other programs like nutrition education to try to improve the availability of healthy food and improve diets, especially in food deserts or low-income communities. 

What's an example of the refugee work?

We have an algorithmic tool called GeoMatch that takes historical administrative data from refugee or asylum seeker resettlement programs. We use that to train machine learning models to try to understand long-term outcomes and who is more likely to thrive in different locations. We use those predictions in an algorithm to recommend specific locations when a new family arrives. The main idea is that we can both speed up the process that agencies go through when making these placements—which has always been a very long manual process—and find better matches between people and places. 

What's an example of the nutrition work?

One project is with the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance, which runs the state's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and a supplemental program that provides rebates when SNAP dollars are spent on fruits and vegetables at certain vendors. It's designed to increase fruit and vegetable consumption among low-income households while also supporting local farmers since the vendors are typically farmers' markets, CSAs, and farm stands.

The challenge is determining where to expand the program with a fixed budget while ensuring equal access and utilization across different groups. It's very costly to the government because they're essentially giving out produce with a 100 percent rebate. The first step was assessing the impact of adding vendors in specific neighborhoods—how much would a new farmer's market in Quincy, for example, increase SNAP households' fruit and vegetable consumption? We recently completed a paper on that first step with faculty and a PhD student at MIT.

How did you get interested in these applications of machine learning and algorithms?

I've always been interested in using math and data science to solve problems and help make decisions. I knew that to stay motivated long-term, I wanted to do something that had the potential to help in some way—to improve social outcomes and also to help organizations that are doing the work on the ground to try to improve those outcomes.

What are you working on at the moment? 

A lot of my current research focuses on improving the resettlement algorithm or the predictions, because our algorithm will only be as good as the predictions underlying it. One complicated issue I'm working on now with a PhD student is that we have very little data for some locations–those that resettle only 20 refugees a year or that are very new and have no data.

There are a lot of technical complexities that make this problem really challenging—both to generate the predictions and then to build an algorithm. It's a cool example where the forefront of machine learning and online decision-making meets an important social problem. That's exactly the type of problem I like to work on.

Where did you grow up and what's your background?

I grew up mostly in State College, Pennsylvania, where Penn State is. My mom is retired now, but she was a statistics professor. I come from a very nerdy family, so I've always been interested in math, statistics, and computer science. At the dinner table, my older brother would constantly ask me math logic questions. That was just our family dinner dynamic. I remember my friends in high school being nervous to come over for dinner because they knew we'd be talking about math.

My mom always seemed to really enjoy what she was doing, and she had a lot of flexibility. That opened the door to me seeing academia as an exciting career path. I started doing research when I was in high school and carried that on throughout college. I've always really enjoyed being in an academic environment, doing research, and spending months or even years just thinking about an interesting problem.

I went to Penn State for undergrad—so, very close to home—and studied math and statistics there. Once I graduated, I took an industry job just to make sure that I wanted to go to grad school. Within a couple of months, I applied to PhD programs. 

I chose to go into a field called operations research, which is using math, statistics, computer science, machine learning—all of these analytical tools—to try to make better decisions in practical settings. I went to grad school at MIT, did my postdoc out at Stanford, and have been here for three years.

What do you like to do in your spare time?


I love to try out new restaurants with my husband. I hate the term ""foodie,"" but I guess that's the best term. I also have a dog, so I spend a lot of time with her—playing fetch, taking her on hikes. I also play on an intramural volleyball team once a week. I'm very invested in that and definitely get overly competitive. And I watch a lot of TV—that's really my main way of relaxing. Right now my favorite shows are Severance, White Lotus, and Shrinking. But honestly, I'm most passionate about reality TV. I love just the brainless aspect of it, they're great to watch while I'm cooking. I just think it's fascinating to see people being filmed and watch what they do and the decisions they make. I can't get enough of it.

Chandler has long been known as a hub of innovation in Arizona, but today that reputation extends around the globe. Our city stands at the forefront of the semiconductor revolution, with industry leaders like Intel investing billions in our community and a thriving supply chain of high-tech manufacturers choosing Chandler as their home. Our future is brighter than ever.  

But for Chandler to maintain its competitive edge, businesses—both large and small—need access to reliable, affordable energy. That's why the Chandler Chamber of Commerce supports the agreement between Southwest Gas and the staff of the Arizona Corporation Commission, the state's utility regulator, in the company's pending rate request.   

Chandler's growth in the semiconductor sector has been nothing short of remarkable. Intel's massive investment in our city has solidified our position as a leader in advanced manufacturing. The businesses that support semiconductor production—from suppliers to logistics companies—are expanding here, bringing jobs and economic prosperity. These companies depend on stable, predictable energy rates to make long-term investments in Chandler, and natural gas plays a crucial role in keeping operations running efficiently and affordably.   

With Chandler's growth, though, comes the expectation that we offer amenities families want and a quality of life that brings folks here. Take Chandler's downtown, which has become one of the Valley's most exciting destinations. Our restaurants are bustling with guests, serving up world-class meals that wouldn't be possible without natural gas cooktops. For these businesses, reliable access to natural gas isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. From fast and casual to fine dining establishments, our culinary scene thrives thanks to affordable energy and access to natural gas.    

Southwest Gas has been a trusted partner to the Chandler business community. The company works closely with businesses of all sizes, ensuring that natural gas remains an accessible, cost-effective energy source. Small businesses, in particular, rely on natural gas to keep costs manageable while delivering high-quality products and services to customers. In an era of economic uncertainty, our small businesses need energy stability, and Southwest Gas provides just that.   

As a chamber of commerce leader, what has impressed me most is Southwest Gas' commitment to open communication. The company has maintained an open-door policy with the Chandler Chamber of Commerce and its members, engaging in a transparent and constructive dialogue about the potential for a rate increase, which today is smaller than in our initial meetings. They have taken the time to explain the need to attract the capital that will make possible the infrastructure investments necessary to maintain safety and reliability and to meet the demands of Chandler's growth, all while ensuring rates remain competitive for businesses. This kind of engagement and fair and balanced approach is exactly what we expect from a responsible corporate partner.  

Chandler is growing, and the demand for energy is growing with it. If we want to continue attracting world-class companies, creating jobs, and supporting our local businesses, we must ensure that reliable, affordable natural gas remains part of our energy mix.  

We've looked closely at the agreement between Southwest Gas and the Corporation Commission staff. Rate increases—even modest ones like this one—are rarely popular, but this proposal has been vetted with community stakeholders, it makes sense for our community, and it is consistent with recent outcomes for other regulated utilities. We urge the Arizona Corporation Commission to grant its approval so that Chandler's business community can continue to thrive with the help of affordable and reliable natural gas.  

Terri Kimble is the president and CEO of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce.

Brown County Commissioner Brian Braun speaks after a cannabis business ordinance public hearing Tuesday. Commissioners unanimously approved the ordinance.



NEW ULM — Brown County commissioners unanimously approved limiting the number of cannabis retail businesses outside of New Ulm at three Tuesday.

The cities of Sleepy Eye, Springfield, Hanska, Comfrey, Evan and Cobden have delegated cannabis retail registration authority to Brown County. 

The New Ulm City Council recently approved a cannabis retail ordinance that limited the number of retail outlets to two.

No comments were heard at a public hearing before commissioners discussed the nine-page ordinance.

Cannabis retail business enforcement was detailed in the ordinance.

The Brown County Sheriff's Office shall complete a minimum of one compliance check per year of every cannabis business to assess if the business meets age verification requirements. 

Brown County may suspend a cannabis retail business's registration if it violates the ordinance of Brown County or poses an immediate threat to the health or safety of the public. Business suspension may be for up to 30 calendar days, unless the Minnesota Office of Cannabis Management (OCM) suspends the license for a longer period.

Brown County or the OCM may reinstate a retail business if it determines violations are resolved. Business violation civil penalties may not exceed $2,000.

Cannabis business minimum buffer requirements include prohibiting business operation within 1,000 feet of a school and within 500 feet of a day care, residential treatment facility, place of worship, adult entertainment establishment, DHS (Department of Human Services) licensed facility, playground, athletic field or another cannabis retail business.

Retail sales of cannabis flower, cannabis products, lower-potency hemp edibles, or hemp-derived consumer products are limited to 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Sunday.

Brown County Planning and Zoning Administrator Robert Santaella said he did not receive any public feedback after the cannabis business ordinance appeared for public notice in the newspaper. 

Brown County Administrator Sam Hansen said he did not receive any public feedback since the ordinance was published. 

Commissioner Brian Braun asked about cannabis retail business license revocation for a business that repeatedly violated the ordinance. Santaella said the OCM would eventually revoke a cannabis retail business license if there were repeated ordinance violations.

Santaella said the cities could set their limits on cannabis retail business license limits but that only the City of New Ulm has shown interest in cannabis retail registration authority. The other county cities delegated cannabis retail registration authority to Brown County which has a limit of three cannabis retail businesses.

Brown County Administrator Sam Hansen said League of Minnesota Cities (LMC) guidance is that cannabis business licenses would be granted on a first come, first served basis.

Ordinance approval came on a motion by Commissioner Tony Berg, seconded by Jeff Veerkamp, who thanked Santaella for his work on the ordinance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news","McClure, Hosmer want to crack down on businesses dodging taxes. Council slows down action","https://www.news-leader.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2025/03/25/springfield-mo-business-license-process-could-change-to-aid-property-tax-collection/82638159007/","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 14:53:06 GMT","

A month ago, City Council approved an ordinance allowing cars with expired tags to be towed. Monday night, the sponsors of that earlier plan pitched another proposal, this time aimed at cracking down business owners that don't pay pay their property taxes. After a contentious debate, council opted to take a different route, referring the proposal to a committee to review, delaying a vote on implementing the plan.

The proposal was another piece of public safety legislation authored by Mayor Ken McClure, who is less than a month away from leaving the post he's held for the past eight years, and Councilman Craig Hosmer. The pair co-sponsored the ordinance, which would require applicants seeking occupational licenses to be up to date on their personal property taxes.

The amendments to the current ordinance would require that an applicant include paid receipts for ""all personal property taxes due Greene County for property held in the name of the applicant for the previous calendar year."" For those who might not owe taxes that year, a statement of non-assessment would have to be included.

City Attorney Jordan Paul said such a requirement has been found to be allowable under state and federal laws and that a similar requirement is already in place in St. Louis and Kansas City.

Greene County Assessor Brent Johnson addressed council and noted that while the city has issued roughly 11,000 business licenses, he has only received a little more than 4,000 business assessment lists from within city limits for the year. He said business assessment lists are similar to personal property assessment — owners list their assets, which for businesses include any equipment, furniture, vehicles, and any other tangible property that is used for the business.

If that list is never filled out and returned, taxes cannot be billed. Johnson also noted it is a matter of education — some business owners do not know that they are required to fill out assessments or what assets would have to be assessed.

Unlike the requirement of an individual property tax receipt for vehicle registration, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said the county has no effective mechanism to crack down on businesses that are not declaring the property they own nor paying their taxes. While collections from property taxes do not make up a large portion of the city's budget, these tax revenues do fund Springfield Public Schools, Springfield-Greene County Library District, and other tax entities.

Hosmer and McClure's proposed change would require those who want to renew or receive a new business license to show they have paid their business' property taxes. Hosmer said this would be a similar process to what the state already uses for vehicle registration, ensuring all business owners are held to the same standards. He highlighted SPS' need for the revenue, particularly as discussions of job cuts have surfaced more recently.

Councilman Abe McGull was the one to suggest referring the proposal to the Plans and Policies Committee prior to voting on it. He emphasized that he was not against the goal of the ordinance and ensuring everyone pays their fair share but rather wanted the details to be more fleshed out and allow time for public feedback.

""When you send things through committee, all those things are hashed out, everybody in the community is aware of it,"" he said. ""But you're asking us, in two weeks, to pass this major piece of legislation that's going to affect a lot of people, the small businesses and stuff like that, and they may not even know about it. Not everybody watches the city council meetings.""

The towing ordinance passed by council Feb. 24 in a 5-3 vote also had not gone through committees prior to being presented to council for a vote. Hosmer questioned why committee work was brought up for an ordinance specifically dealing with businesses and not for the general public.

""It's a privilege to do business in the city of Springfield, and we should make people pay their fair share, businesses and individuals both,"" Hosmer said. ""So, I think it's imperative that we go ahead and do this, and I don't think it should be sent to committee, because the last time my bills got sent to committee, they never seem to come back.""

Councilwoman Monica Horton and Councilman Brandon Jenson, both of whom voted against the towing ordinance, noted that the discussion was not about showing favoritism to businesses but ensuring all questions are answered prior to making legislative decisions. Horton noted there is no rush to put the issue to a vote.

""We might have had a unanimous vote on the towing amendment, if it had went to committee and we had fleshed out some of the issues that came before us to the public,"" she said. ""I think that, you know, because we're having this type of tug of war here, I think that there is some value-add and some benefit to flesh this out a little bit better, instead of doing this sloppily.""

Jenson said that when he was onboarded, he was told that there should be no ordinance that comes before council without going to committee prior. He recently referred Right to Counsel to committee. While there is nothing that requires ordinances to go before committee, City Code does state that it is council policy ""to encourage the referral of council bills involving policy issues and substantive changes to the appropriate city council committee."" Likewise, there is no legislation or strict rules about how long an ordinance, program or topic can remain in committee or what must come out of the process.

""I am surprised that the sponsors of this bill, who gave me that instruction, now have brought two ordinances forward that have a substantial impact on people in our community without following the process that I was told is critically important to good policy,"" he said.

Ultimately, the referral passed 7-2 with McClure and Hosmer opposed. Hosmer said he does not have another future ordinance planned regarding property tax enforcement. With upcoming April 8 election, the issue will be taken up by a new mayor and possibly new council members.

When the towing ordinance was passed last month, Springfield Police Department declared there would be an educational period before enforcement began. With that period over, SPD may begin towing vehicles with inadequate registration starting Wednesday, March 26. Police Chief Paul Williams had previously said initially officers will go after cars that are a year or more expired.

Both Johnson and Icet said they have noticed effects already since the ordinance passed. Johnson said the assessment office is seeing large lines, which are not typical for this time of year, particularly with individuals getting their assessments for the past several past years.

Icet said over the few weeks that the new towing ordinance has been in place but not yet enforced, the collector's office has seen roughly a 30% increase in the taxes collected from the same period last year, totaling roughly $230,000 more. He said this increase is more than what he would anticipate in a normal year and attributed the change to council's action.

Keith Waters, the European Tour Group's longest serving executive (pictured above), is to retire in July. Waters, who is 67 years old, will step down following the Open Championship at Royal Portrush, after nearly 47 years as a player and administrator.

His distinguished career has encompassed several areas of the Tour's business including commercial relationships with promoters, federations, venues, regions and sponsors; player relations and helping to shape the Tour's rules and regulations.

He joined the European Tour Group in December 1995, having competed as a player for nearly 17 seasons prior to that.

His initial role was as Director of International Policy before becoming the Tour's Chief Operating Officer in 2007.

Last July, he moved to a part time role as Chief Regulatory Officer & Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) Technical Committee Representative, remaining part of the Executive Leadership Team in an advisory role.

In addition to being part of the OWGR technical committee, Waters is the representative for the International Federations of PGA Tours on the OWGR Governing Board. He is the only remaining Board member from 2004, the year the proprietary interest and management of the ranking system established by IMG in 1986 was transferred to a new incorporated company, OWGR. 

Waters said: “I feel extremely fortunate to have had such a wonderful life in such a great sport.

“Firstly, as a player, I was lucky to play and travel with all those great players of the 1980s, such as Seve, Sir Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer, who I used to share a room with.

“I was then fortunate to have another great career working for the Tour, particularly at a time when we expanded outside of Europe. My role was to develop new tournaments in new countries and it was a privilege to help the Tour become truly global and establish our long-standing relationships around the world.

“I've met some wonderful people along the way and when I look back on all of it, I have been incredibly lucky. We have achieved so much across the last three decades and I am extremely proud to have played and then worked in a sport I love for nearly half a century.

Guy Kinnings, the European Tour Group's Chief Executive Officer, said: “Keith has made an enormous contribution to the success and the evolution of the European Tour Group.

“Having begun his playing career in 1979, he has been part of all but the first seven of the Tour's seasons to date following the Tour's formation in 1972 and he has played an instrumental role in some of the most formative and significant periods in our history.

“He has truly dedicated his career and working life to the Tour and no-one is more experienced, and indeed no-one is more knowledgeable about Tour matters, than Keith.  He is universally respected by players, partners and colleagues, and on behalf of everyone associated with the Tour, I'd like to thank him for everything that he has done for our Tour and for our sport. We wish him a very happy and well-deserved retirement.”

In January, British sports technology firm Zen Golf stunned PGA Show 2025 delegates with an emphatic demonstration of how to move the ground professionally in golf and Zen is now claiming a two-year lead on the rest of the industry in this category.

Club Car is once again raising the bar for the golf cart experience with the latest updates to its popular Tempo range, which enhance vehicle performance, convenience and aesthetics.

The Costa Brava Golf Association is ‘digitalising' via the Zest.Golf Platform. A collection of 8 golf facilities now offering a 3 or 5 round digital golf pass that showcases the golf diversity within the region.

The Southern Africa and Indian Ocean Islands' region has become accustomed to foreigners buying property, and the South Africa property market, especially in the Western Cape, has seen more than its fair share of investment, writes John Cockayne.

However, the overwhelming majority of this activity has been for single stand-alone properties, not entire golf courses (especially one of the region's best), so the purchase of Pearl Valley golf club with its Jack Nicklaus Signature Golf Course, which sits within the Pearl Valley Golf & Country Estate, breaks this mould by some margin.

The new owner (Philippine billionaire Enrique Razon) already has an established interest in golf through ownership of the Country Club in Calabung in the Philippines, and his ongoing support of golf development in his country, through activities such as the Philippine Golf Tour.

Razon also has extensive hospitality interests, so one can only imagine what plans are in the pipe-line to further enhance one of South Africa' top golf courses.

The club already has top-class supporting infrastructure in the form of a hotel (managed by Mantis Collection), a country club, with an array of superb leisure facilities including a spa, gym and swimming pools. In addition, other facilities include; tennis courts, pétanque courts, cricket nets, a soccer field, SwingFIT Academy, and an equestrian centre.

The buyout of the original owners, was approved by the South African Government's anti-trust authority in November 2024, and announcement of the purchase in December 2024 was made through a social media post (by the golf club) under the heading – “A New Era for Pearl Valley Golf”, and reads as follows:

“We're excited to announce that Pearl Valley Golf has officially entered a new era of growth and opportunity under the ownership of Mr. Enrique Razon Jr.

Mr. Razon, a highly respected global entrepreneur, brings a wealth of experience and a passion for creating world-class destinations. His commitment to enhancing Pearl Valley's legacy ensures a bright future for our Club and its members.

“We look forward to an exciting chapter for our Club.”

Razon's interests in this region look to be long-term, and are not limited to golf, as his company ITSCI (International Container Terminal Services Inc), successfully tendered, in 2023, to operate Durban Container Terminal's Pier 2.

In January, British sports technology firm Zen Golf stunned PGA Show 2025 delegates with an emphatic demonstration of how to move the ground professionally in golf and Zen is now claiming a two-year lead on the rest of the industry in this category.

Club Car is once again raising the bar for the golf cart experience with the latest updates to its popular Tempo range, which enhance vehicle performance, convenience and aesthetics.

The European Tour Group's longest serving executive, who is 67 years old, will step down following the Open Championship at Royal Portrush, after nearly 47 years as a player and administrator.

WILLIAMSTOWN — Misti Sims, a Parkersburg South High School graduate and founder, owner and lead planner of Little Black Dress Events, signed documents Monday at Williamstown Elementary becoming their new Partner In Education.

Partners In Education is a program started by the Chamber of Commerce of the Mid-Ohio Valley that aims for partnerships that support students' growth, fosters achievement and deepens community connections

“This opportunity came up with the elementary and I was like, my heart is always going to still be with the littles, just because this is the groundbreaking part of showing them things that they may not be shown in everyday life, at their home or whatever,” Sims said. “All walks of life, all financial backgrounds come through the school as well as others.”

Sims said her son attended Williamstown Elementary and is now in sixth grade at the middle/high school. She said while he was at the elementary level she was heavily involved with the PTA and other events. She said Principal Lee Ann Cumpston approached her last year about becoming a Partner In Education. Sims said she wasn't very knowledgeable about the program and assumed schools could only have one partner and that they wrote big checks.

“The things that I can bring to the table, it's not necessarily that,” Sims said. “I'm not some big company.”

She said Cumston informed her that the program isn't just about writing checks.

“The more community we can bring into the school, the more things that we can expose kids to,” Cumpston said Monday. “And like she alluded, there are kids that come in here from all financial backgrounds and partnerships like this allow us to do special events for our students that they wouldn't otherwise be able to do.”

Sims said this was all she needed to know to make the decision to become a partner in education.

“We talked a lot about STEM during last year, and I just wanted to kind of circle back to that and just because my kid isn't here, and I just have the one, doesn't mean that I can't still be involved in some capacity. So it just means a lot to me.”

Jill Parsons, CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of the Mid-Ohio Valley, said the chamber tries to match potential partners with schools that will fit their individual level of participation in the program. 

“She (Sims) thought maybe being a partner was out of the ballpark for her, because she couldn't write a big check like a bigger company could do,” Parsons said. “But she's got passion, and she has ideas, and she has manpower that can come into a school that is different from some of the partners that can help more on a financial basis, who maybe aren't able to come into the school and help with the events.”

Parsons said the chamber uses artificial intelligence to make better connections with local businesses that will lead to longer lasting relationships. 

“We're the only county using AI to match schools and businesses,” Parsons said. “We want to create long-term relationships that extend beyond just having a child in the school.”

She said both potential partners and schools will fill out a three-minute survey listing the levels of interest and needs both are looking for.

“It might generate two or three ideas of schools and two or three businesses,” Parsons said. “Just so that relationships in the partner in education program are long term.”

Businesses interested in participating in the Partners In Education program can contact the chamber at info@movchamber.org or call 304-422-3588. 

“At the end of the day, it's about supporting our community's children and showing them what's possible,” Sims said.

Theodora's Pizzeria sat empty on a recent Saturday afternoon. Sussex Meat Packing has seen its weekday lunch crowd all but disappear. And Rocky's Pasties ― a 100-year-old business selling Cornish meat pies ― is down 30%.

“Customers come in and say it used to take them 10 to 15 minutes to get here,"" said Tom “Rocky” Rodkewitz, the manager of Rocky's. ""Now it takes them an hour.”

Blame the sinkholes.

Wharton, an old mining community that long ago became a suburban homestead with a thriving North Jersey downtown, has become a victim of its legacy as a collapsed section of Route 80 ― built over the Mount Pleasant mine ― has choked the borough's streets with detours and squeezed local businesses to the breaking point.

And there is little relief in sight.

The eastbound closure of Route 80 began on Feb. 10 as a sinkhole appeared by Exit 34. That void is located just a few feet from another sinkhole that closed the same area of the highway over four days in December.

Since the discovery of the sinkhole last month, the state Transportation Department announced repairs will take longer than expected due to the possibility of additional voids in the area.

And, as if fulfilling that prediction, an additional void opened on March 19, resulting in the shutdown of westbound lanes.

The entirety of Route 80 at Exit 34 is now closed. And DOT officials have ""identified 90 locations to be assessed and mitigate potential instability or possible voids.""

Gov. Phil Murphy said on March 22 that repairs could take another two months.

The cause of the Morris County sinkholes are abandoned mines that once drove the region's economy, but have been inactive and unattended since the 1960s. Morris County is home to more than 100 such abandoned mines, a 2020 geographical report on the area shows.

The sinkhole saga in Morris County is not only a headache for commuters, but for owners of local businesses ― particularly in Wharton ― who are finding fewer customers entering their shops as drivers avoid the area because of the bumper-to-bumper traffic.

Theodora's Pizzeria in Wharton saw a 50% to 70% decline in customers on some weekdays since the sinkholes shut down I-80 in early February.

""No one wants to sit because they are sitting forever in traffic, it has impacted us a lot,” said owner Theodora Tzouvaras. ""If this takes longer, is it really worth being in business anymore? And we are one of the smaller businesses. It is really difficult to say. They say six to eight weeks but is it really that long? They keep finding new holes.""

St. Patrick's Day weekend was supposed to be one of the best days of the spring for Knotty Pine Pub in Wharton. Not so this year, said its owner, Jimmy Hill. The restaurant, which serves burgers, sandwiches, fries and, of course, alcoholic beverages, was down $1,500 from last St. Patrick's Day, Hill said. 

Warehouse and factory workers would typically take the five minute drive to Townsquare Diner for lunch, said owner Pete Sederas. But that has dried up because the drive is now taking up to 30 minutes each way.

“Their one-hour lunchtime is all on the road,” he said. 

Wharton Mayor Bill Chegwidden has likened the situation to when businesses were struggling during the COVID pandemic five years ago. But some say it's even more difficult.

“It's worse than COVID,"" said Rodkewitz of Rocky's Pasties. ""At least there we had our takeout option,”

Tzouvaras of Theodora's Pizzeria, a staple in the Wharton community since 1996, said for her business ""it feels like COVID again.""

But this time, she said, it seems even more intense.

""COVID we did a lot of takeout, and takeout was always good, so that was not affected, but we didn't have this traffic,"" she said. ""Delivery guys didn't take an extra 20 minutes to get to where they have to be, customers didn't have to sit in traffic. It's a different situation overall.”

Sussex Meat Market, a community shop that has been in business for more than 40 years, has experienced a 30% to 40% drop in businesses, owner Dirk Peereboom said.

""We used to get a big crowd for lunch, but now people don't have time to get here,"" he said.

Major League Barbers on South Main Street is another Wharton business that has been struggling since the sinkhole swallowed Route 80. Owner Nancy De La Cruz said most of her customers are from neighboring towns such as Dover, Lake Hopatcong, Sparta, Parsippany and Budd Lake. But they have stopped traveling to her shop over the last few weeks.

""This was supposed to be our busy season, in the spring,"" she said. ""No one is showing up because they don't want to sit in traffic for hours.”

The barbershop has seen about a 40% decline in customers since the start of the sinkhole repairs, she said.

Still, shop owners work to endure the hardship.

“My grandparents dealth with the Great Depression, we'll be able to endure this,"" Rodkewitz said. ""But it will be tough.""

Chris Flores, a spokesperson for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said businesses in Morris or Sussex counties that have taken a hit from local sinkhole traffic could apply for grants or loans under the COVID-era Main Street Recovery Program.

To date, the state has awarded more than $167 million to 5,000 New Jersey businesses under the program, Flores said.

Strictly speaking, the Main Street Recovery Program is not specifically for businesses affected by sinkhole traffic, but it's a means for the state to inject cash into these businesses in the short term. 

Here's a breakdown of some of the programs: 

Meanwhile, state Assemblywoman Aura Dunn, who represents Wharton in the New Jersey Legislature, along with Senator Anthony M. Bucco (R-Morris) introduced two “Road to Relief” bills this week meant to take some of the pressure off businesses affected by the sinkhole. 

“The only way to turn this around for [businesses] is to do a 180 and focus on getting them the support they need while the engineers and other experts tend to the sinkholes,” Dunn said in a Monday evening statement. 

Gov. Phil Murphy's office declined to comment Tuesday afternoon on the moves being made by the Legislature.

But Yazan Muheisen, co-owner of Pop's Bagel Shop, said the sales tax exemption would be of little help to the business, since the sales tax is often passed on to the consumer. 

“It's not the assistance that's going to make or break the business,” he said. 

As far as federal relief, Murphy would have to request a federal emergency declaration, which would open the way for business assistance, said Barbara Nitis, a spokesperson for the U.S Small Business Administration.

Typically, a governor has to request an emergency declaration from the president of the United States, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. 

Then the SBA will provide low-interest loans to businesses impacted by the disaster; in this case the sinkhole. 

On Saturday, Murphy said the relief that will be distributed to businesses will be determined later.

Murphy issued an emergency declaration on March 8 for Morris County to begin that process, but the potential relief is still in discussions between the SBA and governor's office.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=business+news","Welfare cuts: Rachel Reeves to make further savings","https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4y9v8xwvmo","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 11:05:38 GMT","

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to make further cuts to welfare benefits and government departments in her Spring Statement on Wednesday.

The government announced big welfare spending reductions last week but the chancellor is set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.

The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has assessed that changes to benefits will save £3.4bn in 2029/30 rather than the £5bn claimed by ministers.

The chancellor faces pressure over the performance of the economy, with growth remaining sluggish. But Reeves will argue the UK has to ""move quickly in a changing world"" and will confirm a £2.2bn increase in defence spending.

The chancellor will set out her latest plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement at 12:30 GMT, and will cite uncertainty surrounding the Ukraine war and US tariffs threatening to upend global trade.

Reeves, who ruled out tax rises in the statement, has already announced several spending cuts.

But late on Tuesday, it emerged that she would widen her cuts to welfare after the OBR, which monitors the government's spending plans, estimated the already-announced welfare system reforms would not save the £5bn as planned.

The reforms include stricter tests for personal independence (Pip) payments, affecting hundreds of thousands of claimants.

But it is understood the OBR assessed that many claimants facing losing health-related benefit payments would instead claim for more severe conditions. 

The government did not deny reports, first carried by The Times, that the chancellor would make further cuts to try to make up some of the shortfall.

Some Labour MPs who stayed publicly loyal and had difficult conversations with anxious constituents and annoyed activists have privately expressed frustration at the news.

In her Spring Statement, Reeves will say she is ""proud"" of what Labour has delivered in its nine months in power.

She will attempt to put national security at the heart of her plan to ""kickstart economic growth"", saying the increase in defence spending is ""not just about increasing our national security but increasing our economic security, too"".

""This moment demands an active government stepping up to secure Britain's future... We need to go further and faster to kickstart growth, protect national security and make people better off through our plan for change.""

The increased funding will be invested in advanced technologies, including new energy weapons on Royal Navy ships.

It will also be used to provide better homes for military families by refurbishing the defence estate, and help fund upgrades to infrastructure at Naval Base Portsmouth.

The government announced earlier this month that it would cut the foreign aid budget to increase military spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027.

""As defence spending rises, I want the whole country to feel the benefits,"" the chancellor will say.

But some economists have argued the increase in defence spending will have a limited impact on economic growth.

Low economic growth and higher interest rates on government borrowing in recent months have made it harder for Reeves to stick to her self-imposed and ""non-negotiable"" rules on borrowing and debt.

These rules are not to borrow to fund day-to-day public spending, and to get government debt falling as a share of national income by the end of this parliament.

Helen Miller, the deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Reeves had left ""a tiny margin"" in the Budget.

""At that point in time, you could have said 'don't do that - give yourself a bigger margin' would have been a sensible thing to do,"" Ms Miller said.

""Now she's done it and, having put so much emphasis on the rules being non-negotiable, I think it would be very difficult for her to come back and say 'actually, at the first time of being tested, I'm going to let my fiscal rules be broken'.""

The OBR will publish a new economic forecast after the Spring Statement, where it is widely expected the watchdog will lower its growth expectations.

Official figures estimate the economy grew by just 0.1% between October and December 2024, with it shrinking by 0.1% in January.

When an economy is growing slowly - or contracting - businesses might not take on more workers or give pay rises. Lower profits mean firms pay less in tax, which funds government spending.

Ahead of her statement, Reeves has sought to blame the worsening state of the public finances on a global rise in borrowing costs.

Economic uncertainty, partly related to the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's trade tariffs, have been blamed for the cost of government borrowing rising across the world.

However, critics have said the UK's higher borrowing costs are in part down to Labour's economic policies and the country's economic outlook.

Long-term government borrowing costs over a period of 10 years continued to rise on Tuesday to hit just below 4.8%.

Campaigners say cuts to health-related benefits will be harmful to people with disabilities.

A charity boss says she is ""extremely concerned"" for disabled people after the Spring Statement.

Small business owners have been asking for more support to help them with rising costs in Kent. 

Chancellor says Welsh firms to gain share of £2bn extra funding for cutting edge military technology.

Planning reforms could result in 1.3 million new homes by the end of the decade, watchdog says.

      Anthropic scored a win this week after a U.S. court denied an injunction that Universal Music Group and other record labels had sought to prevent the artificial-intelligence company from using copyrighted lyrics to train its AI models.


     
      Concord, ABKCO Music & Records, Universal Music and several subsidiaries sued Anthropic in October 2023, saying the company was harming them by using copyrighted material to train its AI chatbot, Claude. The record labels alleged that Claude's responses to user queries contained verbatim or near-verbatim copies of the works, saying their reproduction violated copyright.


     
      The music companies, which represent a large cohort of artists ranging from Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande to the Rolling Stones, said Anthropic infringed copyright in lyrics from at least 500 songs and sought a preliminary injunction that would prohibit the company from using the works to train its models.


     
      However, a judge in California on Tuesday denied a motion for that injunction, saying the record labels hadn't demonstrated how using the works to train Claude caused reputational or market-related harm, according to court records seen by The Wall Street Journal.


     
      The record labels and Anthropic weren't immediately available for comment.


     
      Anthropic doesn't meaningfully dispute that Claude's training included copyrighted lyrics, the judge noted. The company said Claude's intended purpose isn't to reproduce existing works in response to user queries, but to generate original outputs, she added.


     
      The case is the latest in a string of disputes between AI companies and publishers on whether and how easily accessible content like music or news can be used to train AI models. Publishers are moving to shield themselves from what they see as violations of their work from AI startups.

TPG, a global alternative asset management firm, has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy's wind turbine generator businesses in India and Sri Lanka. Siemens Gamesa is a wind power subsidiary of Germany's Siemens Energy AG.

In a statement on Wednesday, TPG said the transaction was subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals, but didn't disclose the financial details of the investment.

Mint reported in May last year that Siemens Energy had put up for sale Siemens Gamesa's India wind turbine unit to cut losses and return its global wind turbine business to profitability by 2026.

TPG Rise Climate, the global asset management firm's climate investing platform, will invest in Siemens Gamesa's India and Sri Lanka businesses through its Global South Initiative, launched with climate fund Alterra to scale climate solutions in the region.

MAVCO Investments, backed by some Murugappa group family members, and former JSW Energy chief executive Prashant Jain will also make minority investments in Siemens Gamesa's India and Sri Lanka businesses.

Following the closing of the transaction, a new independent company will be created.

Siemens Gamesa will hold a minority stake in this new company and transfer to it about 1,000 employees and its manufacturing infrastructure in India. It will also exclusively license its intellectual property and technology while developing products for the new company, TPG said in the statement.

Vinod Philip, Siemens Energy board member overseeing Siemens Gamesa, said India remains an attractive wind energy market with significant growth potential.

“The new company will serve the Indian market more effectively while also offering a long-term perspective for the employees and customers. This ensures continued support and development in this vibrant market, while Siemens Gamesa can concentrate on other core markets,” Philip said in the statement.

The new company's board will be chaired by Vellayan Subbiah, who was recently appointed as a whole-time director and designated as executive chairman of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company, Murugappa Group's non-banking financial company. Jain will serve as executive vice chairman of the new entity and Philip will operate as Siemens Gamesa representative on its board.

“We believe onshore wind will continue to play an increasing role in India's green energy mix and this new platform, with Siemens Gamesa's world-class product manufacturing and service offering, and the backing of TPG and MAVCO will continue to accelerate the delivery of gigawatts of clean power to millions of Indians across the socio-economic spectrum,” said Ankur Thadani, partner and head of climate, Asia, at TPG.

Morgan Stanley, Kearney, Deloitte, Alvarez & Marsal, Khaitan & Co., Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton jointly advised TPG, MAVCO and Jain on the transaction.

 Senior Contributor. 

03/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25

Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher.

Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday's market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor's Strategy.

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the ""premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector.""

Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity.""

“Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy.

03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor's Strategy that's built up the world's biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.”

While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy.

GameStop's ""investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively,"" the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read.

GameStop's stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin.

Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020.

""Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen,"" Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair.

That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies.

“Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements,"" analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. 

“In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company's stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won't carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop's financial standing.”

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020.

Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month.

Last week, Saylor predicted there's about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

Should You Buy or Sell GME Stock Here?","https://www.tradingview.com/news/barchart:2a6ee8a0a094b:0-gamestop-is-adding-bitcoin-as-a-treasury-reserve-asset-should-you-buy-or-sell-gme-stock-here/","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:47:58 GMT","

GameStop GME shares are up some 15% on Wednesday, March 26 after the gaming merchandise retailer announced plans of using its corporate cash to buy Bitcoin BTCUSD. 

In its press release, the firm did not set a limit on how much it may invest in the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. 

Investors are cheering the announcement because putting BTC on the balance sheet has worked wonders for MicroStrategy MSTR stock over the past year. 

Including today's surge, GME shares are up nearly 35% versus their year-to-date low.  

What a Bitcoin Strategy May Mean for GameStop Stock

MicroStrategy has transitioned from a business intelligence software company into a Bitcoin proxy in recent years. It started buying BTC in August 2020, when MSTR traded for roughly $15. 

Today, the Virginia-headquartered firm owns more than 500,000 BTC in total, while its share price sits at about $33. That's a well over twenty-fold increase in less than five years. 

In 2024, the company now known as Strategy achieved a “BTC Yield” of 74.3%, indicating its Bitcoin acquisition strategy has been immensely successful in improving shareholder value. 

So, if GME succeeds in replicating MicroStrategy with its Bitcoin strategy, it's reasonable to believe that its stock price will rally in the medium to long term as well. 

That is what's driving GameStop stock price up at the time of writing. 

GME More Than Doubled Net Income in its Q4

GameStop shares may be worth buying at current levels because the retailer's earnings release also showed signed of improvement on Wednesday. 

For its Q4, the gaming merchandise company reported about $131 million in net income. That translates to a more than 100% growth from $63.1 million in the same quarter last year. 

More importantly, the NYSE-listed firm has sharply improved its overall liquidity in the trailing 12 months, from $1.19 billion only to $4.775 billion. 

Wall Street Remains Bearish on GameStop Shares

While things seem to be picking up for GameStop, investors should note that Wall Street remains bearish as ever on GME shares. 

The consensus rating on GameStop currently sits at “Strong Sell” with the mean target of $10 indicating potential downside of about 65% from current levels. However, investors should note that Barchart is only tracking one analyst in coverage of GME.

 Ethereum Foundation's Nixo Rokish told Cointelegraph that unexpected issues on two testnets left developers under pressure and exhausted. 

Ethereum developers are under pressure as the Pectra upgrade moves to a new testnet following a series of unexpected issues that have delayed its mainnet deployment.

The Pectra upgrade, which was expected to hit the Ethereum mainnet in March, was deployed into the network's Holesky testnet on Feb. 24. However, the upgrade failed to finalize on the network, prompting developers to investigate and address the causes. 

On March 5, the update was rolled out to the Sepolia testnet. However, developers again encountered errors, which were made worse by an unknown attacker who used an “edge case” to cause the mining of empty blocks. 

To better prepare for the upgrade, Ethereum core developers created a new testnet called “Hoodi.” 

Hoodi was launched on March 17, and the Pectra upgrade will roll out on Hoodi on March 26. If the upgrade runs smoothly, Pectra may hit the mainnet as early as April 25. 

In an interview with Cointelegraph's Felix Ng, Ethereum Foundation's protocol support team member Nixo Rokish said developers have been through a lot while preparing for the Pectra upgrade. Rokish told Cointelegraph: 

Rokish added that exhaustion is setting in, especially for the consensus layer developers, as Hoodi marks the third attempt to test Pectra.

“I think the consensus layer devs especially, but also like somewhat the execution layer devs are exhausted right now,” Rokish told Cointelegraph. 

Related: Ethereum devs agree to stop forking around and accelerate the roadmap

According to Rokish, the Holesky testnet failed in part because it had never been tested with such a small validator set on the canonical chain.

“As decentralized as Holesky is, it has never been tested at so few validators on the canonical chain,” she said. 

When about 10% was left on the canonical chain, the validators overloaded their RAM and memory as they kept the state for 90% of validators on the non-canonical chain. 

Rokish said they had never seen this before. “And so the consensus layer devs all of a sudden had this problem where they had to change a bunch of things, and I think that that was really tiring for them,” she said. 

Despite the recent testnet challenges, Ethereum's broader development continues to show progress.

On March 13, 2024, the network rolled out the Dencun upgrade, which implemented many changes in the blockchain. 

High gas fees, which were once a huge problem for the network, have become a thing of the past. A year after its Dencun upgrade, Ethereum's gas fees dropped by 95%. On March 23, average gas prices reached historic lows of 0.28 gwei.

Bitcoin's recent relief rally, which took the original cryptocurrency to a two-week high on Monday, is at risk of being short-lived as broader market uncertainty continues to keep investors on the sidelines. 

A lack of bullish momentum, low volumes and ongoing macro tensions are combining to create the conditions for what some traders say is a potential “bull trap” in a directionless market. Market experts point to macroeconomic risks, including potential tariff escalations, inflation concerns, and geopolitical instability, which continue to cast a shadow over Bitcoin's price action.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}"

Bitcoin, the digital currency and virtual payment system, has grown increasingly popular in recent years. The top cryptocurrency token holders have made billions of dollars off the digital asset.

Getting into the crypto space can be simple or complicated, and creating your own coin is possible, but not everything has to be performed digitally. Physical tools like cryptocurrency ATMs are within reach nationwide.

Here's what to know about Bitcoin ATMs and how to locate them in Ohio.

Like traditional ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs are kiosks that allow you to purchase or sell crypto by using cash or your own credit/debit card. Also known as BTMs, you can cash out your Bitcoin at a Bitcoin ATM, according to the personal finance website Bankrate.

Unlike traditional banking methods, however, cash withdrawals are made through a QR code that the machine provides. You then send your Bitcoin via the QR code before receiving your cash minutes after.

Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that can be bought, sold, and mined. It acts as a form of payment that's not governed by a single entity, according to Investopedia. It's run on the Blockchain, a record-keeping system of computers that tracks crypto transactions.

Bitcoin has a limited supply, and because it's a decentralized system, it's not issued by central banks or authorities, USA TODAY reports. While known for its price volatility, some investors have become rich by investing in the coin at the right time.

Planning to use a Bitcoin ATM? The rise of BTMs doesn't come without risk, as Bitcoin ATM fraud is on the rise.

The Federal Trade Commission found that during the first six months of 2024 alone, consumers lost around $65 million to Bitcoin ATM kiosks; older adults over 60 were the most vulnerable. Scammers will impersonate a government official, tech support, or business and urge victims to remove cash out of their bank accounts and instead deposit it into a Bitcoin ATM for added ""protection.""

The FTC notes that the scammers will give victims a QR code. Once scanned at the machine, their cash is deposited straight into the scammers' crypto account. The agency also cautions against clicking on suspicious links, responding to unexpected calls or messages, or swiftly moving funds if rushed.

""Don't believe anyone who says you need to use a Bitcoin ATM, buy gift cards, or move money to protect it or fix a problem. Real businesses and government agencies will never do that – and anyone who asks is a scammer,"" the FTC writes.

According to AARP, there are more than 49,000 crypto ATMs in the U.S., with over 100 Bitcoin ATMs in Ohio, including several kiosks located in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Akron.

Follow:


            After GameStop closed about a quarter of its locations within the past year, shuttering 1,000 stores across the world, the company said it's not close to done. And as the struggling company closes stores, it will invest cash in cryptocurrencies.
    


            GameStop revealed in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it expects to close a “significant number” of additional locations in the coming months, although the “specific set of stores has not been identified for closure.”
    


            A majority of the closures occurred in its biggest market, the United States, with 590 locations shutting down and reducing its store count to 2,325 as of February 1. More than 330 locations closed across Europe, plus nearly 50 stores in Canada and Australia.
    


            Globally, 3,203 GameStops remain — down drastically from its peak of about 6,000 a decade ago.
    


            GameStop has closed hundreds of stores over the past several years because it has struggled to adapt to customers' changing habits of buying games online and streaming. The company was also center of the “meme stock” craze in 2021, which briefly boosted its stock.
    


            GameStop joins a number of other well-known retailers closing stores or completely disappearing, including Joann, Forever 21, Kohl's and Macy's. Among the reasons contributing to the retail exodus is continuing inflationary pressure on consumers' wallets, pressure from private equity and retailers not quickly adapting to changing shopping habits.
    


            As part of GameStop's pivot away from retail, the company also said that it's getting into bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, announcing that a “portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances” might be invested in the digital currency.
    


            “The pivot to bitcoin is really a defense against irrelevance,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail told CNN, adding that it's “an odd thing as it's basically saying the strategy isn't retail but to act as some kind of cryptocurrency investment vehicle.”
    


            Nevertheless, the crypto announcement helped juice the stock: GameStop (GME) shares soared 16% in premarket trading Wednesday.

 Contributor. 

I called my dad the other night, and we found ourselves discussing investments, as we often do. He surprised me by confidently declaring, “You should've invested in gold instead of Bitcoin.” His comment wasn't just casual financial advice; it echoed a broader sentiment that's growing among investors lately.

Why are gold and Bitcoin, both once seen as safe-haven assets, now moving in distinctly different directions? This divergence is becoming more pronounced and meaningful, affecting investor decisions, regulatory outlooks, and market strategies.

Gold, long revered as a safe-haven asset, typically moves inversely to economic optimism. When geopolitical tensions rise, inflation fears spike, or market confidence dwindles, investors rush to gold. This behavior has been consistent throughout economic downturns, including the financial crisis of 2008, where gold prices soared in response to uncertainty. ​​During the 2008 financial crisis, gold prices surged nearly 25% from $870 per ounce in January 2008 to over $1,080 per ounce by December 2009.

Bitcoin, while also touted as an inflation hedge, behaves differently. Its movements are heavily influenced by market sentiment, regulatory developments, technological adoption, and liquidity flows, rather than solely economic indicators. Recently, the cryptocurrency market has been particularly impacted by regulatory crackdowns, advancements in blockchain technology, and growing institutional adoption. These factors often drive Bitcoin's volatility independent of traditional market pressures.

One of the primary reasons gold and Bitcoin are diverging lies in investor perception and asset functionality. Gold maintains a consistent perception as a stable store of value, underpinned by centuries of human consensus. Central banks hold significant gold reserves, reinforcing its global monetary role. Gold's limited use cases—primarily jewelry, investment, and limited industrial applications—protect its demand profile from rapid technological or regulatory shifts.

In contrast, BTC had a 42% annualized volatility of daily price movements in 2023 alone, influenced by regulatory shifts and technological updates. For instance, regulatory decisions in major economies, such as the United States, China, and Europe, can trigger sudden and dramatic price swings. Additionally, technological advancements, blockchain scalability issues, or innovations in competing cryptocurrencies can significantly affect Bitcoin's value.

The recent divergence can also be attributed to differing investor behaviors in response to macroeconomic environments. Amid rising interest rates and fluctuating inflation rates, investors looking for stability lean towards gold. Gold's tangible nature and its long-standing role in monetary policy provide psychological comfort and confidence.

Bitcoin investors often represent a different demographic and risk profile, typically younger investors and tech-savvy institutions drawn to innovation and higher risk-return potentials. The digital asset appeals as both a speculative instrument and a future-oriented investment tied to blockchain innovation. Thus, in periods of uncertainty or technological optimism, Bitcoin can experience swings contrary to gold.

The institutional narrative around Bitcoin has evolved rapidly, adding another layer of complexity. Institutional investors, hedge funds, and even some conservative asset managers have increasingly added Bitcoin to their portfolios.

Institutional investors now hold approximately 7% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply, up from under 1% just three years ago. While this adds legitimacy, it also makes Bitcoin susceptible to large-scale liquidity shifts driven by institutional buying or selling.

Gold, by contrast, has long been embedded within institutional investment frameworks, offering a predictable and less volatile profile. Regulatory clarity in gold trading, storage, and investment is well-established, ensuring consistent institutional participation without sudden disruptions.

Furthermore, recent regulatory moves have uniquely impacted Bitcoin. Regulatory actions in the United States in 2023 alone caused short-term declines of up to 15% in Bitcoin's market value following announcements by the SEC. Authorities worldwide have begun defining clearer frameworks around cryptocurrencies. Regulatory tightening in the U.S., outright bans in certain jurisdictions, or favorable regulatory environments elsewhere can all influence Bitcoin drastically, reinforcing its divergence from gold.

In chatting with Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, during his livestream, he commented, ""The divergence we're witnessing between gold and Bitcoin reflects deeper shifts in investor psychology and market structure. While gold continues to offer predictability during uncertain economic times, Bitcoin's volatility highlights its role as both a speculative asset and a bet on digital transformation. Investors must recognize these distinct characteristics to effectively navigate and diversify their portfolios.""

Understanding the divergence between gold and Bitcoin matters significantly for investors, policymakers, and the broader market for several reasons.

Firstly, this divergence underscores the reality that Bitcoin, despite comparisons, is fundamentally different from traditional commodities like gold. Investors relying on Bitcoin purely as an inflation hedge may misjudge the asset's behavior, resulting in unanticipated risks. Thus, portfolio diversification strategies must account for Bitcoin's unique characteristics rather than treating it as a direct substitute for gold.

Secondly, regulators must recognize that traditional regulatory frameworks suitable for gold and other commodities may not directly apply to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Regulatory clarity tailored to crypto-specific characteristics is essential to stabilize market dynamics and protect investor interests.

Lastly, from a market standpoint, the divergence highlights shifts in global economic and investment paradigms. As markets transition towards digitalization and decentralization, assets like Bitcoin may increasingly decouple from traditional market behaviors, driven instead by technology adoption cycles and digital infrastructure developments. This trend could redefine the benchmarks and metrics investors use to evaluate asset performance.

Looking ahead, the relationship between gold and Bitcoin is likely to remain complex and divergent. While gold will continue to offer stability, predictability, and traditional safe-haven characteristics, Bitcoin will likely embody risk, innovation, and digital transformation. Both assets will likely coexist, serving different investor needs and preferences.

As digital assets become increasingly mainstream, Bitcoin's correlation with technology sectors, particularly blockchain and fintech, might strengthen, further distancing itself from gold. Meanwhile, gold may become even more appealing during periods of intense technological disruption or geopolitical instability.

The current divergence between gold and Bitcoin serves as a critical reminder to investors, regulators, and the financial market about the importance of clearly understanding the distinct roles and behaviors of diverse asset classes. Rather than seeing Bitcoin purely as digital gold, recognizing its unique dynamics can guide better investment strategies, regulatory policies, and market analysis.

Ultimately, embracing these differences between Bitcoin and Gold rather than oversimplifying them could help investors harness both assets more effectively, achieving balanced portfolios that thrive across traditional stability and innovative volatility.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}"

About us

Copy link

GameStop shares jumped over 14% over the past 24 hours after the company's board approved a plan to buy Bitcoin.

The video game retailer and meme stock darling has $4.8 billion in cash reserves, but it's unclear how much it wants to allocate to the number one cryptocurrency.

While the announcement has caused a stock price uptick, some market observers say it's a double-edged sword.

“In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company's stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility,” analysts at crypto business payment company B2BINPay told DL News.

“Stablecoins, of course, won't carry those risks, but Bitcoin can go both ways ― offering potential for growth but also for a drop.”

Bitcoin dropped on Wednesday, to $86,858 in afternoon trading UK time, and is still almost 20% off its January peak.

Still, the move would put GameStop in the swelling company of public firms that have added Bitcoin to their corporate balance sheets ― most famously Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which holds the largest Bitcoin hoard worth more than $44 billion.

Championed by its laser-eyed founder Michael Saylor, Strategy's Bitcoin bet has turned the software company into a de facto Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

Bitcoin adoption has been a stock booster for some companies. 

Strategy's stock price has soared 84% in the last 12 months, and it's up 23-fold since it began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020. 

The shares of Metaplanet, a Japanese investment firm, have skyrocketed 1,600% since it started buying Bitcoin last April.

But not every Strategy copycat has done so well. The swoon in Bitcoin's price in the first quarter, along with stocks and other cryptocurrencies, has punished newer entrants to the Bitcoin treasury play with significant losses.

If Strategy is any guide, GameStop might need its own Bitcoin-maxi. CEO Ryan Cohen was seen with Saylor last month, which stoked speculations that GameStop could join the 170 entities with Bitcoin treasuries.

Matt Cole, CEO of asset management firm Strive Asset Management, also urged Cohen in an open letter to convert some of GameStop's cash holdings into Bitcoin ― to which Cohen responded, “Letter received.”

Co-founded by entrepreneur and Donald Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy, Strive filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF earlier in the year. The proposed ETF invests in bonds that are issued by public companies with Bitcoin treasury holdings.

The current stock market correction has been difficult not just for equity investors, but also for crypto investors. Across the board, nearly every major cryptocurrency is down for the year.

And, right now, the one cryptocurrency on everyone's mind is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which has historically been the bellwether for the crypto market. So just how much of an impact has the stock market correction had on Bitcoin?

Start Your Mornings Smarter! Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day. Sign Up For Free »

The answer to that question should have been ""not much."" That's because Bitcoin has historically been uncorrelated with any major asset class, including both the S&P 500 and tech stocks. In other words, Bitcoin could zig when stocks zagged. Due to Bitcoin's wild volatility, which led to huge market swings up and down, it was pretty much impossible to say that it was correlated with anything.

But that no longer seems to be the case. Bitcoin is now down 10% for the year, and nearly 25% since it hit an all-time high of $109,000 back on Jan. 20. So you could say that the stock market correction has had a very obvious and direct impact on Bitcoin, which is also in correction mode right now.

It's important here to keep an eye on Bitcoin's correlation with the overall stock market. This correlation is a mathematical measurement telling you how connected Bitcoin's moves (up or down) are with the broader market. Historically, this number has been very low, or even negative, suggesting a possible inverse relationship between Bitcoin and stocks.

But, in early January, Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 surged to 0.88, suggesting a nearly 1-to-1 correlation with the stock market. This correlation has remained stubbornly high, suggesting that Bitcoin will likely continue to feel the impact of stock market moves to a much greater degree than in the past.

From a portfolio diversification perspective, a relatively high correlation with the stock market makes Bitcoin much less attractive to investors. It's getting harder and harder to make the point that Bitcoin should be a stand-alone asset class when it is behaving more and more like a highly risky tech stock.

It is also possible to measure the shift in investor sentiment. This, too, we can measure with some mathematical precision, thanks to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Measured between 0 and 100, this metric tells you what investors are thinking at any point in time. If they are deeply fearful, the number is close to 0. If they are ebullient and euphoric, the number is closer to 100.

Image source: Getty Images.

When Bitcoin briefly dipped below $80,000, that number fell below 20, reflecting intense fear in the marketplace. Back in December, when Bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time, that number was closer to 80, reflecting intense euphoria in the marketplace. That makes sense, given that Bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark approximately a month after the presidential election, when investors were feeling very bullish about the prospects of crypto headed into 2025.

These days, crypto sentiment can swing wildly between fear and greed, depending on the day of the week. When the White House is talking about creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, sentiment tends to move positive. However, discussions of trade tariffs and economic tightening measures from the White House often lead to a negative shift in sentiment.

This change in sentiment is having an immediate impact on investor inflows and outflows into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have become a popular tool for adjusting one's overall exposure to Bitcoin. For five straight weeks, there were massive outflows, with investors moving their money out of the Bitcoin ETFs.

That makes sense, right? If investors wake up each day feeling fearful, they are going to find ways to act on that fear. And that means shifting money out of the Bitcoin ETFs. That money has to go somewhere, and it now appears that it is shifting into gold ETFs. In the 30-day period ended March 14, $5 billion flowed out of the Bitcoin ETFs, while $10 billion flowed into gold ETFs.

If you are trying to predict where Bitcoin is headed next, there are three different pieces to the puzzle: Bitcoin's correlation with the stock market, investor sentiment, and investor inflows (or outflows) to the Bitcoin ETFs. The good news is all of these can be measured mathematically, and can be tracked on a regular, recurring basis.

2025 is shaping up to be an important test for Bitcoin. If it can zig when the stock market zags, investors will know that the ""old Bitcoin"" is back. They will become more positive about its long-term price prospects, and more willing to pump additional money into the Bitcoin ETFs. And that steady buying pressure over time should help to put Bitcoin on the path to hitting a new all-time high.

By Emily Harper

Key Takeaways:

Fold Holdings Inc. and Bitdeer Technologies Group have been included in the holdings of the Bitwise Investments Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB). This was announced on March 25, 2025, via the company's X account.

Founded in 2019, and headquartered in Phoenix, Fold Holdings develops Bitcoin financial services, allowing consumers to earn Bitcoin rewards through the Fold app. Bitdeer Technologies is a Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company which has operations in the well-known locations such as the United States, as well as more obscure countries such as Norway and Bhutan and thus a significant player in the setup behind the Bitcoin network itself. This follows the launch of the Bitwise fund, highlighting the ETF's rapid expansion and appeal to companies with significant Bitcoin exposure.

The addition of Fold Holdings and Bitdeer Technologies to the OWNB ETF fits with Bitwise's strategy of broadening its holdings with companies that encompass multiple dimensions of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

With the addition of these two new companies, the ETF now consists of 22 companies holding at least 1,000 BTC in their treasuries. The fund is passively managed, offering exposure to publicly traded Bitcoin companies.

Note that the fund does not own Bitcoin outright or through derivatives linked to Bitcoin, so it avoids some of the direct volatility of the cryptocurrency itself. It is not, however, a measure of Bitcoin's price itself, but rather the price of companies associated with Bitcoin. As a result, the performance of the ETF is influenced by the financial health, market positioning, and strategic decisions of the included companies, rather than Bitcoin's day-to-day fluctuations.

The OWNB ETF is based on the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations Index, which includes significant Bitcoin holders like Strategy (MSTR) (previously called MicroStrategy), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Tesla (TSLA), which is run by Elon Musk.

The OWNB ETF's other major companies include Riot Platforms, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific. Like Strategy, Metaplanet has also been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin.

As of March 21, 2025, Strategy (MSTR) holds the largest share in the Bitwise Standard Corporations Index, accounting for 21.98%. The company owns 506,137 BTC, valued at over $42 billion. Second and third after these are MARA and Riot Platforms, with respective weightings of 10.07% and 9.85%.

Metaplanet, which has been very active in acquiring Bitcoin, has a weight of 4.81% in the index as the fourth largest holding and clearly values Bitcoin as a treasury asset.



The expanded OWNB ETF now holds a cumulative 648,000 BTC, worth over $54 billion USD. This represents approximately 3.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. In other words, the OWNB ETF is a barometer for the growing trend of corporations allocating to Bitcoin.

Fold Holdings currently owns 1,485 BTC worth nearly $124 million according to the Bitwise OWNB site, while Bitdeer holds 1,090 BTC that has an estimated value of about $91 million. According to analysts, ETFs offer a distinctive way to gain exposure to Bitcoin's growth story via the stock market.

Bitwise's move reflects heightened corporate interest in Bitcoin and allows investors to ride this growing trend with exposure through the OWNB ETF.

Oops, something went wrong

MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), recently rebranded to Strategy, co-founder and executive chair Michael Saylor said that he may burn his own private keys to Bitcoin instead of donating the cryptocurrency before he dies.

It would be an “ethically proper, ethically sound form of charity” that would grant “economic immortality,” added Saylor.

Saylor made these remarks while speaking to Christine Lee in an interview on March 25.

Strategy co-founder explained that burning his Bitcoin would reduce its supply, making the asset more valuable. The step would make “everyone in the network much richer and more powerful.”

Saylor added, “We're all in it together, from now to eternity. So yeah, that's my legacy.” He personally holds more than 17,000 Bitcoin.

Strategy itself would “never sell” its Bitcoin holdings the way the U.S. government has vowed not to, Saylor clarified.

The Bitcoin evangelist predicted Bitcoin's market capitalization to reach $200 trillion by 2045. As of March 26, it stands at $1.7 trillion. Saylor believes that in 2045, artificial intelligence (AI) agents will interact millions of times a second and use Bitcoin as a base currency.

Thanks to Saylor's highly bullish outlook towards Bitcoin, Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The company currently holds 506,137 Bitcoin, worth approximately $44.3 billion at current prices.

As GameStop joined the list of select companies that add Bitcoin to their corporate holdings on March 25, Saylor welcomed the move on X (formerly Twitter).

As per Kraken's price feeds, Bitcoin was trading at $87,818.80 at press time. Meanwhile, MSTR was exchanging hands at $341.81 at press time.

Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matthew Hougan says the firm is ""extraordinarily bullish"" on Bitcoin BTC/USD as the cryptocurrency gains widespread acceptance from governments, corporations and traditional asset managers. 

What To Know: Hougan sat down with Benzinga at the Future Proof Citywide event in Miami Beach, FL last week and talked about the importance of a crypto-friendly administration and President Donald Trump's recent announcement of a strategic bitcoin reserve. 

The last existential threat to bitcoin was removed when governments began accepting and adopting the cryptocurrency as an asset, Hougan said.

""We see governments around the world buying it. Do you wanna wait til it's too late to get in, or do you want to build your position now? The reason it's important for crypto investors is the biggest existential risk to crypto has always been that governments wouldn't like it, right?,"" Hougan told Benzinga. 

The chief investment officer said that the bitcoin of today has matured and become legitimized and accepted in a way it was not even five or 10 years ago. He pointed to institutional investors, hedge funds, ETFs and more than 70 corporations that now keep bitcoin as part of their holdings. 

Bitwise designed the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF OWNB that provides exposure to corporations with at least 1,000 bitcoin on their balance sheets.

""BlackRock is in the space. Fidelity is in the space. Stan Druckenmiller owns bitcoin. Ray Dalio owns bitcoin. The United States owns bitcoin,"" Hougan said. 

Hougan said that though the short-term outlook for bitcoin is risky, he sees the influx of capital eventually pushing bitcoin to $200,000 in the long run. 

""Short term: risky. Long term: extraordinarily bullish,"" Hougan said, sharing Bitwise's current outlook for bitcoin.

Bitcoin remained steady above $87,000 in Asian afternoon hours Wednesday as traders continued to monitor U.S. data releases and how the levy of U.S. tariffs will play out starting April 2, with most in wait-and-watch mode.

Majors were little-changed in the past 24 hours as Solana's SOL, xrp (XRP), BNB Chain's BNB, and ether (ETH) rose under 3%, while memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) outperformed with a 5.5% jump.

That was the second-straight day for gains for DOGE, alongside continued bumps in pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), as a tendency among these tokens to act as a “beta bet” on ether's strength showed no signs of reverting.

Elsewhere, shiba inu (SHIB) zoomed 11%, buoyed by a rotation to riskier memes and a 228% jump in its native ShibaSwap exchange in the last 30 days. Open interest on SHIB-tracked futures has risen upward of 20% since Sunday, data shows, indicative of expectations of further volatility.

Concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown remain, however, while a rapid unwinding of momentum trades in equities has led to money managers retreating to full defensive mode, some day.

“We expect markets to continue their soft rebound from last week into month-end, with the next major catalyst being the 'liberation day' reciprocal tariff announcement from Trump scheduled for April 2nd,” Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Rumors of a softer tariff response will go a long way to recover some of the recent technical damage in US stocks, helping to spark a global rally along with the recent jump in EU/China stocks.”

“Crypto will remain a close proxy of equities in the foreseeable future as we don't see a unique catalyst in the meantime, though the recent M&A announcements with Coinbase/Kraken give us faith that the long-term bull market remains alive and well,” Fan added.

Meanwhile, traders at QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast that the upcoming quarter and April in particular, have historically been one of the best periods for risk assets, second only to the festive December rally.

“The S&P 500 has delivered an average annualized return of 19.6% in Q2, while Bitcoin has also recorded its second-best median performance during this stretch - again, trailing only Q4, QCP said, pointing out caution among options traders.

“Options markets remain cautious. Call skew hasn't meaningfully shifted toward calls, with call skew only emerging from June onwards, suggesting traders are waiting to see how the tariff situation develops,” they said, adding that attention is turning to the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data, which could become the “next key catalyst.”

The PCE index captures inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflects changes in consumer behavior.

Released monthly, the PCE is said to influence Fed interest rate decisions. High PCE readings signal rising inflation, potentially prompting rate hikes to cool the economy, which can reduce risk appetite and pressure bitcoin prices downward as investors favor safer assets. Conversely, low PCE data suggests tame inflation, possibly leading to rate cuts or steady policy, boosting liquidity and supporting Bitcoin's price as a speculative asset or inflation hedge.

The next release is on March 28 and could sway market sentiment, with bitcoin's reaction tied to how the data shapes Fed expectations — volatility often follows as traders adjust positions.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, legislation that prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Upon introduction, Sen. Cruz said, ""Cryptocurrency represents financial freedom, innovation, and privacy. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would undermine these core values, erode privacy, and stifle innovation. I am proud to introduce this bill to restrict the implementation of a CBDC, and I call upon my colleagues to expeditiously take it up and advance it.""

This legislation was cosponsored by Sens. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.).

Sen. Cramer said, “A central bank digital currency has the potential for financial monitoring and surveillance and could turn the Federal Reserve into a retail bank. Despite the previous administration's push for this, Congress should not be circumvented and our bill ensures it!”

Sen. Tillis said, “This legislation is a crucial step in protecting Americans' financial privacy and ensuring that the federal government does not have unchecked power over how we spend our money. A central bank digital currency, if misused, could become a surveillance tool that threatens individual freedoms and free market principles. I'm proud to support this bill and stand with my colleagues in defending the American people from government overreach.”

This bill is endorsed by several organizations, including the America First Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Americans for Tax Reform, America's Credit Unions, and many others.

David McIntosh, President of Club for Growth said, “Allowing the Federal Reserve to issue a digital currency would violate the separation of powers, expose Americans to unconstitutional financial surveillance, crowd out private investment and innovation, increase volatility in financial markets, and threaten persistent inflation. Club for Growth applauds WHIP Emmer and the House of Representatives for their effort to keep President Trump's promise to protect Americans from the clear and present danger of the big government CBDC scheme.”

Rob Nichols, President & CEO of American Bankers Association said, “A central bank digital currency would fundamentally change the relationship between citizens and the Federal Reserve, and would undermine the essential role that banks play in extending credit and driving economic growth. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act protects our financial system and our economy from these harms, and we applaud Sen. Cruz and his cosponsors for introducing it.”

Rebeca Romero Rainey, President & CEO of Independent Community Bankers of America said, “A Federal Reserve-issued central bank digital currency would disintermediate community banks, reduce credit availability, and undermine consumer privacy. ICBA and the nation's community banks thank Senator Ted Cruz for introducing the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act to avoid the unnecessary risks a CBDC would pose to consumers and the economy.”

Sen. Cruz has long been a champion of free markets and cryptocurrency. He passed a joint resolution of disapproval overturning the IRS's Gross Proceeds Reporting rule for brokers handling digital asset sales, which would have harmed the digital asset industry by imposing burdensome reporting requirements on decentralized finance (DeFi) participants.

Sen. Cruz originally introduced this legislation in 2024 with the intention of halting the Biden administration's efforts to issue a central bank digital currency. He has previously introduced similar legislation in 2022 and 2023 to prohibit the Federal Reserve from developing a direct-to-consumer central bank digital currency, which could be used as a financial surveillance tool by the federal government.

Sen. Cruz authored the Adopting Cryptocurrency in Congress as an Exchange of Payment for Transactions Resolution, also known as the ACCEPT Resolution. He also introduced an amendment to repeal a provision from the 2021 infrastructure package that created new reporting requirements for many cryptocurrency and blockchain companies in both the 117th and 118th Congresses.

 Celo, originally launched as a layer-1 blockchain in 2020, has now transitioned to an Ethereum layer-2 protocol using optimistic rollups. 

Celo, the blockchain network launched in 2020, has officially transitioned from a layer-1 chain to an Ethereum layer-2 protocol.

Celo announced the successful transition in a March 26 X post, stating that “Celo is officially an Ethereum layer 2” protocol. In the thread, the organization claimed the new protocol features one-second blocks, sub-cent transaction costs, and Tether's USDt (USDT) and USDC (USDC) as gas.

Celo first proposed this transition in the summer of 2023, and it is now completed after block production on the old layer-1 platform halted and continued on the new network. The new platform is based on the OP technology stack and an optimistic rollups implementation.

Blockchain rollups are layer-2 scaling solutions designed to bundle multiple transactions off the main blockchain, reducing congestion and lowering transaction fees. Optimistic rollups owe their name to their assumption that offchain transactions are valid by default, only resorting to fraud proofs during a challenge period if discrepancies are detected on the main chain.

Marek Olszewski, CEO of Celo developer cLabs, told Cointelegraph that “migrating to an Ethereum L2 enhances Celo's security and scalability.” He added:

Related: A beginner's guide to understanding the layers of blockchain technology

Irfan Shaik, founder of rollup protocol Interstate, also recognized the change as positive for the protocol. He highlighted that Ethereum “has the greatest network effects of any chain,” adding:

Olszewski also shared his enthusiasm over the transition to the OP tech stack, saying it allows for “deeper composability with Ethereum-native apps and protocols.” The new system is also significantly simplified, with 365,000 fewer lines of code — decreasing attack surface and, according to him, leading to a lighter, cleaner and faster codebase.

He also highlighted that the upgrade preserved Celo's near five-year chain history and was carried out in a trustless manner. The token was also moved to the Ethereum blockchain, which Olszewski pointed out should sensibly increase its liquidity. He explained:

“What this means is that Celo becomes a fully-aligned Ethereum layer 2 — by architecture, by ecosystem and by mission.“

According to Miles Deutscher, the cryptocurrency market is distinctively volatile compared to other industries, offering unique trading opportunities (source: Twitter, March 26, 2025). This volatility can lead to rapid price changes, presenting both risks and potential rewards for traders. Such characteristics necessitate strategic trading approaches to capitalize on market movements while managing risks effectively.

FXStreet




Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $87,000 on Wednesday after recovering 4% in the last three days. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) find support around their key level, suggesting a recovery on the cards. Traders should keep an eye on Trump's upcoming “Liberation Day” on April 2, with significant tariff announcements, which could trigger increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market due to the potential impact of reciprocal tariffs.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $85,556 on Sunday and rose 4.45% until Monday. However, it hovered around the $87,000 level on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, BTC still hovers around $87,000.

If BTC finds support around its 200-day EMA, it could extend the recovery to retest the key psychological level of $90,000. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally toward its March 2 high of $95,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 51, above its neutral level of 50, indicating increasing bullish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to find support around its 200-day EMA and closes below $85,000, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $78,258.

Ethereum price retested and found support around its daily level of $1,861 for the last two weeks, and it recovered nearly 7% last week. ETH continued its recovery on Monday and closed above $2,081. However, it faced a mild decline on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $2,056.

If the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 39, facing rejection from its neutral level of 50 on Monday, indicating bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.



ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.

Ripple price broke above its 100-day EMA at $2.32 last week and recovered almost 7%. However, XRP consolidated around its $2.44 level in the last two days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $2.44.

If the 100-day EMA around $2.32 continues to hold, it could extend the recovery to retest its next resistance level at $2.72.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 52, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. The RSI must point upward and move above its neutral level of 50 to sustain the bullish momentum. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead.



XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP fails to find support around its 100-day EMA and closes below, it could extend an additional decline to test its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

SEC and XRP agreed to drop their appeals, which pushed Bitcoin into recovery mode – but can these giants provide same potential as these new best altcoins?

The SEC has been fighting crypto for years, but it looks like that's finally changing.

After a long legal battle, the SEC and Ripple's XRP have agreed to drop their remaining appeals. That sent a wave of optimism through the market, pushing Bitcoin back up from around $82,000 to $87,000.

Even with this rebound, some traders aren't convinced. They see Bitcoin and XRP as too unpredictable right now and are turning to presales for bigger opportunities..

Some of the best presale altcoins that we found include Solaxy ($SOLX), BTC Bull ($BTCBULL), Mind of Pepe ($MIND), Best Wallet Token ($BEST), and Meme Index ($MEMEX).

Let's see why.

Best altcoins to buy now

First, let's take a quick look at some of the best cryptos you can buy today:

Now, let's check out the details of the best new altcoins to watch:

Solaxy ($SOLX) could solves some of Solana's biggest problems—network congestion, failed transactions, and scalability. Its Layer-2 solution processes transactions off-chain, then settles them on the Solana mainnet. This keeps fees low and speeds high, even when traffic surges.



What makes Solaxy different is its built-in Solana-Ethereum bridge, which allows direct asset transfers between two of the largest blockchain ecosystems. This increases liquidity and gives traders more control over their portfolios.

Solaxy also uses real-time monitoring and predictive analytics to detect network issues before they cause disruptions.

With just under $28 million raised and its presale still open, this could be one of the best altcoins to buy as Bitcoin enters recovery.

Most meme coins ride on hype alone, but BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) flips the script by actually rewarding holders with real Bitcoin. 

Every time BTC hits major price milestones—starting at $150,000, then $200,000, and beyond—holders receive Bitcoin airdrops. The more $BTCBULL in your wallet, the bigger the payout.

On top of that, BTC Bull includes an automatic burn system. Whenever Bitcoin climbs another $25,000 past $125,000, a portion of $BTCBULL supply gets wiped out permanently. With fewer tokens in circulation and demand increasing, this setup could drive long-term value.

The project has already attracted serious attention, with nearly $4.1 million raised in presale—a big feat for a meme coin that actually puts Bitcoin in investors' pockets.

If you want to capitalize on Bitcoin's recovery and next bull run, BTC Bull could be one of the best altcoins to buy now.

Mind of Pepe ($MIND) takes crypto analysis to another level, using AI to spot trends before they take off. Instead of just tracking price charts, it scans the entire market—monitoring Twitter buzz, breaking news, blockchain transactions, and trading patterns.



This AI doesn't just follow the market—it adapts. Whether it's new regulations, a meme coin gaining traction, or an upcoming altcoin breakout, $MIND processes it all in real time.

What sets it apart? $MIND token holders control the direction. Investors vote on which markets or data sources the AI should prioritize, making it more than just an automated tool—it's a community-driven project.

With over $7.6 million raised in presale, Mind of Pepe is shaping up to be one of the best altcoins to watch before it hits exchanges.

With crypto adoption on the rise, a secure and versatile wallet matters more than ever. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) powers an all-in-one ecosystem with a non-custodial wallet, a decentralized exchange (DEX), and the upcoming Best Card—a crypto debit card designed for seamless spending.



Best Wallet supports thousands of tokens across 50+ blockchains, giving investors an easy way to manage their portfolios in one place.

Investors have already poured almost $11.4 million into the presale, making $BEST one of the best presale coins right now. With real-world utility and a growing user base, it's positioned as an extremely promising presale to watch in the coming months.

Picking the right meme coin can feel like a gamble, but Meme Index ($MEMEX) makes it easier by offering exposure to a basket of meme coins instead of just one. 



Holding $MEMEX gives access to structured indexes, covering everything from big names like Dogecoin to newer tokens with high-risk, high-reward potential.

What makes it different? The community calls the shots. $MEMEX holders vote on which tokens stay in the index, making sure it stays relevant and focused on real opportunities.

With over $4.2 million raised in presale and a major exchange listing set for April, MEMEX looks like one of the best presale coins for investors who want exposure to meme coins without the guesswork.

After years of cracking down, the SEC is finally easing up on crypto, and the market is reacting. Bitcoin has already climbed from $82,000 to $87,000, showing signs of strength, but some traders still aren't convinced.

Even with this recovery, BTC's next move isn't guaranteed. Some see this as the start of another bull run, while others think more volatility is coming. 

Either way, the shift in sentiment is clear—crypto is heating up again, and investors are looking for the best altcoins before things really take off.

 by Bradley van Paridon | Mar 26, 2025

To lower the cost of hydrogen fuel researchers, combine precious metals with organic molecules to create efficient catalysts for the production of hydrogen gas.  

Hydrogen fuel is touted as a clean and sustainable replacement for fossil fuels. Hydrogen is a zero-emission fuel and when produced with renewable energy is carbon neutral. Unfortunately, the cost of production is not economically feasible. This is in large part due to the requirement for the rare and expensive metal platinum.

To produce hydrogen, a reaction called the hydrogen evolution reaction is used. Here electricity splits water, into hydrogen protons, oxygen gas, and freed electrons on an anode. The freed electrons travel via an external circuit to a cathode and are met by the hydrogen protons where they combine to produce hydrogen gas.

However, for this reaction to work the cathode must bind the hydrogen efficiently but not so strongly that the gas is not released after it forms. To create the ideal conditions the cathode is coated in platinum. This rare metal binds with hydrogen atoms with suitable strength and this balance makes it an efficient catalyst and reduces the amount of energy required to run the reaction.  

Unfortunately, platinum is rare, and the amounts needed to scale up hydrogen production to meet modern demand would be extremely expensive. Therefore, finding a replacement for platinum is essential if the world wants to switch to hydrogen fuel.

At the Tokyo University of Science, Hiroaki Maeda, and Hiroshi Nishihara, along with collaborator across Japan, believe they found a solution — palladium.

Palladium, like platinum, is also an expensive rare metal. How then can palladium reduce the costs of hydrogen production? The answer, combine it with another material and use less of it. In this case that other material is called hexaaminobenzene.

Hexaaminobenzene is an organic molecule made of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. When combined with palladium it forms what are called coordination nanosheets which are thin two-dimensional materials. This nanosheet structure gives it several useful properties.

“The amount of palladium ions in the [coordination nanosheet] structure is about ten times less than platinum and palladium metals in the same volume,” said Maeda. Despite using less of the metal, the material still has the needed conductivity to transport the electrons needed for the reaction. And as Maeda explains, “the pores in the structure provide smooth mass transport of protons and hydrogens.”

To test whether the nanosheets perform as well as platinum in the hydrogen evolution reaction the researchers synthesized the palladium, hexaaminobenzene nanosheets directly on to the electrode surfaces. The result was a reaction that was nearly as efficient as platinum. The new material required very little extra energy to produce hydrogen. In a press release the authors wrote that this makes the coordination nanosheets, “among the most efficient [hydrogen evolution reaction] catalysts developed to date, making it a promising low-cost alternative to platinum.”

The team has investigated several combinations of metals and hexaaminobenzene, but the use of palladium is the best. The next steps for the team are to establish methods to efficiently synthesize the new electrodes at a larger scale.

One potential hurdle is the requirement of inert conditions for the production of the electrodes modified with nanosheets as they cannot be obtained in the presence of oxygen.

Durability is another lingering question. In initial experiments the electrodes performed well, remaining intact after 12 hours in the highly acidic conditions. However, their stability of months and years needs to be assessed.

In a press release Maeda concluded, “our research brings us one step closer to making H₂ production more affordable and sustainable, a crucial step for achieving a clean energy future.”

University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign philosophy professor John Schwenkler is the director of the new Illinois Forum on Human Flourishing in a Digital Age, housed in the philosophy department. The forum — which offers an undergraduate course, graduate fellowships, a speaker series and seminars — aims to examine the challenges and opportunities of living in a world shaped by digital technology, and to explore how digital tools might contribute to human flourishing. He talked with News Bureau arts and humanities editor Jodi Heckel.

What is meant by human flourishing?

This is not a question with a simple answer! But it helps to start from the recognition that human beings are one among the many kinds of living things. What it is for a living thing to flourish will depend on the kind of living thing it is: so the flourishing of a dog, for example, is different from the flourishing of an amoeba or an oak tree. With human beings, our flourishing is not just about our having healthy bodies but also about being able to use our minds well and to live with one another in human societies that are flourishing in their own right.

What are the most significant ways that digital technology has changed how we live? Are there other historical technological changes that are analogous to the current period of rapidly advancing digital technologies?

The effects of digital technology on human life have been enormous — and they are just beginning, as artificial intelligence technology is likely still in its infancy. I would put them in two categories. First, there are broad economic effects, such as improved telecommunication and the use of computers to do various kinds of work much more efficiently than it could be done by hand. Second, there are the effects on how we think, feel and relate to one another, as so much of our daily lives are mediated by digital devices like smartphones. In the end, I think it's likely that the digital revolution will have as big an impact on human society as the industrial revolution and the invention of agriculture did, and as big an impact on the way we think and relate to one another as the inventions of the printing press and the printed word.

What are the opportunities and risks associated with the pervasiveness of digital technology?

The most obvious opportunities are economic ones. Digital technology can help us get a whole lot more done than we could without it, and the rise of AI promises great benefits to scientific research and general economic productivity. But there are also personal, cultural and intellectual benefits, such as the ability to connect (albeit virtually) with people around the planet, and to have access to enormous collections of films, books and works of art. On the side of risks, along with the possibility that AI is going to put many people out of work, I worry a lot about the important things that we lose when we spend so much time on our screens. I worry that this experience diminishes our relationships with one another, impoverishes our experience of the physical world, undermines some of the necessary foundations of a healthy political life and simply causes us to waste a lot of time that would be much better spent in more meaningful pursuits.

How can we ensure we are using digital technology in ways that make our lives better?

This is another challenging question that I think each person needs to answer on his or her own. But my simplest advice is just to use much less of it than we usually do. This follows advice that Aristotle, one of my favorite philosophers, gives in the “Nicomachean Ethics.” There, Aristotle says that good moral characteristics are usually a middle ground between two extremes: for example, like courage is in between timidity and being overly rash. He also says that if you are tempted toward one of the extremes — which he calls “vices” — then the way to combat this is to try leaning into the other one. Given that most of us are likely to spend way too much time on our devices, the solution is to take a shot at spending way too little! Hopefully this will end us up in the middle ground, right where we should be.

How can philosophy help to think about the effects of digital technology on society?

The digital revolution is new and ongoing, but the risks and opportunities that it brings are of a kind we have encountered before, and philosophy has been there in those encounters. Therefore, it helps to learn from what past philosophers have thought when they've encountered technological revolutions, and how their thinking stood up to reality. Additionally, philosophical reflection on what's required for a flourishing human life is perennial — since humans haven't changed that much in the past 3,000 years, neither has the relevance of philosophers' arguments about what makes our lives go well.

Executives highlighted remote production, new studio technologies, multiplatform infrastructures as ways to engage viewers, streamline ops

News and sports programming, which are the biggest drivers for broadcast revenue and audiences, were also the central topic of the first panel at the TV Tech Summit, where executives at stations and networks discussed newer technologies that are helping them engage viewers and streamline operations.

When asked about the future of technologies for news and sports, panelists were particularly bullish on advances in virtual sets, remote production, standardized interoperable solutions, hybrid cloud archives and infrastructures that help streamline the delivery to multiple platforms.

During the panel, “New Tech for the Next Generation of News and Sports” Tim Hinson vice president, technology, at ABC13 KTRK in Houston Texas at the ABC Owned Television Stations, stressed that a key tech priority at the station group has been to standardize and centralize technologies. This, he said, has helped them improve quality and more efficiently produce massive amount of local news each week.

That effort, he added, also produced a number of important benefits during the L.A. wildfires.

“Over the past few years, we've been really focusing on technology and operations, centralization and standardization,” he said, adding that he wasn't “necessarily referring to just a people or a hub, for example, even though we do some of that. Really what we're talking about is centralization of technology [in terms of] reducing costs and also workflow optimization. And we're also hyper focused on making sure our common systems and workflows are standardized across the group, especially from a technology perspective, because that really, really promotes the sharing of data, content and personnel.”

Covering Wildfires with Better Tech

During the wildfires, he explained, “a lot of our other stations sent reporters, photographers and other support staff to L.A. to help out with the coverage….Because of our standardization efforts mentioned earlier, people were able to jump right in and begin working…We were able to easily provide live shots to any station around the country from any bonded cell packing unit with just a touch of a button.”

They were also able to get them working without having to “learn the station systems first…They were just able to go straight out in the field and start contributing right away,” he said.

Hinson and the other panelists also stressed the importance of engaging viewers with new ways of telling stories that can help them stand out from a crowded news and sports landscape.

One example of that is virtual sets or augmented reality technologies.

Jason Wormser, senior vice president, CW Sports noted that their production partner NASCAR Productions has recently unveiled a new virtual set in Studio 43, their state-of-the-art production facility that NASCAR uses to produce the CW NASCAR coverage.

“They've invested in a 57 foot LED wall,” he said. “They are using AR camera tracking technology with a [ARRI] Alexa 35 studio camera system…We really think this is kind of the next stage, the next step of these virtual systems"" that will provide enormous flexibility and quality for the studio production.”

During the panel, Scott Warren, president and general manager, CBS Bay Area (KPIX/KPIX+) discussed a ground-breaking case study of how the CBS-owned stations were able to deploy virtual sets, which until relatively recently, required the kind of large budgets and engineering staff that only large networks could afford.

Warren said the project began in 2023 as part of a push to find better ways to tell stories and provide better, more engaging weather coverage. “We wanted to make an immersive experience, because weather is more than two dimensional,” he explained. “It's more than a person in front of a map, it's cloud stacks, it's elevation, it's wind, it's rain, it's precipitation…We felt like we could tell the weather story in a better way in an immersive environment, and that's where this all started.”

In the development process of the system, they worked with Myreze, a branding and virtual production company from Norway. Other vendors included Zero Density's virtual solution, rendering from the Unreal Engine, camera tracking from stYpe and Baron Weather for integrated weather data.

The Secret Sauce for Immersive Local News

A key component, however, was their inhouse tech talent, Warren stressed. “We had to challenge them [all the vendors], as well as ourselves, because we couldn't add bodies…We really had to do it with the existing team…We had to do something different and bring all of this in house and have it hook up into an automated control room with just one director.”

And…that was the where the secret sauce comes in, [the station's inhouse tech talent],” he added. “Our coders and our engineers have worked feverishly to pull all the pieces and parts [together] and to get inside all of the third party vendors' engines and reconfigure things to make it work.”

The result, he adds, is “TV in a box. We've created a system that does work with just one director driving the whole thing, and one operator, and that's it.”

The system is so streamlined they've been able to since install it at other CBS owned stations in New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Colorado and Miami. It has also been expanded for additional types of coverage, including breaking news and sports, with the CBS stations using it for their March Madness Coverage.

In San Francisco, they've become so comfortable with the solution that they've discarded all the hard sets.

The system is particularly appealing for breaking news. “The magic of the weather system is that everything is in real time and real time data,” Warren said. “The big challenge at the very beginning of building this was, how do we bring all that weather data from the National Weather Service and other partners into our system at every single elevation in the atmosphere, to show every different kind of condition, pressure, wind, precipitation and temperature, all the things that factor into what makes weather. How do we bring that digital information into the system in real time and create the visual representations of what that is doing?”

The resulting system “does exactly that,” he explained. “It builds graphics in real time.”

This has also been important for breaking news like wildfires. “We're able to watch fires and fire lines develop with these virtual maps,” he said, adding that it has also been a great tool for covering “earthquakes...We're able to locate and show the magnitude as it ripples out across an area, and all of this is driven by the meteorologists in real time who have an iPad.”

The Remote Production Game

During the panel, CW's Wormser also highlighted the growing importance of remote production tech advances in cutting the costs of sports production.

“Our system is a little bit different than everybody else's, because we are using third parties,” that are producing events for us,” Wormser explained, using remote production technologies. “With REMI, with COVID…it just accelerated so many things in our business [so that remote production]...is kind of the next step” in sports production.

Wormser noted that remote productions have given them more flexibility in the way they've produced events, while reducing costs and freeing up money to improve the productions.

“It just saves so much, and it also gives you flexibility in the future of trying new things, trying different ideas, spending more time on pre-produced or post-produced elements,” he said. “It gives you a little bit more flexibility at a lower cost.”

“All the networks are doing it,” he added. “ESPN has been doing it with basketball. Fox has been doing this for years…It goes back into the early 2000s basically, they were bringing games in from across the world, and they were voicing and doing all the graphics in their studios in Los Angeles, and calling him off the monitor because they don't have the money to go around the world. So it's only going to get better. The technology is unbelievable, and will enable networks to put the money into rights and yet still have high quality, innovative production and content for the viewers.”

The TV Tech Summit had a full separate panel on remote productions discussing those developments in more detail.

BANGKOK (AP) — China protested Wednesday after the U.S. added dozens of companies to its export control list, including more than 50 based in China that it says sought advanced knowhow in supercomputing, artificial intelligence and quantum technology for military purposes. 

Companies from Taiwan, Iran, Pakistan, South Africa and United Arab Emirates also were included in the roughly 80 companies added to the “entity list” of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. 

Six are subsidiaries of the Inspur Group, China's leading cloud computing and big data service provider. It was listed in the U.S. government's entity list in 2023. 

The update also includes the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, which objected vehemently.

“We are shocked that a private non-profit scientific research institution has been added to the entity list. We strongly oppose this wrong decision without any factual basis and ask the relevant U.S. departments to withdraw it,” the research institute said in a statement.

A review committee said the BAAI and another company, the Beijing Innovation Wisdom Technology Co. were judged to have developed large AI models and advanced computer chips for military purposes. 

China's Foreign Ministry also lashed back, saying the entity list and other export controls were an abuse meant to “unjustly suppress Chinese enterprises.”




“It seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations, severely damages the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, and undermines the security and stability of global supply chains. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns this,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a routine news briefing Wednesday. 

The aim is to restrict China's capacity to acquire and develop ultra fast, or “exascale” supercomputers, to develop hypersonic weapons and other sensitive technologies, the bureau said in a notice on its website. It also is intended to prevent South Africa's Test Flying Academy from using U.S. goods to train Chinese troops, disrupt Iran's access to unmanned aerial vehicles and other military items and hinder development of insecure nuclear and ballistic missile programs, it said. 

The companies on the list are subject to the “foreign direct product rule” of the BIS which allows it to control reexports and transfers of foreign-made products containing technology that the U.S. government deems vital for national security. 

The tightening of controls comes as the Trump administration prepares for another round of tariff hikes due next week, an escalation of the trade war that President Donald Trump launched during his first term in office. 

Trump has already raised tariffs on imports of Chinese goods to 20%. On Monday he said he would impose a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela. China buys a large share of the oil exported by Venezuela. 

China has retaliated with its own countermeasures, including sweeping new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google.

It also has moved to tighten its own sanctions regime, meanwhile, with a law enabling it to freeze assets of companies subject to Chinese sanctions.

Geo Week Event





This year's Geo Week conference and exhibition, held in Denver, Colorado in February, was a resounding success, with over 3200 professionals attending this year's event and 215 exhibitors, both of which were records. More than a month after the event, the industry is still buzzing over the conversations and presentations that took place over the course of those three days, with takeaways and insights being brought to the office and into projects. 

Of course, not everyone is ever able to attend every event, and we wanted to give those who couldn't attend a chance to experience some of those takeaways, as well as give those who did attend a chance to review some of those major insights. So, earlier this month, we invited three speakers from this year's conference to join our Carla Lauter on a webinar entitled Beyond the Conference: Key Trends Shaping Geospatial Tech. The on-demand recording is available for free by registering here, and below you can find a quick recap of some of the topics touched upon in the hour-long conversation.

To start, the webinar featured the following three speakers:

Bill Wallace, Founder, AR Mavericks

Amar Nayegandhi, Global Head of Technology and Innovation, Woolpert

Dan Bellissemo, Director of Lidar and Remote Sensing, GIS Surveyors, Inc.

As noted, the conversation focused on the biggest trends and insights these three speakers took away from their time at Geo Week 2025, with the webinar starting with each giving a quick rundown of their personal biggest takeaways before jumping into broader discussions. All three talked about the buzz at Geo Week this year, with Wallace talking about how he felt this year the event “found its voice.” In terms of the major trends, technologically speaking, the conversation ultimately fits into a few different buckets.

The first started with the presentation with Wallace, who talked a lot about the democratization of reality capture. This idea has been a major talking point within the industry for years now, and as Wallace mentions, it's largely been driven by marketing strategies from companies. However, there is an increasing amount of truth to the idea, with both positives and negatives coming out of it. Wallace talked about both sides of that coin – the surveyors' perspective that people may be intruding on their turf, and the idea that more people can complete different types of projects – to start the conversation.

Digital twins were a major part of the discussion as well, particularly with regard to larger and larger digital twins. Nayegandhi talked about a session he moderated that focused on exactly this topic around digital twins for cities and even entire countries. He talked a lot about the ways that this technology is starting to revolutionize the way urban planning takes place, with these digital twins enabling “more responsive governance,” in his words. He specifically pointed to disaster preparedness as one of the immediately apparent impacts of these digital twins. 

And finally, Bellissemo led the discussion around just how much this industry is growing. He talked about how the entire geospatial industry is clearly becoming more important globally, and how that was very much reflected in the attendance and energy around this year's event. One of the ways that has come through is in the growing number of verticals present at the show, and with which his company is working. He notes that today, less than five percent of his lidar processing work is coming from the government, a testament to that increasingly wide net within the sector. Additionally, this led to a discussion around the need for more qualified workers in the industry, and how to attract that young talent to the sector.

Unsurprisingly, one of the themes that really underpinned the entire discussion around these three major topics and others was artificial intelligence. It plays into all of what was discussed above, in particular the digital twins and workforce issues. For the former, Nayegandhi said that, more and more, AI is becoming the “foundation of digital twins.” Around the workforce issue, Bellissemo talked about how there is often fear around AI being something that is going to replace workers, but it's not the way things are or should be working.

“In my opinion, AI and machine learning must start with a human, end with a human, and have human interaction while it's working,” he said.

This is just a snippet of what was discussed in the hour-long conversation about the state of the industry and where we're heading, with inspiration being taken from Geo Week 2025. Whether you were able to attend this year's event in Denver or you couldn't make it, this conversation is a must-watch, and can be accessed for free here.

          March 26, 2025
        



NASHVILLE, TENN. – Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today showcased a bold array of new and refreshed models, along with next-generation technologies set to debut in the U.S. and Canada from FY25 through FY27. Loaded with innovative features, the new products will play a crucial role in elevating the company's performance, boosting customer loyalty, attracting new buyers, increasing profitability, and promoting sustainable growth.

To meet the rising demand for diverse powertrain options, the upcoming lineup will include hybrid technologies (including e-POWER and plug-in hybrids), next-generation electric vehicles (EVs), and advanced internal combustion engines (ICE).

Guillaume Cartier, chief performance officer, stated: ""Today, we unveil our redefined market approach and tailored product strategy designed to better meet customer needs and drive top-line growth. Through powertrain diversification and new models, we will provide a broader range of options that cater to diverse customer preferences, further distinguishing Nissan and INFINITI brands."" 

Ivan Espinosa, chief planning officer, said: ""Over the next two years, we are excited to roll out an impressive lineup that will redefine the road! This includes the reimagined Nissan LEAF, and a daring new Micra EV. But that's not all – we're refreshing our range of SUVs to elevate the driving experience, and our next-generation e-POWER promises new levels of refinement and efficiency. We are committed to investing in products that embody the very best of Nissan. To our passionate fans and loyal owners around the world, I can assure you, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey ahead.""

Christian Meunier, chairman, Nissan Americas, said: ""North America is a key market, and we are taking quick actions to get us back to growth and set the stage for the exciting products to come.

We're strengthening our retail partnerships to deliver high customer satisfaction and hear the voice of the market. Our dealers are fully engaged and enthusiastic for the future.

We're simplifying our operations and retail programs so that we can attack our cost structures, allowing us to deliver the right products to our customers, when they want them, where they need them, and for the right price.

With these actions, and continued investments in our business, we expect an accelerated recovery, supported by strong sales of the fantastic new products already in market, and future models on the way. Full speed ahead!""

The U.S. and Canada will see more than 10 new and refreshed products in key segments, including next-gen EV and hybrid technology and INFINITI models.

In FY25, the U.S. and Canada will be the first markets to launch the all-new Nissan LEAF, joining Ariya in the brand's EV portfolio. 



Reimagined as a sleek and spacious family-friendly crossover, the third-generation all-new Nissan LEAF pairs substantial improvements in aerodynamics with a more advanced EV architecture. 

As a first for the iconic EV nameplate, the all-new LEAF will be available with 19-inch alloy wheels and a panoramic moonroof. For the North American market, a NACS charging port is also integrated – the first time for a Nissan EV – enabling convenient access to the Tesla Supercharger network.

The all-new LEAF sits on Nissan's modular CMF-EV platform (which debuted with the Ariya). Efficient energy management, streamlined packaging and enhanced driving performance from Nissan's new 3-in-1 EV powertrain, are expected to help deliver significant range improvements over the previous generation. Today's announcement provides a first glimpse at this new model, with further details to be shared mid-year.

Additionally, Nissan will commence sales of the brand's first plug-in hybrid in North America, in a PHEV version of the compact Rogue SUV.

A new generation of Nissan's top-selling Sentra compact sedan will be introduced later this year, alongside a refreshed mid-size Pathfinder SUV.

For INFINITI, a refreshed three-row luxury QX60 SUV will be offered, alongside a new SPORT package for the full-size QX80 SUV.  

In FY26, production of the all-new, fourth-generation Rogue will begin. The model will be the first to offer Nissan's innovative e-POWER technology to consumers in the U.S. and Canada. Nissan will also offer Rogue with a powerful and efficient internal combustion engine, as well as a plug-in hybrid model, providing a diverse range of powertrains to shine in the market's most popular vehicle segment. 

INFINITI will launch the all-new QX65 crossover coupe. Channeling inspiration from the pioneering INFINITI FX, INFINITI QX65 promises buyers a stylish two-row alternative in the very popular mid-size crossover segment. 

Then from late FY27, an all-new Nissan EV is scheduled to commence production at Nissan's Canton, Mississippi plant in the U.S. The all-new model will be an adventure-focused SUV. It will be joined in FY28 by a luxury INFINITI EV SUV (inspired by the Vision QXe concept) that pairs the brand's latest Artistry in Motion design language with a suite of technology features.

Under the recent agreement with SK On, both of these future models will feature U.S.-manufactured batteries, supporting 1,700 U.S. jobs at SK On, and involving a total investment of $661 million, including equipment purchases. This is in addition to Nissan's $500 million in investments for EV production at the Canton Assembly Plant.

For customers seeking a sophisticated hybrid powertrain, Nissan's third-generation e-POWER will benefit from the learnings of over 1.6 million produced units since the technology was first introduced in 2016.

The third-generation e-POWER system delivers notable improvements in efficiency where it is targeted to provide up to 15% enhancement in economy at high speeds compared to the current, second-generation system. It will also deliver lower emissions and enhanced refinement through reduced noise and vibration.

A unique Nissan technology, e-POWER uses a small capacity gasoline engine and lithium-ion battery to power an electric motor. As the electric motor alone drives the wheels, the result is an EV-like driving experience, characterized by powerful and responsive acceleration paired with quiet operation.

Central to the advancement is the adoption of a new 1.5-liter e-POWER dedicated engine and the new 5-in-1 system, which shares core components with Nissan's latest EV powertrain.

The third-generation e‐POWER system will debut in North America in FY26 in the next-generation Rogue.

Nissan is committed to delivering the highest customer satisfaction, sustainability, and enhanced business performance. More details on each new product, as well as news on additional models that the company plans to launch, will be shared closer to the start of sales in each respective market.

*Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. financial years are from April through March.

ARIZONA TECHNOLOGY NEWS

Mar 26, 2025, 5:00 AM                            | Updated: 7:20 am

﻿﻿

PHOENIX — Several high-profile technology companies have set up operations in Arizona, sparking concerns about the environmental impact of their services.

For example, the increasing demand for artificial intelligence has led to a rise in the need for data centers, which provide the computing storage capacity required for AI.

However, these data centers consume a significant amount of energy and rely on water-intensive cooling systems to manage the heat generated during energy production.

“Because this energy produces heat, and the heat doesn't get along well with the servers, and we have to get rid of the heat,” Shaolei Ren, the associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Riverside, told KTAR News 92.3 FM on Tuesday. “This process is called cooling systems.”

Arizona currently has about 118 data centers, most of which sit within metro Phoenix.

While these centers range in size, even a medium-sized data center sucks a massive amount of energy from the power grid.

In fact, Ren said a medium-sized data center uses the same amount of energy as around 300,000 households.

There are two stages to the cooling system. First, server-level cooling moves the heat from the server to a heat exchanger, which involves no water loss or water consumption.

However, the second stage moves the heat from the heat exchanger to the outside environment using water to cool. Water evaporation is usually the most efficient way to do this job.

“For example, in many data centers in Arizona they're just using cooling towers that is evaporating water 24/7 to move the heat to the outside environment,” Ren said.

Newer data centers will use water evaporation to pre-cool the air before letting the air into the server room for cooling, he added.

Ren said it's important to look at the cost-benefit analysis of data centers because water use and energy demand will be quite substantial in Arizona due to its hot, arid climate.

He said one should consider the economic benefits data centers would bring to the area compared to other facilities.

Data centers generally have a strong return on investment, he added.

“I think we're seeing more and more people paying attention to this problem and jumping into the field to investigate the impacts and thinking about what can be done to mitigate this problem,” Ren said.

Mews, the industry leading hospitality cloud, has been chosen by Pelham Hospitality to centralize operations, enhance the guest experience and unlock new levels of efficiency across their hotels and event spaces.

Pelham Hospitality runs a collection of three boutique properties in Cape Cod. Pelham House Resort is its flagship property, which also hosts large weddings every weekend, alongside Pelham on Main and Pelham on Earl. The brand is known for its fresh, bright aesthetic and highly personalized service. For General Manager Heather McCarthy, switching to Mews was a long time coming.

“The second I saw Mews, I was obsessed,” said McCarthy. “It's like my hotel brain created an ideal system that's super flexible with lots of open interfaces, incredibly user-friendly, and complete with built-in guest messaging. It checked all the boxes.”

By moving to Mews, Pelham Hospitality will streamline reservations, upsells, and sales and catering, bringing everything under one roof. Their previous property management system and sales and catering software operated independently, creating manual workarounds and data silos. Now, with Mews as the central hub, their systems will be fully integrated, saving time, reducing admin and improving reporting.

Pelham Hospitality is also onboarding Thynk for sales and catering at the same time, connected seamlessly via Mews Marketplace. This hotel tech app store allows the team to easily integrate to pre-approved solutions without additional connection fees. “Mews is the hub of our operations but having that flexibility to choose specialist partners is huge,” McCarthy said. “Once I attached to the idea of picking the expert system in that area and making sure they connect really well, it made a ton of sense.”

Because of the brand's focus on providing memorable experiences, it was important to choose a system that puts guests at its center. In addition to providing user-friendly guest communication tools like direct messaging, Mews automates manual tasks so that staff have more time to spend directly with guests.

“The onboarding has been so refreshing,” added McCarthy. “It's great to meet like-minded hospitality folks who all speak the same language. It feels fresh, but also very personal. And all this smart automation will let us focus on our ultimate priority: being able to tailor the guest journey to the individual guest, which is fundamental to who we are.”

Matt Welle, Mews CEO, commented: “Pelham Hospitality is a perfect example of how great hospitality stems from being open minded. They truly thought about their brand's needs and what they wanted to get out of a new system, which in turn will help them to create even more exceptional guest experiences. Their commitment to flexibility and seamless operations aligns perfectly with Mews, and we're thrilled to support their vision for modern hospitality.”

Pelham Hospitality joins several other hotels on Cape Cod powered by Mews, such as AWOL Provincetown and The Coonamessett, both managed by Lark Hotels, as well as independents like Emerald Resort, Anchor Inn Beach House and Gifford House. Mews is also the first ever PMS to be an active member of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, cementing its commitment to the area.

Mar 26, 2025

The 3.6-meter, 75-ton Advanced Electro-Optical System  telescope on Haleakala is the largest optical telescope in the Department of Defense and helps to track space objects — an important task in the growing global space industry and a major focus of an annual international conference on Maui. Photo courtesy AFRL


What began as a high-tech conference on Maui with 300 attendees more than 25 years ago has grown into a gathering of more than 1,300 people from 25 countries.

The Advanced Maui Optical Space Surveillance and Technology Conference gathers people on the cutting edge of technological development in space. Kihei-based conference organizer Maui Economic Development Board is planning to hold the 2025 event from Sept. 16-19 at the Wailea Beach Resort Marriott.

“The conference brings together a diverse group to bridge technical gaps and fosters international cooperation in advance space sustainability embodying a collaborative spirit,” said Leslie Wilkins, the chief executive officer of the Maui Economic Development Board.

Wilkins credits the foresight of its founder, the late Colin Cameron, who helped establish the Maui Economic Development Board and was a major supporter of the Maui Research & Technology Park, home of a supercomputer used by the U.S. Space Force and Air Force Research Laboratory.

Cameron, head of Maui Land & Pineapple Company and developer of the Kapalua Resort, wanted to diversify the Valley Isle's economy to offer residents a broader range of jobs.

The high-tech park is also the home of the Maui Research Technology Center and Hawaii Small Business Development Center-Maui.

Connected to the advanced telescope at the top of Haleakala, the supercomputer performs a number of tasks including tracking space debris and satellites to help to avoid collisions.

“The focus of the conference is space that is becoming increasingly congested and contested,” Wilkins said.

Observers say the tracking of thousands of space debris and satellites 25 years ago has grown astronomically into tracking hundreds of thousands of objects in space including asteroids.

Another trend is the growing commercialization of space and technologies. About 56% of the attendees in 2024 were from industry, 11% from the military and 9% from academia, according to the MEDB.

A testament to the growing interest is the announcement this month of a $176 million contract to support space research at the Air Force Maui Optical and Supercomputing Site known as AMOS.

The Texas-based firm KBR Inc. is helping to solidify Hawai'i's regional role in the space and defense field.

Brian Young, KBR's vice president of Military Space Operations Division, is responsible for key science and technology initiatives aimed at producing innovative machine learning and artificial intelligence for rapid detection and response in space.

A beneficiary of the high-tech park and conference has been Maui entrepreneur Daron Nishimoto, a University of Hawai'i graduate in physics, who initially worked for former contractor Boeing in the space surveillance field at the Maui high-tech park.

Nishimoto rose to become a senior manager, then started his own business Pacific Defense Solutions developing software.

He sold his software company to KBR and has begun a new startup business, EO Solutions, which works as a subcontractor with KBR focusing on the use of software and artificial intelligence.

“The MEDB helped me with starting up my first company and introduced me to conference members,” he said.

Nishimoto also serves as co-chair of the technical aspects of the conference on Maui.

He said the MEDB also makes sure the conference is culturally sensitive and follows protocols established decades ago to foster not only respect but also participation by native Hawaiian cultural experts. 

The conference this year has attracted more than 300 research submissions covering topics, including space weather, space debris and space system instruments.

Wilkins said the conference fosters cross-sharing of knowledge within the global space community and connects technical experts with decision-makers.

Conference organizers said that so far in the last 25 years, it has welcomed over 17,000 international participants from 42 countries.

“It's the best venue for presenting the research and development and technology that I have developed with my team over the years for space surveillance and space domain awareness,” said Tamara Payne, technical subcommittee chair of the American Astronautical Society Space Surveillance Committee.

Wilkins said the space community needs a global cooperative arrangement so that it can take care of space and monitor the environment and be good stewards of our earth and space.

News Corp's chief technology officer David Kline is resigning from his role to accept an undisclosed position “outside the organisation.”

Kline will remain with News Corp until the end of June as a search for his successor is underway.

“After more than five incredibly productive and exciting years as CTO of News Corp, I am resigning with mixed emotions. It's been a remarkable journey, and while it's bittersweet to step away, I do so knowing that the technology organisation is stronger than ever, with a high-performing, forward-looking team firmly in place. I'm deeply grateful to Rupert, Lachlan, Robert and the entire News Corp leadership team for their trust, partnership and support throughout this chapter,” Kline said in his exit statement.

Kline joined News Corp in January 2020 and over the last five years has driven a rapid period of legacy system overhaul and global implementations of new technology solutions. He moved to News Corp from Viacom Global where he had served as executive VP of technology, CTO and CIO since 2010. His technology career is steeped in media experience, with earlier senior leadership roles at Discovery Communications and AMC Networks.

News Corp CEO Robert Thompson said Kline's contribution, “at a time of profound transformation,” was a crucial element to the media giant's success.

“Dave's drive and leadership have been crucial to our success as other media companies have floundered and foundered. His contribution to our company will resonate for many years to come, both in his enduring positive influence and through the strong and talented tech team that he has assembled,” said Thomson.","{'href': 'https://www.c21media.net', 'title': 'C21Media'}"

Signal is at the centre of a fierce debate over its use by US government officials, bringing the encrypted messaging app's limitations into sharp focus.

In a shocking debacle, The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, became privy to highly sensitive discussions among top national security officials in the US after he was mistakenly added to a group chat on the Signal app comprising US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top defence officials in the Trump administration

The group members reportedly discussed upcoming military strikes targeting locations of Houthi terrorists in conflict-ridden Yemen. The discussions continued for six days before Goldberg left the group on his own while other members still seemed to be unaware of his presence in the chat, according to the report by The Atlantic.

Beyond the security breach, the incident raised questions over whether it is safe to share classified information such as plans for a bombing mission on platforms like Signal.

Signal is a pioneer of encrypted communications and is regarded as one of the most secure messaging apps currently available on the market.

It is widely considered to be a leading easy-to-use, encrypted messaging service among cybersecurity experts, since there are no public reports of hackers intercepting users' messages in-transit by cracking the platform's end-to-end encryption protocol.

The app is also a favourite of privacy and digital rights activists as it collects minimal user data and offers robust privacy features such as the option to hide your phone number and display a username instead.

Unlike Telegram, end-to-end encryption is enabled by default for all messages and voice calls on Signal. In January 2025, Signal announced a new feature that would give users the choice to transfer their chat history and media from to other Android and iOS devices or start fresh.

Signal's end-to-end encryption technology is open-source, meaning that developers can take a look under the hood and verify its security. In addition, the encryption protocol forms the basis of the security offered by other messaging apps like WhatsApp.

Since 2023, Signal has been upgrading its encryption technology to remain secure against the future, hypothetical threat of quantum computers.

When a user sends a text message on Signal, the information is encrypted and only the recipient of the message can decrypt it with specific cryptographic keys stored locally on the devices of the sender and receiver. This ensures that not even the service provider has access to the encrypted data.

It is impossible for law enforcement authorities or hackers to intercept a Signal message in-transit. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended that American citizens use encrypted messaging apps like Signal to keep their messages private. The recommendation was made after Chinese hackers reportedly compromised US-based telecom networks to access conventional SMS text messages.

However, Signal is only as secure as the device security. Encrypted messages can be leaked if an attacker gains access to an unlocked device, installs spyware, or tricks a user into linking their account to a malicious device.

Similarly, a participant in your group chat can take screenshots of your conversation and share it elsewhere. They could also potentially hand over their device to another person who will be able to simply read your decrypted messages.

The bottom line is that Signal is not infallible against human error. Experts noted that the recent US national security leak happened because someone — whether intentionally or by mistake — added an outsider to the chat.
In its response to the ‘Signalgate' scandal, the non-profit entity behind the app said that the claim that there are ‘vulnerabilities' in Signal isn't accurate.

No, Signal does not offer ironclad protection from all forms of snooping. For instance, users on the platform could still fall for scams or phishing attacks.

Last month, Google's cybersecurity arm Mandiant released a report stating that Russian intelligence officials were trying to trick Ukrainian users on Signal into sharing their personal information and handing over access to their accounts on the platform.

However, the report did not mention whether any Signal accounts were actually compromised.

“In order to help protect people from falling victim to sophisticated phishing attacks, Signal introduced new user flows and in-app warnings. This work has been completed for some time and is unrelated to any current events,” the organisation said in a post on X.

“We also constantly monitor security@signal.org for any new reports, and we act on them with quickness while also working to protect the people who rely on us from outside threats like phishing with warnings and safeguards,” it added.

End-to-end encryption is also useless if a device has been infected with spyware like Pegasus, as threat actors can directly access the messages and files on the device without the user knowing.

While it is not possible to fully remove the risks associated with encrypted chat apps like Signal, here are a few ways you can minimise them:

– Use audio and video calls over Signal to avoid written records of what you discussed.
– Enable Relay for calls on Signals so that your IP address remains private while making phone calls to others
– Use your personal phone or laptop while communicating through Signal, as opposed to using work devices.
– Avoid connecting your personal device to work networks to prevent monitoring.
– Enable disappearing messages in Settings &gt; Privacy > Disappearing Messages to automatically delete chats after a set time.

The rise of agentic AI is fundamentally altering workplace dynamics, providing a blueprint for how individuals and organisations can thrive in an era defined by efficiency, innovation, and agility. By automating repetitive tasks, enabling seamless collaboration and empowering workers with data-driven insights, agentic AI transforms traditional workflows into a smarter, faster and more creative way of working.

Agentic AI improves productivity and transforms the very nature of how work gets done. 

By merging human resourcefulness with machine intelligence, it paves the way for smarter, faster, and more innovative approaches to work. 

Workflow management: Agentic AI has the ability to manage and structure workflows. In today's fast-paced world, employees often grapple with fragmented schedules, scattered data, and overlapping tasks. Agentic AI eliminates this chaos by acting as a personal assistant for each employee.

For instance, imagine an AI system that reviews your notifications every morning, flags high-priority tasks, and creates a dynamic to-do list based on deadlines, project importance, and workload. Such intelligent prioritisation saves hours of manual sorting and increases the effectiveness of daily planning.

Agentic AI goes further by customising workflows based on an employee's role. For a project manager, it might generate Gantt charts from raw inputs, assign resources and set timelines with real-time updates. For a marketing professional, it could prepare campaign schedules and automate post-publication performance tracking.

Automating repetitive tasks: Repetitive and manual tasks often drain an employee's time and energy. These tasks do not contribute directly to innovation or strategic thinking. Agentic AI automates these processes, allowing employees to channel their efforts into creative problem-solving and strategic execution.

Consider an HR professional tasked with onboarding new employees. Agentic AI can streamline this process by automatically generating offer letters, scheduling training sessions, and sharing personalised onboarding plans with new hires. 

In finance, AI-driven systems can reconcile accounts, flag anomalies in transactions, and generate real-time reports, eliminating the need for manual intervention. In customer service, AI agents handle repetitive inquiries such as order tracking or account troubleshooting, enabling human agents to tackle complex customer needs that require empathy and nuanced problem-solving.

Enhancing collaboration: Collaboration has always been at the heart of successful organisations. Agentic AI makes this process seamless by breaking down silos and enabling smarter teamwork. AI systems integrate across departments and platforms, creating a unified workspace.

As organisations continue to embrace digital transformation, the role of agentic AI will only grow.

By Raphael Satter

WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -The best-known member of Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE Service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.

Edward Coristine is among the most visible members of the DOGE effort that has been given sweeping access to official networks as it attempts to radically downsize the U.S. government.

Past reporting had focused on his youth - he is 19 - and his chosen nickname of ""bigballs,"" which became a pop culture punchline. Musk has championed the teen on his social media site X, telling his followers last month that ""Big Balls is awesome.""

Beginning around 2022, while still in high school, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, according to corporate and digital records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with half a dozen former associates. Among its users was a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name ""EGodly,"" according to digital records preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools and the online cybersecurity tool Any.Run.

The details of Coristine's connection to EGodly have not been previously reported.

On Feb. 15, 2023, EGodly thanked Coristine's company for its assistance in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

""We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website,"" the message said.

The digital records reviewed by Reuters showed the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was tied to internet protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other Coristine-owned entities between October 2022 and June 2023, and that some users attempting to access the site around that time would hit a DiamondCDN ""Security check.""

Coristine did not return messages seeking comment. Musk's team, which has adopted the name ""Department of Government Efficiency"" though it is not an official government department, did not respond to emails about Coristine. He is listed as a ""senior adviser"" at the State Department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to one official at each agency who told Reuters they had seen his name in their respective agencies' staff directory.

On LinkedIn, Coristine describes himself as a ""Volunteer (Intern) Plumber"" with the U.S. government.

The State Department did not return messages asking about Coristine. CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.

EGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for the past year; attempts to elicit comment from eight people who participated in or interacted with EGodly were unsuccessful.

'THESE ARE BAD FOLKS'

DiamondCDN's website - CDN typically stands for ""content delivery network"" - was registered in mid-2022, according to records collected by DomainTools. It pitched itself as offering ""excellent security tools"" that would help ""lower your infrastructure costs,"" according to copies of the site maintained by the Internet Archive. The site said the company ""has no business inspecting user content.""

In 2023, EGodly boasted on its Telegram channel of hijacking phone numbers, breaking into unspecified law enforcement email accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and cryptocurrency theft. Early that year, the group distributed the personal details of an FBI agent who they said was investigating them, circulating his phone number, photographs of his house, and other private details on Telegram.

EGodly also posted an audio recording of an obscene prank call made to the agent's phone and a video, shot from the inside of a car, of an unknown party driving by the agent's house in Wilmington, Delaware at night and screaming out the window, ""EGodly says you're a bitch!""

Reuters could not independently verify EGodly's boasts of cybercriminal activity, including its claims to have hijacked phone numbers or infiltrated law enforcement emails. But it was able to authenticate the video by visiting the same Wilmington address and comparing the building to the one in the footage.

The FBI agent targeted by EGodly, who is now retired, told Reuters that the group had drawn law enforcement attention because of its connection to swatting, the dangerous practice of making hoax emergency calls to send armed officers swarming targeted addresses. The agent didn't go into detail. Reuters is not identifying him out of concern for further harassment.

""These are bad folks,"" the former agent said. ""They're not a pleasant group.""

He declined to comment further about the harassment or whether EGodly had been or still was the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI didn't return messages seeking comment on EGodly.

Reuters was not able to ascertain how long EGodly used DiamondCDN, or whether EGodly paid Coristine's company. Archived copies of DiamondCDN's website said the firm envisioned having both paying and nonpaying customers.

Another individual who has been subject to abuse from EGodly and a cybercrime researcher who has followed the group said it was composed of hardened fraudsters, citing the group's makeup and the credibility of its claims. Both asked not to be identified, citing fears of retaliation.

Even if the connection between Coristine and EGodly were fleeting, Nitin Natarajan, who served as the deputy director of CISA under former President Joe Biden, told Reuters it was worrying that someone who provided services to EGodly only two years ago was part of a group that has gained wide access to government networks.

""This stuff was not in the distant past,"" he said. ""The recency of the activity and the types of groups he was associated would definitely be concerning.""

Nestled in a pod under an F/A-18 Hornet aircraft wing, flying above California, and traveling up to the speed of sound, NASA put a commercial sensor technology to the test. The flight tests demonstrated the sensor accuracy and navigation precision in challenging conditions, helping prepare the technology to land robots and astronauts on the Moon and Mars.

The Psionic Space Navigation Doppler Lidar (PSNDL) system is rooted in NASA technology that Psionic, Inc. of Hampton, Virginia, licensed and further developed. They miniaturized the NASA technology, added further functionality, and incorporated component redundancies that make it more rugged for spaceflight. The PSNDL navigation system also includes cameras and an inertial measurement unit to make it a complete navigation system capable of accurately determining a vehicle's position and velocity for precision landing and other spaceflight applications.

The aircraft departed from NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, and conducted a variety of flight paths over several days in February 2025. It flew a large figure-8 loop and conducted several highly dynamic maneuvers over Death Valley, California, to collect navigation data at various altitudes, velocities, and orientations relevant for lunar and Mars entry and descent. Refurbished for these tests, the NASA F/A-18 pod can support critical data collection for other technologies and users at a low cost.

Doppler Lidar sensors provide a highly accurate measurement of speed by measuring the frequency shift between laser light emitted from the sensor reflected from the ground. Lidar are extremely useful in sunlight-challenged areas that may have long shadows and stark contrasts, such as the lunar South Pole. Pairing PSNDL with cameras adds the ability to visually compare pictures with surface reconnaissance maps of rocky terrain and navigate to landing at interesting locations on Mars. All the data is fed into a computer to make quick, real-time decisions to enable precise touchdowns at safe locations.

Since licensing NDL in 2016, Psionic has received funding and development support from NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate through its Small Business Innovative Research program and Tipping Point initiative. The company has also tested PSNDL prototypes on suborbital vehicles via the Flight Opportunities program. In 2024, onboard a commercial lunar lander, NASA successfully demonstrated the predecessor NDL system developed by the agency's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

New research suggests that dark energy, the unknown force driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, may not be behaving as previously believed. Observations from a large-scale 3D map indicate that this force could be evolving over time, contradicting long-standing models of cosmology. The data, derived from extensive observations of millions of galaxies, provides fresh insights into the fundamental workings of the universe. Scientists are now questioning whether the standard model, which assumes a constant dark energy force, remains valid in explaining the cosmos.

According to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which operates from the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-Meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, findings suggest that dark energy may not be a fixed force. The analysis is based on data collected over three years, covering nearly 15 million galaxies and quasars. DESI's ability to simultaneously capture light from 5,000 galaxies allows researchers to examine large-scale cosmic structures and measure how the universe's expansion rate has changed over time.

As reported, inconsistencies arise when DESI's findings are compared with measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae. The CMB consists of fossil light from the early universe, has been used to track the expansion history of the cosmos. Similar to thaf type Ia supernovae, often called ""standard candles"" for their uniform brightness, have provided key distance measurements. The DESI data suggests that dark energy's influence may have weakened over time, a deviation from the accepted cosmological model that assumes it remains unchanged.

Speaking in an official press release, DESI Project Scientist Arjun Dey stated that these findings could redefine humanity's understanding of the universe. The instrument's ongoing observations will continue to refine knowledge of dark energy's role. Scientists anticipate that by the project's conclusion, further data will offer a clearer picture of whether dark energy fluctuates, potentially reshaping existing theories of cosmic evolution.

Boeing's Starliner spacecraft docked with the ISS during its Crew Flight Test mission.

More than six months after its crewed test mission encountered significant technical challenges, uncertainty remains over Boeing's Starliner astronaut capsule. The Crew Flight Test (CFT), launched on June 5, transported NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to the International Space Station (ISS) for an intended 10-day stay. However, helium leaks in the propulsion system and thruster malfunctions extended their mission significantly. NASA ultimately decided to bring the spacecraft back uncrewed, a process completed on September 6, with a landing in the New Mexico desert. Both astronauts were reassigned to another mission, which concluded on March 18, with their return on SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule.

According to NASA's Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich, speaking at a press briefing reported by multiple news outlets, a thorough review of Starliner's helium system is ongoing. Potential solutions include replacing certain seals and conducting testing at NASA's White Sands facility in New Mexico. Testing efforts will involve an ""integrated doghouse,"" referring to the thruster pods on the spacecraft's service module. The CFT mission saw five of the 28 reaction control system thrusters fail, with ground tests linking the issue to excessive heat buildup, causing Teflon seals to deform. NASA and Boeing are now working on adjustments to thruster heating and firing sequences to mitigate the issue.

Whether Starliner's next flight will carry astronauts remains undetermined. Stich stated that while the upcoming mission may be uncrewed, all necessary systems will be in place to support human travel. NASA aims to certify the capsule for operational, long-duration missions once these technical concerns are resolved. Stich emphasised the importance of having multiple crew transportation options, highlighting that the recent use of Crew Dragon for astronaut return underscores the need for Starliner's continued development to ensure redundancy in low Earth orbit operations

Artificial intelligence company Anthropic convinced a California federal judge on Tuesday to reject a preliminary bid to block it from using lyrics owned by Universal Music Group tab and other music publishers to train its AI-powered chatbot Claude.

U.S. District Judge Eumi Lee said that the publishers' request was too broad and that they failed to show Anthropic's conduct caused them “irreparable harm.”

The publishers said in a statement that they “remain very confident in our case against Anthropic more broadly.” An Anthropic spokesperson said the company was pleased that the court did not grant the publishers' “disruptive and amorphous request.”

Music publishers UMG, Concord and ABKCO sued Anthropic in 2023, alleging that it infringed their copyrights in lyrics from at least 500 songs by musicians including Beyoncé, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys.

The publishers claimed Anthropic used the lyrics without permission to train Claude to respond to human prompts.

The lawsuit is one of several arguing that copyrighted works by authors, news outlets, visual artists and others have been misused without consent or payment to develop AI products.

Tech companies including OpenAI, Microsoft tab and Meta Platforms have said that their systems make “fair use” of copyrighted material under U.S. copyright law by studying it to learn to create new, transformative content.

Fair use is likely to be the determinative question in the lawsuits, though Lee's opinion did not specifically address the issue.

Lee rejected the publishers' argument that Anthropic's use of their lyrics caused them irreparable harm by diminishing their licensing market.

“Publishers are essentially asking the Court to define the contours of a licensing market for AI training where the threshold question of fair use remains unsettled,” Lee said.

OpenAI has significantly upgraded its ChatGPT chatbot, expanding its capabilities beyond text-based conversations to advanced image generation. The company unveiled the latest update on Tuesday, integrating new technology that enables ChatGPT to create highly detailed and complex images based on user prompts.

The new version, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model, can generate intricate visuals, including multi-panel comic strips with custom characters and dialogue. This marks a major leap from previous versions, which, while capable of image generation, struggled with blending multiple complex concepts into a single output.

The development reflects a broader shift in artificial intelligence, where chatbots are evolving into multifunctional tools. Originally designed for text-based tasks such as answering questions, writing poetry, and generating code, ChatGPT now supports voice commands, images, and even video interactions.

OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT in late 2022, training it on vast amounts of text data from across the internet. While the chatbot initially lacked image-generation capabilities, OpenAI later released DALL-E, a separate tool designed for that purpose. The latest iteration of ChatGPT, however, merges these functionalities into a single, more powerful system that learns from both text and visual data.

Historically, AI image generators have struggled with creating visuals that deviate significantly from existing examples. However, OpenAI claims the new ChatGPT can now handle requests for unconventional images—such as a bicycle with triangular wheels—more effectively.

Starting Tuesday, the enhanced ChatGPT will be available to both free and paid users. Subscribers to ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) and ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month) will also gain access to OpenAI's latest AI tools.

Starlink is on the verge of launching its satellite broadband service in India, with regulatory approval from the government expected soon. Recently, the company has teamed up with Jio and Airtel to distribute its equipment throughout the country. In addition to India, Starlink is gearing up to expand its reach in various other nations. Currently, its broadband service operates in 125 countries and boasts over 7 million users.

However, Starlink might encounter fierce competition from Chinese satellite broadband providers like SpaceSail in the foreseeable future. The company is preparing to make its entry into markets such as Brazil, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan.

Elon Musk's goal for Starlink is to acquire at least 1 million new users each year, a target that could gain significant momentum following its launch in India. That said, there are concerns that the arrival of these Chinese companies could pose challenges for Starlink.

In India, Starlink will also face competition from local providers like Airtel and Jio, as well as Amazon Kuiper. The telecom regulator is poised to allocate spectrum for satellite services, with consultations from stakeholders and experts nearly complete.

Starlink has been waiting since 2022 to roll out its services in India. This high-speed internet service operates through SpaceX satellites orbiting close to the Earth. Once the necessary regulatory approval and spectrum allocation from the Government of India are secured, Starlink is set to officially begin its operations, especially now that it has partnered with Jio and Airtel, which bodes well for a timely approval.

Meanwhile, the government's efforts to tackle cyber fraud are intensifying and show no signs of slowing down. As of February this year, authorities have blocked over 780,000 SIM cards, more than 3,000 Skype IDs, and upwards of 83,000 WhatsApp accounts.

Financial advisers face mounting pressure to improve efficiency, driven by both regulatory demands and commercial realities.

Demand for advice continues to grow – particularly in tax planning, as frozen allowances and upcoming changes to pension inheritance tax relief reshape financial strategies. And clients – and the regulator are increasingly expecting advisers to provide better value for money.

In the meantime, capacity isn't growing to meet the growing demand because adviser numbers stay stubbornly static.

One answer is that advisers need to get more efficient so that they can look after more clients and also provide a better customer experience.

The movement towards more productivity is painfully slow

So the rising demand is presenting advisers with opportunities, but only for those who adapt. The danger is that the tax changes will create more work for advisers but it won't necessarily boost their profits and maybe not even their revenues. The movement towards more productivity is painfully slow.

It is true that advisers are turning to technology to improve their efficiency, according to our latest report, UK Financial Advisers: Planning and Technology. But the pace of their adoption of technology is slow overall and there are big differences in the speed of progress for different parts of the advice process, as we've outlined below.

Technology has transformed some areas of financial planning in recent years. Risk profiling tools are used by nearly all advisers and they have mostly been integrated into advice firms' centralised investment processes. That wasn't the case just a few years ago.

The regulator's retirement income advice review may prompted some advisers to use of cash flow planning for clients approaching or in retirement, but many advisers now see commercial benefits from using the tool to engage clients in a rich experience of thinking hard about their finances.

Yet many manual processes persist in the advice process, notably fact-finding and letters of authority. Advisers' use of manual paper-based fact-finding has only dropped from three-quarters of advisers to two-thirds in five years, so progress here remains horribly slow.

Client portals aim to streamline workflows, but relatively few clients use them and they often complain about their poor useability. And still the advice process beset by fragmented digital experiences and multiple logins.

However, AI-driven transcription is gaining traction in fact-finding, improving efficiency and accuracy of recording. Currently, only one in six (16%) advisers use these facilities but numbers are growing.

Many advisers consider letter of authority (LoA) process the least efficient aspect of their service. Providers dictate the various LoA methods they're willing to accept, which complicates advisers' administration.

Providers and platforms have a great opportunity to offer innovative solutions

But innovative solutions from tech providers like Pension Lab, Re:LoA and Unipass are gaining traction with some advice firms.

With the growing impact of tax on clients' finances for providers we would expect to see lots of helpful tax calculators and other programmes, but advisers report that there are few tax tools in their financial planning suites.

Roughly two-thirds of advisers say they use calculators for income, capital gains and inheritance tax liabilities but often they are mostly free but clunky online tools or the ancillary to their cash flow modellers or their platforms.

Advisers' adoption of technology is progressing, but the pace is slow many advice processes remain manual and fragmented. Providers and platforms have a great opportunity to offer innovative solutions.

iOS 19 is expected to appear very different but feel very familiar

Apple's iOS 19 is turning out to be an interesting software update for iPhone users because it is said to bring along a massive visual overhaul; something that's not changed with the mobile operating system for a really long time. While iOS 18 was supposed to usher in an era of Apple Intelligence (or artificial intelligence) for its iPhone, Apple has been struggling to deliver said features as per previously promised timelines. Indeed, iOS 19 is also expected to add to the existing bugs and problems that are just starting to get ironed out in recent iOS 18 updates.

Right after Apple announced the dates for its Worldwide Developers Conference 2025 (WWDC 25, famed tipster John Prosser who previously released a mockup video showcasing the iOS 19 camera app, has now uploaded a new video giving iPhone fans a better idea of what's expected from the yet to be announced iOS 19 update.

In the video, Prosser claims that the 3D visuals in his video are based on actual footage of the iOS 19 he saw in action. However, it is advised to take the below information with a pinch of salt as this could be based on an early build. And as far as early or even beta builds go, things do change until the final release candidate arrives.

The tipster claims that iOS 19 is more about a visual overhaul and less about adding new features. One can almost call it a new theme, which brings a more rounded design, styling and glossy or glass-like transparent visual elements. Prosser, in his video, states that this visual overhaul was expected last year, but thanks to Apple's focus on Apple Intelligence, it was pushed to the following year (2025).

 



 

The visual overhaul also lines up with the design overhaul (at least by Apple's standards) for its upcoming iPhone 17 series, which has been leaked time and again. The new visionOS-inspired design applies not just to the OS but will also be applied to all native apps. In fact, some of these future design elements have already started showing up in the Apple Sports and Apple Invites apps, in form of tiny menus.

The keyboard, which the tipster claims to almost seems to “float”, appears like your regular iOS keys that are now laid out on transparent glass. The same applies to buttons and other UI elements in most native apps. The shiny edges also make elements pop up from the screen. This surely seems like a good break from the regular and mostly flat user interface that iOS has grown into compared to its skeuomorphic past.

However, Mark Gurman, whose predictions have been accurate so far was quick to point out that most of the mockups “floating” online are based on very old builds of iOS 19. In his post on X, Gurman added that they are missing several key features, which he expects Apple to reveal in June at its WWDC 25 developer event.

As a health IT company, Wise Hospice Options integrates with many different systems, particularly electronic health records. The company has integrated with more than 15 EHRs throughout the 21 years it has operated. The only constant it has found is that each system has its own standard and way of doing things.

In hospice care, Health Level 7 and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources specification standards are not tightly followed, and fields may be used in different ways by the different EHRs. When the company started implementing e-prescribing in its system in 2013, these differences became apparent very quickly.

Each system sends different levels of detail with identifiers from different drug compendia. The lack of universal standardization left the Wise Hospice system and IT team unable to completely fill the gaps that interoperability promised it would fill.

Over the years, Wise staff have tried many different solutions to improve the accuracy and user experience of the integrations. They have worked with various EHRs to improve the data they receive; however, the EHR companies have their own IT priorities and capacities, so Wise staff often were unable to get the full data needed for complete resolution of the data gaps.

This led to unrecognized drugs and instructions (sigs) that the e-prescribing system could not parse or handle. Even with NCPDP working toward a Structured and Codified Sig Standard, adoption by EHRs would be difficult as medications are not their sole focus. The NIH has RxNorm APIs available to assist with drug database standardization, but the adoption in the hospice space has been slow and is not regularly used.

Out of the 15 EHR systems Wise has integrated with, only one was willing and able to work with the vendor to send the detailed and specific data for a truly functional medication integration that supports near-seamless e-prescribing – unfortunately, this lone system was acquired and is now being sunset, said Brett Faubion, director of operations and finance at Wise Hospice Options.

""With the available standards not being adopted and the difficulty in getting a multitude of organizations together to work toward a medication message standard, we had to look at what options were in our control to improve the experience of our users and fulfill the promise of interoperability: reducing duplicate entry and the risks associated,"" he explained.

""One method that other systems have taken is to simply accept and load whatever free-text entries are received from the EHR,"" he continued. ""While doing this streamlines the users' e-prescribing flow, it comes with significant risks and reduced functionality. Free-text sig entries are not able to be checked for dosing in our e-prescribing tool since dosing and frequency are not in their own distinct fields.""

Allergy checks could also be compromised by abbreviations, misspellings or typos of the allergy (for example, Penicillin is often misspelled) and could directly lead to patient harm. Not every EHR offers these checks on the orders and medications entered into their system, making the e-prescribing system the only place these risks might be mitigated.

""We do not believe the simplified e-prescribing workflow justifies the increased risk to our users and the hospice patients and our clients resoundingly agreed,"" Faubion said. ""With reducing functionality not being an option, we needed to look for more innovative solutions.

""Our goals coming out of this situational review were to improve the user experience of e-prescribing in our system, improve the effectiveness of medication and allergy interfaces without requiring EHR-side updates, and to streamline the channels and number of contacts involved in the system,"" he continued.

Too much energy was being wasted on 10 different fronts, and Wise staff needed to compile that energy into a single source as a solution, either as internal development or using a single-source external tool, he added. This led staff to look at AI technologies for the various types and structures of data Wise receives for medications, sigs and allergies. The company needed a tool that could codify medications and allergies, and parse free-text sigs into codified fields.

Wise Hospice Options decided to work with health IT vendor DrFirst to offer integrated e-prescribing to hospices. Wise has worked together to improve the user experience and data flow, and minimize many issues over the years, but the data is only as good as what it gets from the data source, the EHR. As Wise pivoted from trying to collaborate with more than 10 different organizations to one, it discussed the issue with DrFirst staff.

""This is when their clinical-grade AI tool first came up,"" Faubion noted. ""This tool was built to codify medications from medication names, strengths and forms, codify allergies from free-text entries, and parse sigs into individual fields used by the DrFirst e-prescribing system. This seemed like a perfect fit for our needs with a trusted partner that demanded less development time from our IT team.

""After seeing a demonstration of the AI and the data backing its results, we discussed prior use cases, reviewed test data and finalized the data flow,"" he continued. ""This would be the first application of the clinical-grade AI tool in a real-time setting, processing the data as we receive from the EHRs. To accommodate the differences in each EHR's data formatting, the AI model would need to be segmented and trained separately for each integration.""

While the coding infrastructure to be implemented would be standardized and toggled on or off for each account, handling each integration uniquely allowed for greater accuracy and better results. This decision did increase the work for both the Wise and DrFirst teams, but they determined it was worth the improved performance for clients.

""The goal of simplifying the collaboration needed for improvement was met, and while an AI tool will not provide 100% conversions, an 80% conversion rate for sigs and even higher for medications and allergies was a major improvement for our users,"" Faubion reported. ""Even if the EHRs enhanced their medication interfaces, there would still be a portion of medications that would be complex and not transfer well, such as compounds or complex sigs with multi-part instructions.

""While using an AI tool does not fully eliminate duplicate entry or the risk of mistranslation, it significantly reduced the amount of manual entry or correction needed,"" he continued. ""E-prescriptions would still need to be reviewed for accuracy, but the majority would no longer need to be adjusted or edited. This improvement occurs completely behind the scenes and does not require any manual activation or intervention by a user.""

Wise Hospice Options worked with the DrFirst team to adapt their AI tool to the majority of EHRs Wise has integrated with and is continuing to expand the supported systems. Expanding service to an integration involves analyzing the data received, processing a significant load of batch data, and reviewing the results for potential pitfalls, improvements and unique patterns for a client.

""For example, some EHRs split the strength of a medication from the name while others lump them together,"" Faubion explained. ""Some of the differences occur at the client level, such as one client selecting multiple routes for a medication. Treating each structure differently allows the AI to be even more accurate for each client and system. The downside is that initially, we have had to limit our onboarding of this tool to an EHR basis.

""We open the offering to each applicable client as we support a specific EHR with this tool,"" he continued. ""The additional accuracy is absolutely worth the slower rollout time. This also allows us to take a more individualized approach and identify the gaps the AI might have for a client's specific data or ordering practices that may not be currently supported by the AI tool. We can then work directly with the client to find a resolution and ensure all parties are satisfied with the data flow.""

The way Wise built the process and data flow allows for the AI to be used without any additional user entry or intervention. It is a tool in the background that enhances the data received from the EHR to make it more compatible with the e-prescribing system.

""This changes the workflow from a 'fix then prescribe,' with various clicks and potentially multiple screens to manually match a medication, to 'review then prescribe,'"" Faubion said. ""Users still need to pay attention to what is being prescribed and to what alerts may occur, such as an allergy interaction or overdosing.""

In Wise Hospice Options' initial pre-live test batches of medication and allergy data, it saw the AI codify 92% of medications, fully parse 80% of sigs and codify 95% of allergies. The company did not expect 100% for any of these categories as there are instances that are complex or custom and need specific attention. For medications, there are compounds that will not easily translate or items that might be entered as a medication that do not have a codified identifier, like oxygen.

""Complex sigs exist that the e-prescribing system is not designed to handle by default, such as non-standard frequencies,"" he explained. ""Allergies can't always be codified and may not be relevant to prescribing medications, such as 'dust' or 'seasonal allergies.' Given these nuances, we were excited about the potential performance.

""Once we implemented the DrFirst AI with several accounts, we saw even better performance metrics than expected,"" he continued. ""The AI tool has codified 99% of medications, 85% of sigs and 96% of allergies. The almost complete prevention of unmatched or invalid medications has been a great result and major improvement to the user experience.""

Before, any medication that was received with old or outdated NDCs, drug identifiers from a compendium Wise does not use, or OTC medications that may not be in the drug database yet, would require a user to find and manually select the correct medication in the e-prescribing system to ensure the correct medication was prescribed. This workflow would take roughly 15 seconds for an experienced user and several clicks to work through, which adds up quickly when each patient has an average of seven medications.

""Add the time needed to rewrite the sigs for each medication compared to simply reviewing the sig, and we reduced the time to e-prescribe from 20 seconds per e-prescription to two to three seconds,"" Faubion reported. ""We have been very happy with these results and the improvement this AI tool has made to our users' experience, workflow and data accuracy.

""While we have seen very positive results, there were still some bumps and improvements that we've worked through since implementation,"" he added. ""Early during implementation, our clients reported a handful of AI errors and we quickly implemented an escalation system with our users and the DrFirst team to ensure these errors were corrected quickly and did not become reoccurring.""

Wise also has seen data variance at the hospice level as some organizations use manual entry or create their own drug entries compared with others that stick to a prepopulated list. The DrFirst team also has worked on improving the processing of the Reasons section of an e-prescription, as this was a field that was rarely used in prior use cases and its utilization varies significantly even among Wise's client pool.

""This has led to many improvements, including handling multiple reasons being listed,"" Faubion noted. ""As we work together to improve data processing, we are excited to see the results continue to improve over time and as more data is fed through the AI.""

                        Let Healthcare Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.
                    
                
            



A new survey from Athenahealth and the Harris Poll shows physicians are thinking less about quitting their jobs and are more favorable toward AI.

Athenahealth, an electronic health record vendor that sells patient engagement tools and healthcare AI products, and the Harris Poll surveyed more than a thousand primary care and specialist physicians nationwide in January to understand physician attitudes about the state of their profession and the adoption of emergent technologies.

The team reported a decrease in physician burnout rates and intentions to quit in 2025 relative to 2024 — a welcome finding after multiple years of high physician turnover following the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a blog post accompanying the survey, the team said technology improvements, especially the use of AI to address administrative burdens, was a “main driver” of physicians' changing sentiments.

“For years EHRs were cited as one of the major contributors to physician burnout, so it stands to reason that as the technology improves, we'll hopefully start to see sentiments improve as well,” the team said in the blog.

While previous independent research has linked frustrations with EHRs to turnover, those studies have cautioned against attributing discontent to a single factor. Researchers note burnout is complex and can stem from frustrations with pay, difficult patients, volume and intensity of work, and advancement opportunities.

In Athenahealth's survey, 3 in 10 physicians said AI has the potential to reduce burnout. The same number reported they are currently using AI in their practice, while the majority have yet to adopt the technology. This year was the first time researchers queried physicians about their AI use, so a spokesperson couldn't comment on whether AI adoption had ramped up among physicians.

The survey did find an increase in “resources and tools” available to physicians in 2025 relative to 2023. Physicians also reported spending more time with patients relative to 2023, which could partially explain the shift in burnout and quit intentions, according to the survey.

Fifty-one percent of physicians report having adequate time with patients, up from 43% in 2023. While 35% of respondents said patient volumes and costs negatively impact their ability to provide quality care at least once a week, that's down from the 50% of respondents who said volumes and costs impacted care at least once a week in 2023.

Still, physicians report more optimism about potential use cases of AI. They said the greatest possible benefits to using AI in healthcare will be improved clinical documentation and transcription services, identifying patterns in patient data and reduced administrative burdens. 

However, there is a gender gap forming between male and female physicians in how comfortable they feel using the technology to treat patients. 

While 66% of male physicians would use AI for diagnosis support and 54% would use the technology for treatment planning, only 46% of female physicians would leverage the technology for diagnostics and just 36% would use it for treatment planning.

Across genders, physicians said their top concerns with using AI include the loss of a human touch in healthcare, an overreliance on the tools to diagnose patients and improper diagnoses.

LIVERPOOL, N.Y. — DOT Foods held a ribbon cutting ceremony to celebrate the opening of a new family health center for their employees at the company's distribution center in Liverpool on Tuesday.

Nurses from across North Carolina gathered in downtown Raleigh to push for changes to health care legislation Wednesday.Gov. Josh Stein kicked off the day with a speech to nurses gathered at the Raleigh Convention Center. He said many of the policy changes they're asking legislators to approve — such as better working conditions — are well-deserved, and he noted that his recent budget proposal suggested that lawmakers put more money into efforts to train nurses and create more jobs in health care.""You provide critical medical expertise and build meaningful relationships with people who need them,"" Stein said. ""You work day and night to care for North Carolinians who are scared, in pain and at one of the most vulnerable moments of their lives. The work that you do is so important. We want you to succeed. We need you to succeed.""But not all of the asks nurses are putting to lawmakers enjoy broad political support inside the state legislature. Lobbying groups for nurses, doctors and hospitals are often at odds with one another — since changes that could help one group might come at the expense of the others.Following Stein's remarks, dozens of nurses flooded the state legislature to speak with state lawmakers, with plans to gather at Halifax Mall at 1 p.m. to advocate for legislation that would give advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) more authority to treat patients, a move supporters say would save on health care costs by cutting down on needless red tape.That suggestion has long been a top issue for nursing groups, and one that's deeply opposed by doctors' groups, who have succeeded in shooting it down in recent years.Intense lobbying, broad support, no votes: NC nursing bill in limboCurrently APRNs, who have a master's degree and, in some cases, a doctorate, need a supervising doctor before they can offer patients some services in North Carolina. House Bill 514 would allow APRNs, including certified registered nurse anesthetists, to handle everything they're licensed to do without supervision from doctors that, they say, is often supervision on paper alone.Nurses have to pay doctors for supervision under the current rules, and lobbying groups for doctors have spent years fighting against any proposal to undo those rules. Some doctors make tens of thousands of dollars a year from the fees.The push to undo those rules is backed by the North Carolina Nurses Association and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, including Sen. Gale Adcock, D-Wake, a nurse. The legislation has been introduced previously under the name the SAVE Act.The Nurses Association says undoing the rules could save North Carolinians more than $650 million annually on health care spending, while increasing patient access to high quality care — particularly in rural parts of the state, where there are few to no doctors.“I cannot think of many other bills that could save North Carolina this kind of money while actually improving the healthcare system,"" said Sen. Ralph Hise, R-Mitchell. ""More than 25 other states have already passed APRN full practice authority – and it's been at least 20 years in some of those states – so I'm tired of hearing all these disingenuous arguments suggesting we need to study the issue a little longer.""Groups that lobby on behalf of doctors, however, say they're concerned about risks to patient safety by letting people be treated by nurses instead of doctors.""This General Assembly decided to require physician supervision of nurse practitioners so that people who are experiencing illness can be sure they have the best-trained and most-experienced health care team,"" North Carolina Medical Society CEO Steve Keene said Wednesday.

HELENA, Mont. — Mark Nay's first client had lost the van she was living in and was struggling with substance use and medical conditions that had led to multiple emergency room visits.


		  It can be republished for free. 

Nay helped her apply for Medicaid and food assistance and obtain copies of her birth certificate and other identification documents needed to apply for housing assistance. He also advocated for her in the housing process and in the health care system, helping her find a provider and get to appointments.

After a year of “steady engagement,” Nay said, the client has a place to live, is insured, is connected to the health care system, and has the resources needed to “really start to be successful and stable” in her life.

Nay is one of two community health workers in a program that St. Peter's Health of Helena started in 2022, focusing on people experiencing or at risk of homelessness who had five or more ER visits in a year. Nay and his colleague, Colette Murley, link their clients to services to meet basic needs, whether it's health care, food, housing, or insurance. The goal is to provide stability and, ultimately, to improve health outcomes.

Similar work is done in hospitals, community health centers, and other settings across Montana by people with titles such as case manager, outreach worker, navigator, and care manager. State Rep. Ed Buttrey, a Great Falls Republican, is sponsoring a bill in Montana's legislative session to put a common title — community health worker — to the type of work they do and define in law what the role entails. The bill also would provide for licensure and allow, but not require, Medicaid to cover the service.

“Health care is just a very difficult system to navigate, especially when you're trying to sign up for service and you're trying to get access to coverage for service,” Buttrey said. “So that's where I see the biggest benefit.”

Buttrey's HB 850 is one of several bills still alive this session that are related to Montana's health care workforce, which is stretched thin throughout the state, the fourth-largest by land area. According to the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration, more than one-fourth of the state's residents live in an area with a shortage of primary care health professionals.

Other pending workforce bills include three interstate compact bills, to recognize licenses issued in other states for physician assistants, psychologists, and respiratory therapists. Then there are bills to prohibit noncompete clauses for physicians and some categories of mid-level practitioners. Other measures would allow more unsupervised activities by certain aides and assistants, let nurses provide low-cost home visits to low-income patients, allow licensure of doulas, and let physician assistants and physical therapists be considered “treating physicians” for workers' compensation purposes.

State Rep. Jodee Etchart, a Billings Republican and a physician assistant, is sponsoring two of the interstate compact licensure bills and one of the bills to limit noncompete clauses.

Etchart termed the compact bills “a no-brainer” because they allow people to get licensed, get a job, and start working in Montana right away.

In 2023, Etchart sponsored successful bills to allow physician assistants to practice without physician supervision and to expand the scope of practice for direct-entry midwives. Those bills, she said, helped pave the way for the progress this year's workforce bills have made this session.

“It opened a lot of people's eyes about how we can increase access to health care all over Montana,” she said.

The 2023 bill allowing independent practice by physician assistants drew opposition from physicians, with the Montana Medical Association saying it extended their scope of practice without requiring additional training. This session, the MMA has supported the bills to remove noncompete provisions but opposed bills on expanding the scope of practice for chiropractors and optometrists. MMA CEO Jean Branscum said the group generally believes scope-of-practice changes don't fix workforce problems if the expanded practice isn't supported by evidence or training.

Buttrey said this session's bills to extend unsupervised practice and enact licensure compacts are an acknowledgment of the difficulty that small, rural communities have in attracting doctors. Physician assistants and nurse practitioners have been filling those gaps, he said.

Community health workers fill a different type of gap. They don't provide direct medical care, instead helping people find the health care and support services they need to become and remain healthy.

Many states have already adopted definitions for community health workers and started providing Medicaid reimbursement for their services.

The requests to add to the list of Medicaid-covered services come at a time when Congress is considering significant budget cuts that could affect the amount of funding the federal government contributes to the Medicaid program. Although the legislature this session continued Montana's Medicaid expansion program for low-income adults without disabilities, some legislators expressed concern about potential federal changes that could lower the amount of federal funds available for the program.

State Sen. Carl Glimm, a Kila Republican, was one of those legislators. He said he has similar concerns about increasing the types of services covered by Medicaid.

“The more stuff we add,” he said, “the more responsibility the state has” if the federal government shifts more of the program's costs to the states.

Buttrey's bill would define a community health worker as a “frontline public health worker” who helps people obtain medical and social services, advocates for their health, and educates individuals, providers, and the community about health care needs. Workers could be licensed after completing training and supervision requirements.

Most medical providers don't have time to delve into all the outside factors influencing a patient's health, said Cindy Stergar, CEO of the Montana Primary Care Association, which is supporting Buttrey's bill. Community health workers can assist with that, she said, adding that research shows people with complex needs become healthier faster when their basic nonmedical needs, such as food and housing, are met.

“At the end of the day, the patient is better,” Stergar said. “That's first and foremost.”

The Area Health Education Center at Montana State University has been offering community health worker training since 2018, and the University of Montana's Center for Children, Families and Workforce Development began a training program in 2023. Together, the programs have trained nearly 500 people in how to identify the medical and social factors influencing a person's health and in strategies for connecting the person with the right community resources.

“Ideally, what community health workers are doing is getting out of the clinic walls, meeting people where they are, and addressing the priorities of the client to get to the root cause of their health conditions and health needs,” said Mackenzie Petersen, project director for the training program at the University of Montana.

Supporters of the community health worker role say the workers are uniquely positioned to observe, understand, and address the barriers preventing a person from getting and staying healthy.

The barriers might be a lack of transportation or insurance or, for a homeless person, the inability to refrigerate a prescribed medication. A community health worker can arrange rides to appointments, help with insurance applications, or make sure a health care provider prescribes a medication that doesn't need refrigeration.

Murley, with the St. Peter's Health program, recalled that one of her clients was making frequent trips to the ER with suicidal ideation. Murley learned that he faced bullying in his apartment building and helped him relocate. The ER visits dropped off.

As Nay put it: “It's really about helping the people that we work with create a path to their health.”

Reproductive Freedom for All Georgia Condemns HB 441 as a Cruel and Dangerous Attack on Reproductive Healthcare

Atlanta, GA—Today, Reproductive Freedom for All Georgia strongly condemned House Bill 441, an extreme and politically motivated measure that would criminalize abortion at all stages of pregnancy by establishing legal personhood at fertilization. If passed, HB 441 would make Georgia one of only 13 states with a total abortion ban, imposing severe penalties, including loss of medical licenses, imprisonment, and even capital punishment.

Ahead of a hearing today at the state capitol, reproductive advocates will rally and testify against this dangerous legislation in the fight to protect reproductive rights in Georgia. Lawmakers will debate a measure that escalates previous abortion restrictions, putting more lives at risk while ignoring Georgia's ongoing healthcare crisis.

HB 441 follows a series of increasingly restrictive abortion measures in Georgia, including the 2019 LIFE Act that banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. That law took effect in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Instead of addressing Georgia's urgent healthcare crisis, including the state's ranking as the worst in the nation for maternal mortality and the highest rate of rural hospital closures, lawmakers are pushing an agenda that makes reproductive healthcare even more dangerous, costly, and inaccessible.

Alicia Stallworth, Georgia Campaigns Director for Reproductive Freedom for All, issued the following statement:

“This bill isn't about saving lives — it's about control. It would turn pregnancy into a crime scene and force doctors and nurses to choose between risking their livelihoods or providing necessary care. Black and Brown women, low-income families, rural communities, and young people will bear the brunt of this reckless legislation, and Georgia's healthcare crisis will only deepen. We deserve leaders who will address real healthcare needs, not lawmakers who criminalize care and strip away our freedoms.”

“We cannot allow Georgia to become a surveillance state where every pregnancy is scrutinized and every healthcare decision is subject to prosecution. Enough is enough. Lawmakers should be focused on expanding access to healthcare and reducing our maternal mortality rate — not criminalizing reproductive healthcare and endangering lives.”

###

For over 50 years, Reproductive Freedom for All (formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America) has fought to protect and advance reproductive freedom at the federal and state levels—including access to abortion care, birth control, pregnancy and post-partum care, and paid family leave—for everybody. Reproductive Freedom for All is powered by its more than 4 million members from every state and congressional district in the country, representing the 8 in 10 Americans who support legal abortion.

Orlando Health is joining forces with physician-led practice Watson Health on a new hospital, the Orlando Health Watson Clinic Lakeland Highlands Hospital, which is slated to debut in June 2026.

Orlando Health Midwest Region Senior Vice President Carlos Carrasco said in a statement that combining their respective strengths will allow the organizations to expand their services and care footprint.

""This is one of the largest hospital capital investments Orlando Health has made,"" said Carrasco. ""It's a big commitment to the community. But it's a big commitment because the community deserves it.""

""This collaboration will provide our devoted patient base with expanded access to the doctors and care they trust most,"" said Watson Clinic CEO Jason Hirsbrunner.

WHAT'S THE IMPACT?

The organizations said the affiliation will be evident in many areas throughout the hospital. Experts from both entities have been heavily involved in collaboratively designing the facility, selecting the technologies being employed, and planning the services that will be offered.

On opening day, the Orlando Health Watson Clinic Lakeland Highlands Hospital will open with more than 300 inpatient beds, 69 emergency and observation beds, 11 working operating rooms, four cardiac and interventional suites, and 18 beds in an intensive care unit that will serve 36 patients at full build-out.

Obstetric services and accommodations will be available on opening day with eight labor and delivery rooms, two special C-section operating rooms and more than 25 post-partum rooms. A 12-bed neonatal intensive care unit will debut shortly after the hospital opens.

Funding for the project was not disclosed.

THE LARGER TREND

Orlando Health is a private nonprofit, integrated academic healthcare system with $12 billion of assets under management, serving the southeastern U.S., including Florida, Alabama and Puerto Rico.

The system provided nearly $1.7 billion in community impact in the form of community benefit programs and services, Medicare shortfalls, bad debt, community-building activities and capital investments in fiscal 2023, it said.

WEST PLAINS, MO – On National Doctors' Day, March 30, 2025, Ozarks Healthcare is proud to celebrate the dedication, compassion, and hard work of its team of physicians. From providing exceptional patient care to advancing healthcare in the region, Ozarks Healthcare's doctors continue to make a profound impact on the lives of patients, families, and the community.

This year's celebration highlights the many ways doctors at Ozarks Healthcare go above and beyond to provide personalized, high-quality care while building meaningful relationships with patients. As we reflect on their contributions, we are reminded of their essential roles not only in healthcare but in improving the quality of life in the Ozarks region.



“Our doctors are truly at the heart of Ozarks Healthcare,” Jacob Petrus, Vice President of Physician Services and Operations at Ozarks Healthcare, said. “Their expertise, compassion, and commitment to patients are unmatched, and we are fortunate to have such an exceptional team here. Doctors' Day provides an opportunity for us all to express our gratitude for the impact they make every day.”

Ozarks Healthcare's doctors work tirelessly across many specialties, providing expert care in various fields to meet the needs of our community. Below are just a few examples of doctors who exemplify the values of Ozarks Healthcare:

Dr. David Benalcazar, General Surgeon

Benalcazar delivers life-saving surgery and care to patients. His dedication to his patients and his surgical expertise are invaluable assets to the community.

“The most rewarding aspect of being a surgeon is the remarkable improvement in a patient's quality of life that we can achieve after a surgical intervention,” Benalcazar said. “From the moment I meet a patient in the clinic, I become fully committed to their care. I meticulously explain any intervention in detail and remain available to them throughout the entire perioperative process to ensure they achieve the best possible outcome.”

Dr. Joseph Barnard, Family Medicine Physician

A familiar face in Gainesville, Barnard is known for his compassionate care and commitment to improving the health and well-being of families. His focus on building lasting relationships with patients has earned him the trust and respect of many in the region.

“Long-term care is key to better health. Understanding a patient's history and needs allows me to provide more personalized, proactive care—helping prevent issues before they become serious and promoting lifelong wellness,” Barnard said.

Dr. Susan Jolly, Orthopedic Surgeon

Jolly specializes in advanced surgical techniques and treats patients with musculoskeletal disorders. She provides exceptional care to individuals needing orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation, working to improve their quality of life and mobility.

“My motivation for working as an orthopedic surgeon is the ability to greatly improve patients' lives and level of function as well as to relieve their pain causing enjoyment in their life,” Jolly said. “It is my privilege to be able to have such an impact on patients' daily activities.”

Dr. Jen Lambert, Family Medicine Physician

Lambert's approach to healthcare and emphasis on preventative care help patients navigate health conditions with ease. Her compassionate care at Ozarks Healthcare Family Medicine West Plains has been transformative for many patients of all ages seeking treatment for a wide variety of conditions.

“Understanding my patients allows me to create treatment plans that fit their lifestyle, making it easier for them to stay on track and achieve the best results,” Lambert said. “By getting to know them on a deeper level – their routines, challenges, and goals – I can offer more personalized care that truly supports their long-term health.”

Dr. Priscilla Frase, Chief Medical Information Officer

Frase has been instrumental in leading efforts to enhance Ozarks Healthcare's use of medical technology, ensuring that our systems are optimized to provide the best possible care to our patients. Her work behind the scenes supports the advancement of healthcare in the Ozarks.

“Today, technology is an integral part of clinical care,” Frase said. “Technology enhances patient safety via targeted alerts and monitoring care trends. And today, we are finding ways to utilize technology to not just improve care efficiency, but also clinician and provider well-being that can help us sustain high quality healthcare for our community. It is helping my colleagues and coworkers find a balance that works best for them that I most enjoy about my job. Small victories that lead to better outcomes for all are what I live for.”

Ozarks Healthcare encourages everyone to take a moment on Doctors' Day to thank the dedicated physicians who care for their communities. Whether through a heartfelt note, sharing appreciation on social media, or simply offering a kind word, every expression of gratitude helps to show the profound impact that these doctors have.

Following news that Carson Tahoe Health would not renew its contract with United Healthcare past May 30, CTH is working toward a temporary solution for state workers who have United health insurance, CTH officials said Monday.

“CTH is working in good faith to create a solution that extends United coverage for PEBP (Public Employees' Benefits Program) members through Dec. 31, 2025,” said Kitty McKay, CTH vice president of patient and community experience.

Details on the extension or negotiations with United, which insures state workers, were not available.

Last year, CTH announced it would not continue its contract with United and would no longer be an in-network provider as of May 31, 2025.

“Over many of these years, we have partnered with United Healthcare and gratefully provided you with nearby care that is easily accessed,” CTH CEO Michelle Joy previously said. “Increasingly however, we are reliant upon the decisions of insurance companies for care and livelihood.

“The complexities of navigating insurance claims is growing, reimbursements are declining, and every day on the front lines this translates into increasing insurance authorization denials and possible delays in physician-directed treatments, as well as payment barriers making an ongoing relationship insurmountable.”

At the time, Gov. Joe Lombardo's Office issued a statement saying state leadership was meeting with both parties involved to address the issue.

Last week, United Healthcare said it was still negotiating with CTH.

“We remain actively engaged in good-faith negotiation with Carson Tahoe Health,” a United spokesperson said March 17. “It remains our top priority to reach an agreement that is affordable for consumers and employers while ensuring continued, uninterrupted network access to the health system.”

Carson Tahoe Health serves Carson City, Douglas, Lyon and Storey counties as well as patients from the greater region.

According to the Carson City Chamber of Commerce, government (state and local) employs over 11,500 in the city. The largest employers include the Nevada National Guard and state departments of corrections, transportation and employment security, among others.

Carson Tahoe Health, a nonprofit, is also one of the city's largest employers.

United Health Group, which runs United Healthcare, reported revenues of approximately $400.3 billion and profits of more than $14 billion in 2024, according to a Jan. 16 news release from the company.

Even if CTH is no longer in-network with United, “The one exception is when you seek emergency care,” according to CTH.

“In accordance with the federal No Surprises Act, emergency services must be provided as in network for those covered by health insurance through an employer (including a federal employees health benefits plan), the federal health insurance marketplace, a state-based marketplace or other individual market coverage,” says CTH's website.

Oops, something went wrong

Internet healthcare solutions provider Fangzhou has entered a partnership with Tencent Health and Tencent Cloud, aiming to expedite AI-driven healthcare solutions with the integration of the DeepSeek open-source AI model into its platform.

This move is expected to bolster the capabilities of Fangzhou's AI Agent 2.0 platform to enhance pharmaceutical logistics along with online healthcare services.

Fangzhou's recent deployment of the DeepSeek open-source large language model in February has set the stage for this partnership, which utilises Tencent Cloud's infrastructure to power the AI Agent 2.0 platform.

The platform is now equipped with DeepSeek's analytical prowess and Tencent's Hunyuan model, focusing on improving the efficiency of the healthcare sector.

DeepSeek's model is chosen for its performance, cost-effectiveness, and security features.

Its scalable efficiency is attributed to the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, and its private deployment model aligns with stringent data privacy regulations by avoiding the transmission of customer data to third parties.

Fangzhou's AI platform is adept at rapid local deployment of various large language models, which facilitated the swift integration of DeepSeek's technology.

The support from Tencent Cloud's infrastructure has enabled Fangzhou to improve its platform's capabilities, offering improved services to patients and healthcare providers.

The AI Agent 2.0 deployment marks a significant development in the strategic partnership between Fangzhou, Tencent Health and Tencent Cloud.

This upgraded system is now better positioned to address patient services, physician workflows, and the development of new functionalities and data-driven improvements.

In December last year, Fangzhou announced a collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb.

This partnership focused on fostering innovation in internet healthcare, particularly in the development of digital platforms and models for internet-based chronic disease care.

""Fangzhou announces partnership to expedite healthcare solutions with DeepSeek"" was originally created and published by Hospital Management, a GlobalData owned brand.

OAG Rejected Initial $1 Sale Proposal and Negotiated New Terms to Support Healthcare Services in DC, Including Plans for Potential Ward 5 Urgent Care Center & Millions of Dollars in Medical Equipment


Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb today announced that the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has negotiated and secured a revised proposal to sell the Providence Hospital campus — approximately 22 acres of Ward 5 property with buildings that have been mostly vacant for six years. The purchaser, Vision PH Associates (Vision PH), plans to develop hundreds of new housing units, including affordable units, on the campus which will help address the District's housing shortage. OAG's approval of the sale required the preservation of significant public health resources for the District, including $5 million in health services funding, plans for a new Ward 5 urgent care center on the Providence campus, and renewed use of millions of dollars in medical equipment. The deal will not affect health services currently offered in several campus buildings operated by providers other than Providence.

“Ward 5 residents made clear that this deal must balance the need for additional housing and community development with continued access to healthcare services. Today's agreement does exactly that — providing millions of dollars in public health resources and paving the way for significant residential and commercial expansion,” said Attorney General Schwalb. “As the District's independent Attorney General charged with protecting charitable assets, I am proud of the work we do with the business and nonprofit communities to secure the best possible outcomes for all Washingtonians. I want to thank the dozens of community members who came forward to make their voices heard, as well as the teams at Providence and Vision PH, whose cooperation in our review helped achieve a universally beneficial resolution.”

“Since taking office, I have focused on moving the Providence Redevelopment forward. I appreciate Attorney General Schwalb's partnership in these efforts by securing a deal that minimizes risks to the immediate Michigan Park community, maximizes benefits to the District, and creates a pathway for an inclusive development at this Ward 5 hub,” said Ward 5 Councilmember Zachary Parker. “I have heard loud and clear from residents that they want access to healthcare as part of the development, and I greatly appreciate that this deal includes plans for a new family urgent care center and maintaining healthcare facilities at the site. I look forward to working with community partners and city leaders to ensure the Providence Redevelopment delivers for Ward 5 neighbors.”

In 2023, Providence, a DC nonprofit healthcare entity, agreed to sell the Providence campus to Vision PH for $1 as part of a plan to redevelop the site with townhomes and multifamily apartments. Vision PH is a joint venture of real estate developers formed by EYA, LLC and Aroli Group LLC (known as the Menkiti Group).

The District's State Health Planning and Development Agency (SHPDA) asked OAG to review the proposed sale under DC's Healthcare Entity Conversion Act (HECA), which requires any conversion of a nonprofit healthcare entity's charitable assets to for-profit purposes to be adequately valued, protected, and preserved consistent with the nonprofit's stated public-interest mission. While HECA does not require that Providence continue to provide healthcare services on the campus, or that the campus be used to provide healthcare, it does require that the assets Providence uses to advance its nonprofit purpose—providing and supporting healthcare services—be protected and preserved for the benefit of the District and its residents. 

The OAG review process was especially critical for Providence's proposed conversion given that Ward 5 residents have frequently expressed the continuing need for healthcare services in the community. These concerns were reiterated by many residents during a public comment period that was part of the review process.

OAG's independent experts determined that the $1 purchase price that Providence initially agreed to sell the campus for did not reflect the true value of the campus — even accounting for the extensive, value-depleting demolition and remediation costs necessary to clear the campus for residential housing development. As a result, OAG concluded that the originally proposed sale would not adequately preserve Providence's charitable assets, which DC taxpayer dollars have supported for decades.

Following its evaluation, OAG informed Providence and Vision PH that it would only approve the proposed sale on certain conditions. Under these conditions, Providence and Vision PH have agreed to:

During redevelopment, Vision PH will facilitate continued operation of the healthcare services that remain on the campus. These services, which Providence does not provide, include a senior assisted living facility, a first responder clinic, and two medical office buildings offering a wide range of specialty and general practitioner care.

This matter was handled by Estefania Torres Paez, Cara Spencer, and Adam Gitlin, of the Antitrust and Nonprofit Section, and Alexandra Cain and Maximilian Tondro, of the Equitable Land Use Section, with the substantial support of paralegal, Leland Held, multiple legal interns, and other support staff.

A partnership bringing on-site healthcare services to senior living communities is focused on resident wellness, efficient care practices and less time in the hospital.

American House Senior Living Communities is partnering with senior living primary care provider Curana Health to bring on-site healthcare services to residents in 11 of its Tennessee communities. American House has more than 60 senior living communities throughout the Midwest, New England and the Southeast.

Through the arrangement, Curana will offer residents a wide range of concierge-style medical services, including routine preventive primary care, appointments for illness, around-the-clock clinical support access, care coordination and special care appointments, ongoing management of chronic conditions, medication management, and coordination of on-site phlebotomy and imaging services.

An American House spokesperson said the partnership enhances care collaboration with its team and outside providers, with quality as the main objective. The pivot allows American House caregivers to partner with providers focused on improving resident wellness, promoting efficient care practices, and keeping residents out of the hospital and in their homes.

“By partnering with Curana Health, American House is taking a transformative step toward enhancing the quality of care and support we provide to our residents,” Alex Germain-Robin, American House chief operations officer, said in a statement. “Together, we are dedicated to fostering a caring environment that prioritizes the well-being of each individual, ensuring better outcomes, improved health and a more compassionate approach to senior living.” 

After conducting its own internal due diligence, American House said that Curana was a good match for its mission and culture, according to the American House spokesperson. 

The program allows residents to use Curana Health's care team for primary or secondary care, allowing residents to continue seeing their established primary care provider for routine healthcare needs. Visits and services are covered by residents' health insurance and billed by Curana. 

American House also will participate in Curana Health's Medicare Shared Savings Program accountable care organization. American House said this action reinforces the mutual goal of improving outcomes and helping residents maintain their health and independence. American House said that the ACO enables its care team to partner with providers focused on resident wellness and outcomes.

According to Curana, its partners have experienced a 39% reduction in hospital readmissions, a 30% reduction in falls, 39% fewer instances of polypharmacy and 95% resident satisfaction.

Although the program rollout is confined to American House's Tennessee communities for now, the operator's spokesperson said that expanding to other markets “is not off the table.” The decision to launch in Tennessee was a strategic one, the spokesperson said, and American House said it is “thrilled” about the value the partnership will bring to residents and families.

Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee criticized the physician and TV personality ahead of the vote Tuesday for avoiding questions about potential cuts to Medicaid.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, President Donald Trump's choice to lead the CMS, is one step closer to securing the job.

On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 13 along party lines to advance Oz's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.

If confirmed, the physician and TV personality would lead the agency that provides health coverage to more than 160 million people through Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program and the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. 

“Dr. Oz's years of experience as an acclaimed physician and public health advocate have prepared him well to manage the intricacies of CMS,” Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a statement. 

But Democrats on the committee roundly panned the nomination, pointing toward the looming threat of cuts to Medicaid. Oz largely dodged questions about whether he would support reducing funding to the safety-net insurance program during a confirmation hearing earlier this month.

However, Oz confirmed that he was in favor of Medicaid work requirements, which require enrollees to report work, volunteer or education hours to receive benefits.

“Dr. Oz is one of several Trump administration nominees that say that they recognize the real difference that Medicaid and other health programs make, and yet they are joining an administration and are supported by congressional Republicans who plan to slash the health coverage and programs that people rely on,” said Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., on Tuesday.

Medicaid is a target for spending reductions under the Trump administration, even if cuts to the program are politically challenging, given its popularity and risks to providers' finances. 

House Republicans advanced a budget blueprint last month that calls for the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, to find $880 billion in cuts. 

Though the resolution doesn't mention Medicaid specifically, Republicans would be unable to meet their budget target without cutting major healthcare programs under the committee's purview, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 

Ahead of the vote Tuesday, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., argued Republicans' goal was to save and strengthen Medicaid while addressing “the fraud, the waste [and] eligibility issues.”

“Some states are manipulating the system. They're gaming the system,” he said. “If we don't get our arms around it, there will be no Medicaid left for those who are the most vulnerable.”

Marshall also pointed to opportunities to reform Medicare Advantage, the privatized Medicare offering that enrolls more than half of eligible beneficiaries. Medicare will spend $84 billion more on MA enrollees this year than it would if those beneficiaries were in the traditional fee-for-service program, according to congressional advisory group MedPAC.

Oz had previously been criticized by Democrats for his support of the MA program, as well as financial ties to major insurer UnitedHealth Group. 

But during his confirmation hearing earlier in March, Oz pledged to scrutinize MA insurers for practices like upcoding. “A part of this is just recognizing there's a new sheriff in town,” he said.

Regulators' assessment of customer support centers has spurred recent lawsuits from insurers. But the metric “is going to have a smaller weighting on star ratings moving forward,” the director of Medicare said.

The Biden administration is attempting to push through a slew of reforms to the controversial MA program in its final months in power, though it will need the Trump administration's buy-in to get them across the finish line.

Oops, something went wrong

Klarity Health has introduced its new marketing and communications SaaS tool, Kiwi Health, which is designed to support independent healthcare providers and small practices.

The all-in-one platform aims to enhance provider visibility and patient engagement throughout the healthcare journey.

Klarity Health CEO and co-founder Victor Zhou said: ""For too long, independent practices have lacked the right growth tools while facing fierce competition from healthcare companies with big marketing budgets.

""Finally, with Kiwi Health, independent providers now have the weapon built on the proven formula to drive success.""

Kiwi Health provides a suite of tools tailored for independent providers to streamline patient interactions and increase their online presence.

The toolkit includes presence management, which optimises listings across more than 30 clinical directories such as Bing, Google, Healthline, Klarity Health Marketplace, and WebMD.

It also features website management, offering SEO-optimised, clinically focused websites that improve online discoverability and credibility.

Additionally, Kiwi Health's patient scheduling and intake experience feature facilitates self-booking appointments, interactive intake forms, and automated insurance verification to reduce care obstacles.

A HIPAA-compliant patient portal and loyalty system is integrated into the tool, compatible with all electronic health records (EHR). It includes membership and continuity-of-care options that aim to transform episodic visits into lasting therapeutic relationships.

Furthermore, engagement tools within Kiwi Health offer telehealth capabilities, automated reminders of appointments, and tailored follow-ups.

Kiwi Health is part of Klarity Health's ecosystem, designed to decentralise healthcare by providing independent providers with the necessary tools to manage their practices.

This launch complements Klarity Health's existing solutions, including SafePrescriber, a toolkit that focuses on compliance for safe care; and Klarity Marketplace, which connects independent providers with patients seeking personalised care.

""Klarity Health introduces SaaS tool for healthcare providers"" was originally created and published by Hospital Management, a GlobalData owned brand.

Oops, something went wrong

Earnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q4 behind us, let's have a look at HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) and its peers.

Hospital chains operate scale-driven businesses that rely on patient volumes, efficient operations, and favorable payer contracts to drive revenue and profitability. These organizations benefit from the essential nature of their services, which ensures consistent demand, particularly as populations age and chronic diseases become more prevalent. However, profitability can be pressured by rising labor costs, regulatory requirements, and the challenges of balancing care quality with cost efficiency. Dependence on government and private insurance reimbursements also introduces financial uncertainty. Looking ahead, hospital chains stand to benefit from tailwinds such as increasing healthcare utilization driven by an aging population that generally has higher incidents of disease. AI can also be a tailwind in areas such as predictive analytics for more personalized treatment and efficiency (intake, staffing, resourcing allocation). However, the sector faces potential headwinds such as labor shortages that could push up wages as well as substantial investments needs for digital infrastructure to support telehealth and electronic health records. Regulatory scrutiny, and reimbursement cuts are also looming topics that could further strain margins.

The 4 hospital chains stocks we track reported a mixed Q4. As a group, revenues along with next quarter's revenue guidance were in line with analysts' consensus estimates.

Amidst this news, share prices of the companies have had a rough stretch. On average, they are down 7.2% since the latest earnings results.

With roots dating back to 1968 and a network spanning 20 states, HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) operates a network of 190 hospitals and 150+ outpatient facilities providing a full range of medical services across the US and England.

HCA Healthcare reported revenues of $18.29 billion, up 5.7% year on year. This print exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.7%. Despite the top-line beat, it was still a mixed quarter for the company with a narrow beat of analysts' EPS estimates but same-store sales in line with analysts' estimates.

""We finished 2024 with strong business fundamentals that were consistent with previous quarters,"" said Sam Hazen, Chief Executive Officer of HCA Healthcare.

The stock is up 3.3% since reporting and currently trades at $336.01.

With a network spanning 39 states and three countries, Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS) operates acute care hospitals and behavioral health facilities across the United States, United Kingdom, and Puerto Rico.

Universal Health Services reported revenues of $4.11 billion, up 11.1% year on year, outperforming analysts' expectations by 2.6%. The business had a very strong quarter with an impressive beat of analysts' full-year EPS guidance estimates.

Universal Health Services delivered the biggest analyst estimates beat, fastest revenue growth, and highest full-year guidance raise among its peers. The market seems content with the results as the stock is up 3.7% since reporting. It currently trades at $185.91.

With a network of over 250 facilities serving patients in 38 states and Puerto Rico, Acadia Healthcare (NASDAQ:ACHC) operates facilities providing mental health and substance use disorder treatment services across the United States.

Acadia Healthcare reported revenues of $774.2 million, up 4.2% year on year, falling short of analysts' expectations by 0.6%. It was a softer quarter as it posted a significant miss of analysts' EPS estimates.

As expected, the stock is down 30.9% since the results and currently trades at $27.81.

Read our full analysis of Acadia Healthcare's results here. 

With a network spanning nine states and serving primarily urban and suburban communities, Tenet Healthcare (NYSE:THC) operates a nationwide network of hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, and outpatient facilities providing acute care and specialty healthcare services.

Tenet Healthcare reported revenues of $5.07 billion, down 5.7% year on year. This result missed analysts' expectations by 2%. Taking a step back, it was a mixed quarter as it also produced a solid beat of analysts' full-year EPS guidance estimates but full-year revenue guidance missing analysts' expectations.

Tenet Healthcare had the weakest performance against analyst estimates, slowest revenue growth, and weakest full-year guidance update among its peers. The stock is down 5.1% since reporting and currently trades at $131.78.

Walgreens has agreed to pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed in federal court for the Northern District of Illinois more than 10 years ago.

Walgreens was accused of engaging in a ""systematic and routine waiver of patient copayments."" This was to induce all patients at the Cook County Health and Hospitals System CORE center, an ambulatory healthcare center in Illinois, to fill prescriptions at a specialty pharmacy called Walgreens C&M, according to the lawsuit. This allegedly constituted kickbacks. 

WHY THIS MATTERS

The case began in 2014 when plaintiff whistleblowers Sarah Castillo Baier and Rita Svendsen Baier sued Walgreens and a retail pharmacy branch manager alleging violation of the False Claims Act. The federal government and state of Illinois intervened.

The court on Monday dismissed the case after the parties filed for a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal.

In the civil action settlement, Walgreens agreed to pay $5,075,000 to be divided among the United States, state of Illinois and the whistleblowers.
The whistleblowers get $1.3 million, according to the settlement.

THE LARGER TREND

Earlier this month, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity affiliated with private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at $23.7 billion. 

Walgreens has suffered losses due in large part to VillageMD. The company said it was evaluating a variety of options with respect to the $3.4 billion debt owed to WBA by VillageMD.

TOPICS:

ALBANY, N.Y. — A new initiative, the Caring Gene program, is offering full coverage of tuition, books, and fees for New York State residents entering certain healthcare fields. This federally funded program, supported by a Medicaid waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, promises $694 million to New York through March 2027.

Dr. Wendy Trevor, Vice President of Strategic Innovation and Partnerships at Maria College, emphasized the financial challenges faced by aspiring nurses. ""A lot of times nursing students come with family members they've taken care of or family member who's been sick or they're taking care of an elderly relative,"" she said. ""And then they look at tuition and they say, maybe I can't afford that, maybe not now, maybe later.""

Maria College is among approximately 20 institutions participating in the program, which aims to address workforce shortages in healthcare. Students who benefit from the program commit to working in New York for three years, serving populations at or above the 30-percent Medicaid threshold.

Kevin Kerwin, Acting President and CEO of the Iroquois Healthcare Association, noted the program's timely introduction. ""And that's where we're bringing people into the pipeline and getting them to stay for a little while and discover kind of their career by doing that,"" he said. ""So this program has come along at exactly the right time.""

To date, the 'Caring Gene' program has received over 1,800 requests for information, with 713 potential students in the pipeline and 276 students already enrolled. Dr. Trevor highlighted the program's broader impact, stating, ""We all will at some time face needing access to healthcare and to have really competent caring individuals and staffing levels that are appropriate. I think it's gonna, everyone's gonna benefit from this.""

In addition to Maria College, other participating institutions include Russell Sage, Schenectady County Community College, Saint Peter's Hospital School of Nursing, and Good Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Recently Put These 10 Stocks Under Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently.

On Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on how the government's approach to tariffs could play a crucial role in sustaining the stock market rally. Cramer expressed satisfaction with the current direction of policy.

“There's what happened two weeks ago, two Thursdays ago, more accurately when the stock market official went into correction mode. Until the market broke down like that, I think the president was perfectly willing to hammer anybody just to get his way.”

READ ALSO: Jim Cramer Recently Talked About These 5 Subscription Stocks and 8 Stocks on Jim Cramer's Radar

“I don't think he (President Donald Trump) wants to punish good American companies that make things here.”

Cramer explained that he no longer thinks the president wants to harm American companies that manufacture goods domestically. He suggested that the shift in attitude is a relatively new development, and it may signal a more nuanced approach going forward. He noted that with the market's recovery, it is possible that the conversation around protectionist tariffs will surface once again, but the context might have changed.

Cramer speculated that when the market entered correction mode, President Trump may have been influenced by the pleas from various observers about the damaging effects on stocks of good American companies.

“Here's the bottom line: At the end of the day, America's the only country on earth that's played fair on trade. Everybody else breaks the rules to protect their domestic businesses. That's hollowed out our industrial heartland. And that dynamic can only change if our government takes a more carrot-and-stick approach. Assuming Trump doesn't go overboard, that might just be what we've got and it means stocks can finally stage a real rally again.”

For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey's database of over 1,000 hedge funds.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81

A caller asked Cramer's thoughts on HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) and he replied:

“Okay, HCA I think has been punished enough. It's time to buy and I do think that your, your depiction of what happens every day is absolutely right and I feel it's just, it's not manipulation, but it's a pain in, a pain in the butt.”

HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) owns and operates hospitals and healthcare facilities across the United States, offering a wide range of medical, surgical, outpatient, and behavioral health services, including specialized care like cardiac, diagnostic, and rehabilitation treatments, as well as addiction and psychiatric services.

Diamond Hill Capital stated the following regarding HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:

“Among our bottom individual contributors in Q4 were HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) and Freeport-McMoRan. Health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare was negatively impacted in a couple of its markets by recent hurricanes. Further, shares have been pressured since the US election amid growing negative sentiment toward hospitals as investors anticipate potential reductions to safety-net programs such as Medicaid.”

Overall, HCA ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. While we acknowledge the potential of HCA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HCA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

""State of CPS Security: Healthcare Exposures 2025"" Highlights the Most Urgent Healthcare Device and Network Vulnerabilities, Including OT Risks in Hospitals

NEW YORK, March 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Claroty, the cyber-physical systems (CPS) protection company, today released new research on the riskiest exposures to connected medical devices most coveted for exploitation by adversaries. Based on analysis of over 2.25 million Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and 647,000-plus operational technology (OT) devices across 351 healthcare organizations, the ""State of CPS Security: Healthcare Exposures 2025"" report found 89% of organizations have the top 1% of riskiest IoMT devices – which contain known exploitable vulnerabilities (KEVs) linked to active ransomware campaigns as well as an insecure connection to the internet – on their networks. These figures represent a highly targeted, critical area where most security teams should prioritize their remediation efforts.

As cyberattacks in the healthcare sector continue to rise in severity and the resources to prevent them remain limited, this report illuminates the medical assets at high risk for ransomware, extortion attacks, and attacks exploiting insecure internet connections. Claroty's Team82 analyzed the challenges that hospitals and healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) face when identifying which vulnerabilities and exposures in medical and OT devices to prioritize for remediation.

The report details risk exposures in several key areas—hospital information systems (HIS), IoMT devices like imaging, patient equipment, and hospital OT systems. With disruptions to operational continuity and patient care delivery being key concerns, the report focused on a specific combination of medical device risk factors: the presence of KEVs, those KEVs being linked to ransomware, and an insecure internet connection. This represents an apex of exposures that together pose a real, imminent danger to healthcare organizations. These are the most accessible entry points for threat actors into a healthcare network, and are present in nearly every organization analyzed. Taking an exposure management-based approach to risk reduction yields a subset of devices that is manageable enough for organizations to prioritize actual, not theoretical, areas of risk.

Key Findings:

""Hospitals are under immense pressure to digitally transform while ensuring the security of critical systems that support patient care,"" said Ty Greenhalgh, Industry Principal for Healthcare at Claroty. ""Cybercriminals, especially ransomware groups, exploit outdated technology and insecure connectivity to gain footholds in hospital networks. To counter these threats, healthcare security leaders must take an exposure-centric approach—prioritizing the most critical vulnerabilities and aligning remediation efforts with industry guidelines like the HHS' HPH Cyber Performance Goals—to protect patient safety and ensure operational continuity.""

To access Team82's complete set of findings, in-depth analysis, and recommended security measures, download the ""State of CPS Security: Healthcare Exposures 2025"" report.

MethodologyThe ""State of CPS Security: Healthcare Exposures 2025"" report is a snapshot of the vulnerability and exposure trends to IoMT and OT devices across the healthcare sector observed and analyzed by Team82, Claroty's threat research team, and our data scientists.

Georgetown, Guyana and New York, NY, March  25, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- His Excellency Dr. Irfaan Ali, President of the Co-operative Republic of Guyana, today announced a five-year extension of the national healthcare initiative to transform Guyana's public health system with world-class healthcare services accessible to every Guyanese citizen. This next phase of the initiative, launched in 2022 by the Government of Guyana in collaboration with the Mount Sinai Health System and Hess Corporation, will include establishment of a national cancer center, continued modernization of national health facilities including Georgetown Public Hospital Corporation, and the implementation of one of the world's most advanced digital health systems. 

The continued collaboration will build on significant progress made in the first phase of the national healthcare initiative, where Mount Sinai supported the Guyana Ministry of Health in rolling out the Government's health system innovations, including over 35,000 child health screenings, the Ministry's training programs that will graduate nearly 900 nursing assistants in 2025, and a new state-of-the-art pathology lab.  

The initiative will continue to be funded jointly by Hess Corporation and the Government of Guyana and led by the Arnhold Institute for Global Health, the arm of Mount Sinai dedicated to advancing the institution's mission of delivering innovative, high-quality healthcare around the globe, and Mount Sinai International, the international ventures arm of the Mount Sinai Health System.  

Today's Signing Ceremony 

The President was joined today by Dr. Rachel Vreeman, Chair of Mount Sinai's Department of Global Health and Health System Design and Director of the Arnhold Institute for Global Health at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and John Hess, CEO of Hess Corporation, for a signing ceremony to establish the five-year extension of the national healthcare initiative.  

""The journey to world-class healthcare is not walked alone – it is built through strategic partnerships, bold investments, and a shared vision for excellence. Today, we take another decisive step toward transforming our healthcare system. By uniting the policy, expertise and resources of Hess Corporation, Mount Sinai, and Government along with our local healthcare professionals, we are shaping a future where every citizen has access to cutting-edge, compassionate, and high-quality care. Together, we are not just improving healthcare – we are redefining it,” President Ali said.  

CEO John Hess said: “We are proud to support the vision of the Government and the work of Mount Sinai to provide world class healthcare to every Guyanese citizen. Access to affordable and high-quality healthcare is central to the country's future and its commitment to building shared prosperity for the people of Guyana.” 

“At Mount Sinai, we believe global health is local health, and with the Government of Guyana and the Hess Corporation, we're building a public health system that ensures all citizens of Guyana – especially the most vulnerable – can live healthier, more productive lives,” said Dr. Brendan Carr, Chief Executive Officer, and Professor and Kenneth L. Davis, MD, Distinguished Chair of the Mount Sinai Health System. “This unique public-private partnership serves as a global model, and we are honored be part of this transformational effort.” 

“We are incredibly proud to work in partnership with the Government of Guyana to improve access to high-quality healthcare for all Guyanese,” said Dr. Vreeman. “Now, through 2030, we will continue to support and accelerate Guyana's progress to achieving a healthier country and a transformed health system, setting a new regional and global standard for modern health system development.”

The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday advanced Dr. Mehmet Oz's nomination to become administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The 14 to 13 vote was along party lines. Oz next faces a vote for confirmation before the full Senate

Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said by statement, ""Dr. Oz's years of experience as an acclaimed physician and public health advocate have prepared him well to manage the intricacies of CMS.  He will work tirelessly to deliver on the promise of much-needed change at CMS that ensures Americans receive the best care possible.""

Ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he could not support the nomination.

""During his confirmation hearing, Dr. Oz was given the chance to assure the American people that he would not be a rubber stamp for Republicans' plans to gut Medicaid and hike ACA premiums,"" Wyden said by statement. ""At every turn he failed the test. When I asked him a 'yes or no' question about whether he would protect Medicaid, he dodged and weaved and refused to answer.""

Oz appeared before the committee earlier this month. 

When Wyden pressed him for a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer on whether he would cut Medicaid, the nominee replied, ""The way you protect Medicaid is making sure it is viable at every level, which includes having enough practitioners to afford the services, paying them enough to do what you request of them, and making sure that patients are able to actually use Medicaid.""

Some Republicans have proposed reducing spending by making cuts to Medicaid. 

In 2018, Trump appointed Oz to the Presidential Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, reappointing him to the position in 2020.

In 2022, Oz ran unsuccessfully for Senate in Pennsylvania, losing to Democrat John Fetterman.

Oz is best known for daytime talk show ""The Dr. Oz Show,"" that ran for 13 seasons from 2009 through 2022, winning multiple Daytime Emmy Awards.

                        Let Healthcare Dive's free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.
                    
                
            



The decision could throw cold water on potential copycat suits seeking to hold large, self-funded employers responsible if they overpay for prescription drugs.

The litigation against Wells Fargo is the second lawsuit accusing a large, self-funded employer of failing to bring down drug costs for their workers and acting as a poor steward of their healthcare dollars in violation of ERISA.

The first, filed against pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson in February 2024, sent shockwaves through the health benefits industry as it represented a new and potentially powerful legal argument that, if successful, could force companies to take a much more active role in controlling drug costs.

However, employee plaintiffs have yet to persuade the courts. A New Jersey judge dismissed the case against J&J in January, also determining the plaintiffs lacked standing. Now, the dismissal of the Wells Fargo case throws more cold water on the possibility of other copycat suits against employers in the future.

The lawsuit against Wells Fargo claimed that the international bank mismanaged its health plan, including by paying excessive administrative fees to Express Scripts, one of the “Big Three” U.S. PBMs.

In 2022, the plan paid over $25 million in administrative fees to Express Scripts, up from $9 million in 2019 — well above fees paid by other large Express Scripts clients, and despite Express Scripts' services remaining the same and enrollment in Wells Fargo's plan actually decreasing over that time, according to the complaint.

Wells Fargo also allowed Express Scripts to retain savings it negotiated with drugmakers, and agreed to require employees to fill some prescriptions at Accredo, a specialty mail pharmacy owned by Express Scripts, despite Accredo's higher prices, the complaint alleges.

As a result, Wells Fargo members paid higher costs for drugs that they could have gotten for much lower prices. In one example laid out in the complaint, Wells Fargo employees in its plan paid almost $10,000 for a 90-unit prescription for the generic multiple sclerosis drug fingolimod — even though the same prescription could be filled without insurance for about $650 to $900 at various retail pharmacies.

However, Judge Laura Provinzino agreed with Wells Fargo that the plaintiff's alleged harm was insufficient to confer standing.

The connection between Wells Fargo's administrative fees and what plan members had to pay for drugs is “tenuous at best,” Provinzino wrote in her order dismissing the case. In addition, examples of high costs for specific drugs are an unrepresentative subset of the thousands of drugs covered in the plans' full formulary, she said.

And, the plaintiffs' entitlement to their benefits was unchanged, regardless of any mismanagement on the part of Wells Fargo.

“While compelling and detailed, Plaintiffs' allegations are simply too speculative to show concrete individual harm, too tenuous to show causation, and too conjectural to show redressability,” Provinzino wrote, though she added later that “the Court is not unsympathetic to Plaintiff's concerns” and called their frustration with prescription drug costs “understandable.”

Wells Fargo did not take issue with the facts of the case. A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment on the case's dismissal and whether the bank's relationship with Express Scripts has changed since it was filed.

Provinzino dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs can replead the case if they choose. The legal team for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication.

CareCloud (Nasdaq: CCLD) announced an expanded partnership with Alpine Ear, Nose & Throat PC, a Colorado-based otolaryngology group. Following their existing revenue cycle management (RCM) collaboration, Alpine ENT has implemented CareCloud FrontDesk Assist, a front-office solution aimed at streamlining operations.

Alpine ENT, with 24 providers across three Northern Colorado locations, reported improvements in operational efficiency since implementing FrontDesk Assist, including reduced patient wait times and streamlined appointment scheduling. The solution supports critical front-office functions such as referral management, surgery estimates, and prior authorizations.

The practice, which offers ENT services, audiology, vestibular therapy, and allergy care, has experienced measurable gains in productivity and patient engagement through this expanded partnership. FrontDesk Assist is now available nationwide to healthcare practices across all specialties.

CareCloud (Nasdaq: CCLD) ha annunciato un'alleanza ampliata con Alpine Ear, Nose & Throat PC, un gruppo di otorinolaringoiatria con sede in Colorado. A seguito della loro collaborazione esistente nella gestione del ciclo di entrate (RCM), Alpine ENT ha implementato CareCloud FrontDesk Assist, una soluzione per il front-office mirata a semplificare le operazioni.

Alpine ENT, con 24 fornitori in tre sedi nel Colorado settentrionale, ha riportato miglioramenti nell'efficienza operativa da quando ha implementato FrontDesk Assist, inclusi tempi di attesa ridotti per i pazienti e una programmazione degli appuntamenti più snella. La soluzione supporta funzioni critiche del front-office come la gestione dei rinvii, le stime per gli interventi chirurgici e le autorizzazioni preventive.

Lo studio, che offre servizi di otorinolaringoiatria, audiologia, terapia vestibolare e assistenza per le allergie, ha registrato guadagni misurabili in produttività e coinvolgimento dei pazienti grazie a questa partnership ampliata. FrontDesk Assist è ora disponibile a livello nazionale per le pratiche sanitarie di tutte le specialità.

CareCloud (Nasdaq: CCLD) anunció una asociación ampliada con Alpine Ear, Nose & Throat PC, un grupo de otorrinolaringología con sede en Colorado. Tras su colaboración existente en la gestión del ciclo de ingresos (RCM), Alpine ENT ha implementado CareCloud FrontDesk Assist, una solución de oficina frontal destinada a optimizar las operaciones.

Alpine ENT, con 24 proveedores en tres ubicaciones del norte de Colorado, informó mejoras en la eficiencia operativa desde la implementación de FrontDesk Assist, incluyendo tiempos de espera reducidos para los pacientes y una programación de citas más fluida. La solución apoya funciones críticas de la oficina frontal, como la gestión de referencias, estimaciones de cirugía y autorizaciones previas.

La práctica, que ofrece servicios de otorrinolaringología, audiología, terapia vestibular y atención de alergias, ha experimentado aumentos medibles en productividad y compromiso de los pacientes a través de esta asociación ampliada. FrontDesk Assist ahora está disponible a nivel nacional para prácticas de atención médica en todas las especialidades.

CareCloud (Nasdaq: CCLD)는 콜로라도에 본사를 둔 이비인후과 그룹인 Alpine Ear, Nose & Throat PC와의 파트너십을 확대한다고 발표했습니다. 기존의 수익 주기 관리(RCM) 협력에 이어, Alpine ENT는 운영 효율성을 간소화하기 위한 프론트 오피스 솔루션인 CareCloud FrontDesk Assist를 구현했습니다.

세 곳의 북부 콜로라도 위치에 24명의 제공자가 있는 Alpine ENT는 FrontDesk Assist를 구현한 이후 운영 효율성에서 개선을 보고했으며, 환자 대기 시간이 단축되고 약속 일정이 간소화되었습니다. 이 솔루션은 의뢰 관리, 수술 견적 및 사전 승인과 같은 중요한 프론트 오피스 기능을 지원합니다.

이 비즈니스는 이비인후과 서비스, 청각학, 전정 치료 및 알레르기 치료를 제공하며, 이 확장된 파트너십을 통해 생산성과 환자 참여에서 측정 가능한 이익을 경험했습니다. FrontDesk Assist는 이제 모든 전문 분야의 의료 관행에 대해 전국적으로 제공됩니다.

CareCloud (Nasdaq: CCLD) a annoncé un partenariat élargi avec Alpine Ear, Nose & Throat PC, un groupe d'oto-rhino-laryngologie basé au Colorado. Suite à leur collaboration existante en gestion du cycle de revenus (RCM), Alpine ENT a mis en œuvre CareCloud FrontDesk Assist, une solution de front-office visant à rationaliser les opérations.

Alpine ENT, avec 24 prestataires répartis sur trois sites dans le Colorado nord, a signalé des améliorations de l'efficacité opérationnelle depuis la mise en œuvre de FrontDesk Assist, notamment des temps d'attente réduits pour les patients et une planification des rendez-vous simplifiée. La solution soutient des fonctions critiques du front-office telles que la gestion des références, les estimations chirurgicales et les autorisations préalables.

Le cabinet, qui propose des services ORL, de l'audiologie, de la thérapie vestibulaire et des soins allergiques, a connu des gains mesurables en productivité et en engagement des patients grâce à ce partenariat élargi. FrontDesk Assist est désormais disponible à l'échelle nationale pour les pratiques de santé de toutes spécialités.

CareCloud (Nasdaq: CCLD) hat eine erweiterte Partnerschaft mit Alpine Ear, Nose & Throat PC, einer auf Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Heilkunde spezialisierten Gruppe aus Colorado, bekannt gegeben. Nach ihrer bestehenden Zusammenarbeit im Bereich des Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) hat Alpine ENT CareCloud FrontDesk Assist implementiert, eine Lösung für den Empfang, die darauf abzielt, die Abläufe zu optimieren.

Alpine ENT, mit 24 Anbietern an drei Standorten in Nordcolorado, berichtete von Verbesserungen in der betrieblichen Effizienz seit der Implementierung von FrontDesk Assist, darunter verkürzte Wartezeiten für Patienten und eine optimierte Terminplanung. Die Lösung unterstützt wichtige Funktionen im Empfangsbereich wie die Verwaltung von Überweisungen, Operationsschätzungen und vorherige Genehmigungen.

Die Praxis, die HNO-Dienste, Audiologie, vestibuläre Therapie und Allergiebehandlung anbietet, hat durch diese erweiterte Partnerschaft messbare Fortschritte in der Produktivität und Patientenbindung erzielt. FrontDesk Assist ist nun landesweit für medizinische Praxen aller Fachrichtungen verfügbar.

CareCloud's expanded partnership with Alpine ENT demonstrates effective cross-selling capabilities within their existing client base—a positive indicator for their expansion strategy. After successfully providing revenue cycle management services, CareCloud has now implemented their FrontDesk Assist solution, which handles front-office functions like appointment scheduling and prior authorizations.

The implementation at Alpine ENT—a practice with 24 providers across three locations—represents incremental growth through existing relationship expansion rather than a completely new partnership acquisition. This suggests CareCloud's platform is delivering measurable value, as evidenced by Alpine's CEO reporting tangible improvements in operational efficiency.

While positive, this announcement lacks financial specifics or metrics regarding the deal size or revenue impact. For a company with a $68.1 million market cap, individual client expansions like this likely represent modest growth drivers rather than transformative developments. The successful implementation does, however, provide CareCloud with a valuable reference case that could accelerate sales cycles with similar medical practices.

The expansion demonstrates CareCloud's platform strategy is working as intended—starting with core RCM services and expanding into adjacent operational functions—but represents business-as-usual execution rather than a significant new business direction or major contract win that would materially alter the company's financial trajectory.

SOMERSET, N.J., March  26, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CareCloud, Inc. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq: CCLD, CCLDO), a leading provider of healthcare technology and AI-powered revenue cycle management (RCM) solutions, today announced the expanded adoption of its services by Alpine Ear, Nose & Throat PC, a premier otolaryngology group based in Colorado. Following a successful RCM engagement, Alpine ENT has now implemented CareCloud FrontDesk Assist—a comprehensive front-office solution designed to streamline operations and enhance patient satisfaction.

“CareCloud has proven to be a true partner in optimizing our practice,” said Mike Heck, CEO of Alpine ENT. “Since deploying FrontDesk Assist, we've seen tangible improvements across our front-desk operations. Patient wait times are shorter, appointment scheduling is smoother, and our staff now spends far less time on administrative tasks.”

FrontDesk Assist now supports Alpine ENT with critical front-office functions such as appointment scheduling, referral management, surgery estimates, and prior authorizations. These services complement the existing RCM partnership by boosting operational efficiency and freeing up clinical staff to focus more on patient care.

With 24 providers across three Northern Colorado locations, Alpine ENT delivers a full spectrum of ENT services, including audiology, vestibular therapy, and allergy care. Since implementing FrontDesk Assist, the practice has experienced measurable gains in productivity and patient engagement—underscoring a mutual commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and care quality.

“Alpine ENT's decision to expand our collaboration speaks to the trust they place in CareCloud's expertise and solutions,” said Crystal Williams, President of CareCloud. “With FrontDesk Assist, they gain a seamlessly integrated platform that drives both financial and patient-centered outcomes. Our mission is to simplify practice operations so providers can focus on delivering exceptional care.”

This partnership expansion reinforces CareCloud's dedication to delivering scalable, tech-enabled solutions that help healthcare organizations thrive amid industry transformation. FrontDesk Assist is now available nationwide to healthcare practices of all specialties—including the thousands already using CareCloud's EHR and RCM platforms.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=healthcare+news","UK Bishop: Patients deserve access to safe healthcare, not suggestions to commit suicide","https://angelusnews.com/news/world/uk-sherrington-assisted-dying/","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 16:02:01 GMT","

Bishop John Sherrington is the Lead Bishop for Life Issues in England and Wales.

As the United Kingdom's Parliament fast approaches the final vote on a law for legalizing “assisted dying” – which critics points out is allowing doctors to help patients commit suicide, Sherrington called on the British people to contact their representatives in Parliament to oppose the Bill.

When the Bill was first voted on, it included a promise of several supposed “safeguards” – including limiting it for those suffering great pain and requiring a judge to approve it. However, most of these have been removed from the Bill as it reaches its final stage.

Sherrington replied to Crux about the Bill, saying there are “too many unanswered questions” about the Bill even for supporters of assisted suicide, and it shouldn't be passed.

The bishop also said the Church supports palliative care for those approaching death, and that is where the government should be improving peoples' lives in their final stages.

What follows is the full interview with Sherrington.

Crux: During the discussions on the proposal for “assisted death” it looks like the ultimate High Court Judge safeguard will be removed. What is your reaction to this?

Sherrington: I am interested that you use the term ‘assisted death' which you rightly place in inverted commas. During the present debate, the bishops have used the term ‘assisted suicide' for very good reasons. ‘Assisted death' or ‘assisted dying' are words used by the proponents of this Bill. They are euphemistic and try to obscure the reality of the Bill, which will permit a medic to assist the suicide of a person when they desire it under specific conditions. This is presently prohibited in the law which protects the most vulnerable.

There is an amendment before Parliament which removes the role of the High Court Judge. The amendment talks of review by a psychiatrist, a social worker and a lawyer. How adequately can this review be made? The facts that need to be considered are the medical condition, the freedom from coercion, and compliance with the law. I am fearful that the removal of the so-called safeguard of the High Court Judge further erodes the safety of the Bill. How can we be sure that this “panel of experts” has the knowledge particular to each person who is requesting assisted suicide? Will there be an appeal against a view of the panel? What are the costs of such a policy and how will it be funded? I am fearful that this proposal will divert resources from an already stretched NHS [UK's National Health Service] and further limit scarce resources for good palliative care.

This panel will not take decisions in the same way as a judge. It is highly likely that the “experts” will favor assisted suicide as a matter of principle so that they can participate. There are too many unanswered questions for a matter as important as this. I therefore stand firm in my belief that the Bill is unsafe and that there is a danger of coercion and control of vulnerable people.

The Assisted Suicide Committee voted against pain being added as a qualifying criteria – for many supporters, this was the chief reason to back the Bill. How would this – being assisted in suicide for depression, anxiety, or even for fearing the financial burden it might place on your family – affect things in Britain?

Regardless of the initial criteria under which assisted suicide is permissible, evidence from other jurisdictions strongly suggests that they will be rapidly loosened. We can think for example of the widened application in Canada and Belgium. In Canada, one in twenty deaths are from assisted suicide.

Your question raises concerns about a number of mental health issues which might lead people to request assisted suicide. The knowledge and treatment of mental health issues has increased rapidly in recent years and we are now more sensitive to the reality of these illnesses. Slowly the stigma associated with them is breaking down. Such challenges call for help in life, treatment and care rather than death. The Bill has promised that freedom will be needed to end one's life. These mental health issues reduce human freedom and make me more fearful about the danger of coercion of highly vulnerable people. We need to help people live with these illnesses in the best possible way.

You mention the fear of being a financial burden to the family. There are wider questions of how health and social care is funded at the end of life which go far beyond this present debate. These are questions for further political and social debate which not be short-circuited by this particular Bill. Catholic social teaching can help in this future debate.

It is important to distinguish between pain and suffering. Palliative care has led to major advances in the pain control of symptoms. This care needs to be more widely available to people. Experts in palliative care also speak of emotional pain, and spiritual or ‘soul' pain. These can be relieved by holistic professional and spiritual care. Often listening and allowing a person to tell their story leads to healing and reconciliation with the past. People carry within their hearts and bodies the pain of unresolved conflicts, relationship breakdowns and trauma. Good holistic care can assist a person live with and through these challenges.

Suffering is a complex theme which is part of the human condition. It is idealistic to think of life without suffering. The question of why the innocent suffer has been at the heart of philosophical and theological debate over the centuries. This becomes even more crucial when we deal with assisted suicide because what is proposed here is the termination of human life. If we do that, we deny ourselves the chance to respond to suffering in a truly humane way, in the fullness of freedom and love. Suffering needs to be addressed compassionately in a safe and loving environment. This is the project Dame Cecily Saunders began with the modern hospice movement, inspired by Christian values. A holistic palliative care approach, which incorporates not only the alleviation of physical pain, but also personal accompaniment, spiritual and physical guidance, friendship and care is the right and humane answer to pain.

As a Catholic bishop, I recognize the resources that the Catholic Church brings to sick people; the sacrament of the sick, viaticum, and the importance of prayer for the dying. Catholic chaplains and other chaplains and faith advisors help people in hospitals and hospices and their contribution to the debate cannot be underestimated.

How does the Church deal with people suffering, and with painful deaths? Shouldn't people avoid it if they are given the opportunity?

The Church continues the mission of Jesus Christ who healed the sick and freed people from the burden of sin. The Lord Jesus healed, performed miracles, and sent His disciples to do the same. This approach to care has been driving the Church's mission since its foundations and has seen the Church striving to found hospitals and clinics, alleviate suffering in the world and to be close to those who are vulnerable, suffering, and sick. Medicine treats illness and alleviates pain. The Church is the largest non-government provider of healthcare worldwide and Christian hospices in Britain are widely admired.

In her wisdom, in a tradition forged since medical advances in the sixteenth centuries, the Church recognizes there are “limits to treatment,” which we can accept. We do not suggest that people should be kept alive at all costs by what we describe as “extraordinary means.” There comes a point when a person, because of their underlying condition, may refuse further treatment and accept care which respects the dignity of the human person. This is the alleviation of suffering in its true meaning, not its elimination, which is what assisted suicide seeks to obtain. A person may exercise his or her autonomy about treatment but not intend to end their life prematurely and deliberately.

Recently, the press had a lot of news about the use of “buffer zones” around abortion clinics in the UK. Does the move to legalize assisted suicide show a different attitude towards life-and-death in Britain?

There is always a danger in conflating issues but what links these two subjects is the high value placed on personal autonomy and the need to protect personal choice.

While autonomy is an important value, it is only part of the understanding of the human person who has dignity and is relational. It is impossible to assert personal autonomy without first recognizing the unique value and dignity of human life, which begins at conception and ends with natural death. That is why it is wrong that personal autonomy overrides the life of the child in the womb whose dignity is not respected. This approach also fails to recognize the reality that humans are relational beings who live in the world through their relationships with others, with emotions, affections and love. These bond them to other human beings and the whole of creation. Every action of a person touches and affects others, often in unknown ways.

Both these laws overly value personal autonomy and do not consider the wider implications on other human lives. The use of buffer-zones was considered necessary by parliamentarians to protect women who chose to seek an abortion. Women were already protected by laws against harassment and coercion. The presence of others praying or handing out leaflets to offer an alternative was rejected. I fear that the assisted suicide legislation will not adequately protect the right to conscientious objection or freedom from referral to another doctor which further erodes a view which rejects such legislation. While some protection is given for doctors, what about all the other healthcare professionals who work in multidisciplinary teams caring for people at the end of life. They too deserve freedom of conscience.

How would assisted suicide affect the relationship between doctors and patients?

Doctors commit themselves to healing and saving lives. The Greek foundations of medicine led to the Hippocratic Oath which promised to heal and not do harm to a patient. This principle has governed medical practice until the last sixty years when the focus becomes autonomy and choice, especially about the future of the life of the unborn child. Christian healthcare professionals take inspiration from the life of Jesus Christ who healed the sick.

Good communication between the patient and the doctor requires the building of trust. In fact, recent cases of medical mismanagement and doing harm show the vulnerability of the patient who entrusts himself or herself to the professionalism of the physician. Language challenges, and the pressure under which the health service operates, can weaken the relationship which is needed between the doctor and the patient. The danger of this Bill is that people may be anxious about whether the doctor really cares for their healing and whether they can trust the physician.

This radical change in law, which crosses a watershed, will fundamentally alter the relationship between doctors and patients which could, in turn, have a detrimental impact on the whole of healthcare provision. This might cause some people to fear using healthcare – especially the elderly and vulnerable. The possibility for doctors to suggest assisted suicide as well as the duty of referral, which infringes the right to conscientiously object, would put a strain even on the relationship between doctors who oppose assisted suicide, and their patients. Instead, patients deserve access to safe healthcare, and doctors who are able to perform their role as caregivers and guardians of human dignity.

Thank you for the opportunity to answer these questions, As a final point, it is the duty of every MP to ensure that any proposed change in legislation has sufficient time for debate and full examination of its implications. I do not consider that this Bill has had sufficient time for debate and scrutiny, as it has been a Private Members' Bill, and so I believe it should be rejected outright.

'Everybody will be in the game'","https://sports.yahoo.com/college-basketball/article/could-impending-rev-share-changes-help-cinderellas-in-the-future-everybody-will-be-in-the-game-130005097.html","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 15:27:50 GMT","

During the NCAA tournament's opening weekend, five power conference teams punched their proverbial tickets to the Sweet 16 with wins over so-called “mid-majors.”

Top-seeded Florida survived a scare from two-time defending national champion UConn; Auburn outlasted Creighton; Arkansas upset St. John's; Alabama cruised past Saint Mary's; and Houston beat Gonzaga.

By most accounts, four of those five power league programs spent more on their rosters than their mid-major opponents, in some cases by as much as $2 million. The outlier is UConn.

But perhaps, soon enough, the mid-majors will be the ones with the bigger basketball budgets.

No, really.

“In the Big East,” says Duke athletic director Nina King, “their basketball revenue-share portion will be a lot more than what those of us can do who have Division I power football programs.”

As the college athletics industry sits on the brink of historic change — schools can share revenue directly with athletes starting this summer — an unexpected spending disparity looms as a byproduct of the new revenue-sharing rules. Mid-major programs — operating without having to invest in a power conference football team — are expected to, in some cases, outspend their football-focused big brothers in men's basketball.

The spending issue looms as a serious enough threat that it has emerged as a critical discussion point and agenda item within power league administrative meetings in the SEC, Big Ten, ACC and Big 12 — something SEC commissioner Greg Sankey and other high-ranking officials acknowledged this month in interviews with Yahoo Sports.

As the NCAA tournament's second weekend arrives, the potential spending disparity is at the forefront of many minds.

“People have raised the issue with me and they are raising it more frequently right now,” Sankey said last week. “It's something we are having conversations about at every meeting. I'm confident in our schools' ability to compete, but it does raise a set of questions.”

Under college sports' new revenue-sharing rules, schools will be permitted to distribute a pool of revenue to athletes up to an annual, escalating cap ($20.5 million in Year 1). Power league programs are gearing up to spend the majority of that revenue pool allotment — as much as $13 million to $16 million — on their revenue-generating giant of football, a move to remain competitive in the industry's self-proclaimed “cash cow.”

For most power programs, that leaves roughly $2 million to $4 million to be directly shared with men's basketball.

But for those fellow Division I schools without a football program, or one that competes in FCS or even at the Group of Six level, flexibility exists to heavily invest in a singular sport with the goal of qualifying and winning one of America's most popular events: the NCAA men's basketball tournament.

“Big East schools next year can pay $6 million or more to their basketball team,” said Houston athletic director Eddie Nunez, “and that's a game-changer.”

As many as a dozen non-power league Division I schools — many of them in the Big East — are planning to spend at least $5 million on their men's basketball roster next year, with a smaller group hoping to reach the $6 million and $7 million marks, those with knowledge of the plans told Yahoo Sports.

To keep up, power conference schools may need to circumvent the new rev-share pool cap by orchestrating third-party and booster-backed name, image and likeness deals for athletes — essentially violating what the NCAA's own attorney describes as the “central part” of the landmark House settlement agreement: prohibiting booster pay.

“I know our coaches are worried. They've openly talked about it,” Kansas State athletic director Gene Taylor said. “That's where the rumors start to fly about circumventing the cap. Are we going to go back under the table again?”

Last week, before his team's first game of the NCAA tournament, Maryland coach Kevin Willard used a news conference to voice his frustration over the school's investment in its roster.

While being courted for the head job at Villanova, Willard bemoaned Maryland's NIL roster spending over the previous two years and seemed to also object to the school's revenue-sharing plans next year. The school announced earlier this spring that it plans to share $14 million with football and $4 million with its men's basketball roster in 2025-26 — believed to be the second-highest basketball pool in the Big Ten and likely top 10 nationally among power conference programs.

However, at Villanova — a school without a Big Ten football program — Willard stands to get as much or more than $6 million in roster revenue-share.

“Power schools are going to do what they need to do to remain competitive in football,” said Todd Schumaker, a sports law attorney at Church Church Hittle + Antrim and a former NCAA investigator. “March Madness is great but all of the dollars are with the football playoff. After football, you then figure out what's left for basketball.”

Most power conference athletic directors plan to distribute the funds based on the revenue that a sport generates — a way to reward the athletes producing the cash while also providing a legal argument (perhaps a failed one) against any future Title IX lawsuits.

The most common formula is 70%-85% to football, 10%-20% to men's basketball and the final 10%-15% to other sports. The distribution formula is generating strife among a school's own coaches, each arguing for more of the revenue-share pie, especially at those blue-blood basketball programs such as Duke, Kansas and North Carolina.

Even at those traditional rich hoops schools, football still drives much of the revenue from conference television contracts, said KU athletic director Travis Goff. His coaches believe the approach is rational and understand “where we're at and where we're trying to go,” he said.

“At a place where football matters, we can't justify $7-9 million to be shared with basketball,” Goff said, “but we do think we have some innate advantages at Kansas. Coaching, culture, institutional brand, fan base, facilities, they will all move the needle.”

At Duke, King is juggling three programs she says are generating “positive momentum.” The football program has won at least eight games three consecutive seasons and the men's and women's basketball teams both advanced to the Sweet 16 as No. 1 and 2 seeds, respectively.

All three head coaches have made “compromises” on their revenue-share requests, King says without revealing the exact distribution formula.

“It's been a delicate balancing act,” she said.

It's made more difficult by the current college sports landscape, where football success is the most significant driver of the industry's future related to conference realignment, new television contracts, sponsorships, ticket sales and any other serious revenue-generating concept.

Take for instance the basketball powers shifting investment to the pigskin. Indiana is paying its head football coach $8 million a year; Kansas is spending nearly $500 million in football stadium renovations; and North Carolina made the audacious hire of Bill Belichick, with its athletic director, Bubba Cunningham, specifically noting a “demonstration” and “commitment” to the sport.

Many administrators live in fear of their school being left behind during the industry's next great splintering — a presumptive realignment shift to a smaller, more consolidated group of programs likely coming after 2030.

Football, most of them believe, will be the primary driver of such a split.

“Our whole governance model is based on one sport,” said one Big 12 athletic director. “If you want to be a basketball-only school, you're going to end up in the West Coast Conference.”

Within Big East meeting rooms, a very different conversation is happening: Focus on basketball.

Though Big East budgets are a fraction of those in the power leagues — their schools earn $4 million to $5 million annually in conference distribution compared to $40 million-plus in the P4 — Big East members are financially strong enough, with donations, university subsidies and basketball revenues, to share a portion of the $20.5 million.

“Everybody will be in the game — that's my prediction,” said Val Ackerman, commissioner of the Big East.

Ackerman declined to get specific on financial figures, but those with knowledge of the spending expect many within the conference — UConn, St. John's, Villanova, Creighton, perhaps even Marquette, Georgetown and others — to support men's basketball with at least $5 million of revenue-share funding.

There are other programs in Division I outside of the Big East to worry about, too. What about Gonzaga and VCU? There's also Memphis, one of several Group of Six programs whose rev-share budget could reach Big East standards.

“It's kind of interesting from my seat,” said Jeff Jackson, the commissioner of the Missouri Valley Conference. “I don't have a whole lot of empathy for the A4's financial concerns. Welcome to our world.”

Though he declined to comment on his distribution plan, UConn athletic director David Benedict believes that “at minimum” schools need $5 million for a men's roster, $1 million to $2 million for a women's roster and in the “neighborhood of $5 million” for a Group of Six football roster. Such figures, he believes, will put those teams near the top of their respective sports in the revenue-share era.

“We are going to do everything we can within the structure to continue to compete for championships,” he said. “If that's something that scares other people, I'm not sure what to say.”

Ackerman, too, has heard about the “nervousness” within power leagues.

Her response? “We are flattered by the respect they seem to hold for the Big East and we will live up to that,” she deadpanned. “We have the ingredients to keep this going. We don't have their revenue base. Football money goes a long way with other sports. But basketball is less expensive. We are going to have what we need to stay in the top tier of college basketball.”

That figure — to remain atop college basketball — has been escalating now for three years, school administrators and general managers tell Yahoo Sports.

To be a top-25 spending program last season, perhaps $2.5 million to $3 million was needed for a basketball roster. To be a top-25 program this season, as much as $5 million was necessary. In fact, according to estimates within the SEC — which qualified an NCAA-record 14 teams into the NCAA men's tournament — roughly half of the conference spent at least $5 million on their roster.

This poses a legitimate problem in the new revenue-share era. Without circumventing the pool cap, that figure will drop significantly next year.

“No one wants to go backwards,” said one SEC school administrator. “We're having to frontload now and get creative with new sources of revenue.”

To avoid a decrease in player payments and to compete with the Big East revenue-share numbers for next year, many SEC schools, as well as others across the country, are “frontloading” contracts — designing booster-backed NIL deals in a way that distributes to athletes a majority of the compensation before they become subject to the new enforcement entity.

Deals with payments after June 30 are subject to a new Deloitte-run NIL clearinghouse that is expected to heavily scrutinize and potentially prohibit the booster deals that for years now have been disguised as NIL contracts. The legality of the clearinghouse remains a question — it could trigger legal challenges — but, either way, many school-affiliated collectives are funneling millions of dollars to players before the July 1 implementation date.

Frontloading is just a one-year fix, however.

How will power league basketball programs compete with the Big East spending in Year 2 and beyond?

“It's a problem,” said an SEC athletic director. “Villanova and St. John's can pour $10 million into basketball if they want. The SEC isn't going to be able to do that because we cannot sacrifice the cash cow of football.”

In a twist of irony, the very thing power conference leaders designed — this new, cap-based enforcement arm to police booster deals — stands in the way.

Those in the Big East are rooting for the clearinghouse to work, though they aren't necessarily optimistic. They expect power leagues to test the clearinghouse's fair market value system and the compensation range that Deloitte has created to determine if third-party deals are kosher.

“If it has teeth, the Big East is going to be positioned extremely well,” said one of the conference's athletic directors. “That's what we are praying for.”

While plenty of questions remain as it relates to college athletics' new enforcement entity, some answers have been unearthed over the last few weeks.

Deloitte is using thousands of previously struck NIL deals of college and NFL players in developing a “compensation range” to determine if deals are authentic. In a plan under discussion, athletes can resubmit rejected deals at least once with alterations suggested by the clearinghouse.

For example, if Deloitte deems a submitted $100,000 deal between an athlete and third party to actually be valued at $50,000, the player can alter the deal to align with the clearinghouse's suggested figure. Deals rejected for a second time are referred to the CEO and enforcement staff and are then processed through an appeals system via court-overseen arbitration.

From a recruiting standpoint, this is all very tricky.

Many power conference programs are recruiting with the expectation that they will supplement their revenue-sharing amounts with third-party NIL deals, promising a player a certain amount in rev-share plus an amount from outside NIL. However, those outside deals aren't guaranteed dollars.

Those in the Big East, meanwhile, are able to offer guaranteed school payments.

“Those deals are not received the same way,” said one college basketball general manager.

Jim Boeheim, the former Syracuse basketball coach-turned-television analyst, does not believe the power conferences will struggle to contend in basketball roster spending, because he doesn't trust that the clearinghouse will survive legal challenges.

“That's why the NIL collectives are still in play,” he said. “Players are making $500,000-$1 million now for basically doing nothing (no NIL activities). They're going to take that ait'sway? A player whose deal is rejected is going to go to court and win.”

The potential spending disparity in basketball plays out against the backdrop of ongoing negotiations over the future of NCAA governance and control of the NCAA's championships.

Earlier this spring, the SEC authored a proposed NCAA governance model that would grant the four power leagues more control of rule-making and legislative decisions. In a more significant move, the model would also give the SEC, Big Ten, ACC and Big 12 more influence and management of postseason championships, most notably overseeing access and revenue distribution of the men's basketball tournament.

Are these two elements — NCAA governance/championship control and revenue-share disparities with mid-majors — related? Some believe that the NCAA tournament's future — a change to the revenue-distribution structure, automatic qualifying spots or expansion — directly correlates with the potential disparity in basketball revenue-share spending.

Sankey, however, told Yahoo Sports that the spending disparity is not a “driver at this point,” but “we have to pay attention to how this revenue sharing plays out and where its impacts reside. That includes how we make decisions.”

An 18-person committee, of which Sankey is a member, has twice met over the future of NCAA governance and championships. The committee is tasked with completing its work by July 1.

Many believe that the power conferences will use their influence to alter governance and championships as a way to combat any basketball spending disparity.

“What does our future state of being look like that might allow a non-FBS school to outspend [a power conference school] in basketball?” asked one Division I conference commissioner. “I don't think that future is going to exist. They have the control and they're going to stop that from happening.”

For instance, even before the settlement's approval, there is discussion of changing the revenue-sharing rules as soon as Year 2 of the settlement, according to those familiar with the talks. As it stands now, a school's revenue-share pool is reduced by the cost of the scholarships in which they add, up to $2.5 million.

At the highest level, officials are discussing a potential request to have the $2.5 million reduction eliminated from the terms, freeing up extra cash in a cap that already will escalate with each year.

“Imagine a world where Villanova or St. John's has more money to spend on a sport than Texas or Ohio State? When in history could you imagine that happening?” asked one non-FBS general manager. “They are going to find ways to do it.”

Or, are they?

Some power conference programs plan to spend as little as $2.5 million on their men's basketball roster because of a football-heavy distribution formula. They would need $4 million in third-party NIL for a 15-man basketball roster to reach the upper echelon of Big East spending.

“There's not enough real NIL deals,” quipped one Big Ten athletic director, “for even North Carolina to do that.”","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

No matter what happens in Thursday's Sweet 16 showdown with No. 2 seed Alabama, BYU athletics is in the midst of a golden run. If the Cougars were a publicly traded company and you had bought their stock a few years ago, you'd be able to retire.

In seven months the Cougars have made national headlines in football, basketball, track, cross-country and the Olympic Games. Their latest victories came in last week's NCAA Tournament, when the Cougars dispatched VCU and Wisconsin.

Things weren't looking so good for the basketball team the first two-and-half months of the season. They were 11-6 in mid-January, and five of those wins came against nonconference hors d'oeuvres — Central Arkansas, UC Riverside, Queens University, Idaho and Mississippi Valley State. The Cougars began conference play by losing four of six games.

Since then they have won 15 of 18 games, climbed to No. 17 in the national rankings, and won two games in the NCAA Tournament to advance to the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2011 and only the third time in the modern era.

All of this comes on the heels of a football season in which BYU won 11 of 13 games and finished No. 13 in the final poll, clobbering Colorado in the Alamo Bowl. They were unbeaten through their first nine games and climbed to No. 7 in the AP rankings before losing two games by four and five points.

Only four schools who made the Sweet 16 also finished in the top 25 of the national football polls — BYU, Tennessee, Ole Miss, Alabama.

While the football team was rolling, BYU won both the men's and women's NCAA cross-country championships, becoming only the fifth school ever to pull off the double.

This was preceded by a summer in which seven current or former BYU distance runners qualified for the Paris Olympics Games — the highest total by any school in the country. Kenneth Rooks won the silver medal, and Conner Mantz and Clayton Young claimed top-10 finishes in the marathon. The women's track team finished ninth in the recent NCAA indoor championships and alumnus Whitney Morgan placed fourth in the world track championships.

These are heady times for the Cougars. There is perhaps only one school year that surpasses it for across-the-board success: 1980-81.

In 1980, BYU lost its season opener on the football field (by four points to New Mexico), then won 12 straight. The season concluded with the famous 46-45 “Miracle Bowl” win over SMU, in which the Cougars overcame a 20-point deficit in the final four minutes, scoring on a 41-yard pass on the final play. The Cougars finished No. 11 in the national polls.

This was followed by a basketball season that was much the same story, including another miraculous and now mythical finish. The Cougars, who featured three future NBA players, won 25 of 32 games and beat Notre Dame in the Sweet 16 after Danny Ainge weaved through defenders the length of the court for a layup at the buzzer. The Cougars finished No. 16 in the rankings.

It was the year of Danny Ainge and Jim McMahon, still the best basketball and football players ever to play for the school. Ainge was named national player of the year, averaging almost 25 points per game, and finished with a career total of 2,467 points (this was before the creation of a 3-point shot). McMahon threw for 5,017 yards and 51 touchdowns and was named first-team All-American. Ainge and McMahon went on to win NBA championships and a Super Bowl.

While Ainge was leading the BYU men, Tina Gunn was helping the women's team win 24 games and leading the nation in scoring. She became the school's all-time scoring leader with 2,759 points (again, without the 3-point shot).

That spring the golf team won the NCAA championships, and the baseball team won 46 games. Wally Joyner and Rick Aguilera went on to become all-stars in the Major Leagues.

It was a rare moment when multiple sports ranked among the best in the nation in the same year. Forty-four years later it has happened again.","{'href': 'https://www.deseret.com', 'title': 'Deseret News'}"

Hey there! The men's international break came to a dramatic close on Tuesday with Argentina's big win over Brazil, while the U.S. women's national team are gearing up for their next international window with a roster drop. I'm Pardeep Cattry with the latest.

No Lionel Messi, no problem for Argentina – the reigning world champions collected a 4-1 win over Brazil on Tuesday, the day they also booked their place at the 2026 World Cup. Julian Alvarez and Enzo Fernandez ensured Argentina would have a 2-0 by the 12th minute and though Matheus Cunha clawed one back with a goal in the 26th minute, goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Giuliano Simeone ensured the hosts would come out with a commanding win.

Argentina end this month's international break with an eight point lead over second place Ecuador and qualified for the World Cup with five games to spare, a testament to the success of their qualification campaign. Though Messi leads CONMEBOL's qualifying competition with six goals so far, manager Lionel Scaloni has been able to test out what this time looks like without the 37-year-old and the results have been fairly impressive, and Chuck Booth notes that Tuesday's win was emblematic of those efforts.

As for Brazil, they end the month in fourth place, nestled inside the top six spots that ensure automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup. They are six points ahead of seventh place Venezuela, who sit in a playoff spot, and seven ahead of eighth place Bolivia, so a spot in next year's competition still feels likely, but how well they will do there remains a big question. For all their attacking talent on the pitch on Tuesday, with Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Raphinha all getting the start, they took just three shots against Argentina and Cunha's goal was their only attempt on target.

Argentina are one of four non-host nations so far to book a trip to the 2026 World Cup, with Japan, New Zealand and Iran also earning their place during this month's international window. As things stand, 41 spots are still up for grabs at the first-ever 48 team edition of the World Cup.

Trinity Rodman will return to the U.S. women's national team for the first time since last summer's Olympic Games, joining the group for next month's friendlies against Brazil. She's one of the more experienced players on a roster full of relative newcomers as head coach Emma Hayes continues a period of experimentation as the long road to the 2027 Women's World Cup continues.

Here's a look at the roster in full.

Hayes will work with 11 players who have 10 or fewer international appearances including goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce and defender Avery Patterson, who could earn their first caps during this camp. Defender Alana Cook and forward Ashley Hatch, meanwhile, could earn their first minutes since Hayes took the job, demonstrating the head coach's continuing efforts to widen the player pool as much as possible. That effort also includes working alongside the U-23 USWNT, who will run a camp concurrently with the senior team that is similar to the Futures camp that took place during January.

As Hayes continues to tinker with fresh faces and new ideas, the goalkeeper position remains an area of focus after Alyssa Naeher's international retirement at the end of 2024. Hayes has stuck to the group she brought along for the SheBelieves Cup and previously targeted this June as a time when she hopes to lock in her choice as the USWNT's new starter, meaning the pressure's on to make the most of their opportunities both at the club level and with the national team.

The USWNT will first play Brazil on April 5 at SoFi Stadium, where the grass fields used for the Concacaf Nations League will stay in place, before a second game against the 2027 World Cup hosts on April 8 at PayPal Park in San Jose.

Summary: Gonzalez is a high-motor wing with great defensive tools and a slashing style on offense. If his jumper and handle develop, he could be a versatile two-way starter. But he barely even played off the bench overseas.

Comparisons: Josh Green, Wesley Johnson

Defense: Gonzalez regularly makes second and third efforts on defense, rotating over to the paint to help contain an attacker, then hustling back to the perimeter to corral another possible scorer. With his athleticism, awareness, and intensity, he has all the tools to someday be a highly versatile defender both on and off the ball.

Finishing: Solid at-rim finisher who can score athletically when he has space to launch, coming off of both cuts and self-created straight-line drives. He also was asked to create shots out of ball screens for the Spanish national team, showing a feel for splitting pick-and-rolls.

Shooting upside: He made 27.2% of his 3s in three years combined in the Real Madrid system and for the Spanish youth national team, per Real GM. But he has solid form and made 77.6% of his free throws, an encouraging sign for his potential to become a plus-shooter.

Ball-handling: Hasn't shown much ability to generate shots for himself or others. He lacks a midrange pull-up or much wiggle to get to the rim. He has a good but not great first step as well.

Experience: Gonzalez barely played this past season for Real Madrid, logging a hair over 10 minutes per game. Young players often don't get minutes for such a talented team in such a high-level league.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

Liam Lawson has failed to score points in the first two races of the season 

Red Bull have delivered one of the most ruthless driver moves in F1 history after deciding to drop Liam Lawson after just two races. 

The 23-year-old New Zealander will swap places with Japanese driver Yuki Tsunoda and return to Red Bull's second team, Racing Bulls, from the next race in Japan in a week's time. 

The decision was reached by Red Bull bosses, including team principal Christian Horner, at a meeting in Dubai on Monday, insiders have told BBC Sport.

It is expected to be formally confirmed later this week by Red Bull, who refused to comment.

Red Bull have long been renowned for the ruthlessness with which they handle their young driver programme.

Even in that context, the way they have dealt with Lawson has caused widespread disbelief in Formula 1.

The move, first confirmed by Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, comes after a dire start to Lawson's Red Bull career.

Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions

The New Zealander qualified 18th at the opening race of the season in Australia, before crashing out of the race in the rain.

In China last weekend, he qualified last for both the sprint and the grand prix, and finished the two races 14th and 12th. 

His average qualifying deficit to team-mate Verstappen has been 0.88 seconds. Verstappen finished second in Australia, third in the sprint in Shanghai and fourth in the Chinese Grand Prix.

Japanese driver Tsunoda was asked at the Chinese Grand Prix whether he would accept the promotion to Red Bull if it was offered.

He said: ""Yeah, why not? Always. In Japan? Yeah, 100%. I mean, the car is faster.""

When the scenario was put to Lawson, he responded: ""I've raced him for years, raced him in junior categories and beat him - and I did in F1 as well, so he can say whatever he wants.""

Lawson was promoted to Red Bull this season following the team's decision to pay off Sergio Perez, despite the Mexican having two years remaining on his contract.

That decision was made after a difficult 2024 for Perez, who failed to finish on the podium after the fifth race of the season.

Perez's performances contributed to the team finishing third in the constructors' championship last year, behind McLaren and Ferrari.

As Perez's slump in 2024 had mirrored a similar pattern of performance in 2023, Red Bull decided the time had come to get rid of him.

They had the choice between Lawson and Tsunoda as a replacement and chose the New Zealander, despite the fact he had completed just 11 grands prix split over two seasons - whereas Tsunoda has raced for the company since 2021.

The decision to promote Lawson to Red Bull, alongside Max Verstappen, after just 11 grands prix spread across two seasons was already questionable.

To demote him back to second team Racing Bulls after just two races in a swap with Tsunoda - who was passed over only three months ago - is, quite simply, extraordinary.

It raises serious questions about Red Bull's management, primarily team principal Horner.

It was Horner's decision to offer a new two-year contract to Sergio Perez last May even though the Mexican was starting to struggle in the second Red Bull - just as he had through the second half of 2023.

He did that despite Carlos Sainz being available following Ferrari's signing of Lewis Hamilton for 2025.

After Perez's performances slumped through the remainder of 2024, the decision was made to terminate his contract. That resulted in a pay-off of many millions of dollars.

And rather than pick Tsunoda, who had four years' experience and had edged Lawson as a team-mate, they picked the New Zealander, apparently because of his mental fortitude.

Now they have to find a way to justify this series of decisions - and the almost unprecedented one to dump Lawson after so little time to bed himself in.

To many, it will smack of a team in denial about the size of the problem they have with their car. And a lack of understanding of what to expect when picking drivers who are yet to prove they are world class as the team-mate of a champion of genius level and expecting them to perform in a car with fundamental issues.

Lawson was one of six drivers to retire from the season-opening race in Australia 

Lawson took part in six races in 2023 as a substitute for Daniel Ricciardo when the Australian broke his hand in a crash, scoring points with a ninth-place finish in Singapore.

And last year he competed in five races after Ricciardo was dropped following the Singapore Grand Prix, taking points for ninth-place finishes in the US and Sao Paulo Grands Prix.

Tsunoda out-qualified Lawson by a ratio of four times to two in 2023 and seven times to two in 2024. In races, Tsunoda has been ahead six times against four when both have finished.

Red Bull chose Lawson on the basis they believed the Japanese lacked the mental toughness to survive at Red Bull alongside Verstappen, while his fellow driver had more potential to improve.

They had been planning to wait until at least the Japanese Grand Prix before making a call because it is the first track on this year's calendar at which Lawson has previous experience.

But in the end Lawson's poor performances have led to his downfall after just two races.

Verstappen is said by insiders to believe the decision is an error, on the basis that the problem is Red Bull's car - not the second driver.

The Dutchman has said the 2025 Red Bull is the fourth quickest car - behind rival top teams McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari.

The car continues to have balance problems which hampered the team last year and meant Verstappen won only two of the final 14 races of last year, while fighting off a late assault from McLaren's Lando Norris to win his fourth world title.

Nyck de Vries was let go from Red Bull's sister team, then called Alpha Tauri, after 10 races in 2023 

Lawson's two races in his first full season at Red Bull will go down as one of the shortest ever driver stints for an F1 team. 

While Lawson at least gets to stay on the grid, Japanese driver Yuji Ide had no such luck in 2006. The 31-year-old was dumped by Super Aguri after just four grands prix - and had his FIA super licence revoked - after struggling to adapt during his rookie season. 

Dutchman Nyck de Vries impressed enough during a stand-in drive for Williams in 2022 to claim a full seat with the Red Bull's second team, then called Alpha Tauri, a year later. 

But his F1 career ended only 10 races in to the 2023 campaign when he was replaced mid-season by Ricciardo. 

Indian driver Karun Chandhok managed one race more than De Vries in 2010, when he lost his place at the HRT team to Japan's Sakon Yamamoto after just 11 grands prix. 

There were some memorable substitute appearances, including Markus Winkelhock's one-race deal - and retirement - with Spyker in 2007.

Andre Lotterer famously called it a day after two laps for Caterham in 2014, while Luca Badoer's double cameo for Ferrari in 2009 - when the Italian finished at the back of the field on both occasions - caused much dismay for Scuderia fans.

The NCAA on Tuesday faced calls to follow in the footsteps of World Athletics and enact gender tests for athletes who want to compete in women's sports.

World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said cheek-swab tests will be used for athletes who want to compete in the female category. He called the process ""very straightforward"" and keeping women's sports fair an issue that was ""important"" to him. 

He added that the tests are not invasive and was ready for any criticism that could come his way.

Advocates for fairness in women's sports called on the NCAA to go further and alter their rules in accordance with World Athletics.

Coe vowed to protect women's sports.

""Neither of these are invasive. They are necessary, and they will be done to absolutely international medical standards,"" he said during a media availability. ""I wouldn't have set off down this path in 2016, 2017 to protect the female category in sport if I'd been sort of anything other than prepared to take the challenge head on.

""We've been to the Court of Arbitration for Sport on our [difference of sexual development] DSD regulations. They've been upheld, and again they've been upheld after appeal. We will doggedly protect the female category, and we'll do whatever is necessary to do it. And we're not just talking about it.""

President Donald Trump signed the ""No Men in Women's Sports"" executive order in February to keep biological males from playing against girls' and women's sports.

The NCAA followed up by altering its gender-participation rules. The organization said a ""student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete on a women's team."" The previous policy, which had been in place in 2010, allowed biological males to compete in the women's category after undergoing at least one year of testosterone suppression treatment.

However, women's sports advocates have pointed out that the NCAA's rules do not go far enough.

MAINE GOV. JANET MILLS RESPONDS TO TRUMP'S DEMAND FOR APOLOGY OVER TRANS-ATHLETE POLICIES

The major criticism was that the policy fails to go far enough or establish clear barriers to protect women's athletes in the college ranks and that the policy allegedly allows trans athletes to bypass the restriction by changing the gender on their birth certificate.

In the U.S., 44 states allow birth certificates to be altered to change a person's birth sex. The only states that do not allow this are Florida, Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Montana. Meanwhile, there are 14 states that allow sex on a birth certificate to be changed without any medical documentation required, including California, New York, Massachusetts and Michigan.

Riley Gaines, the host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast and former All-American swimmer at Kentucky, told Fox News Digital in an interview last month that the new NCAA policy is ""as clear as mud.""

An NCAA spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the governing body will not allow trans athletes to compete in the women's category based on changed birth certificates.

""The policy is clear that there are no waivers available, and athletes assigned male at birth may not compete on a women's team with amended birth certificates or other forms of ID,"" the spokesperson said. 

Regarding trans athletes practicing on a women's team, the NCAA considers male practice players a ""staple"" of women's sports.

""Male practice players have been a staple in college sports for decades, particularly in women's basketball, and the association will continue to account for that in the policy,"" the spokesperson said.

Yuki Tsunoda and Liam Lawson are poised to switch teams for the Japanese Grand Prix; Lawson's disappointing performances at Red Bull in the opening two events leading to a return to Racing Bulls; Tsunoda set to make Red Bull debut on home soil at Suzuka on April 4-6

Red Bull are set to replace Liam Lawson with Yuki Tsunoda after just two races of the Formula 1 season from next week's Japanese Grand Prix.

Lawson will return to Racing Bulls - the company's junior team - from the Suzuka race in a straight swap with Tsunoda after a difficult start at Red Bull as Max Verstappen's team-mate.

Red Bull have not commented and no official announcement is expected on Wednesday.

The 23-year-old Lawson has endured a dismal start to 2025 so far, being knocked out at the first stage of all three qualifying sessions (including one in the Sprint format) and has struggled for race pace compared to Verstappen, scoring no points in Australia and China.

Tsunoda has been at the sister Red Bull-owned outfit since 2021 but did not get the nod to replace Sergio Perez, who was left without an F1 seat for 2025.

He will be the fifth team-mate for Verstappen since Daniel Ricciardo left at the end of 2018.

But while both Pierre Gasly and Alex Albon experienced brief and unsuccessful tenures next to Verstappen when young drivers after also being promoted through the Red Bull ranks, Lawson's time at the senior team has proved to be astonishingly short.

Horner had notably refused to confirm following last Sunday's Chinese GP that Lawson would still be in the car at the next race in Suzuka on April 4-6 after initial reports on Autosport that he might not. The first reports that Red Bull had duly decided to decided to make a change with Tsunoda emerged in the Dutch media, De Limburger followed by De Telegraaf.

Analysis from Sky Sports News reporter Craig Slater:

""Red Bull give but Red Bull also take away.

""Christian Horner explained at the end of last year that Liam Lawson's mental strength was one of the reasons he got the nod ahead of Yuki Tsunoda for the senior team drive. Lawson will have to call on all that mental strength now.

""This will be cruel, but to an extent might taking him out of the firing line be of longer-term benefit? He has struggled far more than anticipated to get to grips with this car.

""I've spoken to people with a window on how Lawson's been over the first two grand prix weekends. ""Frazzled"", ""at a loss"" and ""too much too soon"" are the kind of phrases they've used. Results, albeit from a small sample, are way adrift of any the team have posted before; an 18th and two 20ths in qualifying is not Red Bull form.

""Yet there are absolutely no guarantees Yuki Tsunoda will suddenly be running up there and close to Max Verstappen in qualifying. Yet the No 1 priority for the team is still giving Verstappen a winning car even if only he can really master it, rather than finessing the car to improve the form of the No 2 driver.""

Lawson was promoted ahead of Tsunoda to the seat on December 19 as Red Bull moved to end Sergio Perez's time at the team after the experienced Mexican's sustained struggles in the seat despite giving him a two-year contract earlier in the year.

Whereas Tsunoda had just completed his fourth season at what is now Racing Bulls, Lawson had only driven in 11 grands prix for the outfit over the previous 15 months and been both outqualified and outscored by the Japanese driver during that time.

However, Red Bull were understood at the time to have given Lawson the seat because they viewed him as being better suited to the challenge of being Verstappen's team-mate and, given his F1 inexperience relative in his handful of appearances at Racing Bulls, had run close to Tsunoda's pace already and had a higher ceiling of performance to find.

But Lawson's struggles with the RB21 during the first two race weekend have led to a sudden, and until last weekend unexpected, reappraisal of the situation with Tsunoda to now finally get his chance at the top team from Suzuka, his home race.

Speaking after Lawson qualified last and finished outside the points in both the Sprint and Grand Prix sessions in Shanghai, team principal Christian Horner said: ""I think Liam still has got potential, we're just not realising that at the moment. I think the problem for him is, he's had a couple of really tough weekends, he's got all the media on his back.

""The pressure just naturally grows in this business, and I feel very sorry for him. You can see it's very tough on him at the moment.

""He's a young guy, we've got a duty to look after him and we're going to do the best that we can to support him.

""Liam's still a very capable driver. We know that, just for whatever reason, we're not seeing him able to deliver that at the moment.""

Tsunoda, meanwhile, has started his season strongly for Racing Bulls.

The 24-year-old qualified fifth and ninth in Australia and China respectively, scoring points with sixth in the latter event's Sprint race. He would also likely have scored points in both the main grands prix so far too but for botched strategy calls by the team which dropped him down the order.

Welcome to the first edition of the Starting Pitcher News column. Each week, I'll be taking a deeper look at a few trending/surging starting pitchers to see what, if anything, is changing and whether or not we should be investing in this hot stretch.

The article will be similar to the series I ran for a few years called Mixing It Up (previously Pitchers With New Pitches and Should We Care?), where I broke down new pitches to see if there were truly meaningful additions that changed a pitcher's outlook. Only now, I won't just look at new pitches, I can also cover velocity bumps, new usage patterns, or new roles. However, the premise will remain the same: trying to see if the recent changes we're seeing are worth buying into or just mirages.

Each week, I'll try and cover at least four starters and give my clear take on whether I would add them, trade for them, or invest fully in their success. Hopefully you'll find it useful, so let's get started.

All the charts you see below are courtesy of Kyle Bland over at Pitcher List. He created a great spring training app that tracks changes in velocity, usage, and pitch movement. It also has a great chart feature, which allows you to see how the whole arsenal plays together.

I will admit that I've never been a huge fan of the idea of Jordan Hicks as a starter. I understand the allure of his velocity and the fact that his stuff played up in the bullpen, but I just never believed it would transition into the starting rotation. To a certain extent, it didn't last year. Hicks did post a solid 4.10 ERA, but it came with a 1.45 WHIP and only 109.2 innings of work. I was fully out heading into this season.

While Hicks' spring training hasn't been great, something popped out in his last start that we should take note of.

That's Hicks averaging 97.4 mph on his sinker and four-seam fastball, up almost three miles per hour from last year. He also did that into the fifth inning, so it wasn't just a spike in the game's early innings. The results were obviously there with seven called strikes, four whiffs, and a 32.4% CSW on the sinker. That velocity gain also carried over to the four-seam fastball he uses against lefties, but he didn't have as much success in this last start. That concerns me a little since his sweeper is less effective against lefties and the splitter appears to be taking a backseat, which makes sense since it's a volatile pitch. However, it all does mean that Hicks could have more trouble with left-handed hitters.

We should also note that the sweeper has seemed different this spring. As you can see from the chart above, the pitch is 1.5 mph harder, but that has come with almost four inches of added drop and significantly less horizontal movement. In his final start, it performed well as a swing-and-miss offering, but I'm not sure the changes make a ton of sense. Last season, Hicks' sweeper posted a 15.3% swinging strike rate (SwStr%) and a 28.8% Ideal Contact Rate (ICR), which are both above-average. However, he did also have below-average strike rates and zone rates on the pitch, so Hicks may be trying to tighten the pitch up to make it easier to command. If that trade-off costs him swinging strikes, I'm not sure if it's a net positive.

At the end of the day, I'm still not a huge believer in Jordan Hicks as a starter, and I think Hayden Birdsong could push him back to the bullpen by the summer; yet, I'm willing to take a gamble on Hicks with this increased velocity I may keep him on the bench for his first start against Houston but could fire him up against the Mariners in the next one.

The biggest news out of San Francisco this weekend may have been that Landen Roupp was named the Giants' fifth starter. Despite Hayden Birdsong getting a lot of attention for his strong spring, Roupp also had an impressive spring of his own with a 3.75 ERA, 0.75 WHIP, and 14/1 K/BB ratio in 12 innings. A lot of that success came with a revamped pitch mix.

In 2024, Roupp pitched the majority of his innings out of the bullpen, so we might not have a complete sense of his arsenal, but he threw his curve 44% of the time, his sinker 41% of the time, and then mixed in a changeup and slider. A big concern with that approach is that both his curve and sinker were significantly worse against lefties. The sinker didn't get hit hard, but it had just a 1.6% SwStr% and was not commanded well against lefties, which suggests a lack of confidence since Roupp commanded it really well against righties. Also, his curve posted just a 7.7% SwStr% to lefties and had just a 10% PutAway rate, despite being his primary two-strike pitch to lefties.

To address those concerns, Roupp added a cutter this off-season that could operate as his primary fastball to lefties and modified his changeup to add more horizontal run. Some of that changeup alteration could simply be the result of a slightly lower arm angle, but it seems like Roupp is working to add more run on his sinker and changeup by dropping his arm slot a little bit. That could give him more swing-and-miss potential against lefties with a changeup that comes in around 88mph and plays well off of his sinker. The cutter, or harder slider, could also serve as a strike pitch to lefties that he can use to jam them inside. That will set up the success of the changeup low and away.

All of that now gives Roupp a clear four-pitch mix, and he has also talked about using his four-seam fastball more, which would give him five pitches and a clear plan against both righties and lefties. While I know he doesn't have the eye-popping velocity of Birdsong, Roupp consistently posted above a 30% strikeout rate in the minors, and this deeper pitch mix makes him one of my favorite early-season waiver wire adds. While I might not start him at Houston, I want Roupp on my bench in case his arsenal all comes together like I think it can and he becomes a big FAAB target for my competition.

What a find Richard Fitts has been for the Red Sox. He was acquired from the Yankees, along with Greg Weissert and Nicholas Judice, for Alex Verdugo last season, and the Red Sox quickly went to work reshaping his arsenal. Those tweaks continued in the offseason, and Fitts showed up to spring training sporting added velocity, a new cutter, curveball, and kick-change.

The velocity itself is nice, with his four-seamer up 1.5 mph from last year. Considering Fitts also has elite extension and iVB on the pitch, the four-seamer has the makings of an offering that can thrive up in the strike zone. He has pounded the zone with it well in spring training, and he does have a sinker he can use inside to righties, which could help the added velocity of the four-seamer play up.

The added cutter for Fitts might also be a bit of a gyro slider, but we do know that it's a modification from the slider he threw last season. The pitch is almost two mph harder with less horizontal movement. So far in spring, he has used it more to right-handed hitters, which makes me think he's not using it as a true cutter but as more of a gyro slider to create separation from his sweeper, which is his primary whiff pitch to righties. The increased velocity on the harder slider now creates a three mph gap between the sweeper with significantly less horizontal break, which you can see in the chart below with the sweeper dots in pink and the slider dots in purple. Although they attack similar areas, the added movement of the sweeper should add to the deception of his arsenal with the slider staying in the zone for strikes and the sweeper moving off the plate for swings-and-misses.

You can also see a new wrinkle in here with Fitts' changeup showcased by the green dots. Fitts is now throwing a kick-change that comes in at 89 mph with 10.5 inches of armside run, similar to the 12 inches on his sinker (yellow dots above). You can see how they would attack the same part of the plate, away to lefties, but the changeup dives down in the zone. The only issue here is that Fitts doesn't throw the sinker to lefties, so the two pitches can't play off of one another. However, Fitts' sweeper is better as a swing-and-miss offering to righties, so it's clear that the inclusion of the kick-change and curveball is his way of trying to find a solid PutAway pitch to lefties as well. So far, his command of the curve has been good, and he posted a 36.4% CSW with it in his last start, which is promising.

At the end of the day, we have a young pitcher who is throwing almost two mph harder and now has a true six-pitch mix that he can use against hitters of both handedness. That should excite us. Yes, Brayan Bello and Lucas Giolito don't figure to be out for a long time, so Fitts may not have a long leash in the rotation, but there wre rumblings that the Red Sox were open to a six-man rotation to help keep everybody healthy, so if Fitts is pitching well, Bello and Giolito coming back would bump Sean Newcomb from the rotation and the Red Sox could keep a six-man rotation with Fitts still involved. Given how he has looked this spring and that he starts the season in Texas and against the Cardinals, two matchups I'm not running from, I'm inclined to throw Fitts on my bench and see how this all goes.

2025 Fantasy Baseball: 60 Undervalued Players, from Jasson Domínguez to Bo Bichette

60 undervalued players to help you win your fantasy league.

Over the weekend, the Braves traded Ian Anderson to the Angels, freeing up a rotation spot for AJ Smith-Shawver. The 22-year-old was solid this spring with a 3.94 ERA but 20 strikeouts and five walks in 16 innings. That strikeout upside made him a trendy add in fantasy leagues on Sunday night, but I have some concerns about Smith-Shawver to begin the season.

For starters, he has not posted an ERA under 4.00 since he pitched 21 innings at High-A and Double-A in 2023. He had a 4.17 Triple-A ERA in 2023 and a 4.86 mark last year. Now, he was young for the level, which we need to keep in mind, but he also has had command issues that have always led to double-digit walk rates. That's not ideal.

The pitch mix itself is fine. Smith-Shawver relies heavily on his four-seam fastball, which sits 96 mph, but can reach the upper 90s with above-average extension and iVB. It's a flat fastball that plays well up in the zone and can miss bats. He pairs that with an improved changeup that had the highest whiff rate of any of his pitches in 2024 and a curveball that he added in 2023 and has plenty of vertical movement with good command. He also features a hard slider that looks like a swing-and-miss spitch but wasn't used in his brief MLB innings in 2024.

That's a package that could lead to MLB success, provided he can show gains in his command that prevent him from running into trouble. Fastball command in particular has been an issue for Smith-Shawver, and many of his home runs in the minors came on poorly located fastballs. MLB hitters will take advantage of that too if he can't get it ironed out.

The bigger issue may be how long he remains in the rotation. He claimed the fifth spot for now, but Spencer Strider may be back in 3-4 weeks. Grant Holmes has also looked good this spring and has no minor league options, so the Braves can't demote him when Strider is back. That makes Smith-Shawver the most likely candidate to go back to Triple-A or join the bullpen as a multi-inning guy. Now, Reynaldo Lopez and Chris Sale are not pictures of health and could get hurt before Strider returns, but you're not likely to get a long runway with Smith-Shawver, and his first starts figure to be against the Padres, Marlins, Phillies, and Blue Jays. We would certainly love to have him for that Miami start, but I'm not sure I'd want him for the Padres and Phillies starts and then maybe see him lose his rotation spot when there are plenty of other intriguing undrafted arms still on waiver wires, like Roupp and Fitts.

Reese Olson is another pitcher who has featured increased velocity in spring training, sitting 95.3 mph on his four-seam fastball in his last start, which is up over one mph from last year.

That may not seem like a big deal, but the four-seam fastball was easily Olson's worst pitch in 2024. It posted just a 4.6% SwStr% while allowing a nearly 40% ICR. It's a relatively flat fastball, but didn't have the velocity to succeed up in the strike zone, so Olson threw it low and middle a lot. A bump up to 95.3 mph and some added horizontal movement, as seen in the chart above, could help it be more successful in on the hands of righties or up in the zone. At the end of the day, we simply want Olson's four-seamer to not be as bad as last year. It doesn't even have to be good.

That's because Olson has a really solid changeup, which has gotten even stronger this spring with added velocity and more arm-side run. It should be a real weapon against lefties, and then Olson has a plus slider that registered a 21.4% SwStr% and 15% ICR against righties in 2024. If his four-seam and sinker can simply set up the slider and changeup (and curve at times), then Olson should be in a good spot. However, we're going to need to see him hold those velocity gains into the season as well.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}"

""It wasn't a formal conversation that we had as a ballclub,"" he said, via ESPN. ""It's certainly a huge honor to get the invitation to the White House. It allows us to celebrate our 2024 championship. To my understanding, every World Series champion gets that honor, so it's a great honor for all of us.""

In 2019, Roberts suggested to the Los Angeles Times he would skip a White House visit after Trump criticized Roberts during the 2018 World Series for making a pitching change.

Regardless of what changed, MLB fans criticized the team.

World Athletics chief say rules will uphold the integrity of women's sport amid debate over inclusion of trans athletes.

Track and field is set to become the first Olympic sport to require participants in women's events to undergo DNA testing to prove their biological sex following a decision by World Athletics.

Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said on Wednesday that track and field's governing body had agreed to introduce the testing to keep the “absolute focus on the integrity of competition”.

“It's important to do it because it maintains everything that we've been talking about, and particularly recently, about not just talking about the integrity of female women's sport, but actually guaranteeing it,” Coe told reporters on Tuesday after a two-day meeting of the governing body's council in Nanjing, China.

“And this, we feel, is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition.”

Coe, a former Olympic medal-winning middle-distance runner, said the body had made the decision following an “exhaustive review” and consultations with more than 70 sporting and advocacy groups.

“Overwhelmingly, the view has come back that this is absolutely the way to go,” Coe said.

Coe, who earlier this month mounted an unsuccessful bid to lead the International Olympic Committee, said competitors would be subject to non-invasive cheek swabs and dry blood-spot tests and would only be checked once in their career.

“We will doggedly protect the female category and we will do whatever is necessary to do it, and we're not just talking about it,” he said.

 



 

The decision is the latest turn in the heated debate over the participation of transgender women and gender non-conforming athletes in women's sport.

World Athletics in 2023 announced a ban on transgender women who had gone through male puberty, pending a review into the eligibility requirements for participants in female competition.

The move overturned previous rules that allowed transgender women to compete if they maintained a blood testosterone level of no more than 5nmol/L for the preceding 12 months.

While broadly aimed at athletes who have changed their gender, World Athletics's testing requirements would also affect small numbers of competitors who were born with atypical sex chromosomes.

World Athletics's decision also comes on the heels of similar moves by several major sporting bodies, including World Aquatics and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the main governing body for college sport in the United States.

The International Olympic Committee, which will oversee the running of the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, has allowed transgender athletes to compete since 2004 but ultimately defers to the eligibility rules set by individual sporting bodies.

Beyond the world of sport, the issue has become a lightning rod in the broader culture wars taking place in the US and other Western countries.

Last month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to deny federal government funding to educational institutes that allow trans girls and women to participate in female sport and use female changing rooms.

In a New York Times/Ipsos poll published in January, 79 percent of Americans said that trans women should not be allowed to participate in female sports, up from 62 percent in 2021.

Genius Sports' strategic partnership with Deep Blue and Precise represents a calculated move to capitalize on the explosive growth in women's sports viewership, which has doubled in just two years. By launching during NCAA Women's March Madness, GENI is timing this initiative to maximize immediate visibility.

The WS/AIM service leverages GENI's exclusive relationships with the WNBA and NCAA - key assets that provide competitive differentiation in the fragmented sports media landscape. These exclusive partnerships create barriers to entry for competitors seeking similar positioning.

What makes this particularly valuable is that GENI isn't just offering generic advertising solutions but creating specialized audience segments specifically for women's sports advertisers - a currently underserved market with growing brand investment. The FANHub platform serving as the primary activation channel positions GENI to capture recurring advertising revenue rather than one-time project fees.

The emphasis on first-party data aligns perfectly with broader industry shifts away from cookies and third-party tracking, future-proofing the offering as privacy regulations tighten. By creating publisher-direct inventory opportunities, GENI is positioning itself as both a data enabler and media facilitator - expanding its role in the value chain.

This partnership model also demonstrates strategic efficiency - rather than building all capabilities in-house, GENI is leveraging Deep Blue's category expertise and Precise's technology infrastructure, likely accelerating market entry while controlling development costs.

The new WS/AIM service addresses a significant market inefficiency - despite surging viewership, women's sports have lacked sophisticated audience targeting capabilities that are standard in other advertising sectors. This creates an opportunity for GENI to establish early market leadership in what remains an undercommercialized segment.

The architecture of this solution is particularly noteworthy. By creating a private collaboration environment, GENI avoids the commoditization pressure facing many adtech platforms. The emphasis on proof-based lineage and verifiable, privacy-preserving collaboration differentiates this from standard audience targeting solutions.

From a revenue perspective, the platform enables multiple monetization streams: technology licensing, media activation fees, and potentially revenue-sharing from the resulting advertising campaigns. This diversified approach reduces dependency on any single revenue model.

The platform's ability to transform fan insights into first-party audience segments that work both within and beyond sports content is crucial - it expands the addressable inventory beyond just game broadcasts, creating scale that advertisers require for meaningful investment. This effectively allows GENI to monetize fan interest even when games aren't being played.

The privacy-first approach also serves as insurance against regulatory changes, with the platform designed to maintain data ownership and control with athletes, teams, and leagues while still enabling monetization. This approach builds trust with sports properties, potentially strengthening GENI's position for future partnerships and contract renewals.

RUSSELL WILSON AND THE NEW YORK GIANTS 

The Giants have their starting quarterback. Russell Wilson signed a one-year, $21 million deal with Big Blue that includes $10.5 million guaranteed. He joins a quarterback room whose meme-ability exceeds its on-field ability -- free-agent signee Jameis Winston and holdover Tommy DeVito -- and one that could grow further in the NFL Draft. 

So, why is Wilson the presumed starter? Well, he provides much, much more stability than Winston. And while $21 million sounds like a lot, it's a reasonable bet he actually makes closer to $10.5 million. That's less than what old friend Daniel Jones is making, for reference. 

Furthermore, this doesn't preclude the Giants from drafting a quarterback, whether it's at the top of the draft -- they have the No. 3 pick and have explored moving up -- or later on, when they can take a flyer. 

Long story short, it's a stabilizing move with a low ceiling but a reasonable floor. 

DAMIAN LILLARD AND THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS 

Damian Lillard is out indefinitely with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf. It's the same ailment that ended Victor Wembanyama's season back in February, though Wembanyama's was in his shoulder. 

The first big call Andrew Luck had to make as Stanford football general manager isn't the one he was hoping for. Stanford fired coach Troy Taylor a few days after reports of a pair of investigations revealing Taylor mistreated female staffers and tried to have an NCAA compliance officer removed after being warned of rule violations. 

ESPN reported Luck stood by Taylor less than a week ago. Now, he's fired him. It's notable Luck -- appointed GM in late 2024 -- was the one making that choice, Richard Johnson writes. 

And then there were 16. The men's Sweet 16 begins tomorrow, and it's full of the big boys: all four No. 1 seeds, three No. 2 seeds, two No. 3 seeds and three No. 4 seeds. 

When the margins are as small as these, every little advantage helps, and that includes along the sideline. Kyle Boone ranked the 16 coaches left, and No. 1 is ... 

The Big Ten has four teams in the Sweet 16, tied with the Big 12 for second-most behind the SEC's record-setting seven. And of the many talking points, the Big Ten's title drought is a big one: Izzo's 1999-2000 Spartans are still the last Big Ten team to win it all. Jason Richardson starred on that team. Twenty-five years later, his son, Jase Richardson, is starring on this one. 

That's one reason to root for Sparty. As for the other teams? Cameron Salerno has reasons to root for all 16 teams. 

Opening Day is tomorrow, and it'll be a fun one, with big-name pitchers on the bump and enticing matchups like Brewers-Yankees, Red Sox-Rangers, Mets-Astros, Braves-Padres and Tigers-Dodgers on the docket. 

Big names require big calls. Mike Axisa has bold predictions for every team, and that includes one of the game's star pitchers. 

Unfortunately, Skenes is one of few highlights for the Pirates, who have MLB's eighth-lowest win total (77.5). Matt Snyder made best bets on win totals, and one team he likes more than the sportsbooks is ... 

Matt also likes the Rangers to win the AL West. Here's our preview for that division as well as the others: 

🏀 Lakers at Pacers, 7:30 p.m. on ESPN 🏒 Devils at Blackhawks, 7:30 p.m. on TNT/truTV 🏀 Celtics at Suns, 10 p.m. on ESPN 🏒 Stars at Oilers, 10 p.m. on TNT/truTV

FREWSBURG – The Frewsburg Central School District is moving ahead with a merger of some school sports programs with Southwestern – with a few caveats. 

During a special meeting Monday, Frewsburg school board members approved merging five individual sports with Southwestern teams: the varsity football team, junior varsity football team, the competitive cheer team, girls tennis team and the boy's varsity soccer team.

As the Board President Larry Lodestro called for a vote, all board members gave a unanimous thumbs up for the boys varsity soccer team, competitive cheer team and girls tennis team. However, when it came to the school's two football teams, Carrie Graham, board vice president, voted against those two mergers. 

However,  Graham wasn't alone in her dissenting vote.  Several community members, student family members and alumni, expressed their displeasure with the idea of a merger.

Brad Swanson, a parent of two Frewsburg students said, “This feels rushed. If you read the comments left on Thought-Share it's more like 85 – 95% of our residents don't want this merger to happen. It's the same for Southwestern parents, they don't want this either.”

Swanson, also said that he believes that the data gained from a survey sent out by Frewsburg officials was swayed and unreliable. 

“There was a question and answer section prior to a presentation in the email but,” he said. “But,  at the end of the presentation, there wasn't another survey to take or see what a person's viewpoint was when all the facts were presented.” 

Supporting and echoing Swanson's statement, Heather Heald, a concerned parent asked, “have you considered the extra drive time that will be added to our students' day? It seems like Southwestern doesn't want to merge. We, as a school, are not unified – no one really seems to want this.”

Additionally, Michael LeBaron, school board member, indicated that while he approves of the merger – it is only for one year, and he would demand that the school board would again, do its due diligence, and look at all aspects of a merger the following school year. 

However, Dr. Danielle Cook, district superintendent, said she understands how community members can feel so strongly about this topic, and is sympathetic to their cause.

Frewsburg Central School District's Board of Education, voted Monday, during a special school board meeting, held at 26 Institute St., to merge five of the school's athletic teams with Southwestern School District's teams.

“A lot of a community's image is tied up with its local, high school sports teams. I get it, I understand why people have such a strong reaction to talk of a shared sports program,” she said. “But, we must do what's in the best interest of our students, and sometimes doing what's right is not the most popular thing.”

Lodestro disagreed with the idea that the process was rushed while agreeing with LeBaron that the conversation isn't over.

“This merger is only for our fall sports teams and it's only for one-year, nothing more,” Lodestro said. “Each year we will review where we're at with our school sports program, and re-evaluate, nothing is set in stone. This was not a rushed decision, we took three months, had several community meetings about this, we put out surveys and gathered all the data we could to make the best, educated, choice.”

Game-changing Partnership Equips Student-Athletes with Tools to Boost Mental Wellness and Encourage Safe Choices

IRVING, Texas, March 26, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Mothers Against Drunk Driving® (MADD) and NDUR for Athletes, a leading mental health platform, are teaming up to provide student-athletes with essential mental wellness resources while equipping high schools and colleges nationwide with innovative education programs. This collaboration aims to redefine mental health support and empower young athletes to make safer, healthier decisions—on and off the field.

Through this partnership, MADD Sports and NDUR will deliver a cutting-edge, technology-driven program designed to engage student-athletes, encourage smart decision-making, and create lasting change.

""Mental health plays a crucial role in making safe, healthy choices,"" said Stacey D. Stewart, CEO of MADD. ""By combining NDUR's innovative digital support system with MADD Sports' mission to prevent impaired driving, we are putting vital mental health and decision-making tools directly into the hands of student-athletes across the country. This partnership empowers young athletes to prioritize their well-being, make healthier choices, and help build safer communities by addressing critical issues like impaired driving and underage drinking.""

At the heart of this powerful collaboration is NDUR's innovative mobile-first platform, which connects athletes directly to on-campus services, teletherapy, crisis intervention tools, and peer-to-peer support—anytime, anywhere. By integrating technology-driven resources with MADD Sports' impaired driving prevention initiatives, this partnership will create a lasting impact in schools and on campuses nationwide.

""MADD Sports and NDUR are set to change the game in student-athlete mental health and impaired driving prevention,"" said Bob Khederian, NDUR Chairman. ""We've spent the past two years perfecting a mobile-first experience for Gen Z athletes, and this partnership is a game-changer in bringing that vision to life.""

With a focus on student-athlete well-being, MADD Sports and NDUR have built a dynamic digital platform that provides:

On-Demand Mental Health Support: A technology hub customized for each school, giving athletes instant access to campus counseling, teletherapy, and additional resources.

Peer-to-Peer Support Network: A national, anonymous space exclusively for college athletes to connect and share experiences.

Educational Resources & Leadership Development: A robust library of tools, mentoring programs, and leadership initiatives to help athletes take charge of their well-being.

Campus Leadership & Mentorship Program: Empowering student-athletes to be advocates for mental wellness and impaired driving prevention on their campuses.

The impact of this partnership extends far beyond individual wellness. Together, MADD and NDUR will ignite community engagement through exciting donation opportunities, including a QR code activation at an upcoming Boston Bruins game and dedicated donation links on NDUR's platform. Every contribution directly supports MADD's mission to end impaired driving, prevent underage drinking, and save lives.

Since launching in the 2023-2024 academic year, NDUR's platform has already reached

thousands of student-athletes at nearly 100 campuses nationwide, including Boston College, UMASS Amherst, Georgetown University, and Babson College.

""We're at a critical moment in student-athlete mental health,"" said Carter-Williams, Chief

Relations Officer for NDUR. ""The pressures athletes face today—especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic—demand innovative, accessible support systems. Our platform provides student-athletes with a first line of defense, ensuring no one feels alone in their struggles.""

NDUR's technology-driven approach directly aligns with the NCAA's newly published mental health guidelines, which will become mandatory for Division I programs this November. Thus, NDUR is a turnkey, affordable solution for colleges of all sizes, helping them comply with these standards without additional strain on athletic department resources. In addition, the MADD Sports and NDUR initiative is supported by corporate partners and sponsors, including the NFL, Uber, and Diageo, ensuring the program remains free for schools.

About NDURNDUR for Athletes was founded to transform the mental health landscape for student-athletes through proactive, community-driven support. By addressing the No. 1 priority on every campus—mental health—NDUR empowers student-athletes to manage daily stressors, build resilience, and prioritize well-being both on and off the field. NDUR was co-founded by Michael Carter-Williams, a Syracuse University alum and 2014 NBA Rookie of the Year, and Russ Cooke, former CEO of Boston Coach and NFL alumni, to address the growing mental health crisis among student-athletes. The NDUR leadership team includes Darren Orr, a Duke University grad, and 17 year NHL agent who worked alongside his NHL Hall of Fame father, Bobby Orr.

(Bloomberg) -- The Sports Illustrated brand is teaming up with UK-based media firm Galactic to launch a predictions market allowing users to bet on anything linked to athletic events — except the outcome of games.

The platform, which will be known as SI Predict, joins a growing field of quasi-betting exchanges, including Polymarket and Kalshi, which offer products based on derivatives contracts. SI Predict will be available globally and feature bets on things such as football-game attendance or what song a halftime musician will perform, but not who will win a specific game.

The goal of the platform is “to foster conversation, debate and engagement, allowing users to showcase their expertise without the complexities of gambling,” according to a statement from the companies Wednesday. SI Predict will launch in the second quarter.

“Sports media is no longer a one-way conversation,” Galactic Chief Executive Officer Stuart Stott said in the statement. “Fans want to be involved, and they want their opinions to have weight.”

Since the US Supreme Court struck down a national ban on sports betting in 2018, the market has soared, led by online sports books DraftKings and FanDuel. More recently, national exchanges and trading platforms have entered the fray, with Robinhood Markets Inc., for example, offering derivatives-based products that let users bet on the outcomes of March Madness college-basketball games.

Some online-wagering businesses have at times run afoul of US regulations and been forced to scale back their offerings.

While SI Predict will comply with regulations put in place by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the US, “as a non-custodial platform, it does not need to be regulated,” Stott said in an emailed response to questions. The platform's wagers aren't concerned with the outcome of a specific sports event, but rather on adjacent gambles, such as whether Taylor Swift will attend a certain game. SI Predict's products “are akin to futures contracts,” Stott said.

Best known for its sports magazine with its iconic swimsuit issue, the Sports Illustrated brand is now owned by Authentic Brands Group Inc., which licenses it out for ventures including ticketing platform SI Tickets, hospitality operator SI Resorts and film, television and podcast producer SI Studios.

IN OTHER NEWS – The average Georgia adult has not broken a sweat in 103 days.
Release:

Poll of 3,024 adults.
34% of Georgia adults say they have lost interest in playing sports.

For years, public health experts have waved red flags about America's slide into a sedentary lifestyle, tying it to a laundry list of health woes – heart disease, diabetes, you name it. But here's a question that's been simmering beneath the surface: Is this less about laziness and more about a cultural drift away from playing sports entirely? A new survey from LiveSportsonTV.com digs into this, polling 3,024 adults to find out how many have swapped cleats for remotes – and why.
The findings paint a telling picture. When asked, “When's the last time you played a sport that made you break a sweat?” the average Georgian said it was 103 days ago (compared to a national average of 98 days). That's over three months since they last huffed and puffed on a field, court, or trail. But the numbers vary wildly across the country. Take North Dakota: folks there haven't broken a sweat in an average of 188 days – over half a year. Meanwhile, Colorado residents are practically still wiping their brows, averaging just 19 days since their last workout-worthy game. It's a stark divide that hints at more than just climate or terrain.

Then there's the choice between doing and viewing. LiveSportsonTV.com asked, “If you had an hour to spend on sports, would you rather play or watch?” In Georgia, only 31% picked playing over watching – a stat that might make gym teachers everywhere wince. North Dakotans, true to form, were the least enthusiastic, with just 11% opting to lace up. Coloradans, on the other hand, flexed their active streak again, with 67% saying they'd rather be in the game than on the couch. It's a split that suggests geography, culture, or maybe just habit plays a bigger role than we think.
Losing the Love – and What Might Bring It BackThe survey didn't stop at sweat stains and screen time. It also probed whether Georgians have simply fallen out of love with playing sports. Here, 34% admitted they've lost interest – perhaps a reflection of declining local options or shifting priorities. 
So what's holding people back – and what could pull them in? The answers offer a glimpse into the practical and psychological barriers:

44% said they'd play if they had friends or a group to join. It's a reminder that sports, at their core, are social – and loneliness or a lack of buddies might be sidelining more people than we realize.
27% blamed a lack of free time. Between work, family, and the endless scroll of streaming options, carving out an hour to shoot hoops isn't as simple as it sounds.
16% pointed to a shortage of local opportunities or facilities. If the nearest court is miles away or the community league folded years ago, motivation can fizzle fast.
14% got creative, saying they'd play if they could do it from home – like virtual reality sports. It's a nod to how tech might just bridge the gap for the housebound or the hesitant.

When it comes to big events like March Madness, viewing habits reveal a state of casual fans rather than diehards. Only 11% watch every game religiously, while 40% catch a few when they can. Another 21% tune in only if their team is in the mix, and 28% skip the whole spectacle entirely. For basketball buffs who do watch, the survey pegged their March Madness screen time at an eye-popping 59 hours – proof that when the stakes are high, the couch still calls.
Game-day rituals tell a similar story. A hefty 57% order wings and settle in, treating watching as their sport of choice. Just 16% hit the field themselves before kicking back, while 12% tinker with fantasy lineups and 14% scour betting odds – more invested in the spread than the sweat.

“We're seeing a real shift in how people engage with sports,” says Emil Sturesson of LiveSportsonTV.com. “It's not just about time or access – there's a cultural lean toward spectating over participating. But the appetite to play is still there, especially when friends or local options make it feel less like a chore and more like a good time. We need to meet people where they are – whether that's building more courts or finding ways to make sports social again.”

PARKERSBURG — The 2024-25 basketball season was the first one for Ritchie County head coach Kenny Church.

The Rebels advanced to the state tournament in Charleston for the first time since 2021 and a large part of that was because of big man Isaac Hodges, who was honored as the Little Kanawha Conference's Player of the Year.

“We were told he's got another three inches in his growth plates. I mean I'd love to have a 6-10 kid next year, but I'll take a 6-7 Isaac Hodges over about any kid these days,” admitted coach Church, who said the pivot gained 20 pounds and grew a couple inches last summer.

“He's always just dedicated himself to this sport and I always tell the guys you are going to get exactly what you put into the game. I think this just speaks volumes to that because he's getting what he's put into the game, you know, LKC Player of the Year. First time we've had one here in 24 years. It just shows his dedication.”

The last time a Rebel won the honor was back in 2001 with Eli Heagy, who shared the top spot alongside Williamstown's Chris Kellar.

Hodges, whose team was bounced in Charleston during the quarterfinals by eventual state champion Wheeling Central, averaged 23 points, 12.9 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 2.4 steals and 2.5 blocks while shooting 52% from the floor and 77% at the free-throw line.

“I was going to take a week off at least after my butt-whipping last Tuesday, but he wouldn't let me,” added the coach. “He actually messaged me last night (Sunday) and said ‘Coach, can I get in the weight room tomorrow,' so it's kind of hard to tell a kid like that no that's so hungry.

“I've been fortunate actually to coach Isaac since he was going into seventh grade in the summer. I was their summer league coach. My assistant, Jay Cronin, was the middle school coach at the time and he asked me if I could coach these boys in the summer and that's how I got initiated into coaching. It's just been a dream to have a kid like Isaac.”

Three-time first team honoree Parker Schramm from Williamstown, who helped the ‘Jackets to a double-A state runner-up finish, finished second in the LKC POY voting.

Schramm averaged 16.6 points, 4.0 boards, 2.5 assists and 2.5 steals while shooting 77% from the line and 42% from deep.

Yellowjacket teammate Jayden Bryant, who averaged 17.7 points, 4.9 caroms, 2.1 assists and 1.3 steals while shooting 72% at the line, was a repeat honoree on the first unit along with fellow senior teammate Cruz Isaly, Hodges and Braxton County junior Steve Boggs (11.7 ppg, 10.9 rpg 1.2 spg, 1.5 bpg, 62% FG). Isaly, who had a 2.61 assist-to-turnover ratio, averaged five dimes a night to go with 13.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.9 steals while taking a team-high eight charges.

Five players moved up from last year's second unit — Ravenswood senior teammates Noah Dawson (15.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 4.3 apg, 1.1 spg, 74% FT, 53% FG) and Evan Swain (13 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 2.5 apg, 1.2 spg, 2.0 bpg, 69% FG) as well as a trio of other 12th-graders in Tyler Consolidated's Brady Strode (14.7 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 2.3 apg, 1.8 spg), Roane County's Cam Cumpston (15.9 ppg, 6.9 rpg, 3.6 apg, 75% FT) and Wahama's Eli Rickard (20.5 ppg, 10.5 rpg, 4.3 apg, 2.0 spg, 76% FT).

Class AA state tournament participant Doddridge County was represented on the first team by junior Jerod Trent (10.4 ppg, 3 rpg, 3.2 apg, 2.4 spg, 70% FT). The Bulldogs were runner-up to Williamstown in the Night of Champions while the Rebels knocked off the Eagles in the consolation game.

The only other senior to garner a spot on the first team was Ryan Kent of St. Marys. The Blue Devil put up 15.5 points, 5.4 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2 steals a night while knocking down 55 3s and converting at 69% from the line.

Parkersburg Catholic junior Preston Randolph (13.8 ppg, 5.3 rpg, 3.1 apg, 2.9 spg, 71% FT), Gilmer County sophomore Kolten Holbert (15.1 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 1.5 apg, 2.7 spg, 69% FT) and South Harrison freshman Joseph Fenstermacher (14 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 4.4 apg, 1.7 spg, 2.1 bpg) comprised the remainder of the 15-player first team.

The All-LKC second team featured Ritchie County's Seth Cronin, Wirt County's Braylan Dawson, Braxton County's Logan Baldwin, Doddridge County's Jaden Solomon and Landon Thomas, Calhoun County's Baron Davis, Roane County's Will Odle, South Harrison's Adam Marple, Gilmer County's Jacob Mick, Webster County's Joston Lewis, Parkersburg Catholic's Leonardo DeAngelo, Wahama's Cooper Roush, Rebel Rhett Johnson and Eagle Brady Toler.

Photo by Jake McNeill: Southwest Minnesota State University guard Bri Stoltzman (2) sizes up a Northern State defender during the first half of a Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference womens basketball game on Jan. 17 at the R/A Facility in Marshall. 

MARSHALL — From a childhood introduction to basketball to a senior year high school realization of her potential, Southwest Minnesota State University senior Bri Stoltzman finishes her collegiate basketball career as one the program's most decorated guards. Along with the accolades collected, it's the memories made on the court and friends earned along the way that she holds the closest. 

“It's been a journey … I wouldn't change it for the world,” Stoltzman said. “It went by fast, and it was fun. I would do it all again if I could.” 

The 5-foot-8 2021 graduate of Mankato West High School has sported jersey No. 2 the last four years for the SMSU women's basketball team. What started as a pick-up hobby influenced by a her friend Calie Schumann turned into a college career that earned her a Division II Player of the Year award and a run to the 2025 NCAA Division II Tournament Sweet 16. 

“One day, [Schumann's] like, ‘Just come to tryouts. Every shot you miss, I'll miss, so we're on the same team,'” Stoltzman said about first getting into basketball competitively in the summer going into seventh grade. “That got me into the sport, and I just grew to love it because of the people in the sport.” 

Stoltzman started making contributions as a freshman at SMSU and blossomed over the next three seasons. She appeared in all 26 games her first year, averaging 2.6 points over 11.7 minutes per game. Come sophomore year, she was named to the All-Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference [NSIC] Second Team after elevating her game to an average 13.8 points and 6.9 rebounds a night over 29.7 minutes. 

Junior year, the Mankato native made the NSIC First Team after starting all 31 games, and led the Mustangs in scoring, rebounding, assists, steals and free throws. Yet, Stoltzman's best year was still to come. 

Along with helping lead SMSU to a 28-5 record, a program record of wins, Stoltzman was named the 2025 NSIC Player of the Year, the Division II Conference Commissioners Associations [D2CCA] Central Region Player of the Year, the NSIC Player of the Week seven times and was named to the All-NSIC First Team. She also made the All-Tournament team for the NCAA Central Region alongside junior Audrey Swanson, and was named to the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA) All-American first team. 

Rounding out her senior year accolades and marking the first athlete in SMSU history to do so, Stoltzman was named the Division II D2CCA National Player of the Year on Tuesday, an award selected by college sports communicators from NCAA Division II schools. 

“I'd say that I honestly don't really look into accomplishments or accolades, because there are more important things. I'd just rather hang out with my teammates and cheer them on,” Stoltzman said. “I hope they get all the attention … They all deserve it.” 

Stoltzman stands second on SMSU's womens basketball all-time scoring list with 1,764 points, just behind Julie Thein's 1,800 set during 1987-1991. She finished this season with 703 points, surpassing the previous mark of 579 points she set during her junior campaign. 

“That's not why she's playing. She's playing because she loves the game. She's that 7-year-old kid that has the basketball in the driveway. That's Bri,” SMSU women's basketball head coach Tom Webb said. “It's not about the awards she got last week or the week before. It really isn't … I think that keeps you centered. It keeps you where you need to be, and you understand why you're playing. She's playing for the love of the game, and it's a pretty cool thing to watch.” 

Becoming a consistent playmaker for the Mustangs, Stoltzman led the team this season with an average 22 points while shooting a team-high 54%. She was the team's best free-throw shooter at 82%, and led with 4.1 assists and 2.2 steals a game. She also ranked second in the NSIC in scoring and field goal percentage, while ranking third in assists. 

“The best advice I've gotten — I'm stealing this from Webb because his words are just so good — is to just be you. Confidence is key, especially at a young age,” Stoltzman said. “You just have to be you, go out there and do your thing.” 

Stoltzman didn't get serious about pursuing college basketball until the summer going into her senior year of high school, as she was also heavily involved with softball. She switched between shortstop and second base for travel ball, and primarily played catcher for high school. 

“I didn't know what I wanted to do ever. My AAU coach was on me in a good way like, ‘It's time to pick whatever you love most. No one's going to be mad at your decision, but you need to focus in on one right before your senior season if you want to get recruited,” Stoltzman said. “I listened to him … He got me recruited, and he got me to coach Webb.”  

Remembering when he initially came across Stoltzman, Webb couldn't help but smile while staring ahead. 

“I remember the first time I saw Bri play AAU [Amateur Athletic Union]. She was super, super competitive … You could just tell she wanted to win, and those kids are tough to find,” Webb said. “Then, we went to a high school game … I watched her warm up, and I thought it was just a different warm-up. She had a different mentality, and you could just see that there was something special.” 

Webb, in his ninth year as SMSU's head coach, also attributed Stoltzman being a multi-sport athlete as another reason he wanted to recruit her. 

“She's a heck of a catcher in softball, and as a catcher, you have to lead. Those things all correlate to basketball,” Webb said. 

Stoltzman knew she wanted to become a Mustang quickly after beginning conversations with Webb, noting his authenticity in the interview and the program's potential for growth as key selling points.

Just as the program grew over her four years with the team, so did Stoltzman. She credited Webb as one of the main factors in that development.

“He [Webb] always has believed in me, and I really believe in him … I feel like throughout the years, we just have developed this relationship that's so important to me,” Stoltzman said. “He always talks about leaving the jersey in a better place … I care so much about Webb.”  

Stoltzman, who has three older sisters and a brother, also attributes her family as heavy influences. 

“My family also inspires me. They never fail to text me ‘good job' or ‘good game,' even if I don't play well. I really, truly do have a really good support system,” Stoltzman said. “Also, my teammates … They really push me to be a better player and person every day.”

Stoltzman's ability to develop as a leader over her four years has also resulted in her leaving a lasting mark.

“She has an unbelievable feel for the game … But, she's an unbelievable leader. I think her ability to get her team to enjoy tough times sometimes is such a tough thing to do,” Webb said. “What I mean by that is, if it's in the middle of a tough run, she'll get them together, and she'll huddle them up and say something. Next thing you know, we go on a little run and that. That's true leadership.”

Stoltzman has hopes to become an occupational therapist after graduating this summer.  

With all of the points scored, the assists dished out, the injuries overcome, the awards achieved, relationships built, the heartbreaking losses and overtime thrillers, Stoltzman leaves the court knowing her younger self has been fulfilled for the career she's upheld. 

“I feel like I've grown a lot throughout the years. I think, looking at me from a high school perspective, I would just be proud of myself,” Stoltzman said. “I would also look back and tell myself to keep working, too.”

Mar 26, 2025

MARK NANCE/Sun-Gazette Correspondent
Loyalsock's Alaina Dadzie looks to shoot against Imhotep during the PIAA Class AAA semifinals last week.

It felt like Alaina Dadzie built an airlock first team Class AAA all-state case last year. She averaged a double-double throughout the postseason, helped Loyalsock reach the state's Final 4 for the first time and was the best player on the court in that semifinal against eventual champion Lancaster Catholic.

And yet, she was denied that first-team honor, settling for second. Whether first, second or third, making any all-state team is a fabulous honor but the first-team snub added fuel to an already raging competitive fire. So Dadzie went back to work, continued improving and is making her case again.

Not that she is thinking about that these days. Dadzie simply is focused on winning and has helped Loyalsock do that a lot. She did so again last Friday, scoring 31 points and grabbing seven rebounds as Loyalsock defeated Imhotep, 65-46, in the semifinals and reached its first state championship.

Next up is Thursday's state final at Hershey's Giant Center against Shady Side.

“I like these big games,” Dadzie said. “These are the biggest stage to go on and perform, so it's super fun to play in front of a lot of people and show them what I can do.”

Dadzie sure does a lot. And when the games have been the biggest the last two years, she has played her best basketball.

A year after bursting onto the state scene, Dadzie is producing 24.7 points and 7.4 rebounds per game this postseason. That has included virtuoso performances in the district championship against Hughesville, the second round of states against West Catholic and last Friday night.

Since the last year, Dadzie has been a marked player, the one each team builds its game plan around. But she keeps going strong and embracing the opportunities which only come through hard work.

Dadzie worked hard again against Imhotep, making 10 of 14 shots, including two 3-pointers, while helping Loyalsock control the boards against the taller Panthers. Dadzie excelled against two Division I recruits and also made three steals, helping Loyalsock dominate the game's final 2 1/2 quarters.

It speaks volumes than once the playoffs hit; Dadzie has gone to another level. She has increased her scoring average by seven points in the playoffs. Granted, Loyalsock blew out most of its regular season opponents and Dadzie rarely played much in the fourth quarters of those games, if at all.

The playoffs have given the junior center a shot to go the distance in these games and she has continued pouncing on the opportunities.

“The blowouts aren't as fun when you don't play much. It's like you're just there,” Dadzie said. “These hard games, you have to go at after every second of the game and they're fun.”

Dadzie has been especially dangerous when Loyalsock is not experiencing much fun. Hughesville built an 11-point third quarter lead in the district final but Dadzie erupted in the second half, scoring 28 points and helping the Lancers rally for a thrilling 52-49 against the team which denied it the title a year earlier.

Loyalsock struggled for long stretches against West Catholic in the second round but Dadzie became virtually unstoppable in the fourth quarter, scoring 15 of her career-high 36 points, while adding seven boards and three assists.

“I just told her between quarters, if you play low, if you play physical and want the ball nobody is stopping you,” Jacobson said following the West Catholic game. “She came out with her eyes on fire and she wanted the ball.”

That game played out like so many have this season, Dadzie frequently being battered but fouls often not being called. At times, it feels like the Shaquille O'Neal days when the Hall of Famer seemingly was punished for being tall, strong and physical.

Still, instead of asking why, Dadzie kept moving forward. She used the no-calls as motivation and took over the game, displaying not just her talent but her maturity as well.

“Alaina was going through it physically and definitely getting attacked there,” guard Jillian Kennedy said after dishing six assists that night. “We just kept encouraging her and that's really all it took. ”

Dadzie is the first one to deflect individual praise toward her teammates and it is well-deserved. They have done super jobs setting Dadzie up and vice-versa. They know what is coming each game in terms of double teams and various looks.

Still, an opponent can know what is coming and still have a hard time neutralizing it if one brilliantly executes. So often that is what Loyalsock has done, creating opportunities not just for Dadize, but for everyone.

“We try to scheme lots of ways to get her the ball and be creative but it's the players who make the plays,” Jacobson said. “It's her learning body position. It's her understanding, ‘What's the defense giving me?' It's the passer thinking. ‘Where does she want it?' It's stuff you have to work on consistently because she's seen every type of defense you can see.”

Although she knows when to try and take charge, Dadzie also does not force things. She has used the constant attention to the team's advantage as well and that has led to quality looks for teammates. That has paid monster dividends during states with Lacey Kriebel draining five 3-pointers against Dunmore in the quarterfinals and Kennedy two game-changing treys against Imhotep.

“I think she is figuring out how to manage getting double teamed and fouled all the time by getting her open teammates the ball while still getting her own shots,” Kriebel said.

It's a reciprocal relationship with all the Lancers not looking for any shot, but the best shot. It has really come together in the playoffs with the inside-outside game clicking as well as it has all year. Kriebel has scored 44 points in the last two games, but also has piled up 15 assists.

The Lock Haven-bound guard had eight more against Imhotep. It was not that Dadzie was wide-open but the chemistry both have built consistently shined through. Whether there was a small gap or a step, both sensed when openings presented themselves and kept the offense humming throughout the game.

“She knows how to position herself so that I can throw a lob. She's so athletic that if you throw the ball up for her, she's going to go get it,” Kriebel said. “I feel like we have a special connection, wing to block, and we understand each other's game.”

Few in District 4 understood how Dadzie was not a first team all-state selection last year. But the past is the past and new opportunities continue presenting themselves.

WELLSBURG — They say coaching is not for the faint of heart. 

Brooke baseball coach Doug Costain has found out the hard way this week. 

His Bruins certainly stressed out their bench boss, but in the end, they gave him plenty of reason to celebrate. 

After winning in extra innings on the road Monday night at John Marshall, the Bruins came from behind to do it again Tuesday evening at rival Weir High, this time 7-5 in nine innings. 

“Wow, I tell these guys all the time I'm too old for this, my heart can't take it,” Costain joked. “We learned a lot about ourselves and learned how resilient we are. Good teams find a way to win even when you don't have your best game.

“We're young. I think we let the emotions get the best of us early on, but we settled in and kept battling and found a way to pull out the win.”

The Bruins trailed the game 3-2 with two outs in the top of the seventh and were down to their last strike, then after taking the lead, saw the Red Riders tie the game in the bottom half to send it to extras. 

Even the ending, going to the bottom of the ninth with a three-run lead, was not without drama as the Red Riders got a run across and were threatening to tie, if not win, the game with the bases loaded. 

Henry Anderson's sixth punchout in his 2 2/3 innings of relief work, getting the third out with a called third strike looking to end the game, allowed Costain to breath a little easier. 

The night before, the Bruins also overcame losing a seventh-inning lead with an eight-run eighth at John Marshall.

“One of my assistant coaches looked at me in the seventh (Tuesday) and said this is the grittiest team he's ever seen, and that's how good teams win, especially at the end of the season, they grit it out and find ways to win,” Costain said. “Their pitcher was really doing a good job against us … but we found ways to claw out some runs and get into the extra innings.”

The victory is Brooke's fourth-straight for Costain's young group after getting 10-runned on opening day at Wheeling Park, sending them into a weekend tournament trip to Huntington with a 4-1 record. Three of those wins, including the one over the Red Riders, are over regional opponents in Class AAA. 

“We always set the bar as high as we can,” Costain said of the 4-1 start. “We really challenged these guys, we have freshmen out there in the starting line up. We had 10 seniors last year, this year it's only three. It's a much different situation and they're all playing different roles, and right now everyone is fitting into their roles and doing what is best for the team. 

“We're 3-0 in games against teams in our region and that's a good place to be.”

Tuesday night, Aiden Provenzano provided what ended up being the winning hit with a two-run double in the top of the ninth, another run later crossing on an error, one of five committed by Weir in the game, multiple of which resulted in Brooke runs. 

Trailing 3-2 with two outs and two on the seventh, the Bruins appeared to be going to come up short when a pop up into shallow left field seemed poised to be the third out, but it popped in and out of a Red Rider glove, allowing runners on second and third to come around and score for a 4-3 lead. 

Weir, which led 3-0 through three innings, stayed alive by getting a run across on a passed ball with two outs in the bottom of the seventh. 

After a scoreless eighth and Brooke going ahead 7-4 in the top of the ninth, Weir got an RBI single from Cayden Braswell to get within one, and had them loaded up with two outs, but did not get another big hit to keep things going. 

A Liam Williamson two-run single in the second inning had put the Red Riders on top early, a lead that stood up until the seventh large in part to starting pitcher Aleks Zanieski dealing on the mound. 

The sophomore had fanned 11 batters and allowed just four hits when he was forced to depart in the top of the seventh due to his pitch count reaching 110. He left with a runner on and the Red Riders up 3-1, but ultimately had to settle for a no-decision despite the strong six-plus inning performance. 

The loss dropped Weir High to 1-2.

Coaches and athletes describe Lon as someone who has an unmatched work ethic and commitment to the game. 

PRINEVILLE, Ore. -- A void is left in Crook County Athletics after longtime Prineville Sports Editor for the Central Oregonian newspaper Lon Austin passed away from a heart attack over the weekend. He was 69.

""Still just hasn't really set in and it probably won't until we see the empty chair up on top of the first base dugout without Lon in it,"" said Crook County head baseball coach Steele Bailey.

Austin was known to have a smile and a friendly approach to sports editing.

""I felt on top of the world, really,"" said Crook County senior Gage Martinez. ""It was after a great game. I think I went like three-for-four, but he just walked up to me, and I almost felt like a celebrity, you know?""

""I was always looking forward to having an interview after the game, my match, or a football game,"" said Crook County senior Ethan Lampier. ""He would always be there, and it'll be different.""

Austin always had his unique areas picked out for his prestige photography. For baseball, it was his chair on top of the dugout.

""He was a big part of our every sports program,"" Martinez said. ""I always look up on top of the dugout, and he'd be sitting there with his camera. He'd be taking pictures, cheering us on.""

Coaches and athletes describe Austin as someone with an unmatched work ethic and commitment to the game.

""During wrestling season, it didn't matter how late the tournament got over. I was always expecting a call from Lon, whether it's 10:30 or 11:30, to see how we did,"" said head wrestling coach Jake Gonzales.

""He's going to be missed a lot,"" said head Cross Country Coach Orie Gonzales. ""Big time. I don't think I've ever been to a sporting event for Crook County that he wasn't there.""

His dedication left a mark not just on popular programs but also on all sports and athletes.

""He spread it around throughout the sports, but he spread it around from kid to kid,"" said head track and field coach Ernie Brooks. ""That picture in the paper meant a lot to someone; that may be the only time they ever get recognized.""

Now, programs are adjusting to life without Austin behind the camera, cheering them on and finding ways to honor him.

""There will be a chair up there full on the season and will be definitely playing for him,"" said Bailey.

“It was definitely very nerve-racking [to start the season],” Hopp said. “I was definitely really nervous coming into today. We hadn't practiced handoffs, so that was quite scary. It was really fun to cut in, though, because at outdoor meets you can't do that. But it was a lot of fun to cut in this meet.”

Hopp was the runner for MVL who pulled away from the rest of the teams, being the second athlete to run in the 4×200.

“I definitely know that my starter Avery [Freier], she got me there so I could get it,” Hopp said. “But it was a lot of fun to be able to get that pull ahead and get my team ahead so they can take it the rest of the way.

The 4×800 relay team of Natalie Matzke, Grace Peters, Faith Peters and Kylie Berdan placed first as well with a time of 12:04.17.

Also for the MVL girls, Brown placed second in the 55-meter high hurdles (9.68), while Davey placed third (9.73).

								By Hayden Bird 

The National Women's Soccer League Boston expansion team unveiled its second effort to name itself following the disastrous first attempt in Oct. 2024.

Instead of BOS Nation FC, the Boston team will be known as Boston Legacy Football Club, per a club announcement on Wednesday morning.

“The club has gone through a rigorous fan feedback and quantitative analysis process, collecting hundreds of name suggestions from initial fan feedback and whittling that down over five months to one name, Boston Legacy FC,” the team announced in its statement unveiling the new name.

After responses to the original name proved almost exclusively negative in late 2024, the club acknowledged in December that it would try again.

“Your voices have made it clear that revisiting our team name is essential,” controlling owner Jennifer Epstein said in an update on Dec. 31.

Boston Legacy FC is set to take the field in 2026 as part of an NWSL expansion to 16 teams. The club has already hired front office staff, including former Barcelona executive Domènec Guasch as Boston's first general manager.

The other major story already surrounding the team is its choice of home venue. Alongside the City of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu, the club is currently locked in a court case over whether or not it will be allowed to go ahead with a major renovation project of White Stadium, which the Legacy intends to use.

The lawsuit opposing the stadium renovation was brought by 20 citizens and the Emerald Necklace Conservancy, a private nonprofit group. A ruling is expected soon. Should the lawsuit succeed in defeating the current stadium project, the Legacy would need to seek alternative options for hosting home games.

The New York Giants have slowly formed one of the most intriguing quarterback rooms in the NFL, signing two Pro Bowl QBs during free agency.

After a 3-14 season, the Giants agreed to a deal with Jameis Winston. New York made the move for Winston after having Tommy DeVito under contract.

They have now added to the quarterback room, signing 10-time Pro Bowl quarterback Russell Wilson to a one-year deal.

Amid the chaos on social media, with the Wilson news blowing up in online NFL landscape's, Winston was far from the football field.

Wilson posted a photo soon after the Wilson news dropped online, revealing his golfing plans with Super Bowl champion Von Miller.

""Hips don't lie,"" Winston said.

Winston and Wilson now form an interesting quarterback battle. While many analysts believe Wilson is viewed as the starter, Winston has also proven that he can contribute at a high level.

Last year, during his lone season with the Cleveland Browns, Winston posted 13 touchdowns and 2,121 yards, completing 61.1% of his pass attempts.

Wilson, who's fresh off his lone season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, capped off the season with 16 touchdowns and 2,482 yards, completing 63.7% of his pass attempts.

He led the Steelers to a 10-8 record, including a playoff appearance.

The winner of FIFA's first 32-team Club World Cup in the United States could earn $125 million as details of a $1 billion prize money fund were finally published

FIFA Details Club World Cup Prize Money With $125M Target for the Winner in $1BN Fund

GENEVA (AP) — The winner of FIFA's first 32-team Club World Cup in the United States could earn $125 million as details of a $1 billion prize money fund were finally published Wednesday.

FIFA said it allocated $525 million in guaranteed fees for teams taking part in the June 14-July 13 tournament, ranging from $38.19 million to the top-ranked European team to $3.58 million for the Oceania representative Auckland City.

A further $475 million is earned by results in the 63 games, with $2 million paid for winning group stage games, $7.5 million for playing in the round of 16 and $40 million to the team that wins the final at MetLife Stadium near New York.

The top-ranked European team — likely Real Madrid — that won all its group-stage games and advanced through the knockout rounds to win the title would get to $125 million.

The golden trophy has been sitting in the Oval Office at the White House this month after FIFA President Gianni Infantino delivered it to President Donald Trump, who was invited to present it to the winning captain.

The prize fund was delayed until a global broadcast deal was belatedly agreed in December with streaming service DAZN, which then got a major investment from a state-backed sports agency in Saudi Arabia. Fans can watched games for free on DAZN's website.

Saudi Arabia also was confirmed in December by FIFA as host of the men's 2034 World Cup.

Each of the 12 European teams in the Club World Cup lineup will be paid at least $12.81 million as an entry fee for the first expanded edition of the four-yearly tournament. Payments will be decided by “a ranking based on sporting and commercial criteria,” FIFA said without providing details.

Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea also qualified by either winning a Champions League title from 2021 to 2024, or having consistent results in the competition over those four seasons. 

Countries were capped at two entries, unless they had three Champions League winners. Salzburg of Austria qualified as the final European team, despite never advancing beyond the round of 16, because higher-ranked clubs like Liverpool and Barcelona were blocked by the country cap.

The six South American teams each will get a $15.21 million entry fee.

Teams from Africa, Asia and the CONCACAF region of North America — including Lionel Messi's Inter Miami, despite not winning the MLS Cup title last season — each will get $9.55 million for playing. Any team from these regions that wins the title will earn less than $100 million.

Leon of Mexico is currently contesting its removal from the competition by FIFA because it is in shared ownership with Pachuca which also qualified.

FIFA aims to share $250 million among clubs worldwide who did not qualify for the tournament. It is unclear how many clubs will be paid, or how much they will get. 

The maximum prize of $125 million ranks below the English Premier League and UEFA's Champions League in soccer's prize money table.

Man City got 176 million pounds ($227 million) in prize money from the Premier League for winning the title last season.

In the 2022-23 Champions League prize list, the most recent published by UEFA, title-winning Man City got almost 135 million euros ($146 million). The competition's total prize fund has now risen by almost 25% for each season through 2027.

UEFA will pay out close to 2.5 billion euros ($2.7 billion) among the 36 teams in the new expanded format that guaranteed eights games played instead of six.

The $1 billion Club World Cup prize pot is, however, more than double the $440 million FIFA shared among the 32 soccer federations whose teams played at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

Sponsors who signed with FIFA for the club event in the two highest commercial tiers also have deals for the men's 2026 World Cup in the U.S. which will be co-hosted by Canada and Mexico.

It isn't often we see someone ranked 140th in the world in the quarterfinals of a WTA 1000. But Eala is a pathbreaker in more ways than one.The 19-year-old is also, already, the highest-ranked player ever from the Philippines, and one of the only ones currently on tour. The lefty has spent most of her brief career on the ITF circuit, but a wild card got her in the door in Miami, and she has made the most of it, upsetting two of the WTA's biggest hitters, Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys, back to back. Beating Ostapenko is something that Swiatek can't claim to have done yet.

Can Eala make it three power-player victims in a row? She has some of the traits of her fellow lefty—and half-Filipino—Leylah Fernandez. Neither is tall, but they make up for it by playing close to the baseline and taking every ball they can on the rise. That's not an easy way to win, especially against Swiatek, who is No. 2 in the world, a past champion in Miami, and who hits with a heavy, bouncy topspin that can be hard to time.Swiatek has played some tight sets in her three matches in Miami, but hasn't lost any of them so far. She should be able to attack Eala's serve, but she may have to deal with Eala doing the same to her second serve. I'll just finish by saying that Swiatek and Fernandez have played twice, and Iga has lost a total of five games. Winner: Swiatek—Steve Tignor

Polish world No. 2 Iga Swiatek has been given extra security after a spectator at the Miami Open verbally abused the five-time major champion during a practice session last weekend, the BBC reported on Wednesday.

The man shouted personal insults about Swiatek's family and had previously sent abusive online messages to her through social media.

""The Miami incident appears to be a direct transition from verbal aggression online to harassment in the real world,"" Swiatek's representative said. ""He was aggressive and taunting.""

The BBC said Swiatek's team reported the incident and that tournament organizers and the WTA put extra security measures in place around the player, who is scheduled to face Philippine wild card Alexandra Eala in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.

""Security is a top priority. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues,"" Swiatek's spokesperson said.

""Constructive criticism is one thing, and threats, hate speech or even disturbance during training is another -- this cannot be condoned.""

The WTA told Reuters player safety was a top priority.

""There are comprehensive security protocols in place to make sure that any incidents are handled promptly and effectively,"" the WTA said.

""The details of these are not something we discuss publicly, but we are steadfast in our commitment to maintaining a safe environment for players and everyone attending one of our events.""

The incident happened a little over a month after a spectator was removed from the Dubai Championship and banned after causing 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu distress by exhibiting ""fixated behavior"" toward the British player.

ASICS athletes Alex de Minaur, Borna Coric, Lorenzo Musetti, Belinda Bencic, Harriet Dart and Jasmine Paolini will flaunt the collection throughout the European Tennis Tour.

Turning focus to the sneakers, the ubiquitous GEL-Kayano 14 is the lone off-court proposition.

Serena Williams and Patrick Mouratoglou enjoyed real success together as the former won ten Grand Slam titles with the Frenchman by her side.

The American WTA legend won a record 23 Grand Slam titles during her tennis career, dominating the sport for almost 20 years.

Ten of those titles came under the guidance of French coach Mouratoglou, who joined her team in September, 2012.

Williams was never afraid to voice her opinions during her time on tour, once sharing her thoughts on the differences between men's and women's tennis.

43-year-old Williams said she would lose 6-0, 6-0 to Andy Murray if they ever played a match, as Mouratoglou now reveals what happened when the 23-time Grand Slam winner trained with ATP stars.

Mouratoglou recently took to Instagram, reacting to Williams' past comments on men's and women's tennis.

A post shared by THE COACH (@patrickmouratoglou)

“It's funny that it's coming from Serena [Williams] and that she says that men's and women's tennis are two different sports,” he said.

“That's true for mainly one reason: It's the fact that men are so much faster than women, movement-wise.

“Serena is talking about the power of men, but Serena was hitting with guys you know.

“When I was coaching her, she played many times with Grigor Dimitrov and [Stefanos] Tsitsipas; there was zero problem.

“Hitting from the centre of the court, hitting cross court, no problem, they were impressed by the way.

“When the movement was involved, then it was different and this I agree with her.”

Mouratoglou coached Williams, Dimitrov, and Tsitsipas, leading all three players to success on the ATP and WTA Tours.

The Frenchman then reflected on the potential match with Murray, as he hinted at an idea he has for mixed gender competition.

“We had the idea with Serena to play a match against Andy Murray and then we had also an idea on how to reduce the difference between men and women to make this match extremely competitive,” said Mouratoglou.

“I'm not saying what because I want to do it one day.”

Mouratoglou is keeping his cards close to his chest when discussing his mixed gender tennis competition idea, but there's plenty of evidence to suggest the 54-year-old knows how to innovate.

In 2020, Mouratoglou helped launch Ultimate Tennis Showdown [UTS], a modern ‘reinvention' of tennis that has since attracted some of the sport's biggest names.

The format is hardly recognizable for traditional fans of the ATP Tour, as players compete in ‘quarters' rather than ‘sets.'

Australia's Alex de Minaur won the UTS Grand Final in 2024, beating Holger Rune in the final, 3-0 [13-8] [14-11] [16-10].

12,500 fans are set to watch the next UTS event in Nimes on April 4, as three top ten players head to France.

It's fair to say Mouratoglou's UTS has been successful since its launch five years ago, as many will no doubt be interested to see what his ideas for a mixed gender competition look like.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=tennis+news","Becoming the best at 20, Hewitt on explosive charge to No. 1","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/lleyton-hewitt-no-1-club-video-2025","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 14:37:21 GMT","

While many players spend years waiting for their chance to reach No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, typically achieving the milestone in the prime of their careers, Lleyton Hewitt's ascent was anything but gradual — it was a sudden, electrifying breakout.

Aged just 20, Hewitt became the youngest World No. 1 at the time — a record since surpassed by Carlos Alcaraz — when he defeated Patrick Rafter en route to the title at the Nitto ATP Finals in Sydney in 2001.

The Australian's meteoric rise was a testament to his relentless work ethic, unyielding determination, and a fierce, win-at-all-costs mentality that defined his legendary 19-year career.

“I think the first time you get there means the most, because no one can take that away from you,” ATP No. 1 Club member Hewitt said when reflecting on his achievement.  “The only way you get the No. 1 ranking is to be unbelievably consistent, giving 100 per cent every time I stepped on the court gave me the best opportunity of competing against whoever it was and I think that mental toughness really helped.

“It is still very much an individual sport, tennis, and being out there and at times it gets very lonely. But that is why I think when you are able to get to the pinnacle of the game and get the most out of yourself, that is what the satisfaction comes from.”




Hewitt's journey to No. 1 began when he made his tour-level debut at the Australian Open in 1997. He suffered a straight-sets defeat to Sergi Bruguera but a year later he burst onto the scene in style. Aged just 16 and competing as a wild card in Adelaide, Hewitt defeated idol Andre Agassi en route to his first ATP Tour title.

“I was able to beat Vince Spadea in the quarter-finals and then came up against one of my all time idols,” Hewitt recalled. “I had a poster of this guy above my bed in my bedroom. Andre Agassi. It was surreal to be walking out on Memorial Drive Centre Court playing one of the absolute greats of the game. I walked on the court trying to be competitive and in the end I couldn't have dreamt that I would actually be able to beat Andre.”

Hewitt made impressive progress following his Adelaide success, cracking the Top 100 for the first time in 1998, the Top 30 by 1999 and the Top 10 by 2000.

The Australian enjoyed a consistent first half of the season in 2001, winning trophies in Sydney, at The Queen's Club and in ‘s-Hertogenbosch. However, his No. 1 dream suddenly became a distinct possibility that September when he defeated Pete Sampras to clinch his first major title at the US Open.

“All of a sudden I had won the US Open,” Hewitt said. “I came straight back from that US Open and played in a Davis Cup semi-final and then within three months I am challenging for the No. 1 ranking. It all happened like a whirlwind.”

Heading into his final round-robin match at the Nitto ATP Finals, the already-qualified Hewitt knew victory against good friend Patrick Rafter would result in him becoming the youngest No. 1 in history.

“It was a bit of a surreal feeling going out to play that match. Especially alongside Pat, who I'd look up to for so many years as a massive role model to me and a big brother when I first came onto the Tour,” Hewitt said. “In the end it was a fantastic feeling that it could happen in Sydney, Australia and I could enjoy it with a good friend in Pat Rafter.”



Not only did Hewitt reach No. 1 but he maintained an iron grip on top spot. The Australian spent 75 consecutive weeks as the No. 1 in his first stint, the third longest debut reign in history behind Roger Federer (237) and Jimmy Connors (160).

In a standout 2002 season, Hewitt won five titles, including Wimbledon and the Nitto ATP Finals.

“The 2002 season was probably one of my proudest. I felt like I was the best player in the world. Consistently over 12 months and that is not an easy thing to do at 21 years old. You've won a Slam, you've won Tour Finals and you've got a massive target on your back each week.”

Hewitt spent a total of 80 weeks at No. 1 and lifted 30 tour-level titles in a historic career.

Follow:


            Gaby Dabrowski enjoyed some of the most memorable victories of her tennis career last year, and did it all while quietly navigating a personal health crisis.
    


            It was only on New Year's Eve that Dabrowski, one of the world's top doubles players, revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer in April. Suddenly, everything she had achieved throughout 2024 – an Olympic bronze medal in mixed doubles and her victory at the season-ending WTA Finals – was cast in a new light, instantly more remarkable than it first appeared.
    


            At one point in her recovery, just two weeks before the start of the grass-court season, Dabrowski couldn't even toss the ball into the air for a serve. Unable to lift her left arm high enough, she instead got her coach to throw it up for her during practice sessions.
    


            But fast-forward a couple of months and the Canadian was in Paris with an Olympic bronze medal around her neck, finally celebrating a childhood dream fulfilled.
    


            Arguably more impressive was that Dabrowski and partner Erin Routliffe had been runners-up in the mixed doubles at Wimbledon just a few weeks before, all while the 32-year-old had put further cancer treatment on hold to continue competing.
    


            The success, Dabrowski thinks, came alongside a change in perspective brought about by her cancer diagnosis – a new and welcome appreciation for the life she was leading.
    


            “I really felt like it was such a cool thing to be able to play tennis as my profession, and I felt very grateful for the opportunity to be able to do that,” she tells CNN Sports.
    


            “What I noticed is the results that I had last year didn't come because I wanted them, they came because I was enjoying what I was doing … really finding this joy in an achievement that came not from dreaming about it at night necessarily, but from sticking to my process of how I wanted to improve my tennis.”
    


            This was especially true during the Paris Olympics, when Dabrowski endured a period of bad health on her way to winning bronze in the mixed doubles alongside Félix Auger-Aliassime.
    


            That tournament was never centered around getting a medal; it was about simply getting through “a couple of really tough days,” Dabrowski says.
    


            “Honestly, I went to sleep thinking about how I was going to survive the next day,” she adds. “What I was going to try to eat, hopefully I would sleep well, and if I didn't, how I would manage that. I broke things down into very small, achievable wins … And then a good result came.”
    


            Dabrowski's cancer journey really began in the spring of 2023 when she noticed a lump in her left breast. A doctor around that time told her not to worry about it, so she didn't.
    


            However, during a physical provided by the WTA, the governing body of women's tennis, the following year, another doctor encouraged Dabrowski to get the lump scanned. What came next felt like a whirlwind: a mammogram, an ultrasound, then a call from the radiologist urging her to get a biopsy immediately.
    


            “It turned grim very quickly,” says Dabrowski. But it equally didn't take long for things to become more positive.
    


            “I eventually got good news after good news after good news in terms of my staging, the size of the tumor, my Oncotype DX scoring which determines if you need chemo or not,” she adds.
    


            “I didn't need chemo because my score was low enough and I didn't have any spread through my lymph nodes. So I kind of was just in this mode of: ‘Okay, this was scary, but I'm also super grateful that I'm handling this quickly and I'm still at an early stage.'”
    


            The WTA, backed by medical technology company Hologic, offers annual health screenings for players on the Tour, which this year took place at the ongoing Miami Open. They examine, among other things, body composition, bone density, pelvic health, mental health, and Ob-Gyn issues like fertility and postpartum recovery.
    


            Players are also offered blood work, skin checks, cardiology tests and internal medicine with Mayo Clinic physicians.
    


            “We have not a lot of time when we're traveling – let alone being able to see our doctors, being able to get checkups,” world No. 4 Jessica Pegula told CNN en Español's Elizabeth Pérez at the Miami Open. “Our schedule's so all over the place so being able to come here and to do that before a tournament is great.”
    


            Pegula also said that she had spoken to women's health specialists through the WTA about the option to freeze her eggs. “I'm 31,” she explained, “so that's something that interested me, knowing that I don't really know what I'm going to do, but the window of having a kid gets smaller and smaller as you get older.”
    


            As for Dabrowski, she feels grateful to have such resources at her disposal, ultimately leading to her early-stage diagnosis. Now, she wants to help spread awareness for breast cancer – a big reason for sharing her story when she did.
    


            “I really wanted women to be able to know that, even though something like cancer is scary, if you get whatever you have checked out early, and you can handle it, breast cancer has a 99% chance of survival,” says Dabrowski.
    


            “And that was the first messaging that I saw on the flyer when I walked into the office for my mammogram: breast cancer is 99% survivable.”
    


            The past year in Dabrowski's life also demonstrates how it is possible to thrive, and not just survive, during intense treatment for health issues. Cancer became curiously intertwined with her tennis career, providing added motivation to get back on the court with a new appreciation for the sport
    


            “In the beginning, I wasn't sure what my future would hold, not just in tennis, but my life in general,” she says. “I didn't know if I was able to play again, when that would be, what my schedule might look like; would I have to play fewer tournaments? What would that mean for my ranking, my position financially?
    


            “But then over time, I would say probably a month and a half after my diagnosis when I'd had a lot of answers to a lot of the questions I had about coming back to play, I really had this itch to want to return.”
    


            The cancer diagnosis has forced Dabrowski to take care of her body with meticulous attention to detail. That means making incremental improvements to her diet – avoiding sugar, processed foods, and anything that might cause inflammation – her sleep, and her physiotherapy.
    


            Dabrowski has always taken tennis seriously and always will for the duration of her career. But while dialing in on how she treats her body, she's noticed a new, almost liberating, mindset appear – one that allows her to approach the game in a more positive and forgiving way.
    


            Now, winning still feels good but the losses don't hurt quite as much as they used to.
    


            “Although tennis has been all-encompassing from a very young age for me, I don't feel like it's the number one thing about who I am as a person, and I no longer attach my identity to my performance,” Dabrowski says to CNN.
    


            “I'm able to take this life a little bit lighter, I feel like that's where good results come; and even if they don't come, I'm okay with them.”
    


            That's a special position to be in, especially when you consider that Dabrowski, around about this time last year, thought that she might never be able to play tennis again. But she's back on the court now, appreciating the life of a professional athlete more than ever before.

Tennis

MIAMI — Scour the records. Sift through the score sheets from matches the past few months all over the world, in Trnava, Slovakia, or Bengaluru, India, or Takasaki, Japan.

Other than five consecutive wins in January at a minor tournament in Canberra, Australia, there is little to suggest the immediacy of what has been a breakout week for Alexandra Eala. Yet here she is to take on Iga Swiatek, the most mercilessly dominant women's player of the last three years, in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open — a WTA 1,000 event, just below the level of a Grand Slam.

Eala, 19, is in a place no player from the Philippines has ever been. No wonder her parents are flying in for the match.

The trailblazing, though, might be the easiest thing for Eala to deal with. She's been breaking ground for tennis players from her country — an archipelago of 7,641 islands and more than 110 million people — for a while now.

Eala was the first to win the Les Petits As, the premier international tournament for kids aged between 12 and 14. She was the first to win a junior Grand Slam, at the 2022 U.S. Open. She's the first to get to the cusp of the top 100.

“It's prepared me to take this in, step by step,” Eala said during an interview underneath Hard Rock Stadium on Monday evening.

Minutes before, Eala had heard the news that Paula Badosa had withdrawn from their round-of-16 match with a back injury. She had to figure out whether she was going to watch Swiatek play Elina Svitolina later in the evening.

She was on the fence. It was the second match of the evening session, and would likely finish after midnight. Perhaps getting some rest might serve her better. She'd never done this sort of thing before.

“A lot of new experiences,” she said.

Eala began her stay in Miami with a solid win over the American Katie Volynets, a scrambler with a sneaky hard knockout punch when she needs it. Then she beat the mercurial 2017 French Open champion, Jelena Ostapenko, in two tight sets. That was her first win over a top-30 player. It was also the first win over a top-30 player for a Filipino player since WTA rankings were first published in 1975.

Then she backed it up by beating Madison Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion and world No. 5, 6-4, 6-2. Two top-30 wins and one top-5 win for Eala; the same for the Philippines.

Keys makes her home in Florida and hits something close to the biggest ball in women's tennis. Her forehand was too big for top-10 men's player Casper Ruud to handle at times during a mixed-doubles exhibition before the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif.

Eala used her legs to get her feet behind Keys' shots. She absorbed the power, took aim at the lines and sent Keys on the run in the style of Mirra Andreeva, another teenager who has toppled bigger and more powerful foes lately.

“I knew that she was a great player, I knew that she was a big hitter,” Eala said after the match. “I had to keep my legs on and take the opportunities that I could find.”

Eala owes this Miami Open opportunity to one of the quirks of her sport: the wildcard entry, which allows the owners of tournaments to give a handful of spots at each event to players who would otherwise have to get in through a qualifying competition, if they can even qualify for it.

IMG, the sports and entertainment conglomerate, owns the Miami Open and represents Eala. The company usually awards spots in the tournament's main draw to some of its promising young players. This year, Eala got one of the golden tickets.

But then she actually had to do something with it, just as she had before. She was born with athletic genes and financial resources. Her mother was a top swimmer in the Philippines and an executive with a leading telecommunications company there. There are plenty of children born with that sort of pedigree. Few of them take the chance to become a top tennis player like Eala has done now, especially in a country where basketball rules the sporting roost.

She has won several medals at the Asian Games, earning bronze in 2023 after losing out in the semifinals to Zheng Qinwen, who would win gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

“Growing up, it was tough,” Eala said after beating Keys. “You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course, you had many people to look up to around the world, but I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step.”

It was her family that brought her to the court. Eala's grandfather, a tennis buff, introduced all his grandchildren to the sport at his local club. Alexandra and her older brother, Miko, who went to play at Pennsylvania State University, took to it most.

“I never saw myself doing anything else that wasn't tennis,” Eala said. “I saw as I grew that I was getting better and better, and I saw that I always had the potential to make it.”

The first hint arrived when she was 12, with the win at Les Petits As. It earned her a scholarship to the Rafael Nadal Academy in Spain. Her brother got a spot, too, which helped her adjust to leaving her parents at 13 to live in a dormitory on the other side of the world.

“To be there on a scholarship was something that I was not thinking about at all,” she said. “I knew that this is what I wanted to do, so that was a good step towards becoming a professional.”

Nadal has been posting his congratulations to her on social media the past week.

Even after she won the junior U.S. Open title, though, Eala knew she had a long road ahead.

Things can change fast in the career of a tennis player. Sometimes, the door cracks open and a new big thing storms through it, but Eala pushed back against any sort of radical transformation taking place. She knows that there are few overnight sensations these days. Andreeva is the youngest player in the top 100 and she only has one more teenager for company, Australia's Maya Joint. Eala, at No. 102 in the live rankings thanks to her Miami run, will be hoping to join them soon.

“I'm the same person that I was two weeks ago,” she said. “It's a big step definitely, but I cannot assume that it's solidified. I just have to keep my head down, keep working, and results will come if I continue on this path.”

The path has suddenly become a lot more fun, which is plenty important, but not entirely the point, especially with Swiatek on the horizon. She's seen her close-up before: the five-time Grand Slam champion was the guest of honor when Eala graduated from Nadal's academy. Now she is a rival like all the rest, in unfamiliar territory for Eala.

“I've never been in a major tournament this long, so I'm definitely enjoying that,” she said. “But I'm still hungry, and I'm still motivated.”

Emma Raducanu is back in Grand Slam-winning form and is aiming for a spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open on Wednesday 11pm when she takes on home favourite Jessica Pegula; watch all the action from Miami on Sky Sports Tennis, Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Wednesday 26 March 2025 10:41, UK

Emma Raducanu will take on Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals of the Miami Open in arguably the biggest match of her career since winning the 2021 US Open.

Her best run since being crowned US Open champion at the age of 18 continued as she brushed aside American 17th seed Amanda Anisimova in straight sets.

Raducanu did not drop a point on her serve in the first set, which underpinned an impressive performance that saw her move into the top 50 of the world rankings.

""I've come a long way in the last week since Indian Wells [where Raducanu lost in the first round],"" she told Sky Sports Tennis.

""I wasn't necessarily feeling great about my tennis, about everything, but this week I have some really good people around me who I trust and who I have fun with off the court, and that is extremely important.

""When I play my best I am definitely authentic, true to myself and creative. I feel when I am boxed into a regimented way then I am not able to express myself in the same way. So I'm happy with how I realised that this week.""

Earlier this month, Raducanu ended her coaching trial with Vladimir Platenik after just two weeks following her first-round exit from Indian Wells, saying it ""wasn't quite heading in the right direction"".

Currently looking for a permanent presence in her box alongside fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura, Raducanu has found a short-term solution in working alongside Jane O'Donoghue, her childhood mentor and former LTA coach, and Mark Petchey, a former coach of Andy Murray and commentator and broadcaster on the Tennis Channel.

The 22-year-old admits feeling ""comfortable"" and ""relaxed"" in her new environment where she is able to express herself on and off the court.

She said: ""I think I'm playing better than in Australia this year. Circumstances change all the time, but for me the biggest thing I'm proud of is just finding the competitive spirit and being there for every ball and drawing that out of myself. I think that's kind of been missing in the last few months and even few years at times.

""I think that's the biggest win for me, just feeling a lot of hunger, feeling on the court competitive, wanting to run down every ball, and that's the biggest win I would say from this week.""

For the second time in her career, Emma Raducanu has won four matches at a WTA level tournament:
2021 US Open
2025 Miami Open

Raducanu has now won four matches in a row for the first time since that incredible victory in New York and it is the first time she has reached the last-eight of a WTA 1000 event.

Petchey is a former Davis Cup player for Great Britain who was involved in Raducanu's development as a teenager in the years before her US Open victory.

""There's more switching on and off, rather than be 'on' the entire time,"" explained Raducanu.

""I'm someone who works really hard and can be really intense, but sometimes too intense. It's harder to be extremely focused when you need to be on the match court because you're focused from the first minute to the last.

""So I think just being able to switch off and have fun with them and play Spikeball before the match, and we just create certain routines. They bring small doses of happiness that I guess just keep you going, the small things.""

Raducanu also explained her reasons why there is a sense of trust and synergy in the team following the exit of Platenik after a brief stint.

She said: ""He is a great coach. He's so experienced. He's worked with so many players and brought them up to the top and developed players. I respect him a lot as a coach.

""It just wasn't right at the time and I'm not sure going forward, but I think this week was a great eye-opener to when I'm happy and expressive and myself.

""Just having people that I've known for a very long time, since before the US Open, and just those familiar faces is the most valuable thing, for this week at least.

""It's difficult because I just met him and it's difficult to kind of build many years of connection straight away.""

Raducanu added: ""I wasn't feeling great after Indian Wells, but to come to Miami - and then after I stopped with Vlado - to just have familiar faces, people that I knew, people that have really gone through the trenches with me, but also can kind of lift me up at the same time, I think made a big difference.

""Just having them around, people that I really trust, I think that's probably when I started feeling a bit better off the court. That translated on the court. I was freer.""

Raducanu explained the differences in her warm-up routine, which her team have adjusted in Miami, to help make the Bromley star more relaxed ahead of her matches.

""I think before even the first half of the first section of this year, I would be so locked in,"" said Raducanu, who is on the brink of becoming British No 1 again should she reach the semi-finals in Miami.

""Every warm-up would be an hour long. It would just be not much talking, just so focused. A lot of long tennis sessions, long gym sessions and just long days all the time. Then by the time I played the match, I was quite tired.

""I think that's something that we adjusted this week, bringing more fun elements into it, shortening certain things in warm-ups and just adding things that are outside the box.

""To warm up, for example, not just running up and down in a straight line, which can be a bit more tedious, and just playing a game and playing three different sports before we warm-up, getting a good sweat on, laughing. Then you go onto the court feeling a lot more relaxed and every part of you is just looser.

""I think it's worked so far this week. It's definitely a note to take home for me.""

Tim Henman says Raducanu has shown ""some really positive signs"" ahead of her crunch meeting with last year's US Open finalist, Pegula.

The former world No 4 told Sky Sports: ""First and foremost we're a results-based industry here and it's the fact that she's been on court competing and winning. I think that second match against [Emma] Navarro, to come through in those circumstances, she played some brilliant tennis. Navarro served for the match but Emma kept digging deep and found a way to get the job done.

""You reflect on the tournament schedule this year. She's played a lot of tournaments and I think that's a big positive. She hasn't had the results but just the fact that she's out there competing, she doesn't seem to be picking up those little injuries that have set her back so I think she's reaping the rewards for a lot of hard work on the court, in the gym, working on that fitness.""

Physical trainer Yutaka Nakamura, who has previously worked with Maria Sharapova and Naomi Osaka, was added to the team to help improve Raducanu's physical robustness and athletic potential and the signs are looking positive.

""In the big picture, it's still very early days,"" said Henman. ""They've only been working a matter of months. Normally you're talking a matter of years for a relationship to build. That foundation of the physical work but also the trust and understanding of Emma's body so I think there are some really positive signs. I really think Emma's in a good place.""

Raducanu and Pegula have split their two previous meetings. Pegula won in straight sets on the hard courts of Cincinnati in 2022, but Raducanu posted an upset win on grass at Eastbourne last year.

Briton is looking a tougher athlete but can still learn lessons from her quarter-final opponent, Jessica Pegula

Jessica Pegula began her professional tennis journey with a head start on most of her peers. In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL's Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether.

At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player. She failed countless times before she began to soar.

Today, Pegula has established herself as a veteran top 10 player and one of the most reliable members of the sport's elite. Her success was not the result of a dramatic overnight shift – she built her confidence and convictions through her daily work and resilience over a significant period of time.

On Wednesday in Miami, Pegula will face Emma Raducanu in what is now undoubtedly the best tournament of Raducanu's career outside her fateful US Open title run in 2021. After defeating one top-10 American player in Emma Navarro, Raducanu now has the opportunity to measure herself against one of the best in the world in her first WTA 1000 quarter-final.

Although she remains a clear underdog, the Briton should not be afraid. Their two previous matches have both been tight. Pegula won their first and only hard-court meeting in two tough sets at the Cincinnati Open in 2022, but last summer Raducanu defeated Pegula in three gruelling sets on home soil in Eastbourne to finally clinch her first top‑10 win.

The pair share some similarities. Both possess smooth, compact strokes off each wing, effortless two-handed backhands and excellent timing, which they use to take the ball early and take time away from their opponent. Both relish smothering rivals with vicious early service returns. Only one of them, however, has come close to directing those assets into consistent winning tennis over a long period.

Pegula particularly thrives in fast conditions and few players are as adept at deflecting the power generated by her foes. One of the biggest ­challenges for Raducanu will be to find the right balance between imposing herself by ­playing ­offensive tennis and also keeping Pegula uncomfortable by mixing up the speed and trajectory of her ball.

The 22-year-old has done a great job this week of frustrating opponents with her backhand slice and defence, but Pegula is a level above them all.

Alongside improvements to her serve, forehand and movement, Raducanu's three months of work with her new fitness coach, Yutaka Nakamura, the one person who has accompanied her throughout the year, appear to be paying off. She looks like a considerably stronger and more durable athlete.

after newsletter promotion

Good fortune has certainly played a role in this run, with Amanda Anisimova and McCartney Kessler ­struggling against her with physical issues in consecutive matches. For so long, Raducanu was always the player breaking down on the court. She now looks physically prepared for all possibilities and she recovered well from a gruelling, attritional second-round win over Navarro. Against those struggling opponents, she made her own luck by refusing to allow them back into the matches.

As she faces off against Pegula, there are also lessons that Raducanu, at 22 years old, can learn from her. Successful tennis careers are a marathon and each is completely different. Some players fulfil their potential at a young age but others must reckon with a far longer journey.

While the past three and a half years have at times been brutal for Raducanu, mere match wins often hard to come by, players who work hard each day will always have opportunities to turn their fortunes around. With that in mind, it is notable that Raducanu has competed more frequently this year than ever before. Even as she struggled through numerous bitter losses in recent months, to her credit she kept on ­rolling with the punches and showing up. This week at least, she is finally landing some of her own.

On Tuesday Novak Djokovic – a six-time tournament winner in Miami – stormed into the men's quarter-finals after thrashing Italy's 15th seed Lorenzo Musetti 6-2, 6-2 on a rain-affected day of play. Next up he will play Sebastian Korda of the US, seeded 24th, on Thursday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The Hope College women's tennis team started league play with a bang as the defending title holders with a 7-0 win over Alma College on Tuesday.

 WTA
                        


WTA Staff


With the BNP Paribas Open underway in Palm Desert less than two months after devastating fires swept through Los Angeles, the WTA and WTA Foundation mobilized quickly to support affected tennis communities -- with WTA Legends Alexandra Stevenson and Gigi Fernandez leading the charge.

When Palisades Charter High School burned down, Stevenson, who coaches six of the school's players, knew immediately how badly the girls' and boys' varsity teams had been impacted, many without home courts, and some without homes.

Working with Palisades coach Bud Kling and WTA Foundation Executive Director Ann Austin, Stevenson organized a trip for both teams to attend the BNP Paribas Open on March 7. World No. 5 Madison Keys stopped by for photos and autographs, while Maria Sakkari and Austin, on behalf of the WTA Foundation, presented a $10,000 donation to support the displaced students.





 WTA
                        

“It was so important for these players to receive positive support after nearly two months without any normalcy in their lives,” Stevenson said. “Seeing the best players in the world compete at the BNP Paribas Open was uplifting and energizing.”

Meanwhile, Gigi Fernandez partnered with the WTA Foundation to raise $50,000 -- including a $10,000 pledge from USTA Southern California -- to help rebuild the Palisades Tennis Center and assist the fire-ravaged Altadena community.

“When I learned what had happened in the Los Angeles area, I was compelled to act,” Fernandez said. “Less than six months ago, my house was flooded and my car lost in back-to-back hurricanes. Ironically, just before that I'd started planning a nonprofit,  so I followed through and created one to help disaster victims.”

While filing for 501(c)(3) status for her new nonprofit, ""Tennis for Hope,"" Fernandez partnered with the WTA Foundation as a fiscal sponsor to begin raising funds.

At a ceremony in the WTA suite at Indian Wells, Fernandez -- joined by Hall of Famer Pam Shriver -- presented Palisades Tennis Center Director Mike Tomas with a check for $25,000 to support the rebuild. She also announced a second $25,000 commitment to aid the Altadena tennis community.

“The WTA Foundation's mission is to change lives,” Austin said. “We responded immediately to provide both financial and emotional support to those whose lives have been changed forever by these fires.”","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}"

Edwardsville, which is riding a 24-year streak as the Southwestern Conference champs, got a start on a possible No. 25 with a 9-0 win over Alton Tuesday at the Edwardsville Tennis Complex.

Despite the loss, Alton coach Jesse Macias saw positives.

""I'm proud of the energy and attitudes our players had today,"" Macias said. ""They were excited to start the season and never got their heads down. I want to see that same effort and attitude all year.

""I saw a lot of positives today, starting with Alex Tuetken. He was stellar in singles and doubles.  He played No. 1 doubles with his brother and they played probably the best doubles team in conference.

""Alex and Nik played well at times, but what was most promising was how they communicated throughout the match. They had good body language and really supported each other, it's a good sign.""

""That match will make Alex better.  Nik, Joe, and Jayden (Beirman) all played well at times.  They adjusted to the pace and serves after a while.  They all talked about reducing unforced errors after the match, so I know what we need to work on.  But, the effort was there in every match.  

""Our best singles matches were probably at No. 5 and No. 6,"" Mcias said. ""Erik and Carter (Hanebutt) were having fun out there and learning on the fly.  Erik had a really tough matchup because Schaefer Bates has been to state every year since his freshman year.

""You know Edwardsville is loaded when he is their number five.  But, Erik was hitting his serves and making adjustments throughout the match.  He and Carter can take some lessons from today.""

Big Rapids' Breanna Beaver gets ready to serve during workouts on Tuesday with members of the Ferris PTM program.

BIG RAPIDS – It was indoor tennis for the Big Rapids Cardinals on Tuesday but was well worth it with a visit from members of the Ferris State University Professional Tennis Management program.

Girls tennis players received tips and instruction from PTM members in the high school gym. R.J. Tessier, the PTM director, said the students from his program spent two hours working with the  BR players.

“We work with the JV team and then we work with the varsity team,” Tessier said. “With this nasty weather, we've been indoors.”

The PTMers focused on showing Big Rapids players various skills.

Junior Breanna Beaver appreciated being able to work with the PTMers.

""I definitely have learned quite a bit,"" she said. ""They're really helpful. I really enjoy working with them. They're teaching us how to serve, how to do a quick backhand, how to do a quick forehand.""

The tennis world is mourning the passing of former Top 10 star Juan Aguilera, who died at the age of 63 on Tuesday in Barcelona, his native city. 

Aguilera, who turned pro after winning the Junior Spanish Championships in 1980, claimed five ATP Tour titles and reached No. 7 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 1984. The Spaniard retired in 1991, and was able to fully immerse himself in two of his great passions: literature and rock ‘n' roll.

Inspired by the games of Spanish legends such as Manuel Orantes, Pepe Higueras and Fernando Luna, Aguilera took his first steps in the sport at Club Tennis de la Salud, in Barcelona. Juan stepped away from the game between the ages of 15 and 16 to focus on music. In the 80s, he even played guitar and drums with the rock band Palo.

Aguilera was blessed with a natural ability to play tennis, bestowing a certain elegance and ease upon the court. The owner of a sublime one-handed backhand, he soon caught the eye of coaches, who considered him to be one of Spain's biggest talents.



Rafael Nadal, a 22-time Grand Slam champion, took to his X account on Tuesday afternoon to remember Aguilera: “My deepest condolences to the family and friends of Juan Aguilera, a great figure in our sport whom we will miss dearly. Rest in peace.”

Those that had recognised Aguilera's ability were soon vindicated. He claimed the biggest win of his career when he defeated Boris Becker, the then-world No. 3, in Hamburg in 1990, 6-1, 6-0, 7-6, in the year the ATP Masters 1000 category was introduced.

To get to that final, Aguilera left in his wake the likes of Goran Ivanisevic, Michael Chang, Jim Courier, Magnus Gustafsson, and Guy Forget. Aguilera, who was not even planning on playing in the tournament because he had to go through qualifying, benefitted from the withdrawal of two players and went straight into the main draw in what would turn out to be the best week of his career.

 “I just played the best match of my life”, said Aguilera after defeating Becker in a rain-soaked final, which was paused for over an hour while the Spaniard had a 6-1, 5-0 lead. When they returned to the court, Aguilera finished off his masterpiece and was crowned champion in the German city against the biggest player of the day.



Aguilera also won the Hamburg title in 1984, prior to its upgrade to an ATP Masters 1000, where he beat Yannick Noah and Guillermo Vilas en route to the title. He also triumphed in Aix-en-Provence (1984), Bari (1989) and Nice (1990). Additionally, Aguilera reached four clay-court finals: Bordeaux (1983), St. Vincent (1989), San Remo (1990) and Palermo (1990). His best Grand Slam result was a run to the Roland Garros fourth round in 1984. 

“We have lost so much talent, both on and off the court. Joan was special in every way. Sensitive. Thoughtful. Clever. Impulsive. Talented. And above all, a heart too big for this world,” said Tomás Carbonell, who reached No. 40 in the world and played alongside Aguilera, on X.

The Spaniard decided to dedicate his time to teaching when he retired. He became a coach at a club in Premia de Dalt, where he would teach children all the things he had learned during his professional career.

Novak Djokovic cruises into the Miami Open quarter-finals with a 6-2 6-2 win over Italy's Lorenzo Musetti; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Novak Djokovic won 12 of the last 14 games of his match against Lorenzo Musetti to crush the Italian 6-2 6-2 and move into the quarter-finals of the Miami Open in his best performance since the Australian Open.

The momentum in the rain-delayed match seemed to swing in Djokovic's favour when he complained to the chair umpire in the opening set over a serve-clock warning.

That frustration seemed to spark the Serbian, who broke the next game for a 4-2 lead and never looked back in the presence of an adoring crowd that included tennis greats Serena Williams and Juan Martin del Potro.

""I was star-struck. It was amazing to see first DelPo, obviously a long-time friend and a rival, so happy to have him around and get his support from the box,"" Djokovic said.

""It was amazing, it was (the) first time to have DelPo in the box, so I want to thank him really for coming. And Serena, that was a surprise.""

Six-time Miami champion Djokovic crushed an exquisite backhand winner for a 5-2 second-set lead and sealed the win when Musetti double-faulted on match point.

""Actually, when I had that down-the-line passing shot, I pointed to her (Williams) and asked her whether it was OK,"" he added.

""She said, 'yeah, it was fine'. If Serena says it was fine, then it was amazing by everyone else's standards.""

Fresh off a record 411th ATP Masters 1000 victory in his last match, Djokovic was slow out of the gates against Musetti as the Italian went up 2-0 in the first set.

A hold of serve was all the Serbian fourth seed needed to turn the match around, rattling off six straight games to claim the first set in 40 minutes.

The second set provided much of the same as Musetti was simply outmatched by his 37-year-old opponent, Djokovic wrapping up the win in one hour and 23 minutes.

Speaking to Sky Sports' Gigi Salmon, Djokovic said: ""I think the level is really good. It's my best match of the tournament and for me what I like to see as I progress through a tournament is raising the level of tennis and that's what's happening.

""Overall it was a great performance, phenomenal to have Serena courtside. I think it was the first time, maybe the second time she's watched me live so I was a bit nervous. Del Potro as well, long-time rival and friend in the box, so I had to deliver.""

The 37-year-old also gave an interesting insight into the working environment alongside Andy Murray, saying: ""We don't know each other as people that well.

""We shared the same stage on the tour for a very long time - we've known each other maybe 25 years since the junior days, but when you're rivals you don't interact as much and actually before the match today we sat down waiting for matches to restart because of the rain delay, so we had a very interesting talk.

""I always had tremendous respect for Andy as a player but now even more so as a person. Such a nice guy and I'm really grateful he cares about me, that he cares about me doing well on the court.

""It's still surreal in some sense that one of my biggest rivals is my coach. He's pumping and jumping around the box, sometimes I kind of pinch myself and think, 'is this real? Is this a dream?' So it's great.

""We're trying to get the most out of this relationship as a player-coach and also spend some quality time together. I think Miami has been really good. We were here early - a week before the tournament started - so we played some golf, we enjoyed some dinners together and we're having fun.""

Djokovic will take on Sebastian Korda in the next round after the American beat Gael Monfils 6-4 2-6 6-4.

Musetti's compatriot Matteo Berrettini had a better day on Tuesday, eclipsing Australian 10th seed Alex de Minaur 6-3 7-6 (11-9) to set up a clash with home favourite Taylor Fritz.

Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo upset fifth seed Casper Ruud in straight sets to reach the quarter-finals, where he will face Grigor Dimitrov.

Meanwhile, top seed Aryna Sabalenka battled past China's Qinwen Zheng 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals of the women's tournament.

""Always tough battles against her,"" Sabalenka said after extending her head-to-head record against Zheng to 6-0. ""Today I had to work really hard, especially in that second set. I'm really proud of the way I handled my emotions.

""Even when something didn't work well, I was there and I was fighting for every point.""

She will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in the next round, after the sixth seed conquered Magda Linette of Poland in straight sets.

Six-time Miami Open champion Novak Djokovic soared into the quarterfinals on Tuesday evening, with a fellow GOAT watching in the stands and a beloved champion sitting in his box.Facing Lorenzo Musetti on a Tuesday plagued by rain, Djokovic picked apart the 15th seed, 6-2, 6-2, to secure his eighth last eight appearance in the Magic City and first since the event relocated to Hard Rock Stadium. Serena Williams was among those in attendance, with Juan Martin del Potro enjoying the atmosphere directly behind the Serbian's current coach and fellow major winner Andy Murray.“It was great to have Serena courtside, and Del Potro in my box, and Andy as my coach,” Djokovic told journalists afterward with a grin. “It was a bit star-studded, to be honest!“When I saw Serena in particular, I was like, oof! I'm very happy, but I'm also nervous. I gotta come up with my best performance.”

Down 0-2 to start, Djokovic grabbed full control by reeling off the next nine games—in part by turning a time violation issued by chair umpire Fergus Murphy during the fifth game into significantly increased speeds on his first serve and forehand.As clean as a backhand crosscourt pass one can hit secured a 4-2 advantage and the 37-year-old poured it on by building a strong rhythm on his serve.Musetti lifted his arms in the second set after saving a pair of break points to stop the bleeding at 0-3. Up 4-1, 0-15, Djokovic put his iconic jets on full display via north and south movement and after Musetti netted the open put-away, looked at Williams with a point to his knees.Two games later, Djokovic locked up the victory when Musetti double-faulted. He paid tribute to del Potro by imitating his takeback forehand in celebration.

""I'm very happy with my performance, my attitude on the court,"" Djokovic said. ""I always try to be aggressive, didn't want to really give him a chance to come back. He's a very dangerous player if you give him time. A very talented player on all surfaces, he's proven that over the last few years...""I had a slightly slower start in the first two or three games. (I needed to) get the engines going, but once I won that close fourth game to break back, I never looked back. I won from 0-2 down, I think, nine games in a row.""A round earlier, Djokovic set the record for most wins at the 1000 level when he surpassed Rafael Nadal with 411. The Belgrade native is bidding to lift his 100th career trophy and can move within two wins of achieving that milestone if he advances past Sebastian Korda.The No. 24 seed fended off Gael Monfils, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, to avenge his Indian Wells defeat to the Frenchman. In January 2023, Korda held a championship point on Djokovic before the legend battled back to clinch the Adelaide crown.

Miami is filled with players who are shaking off slow starts to 2025. You can add Djokovic and Korda, who will play the last match of the night session on Wednesday, to that list. Coming into this tournament, neither had won a match since the Australian Open in January.Now here they are in the quarterfinals. Korda has beaten a Top 10 opponent in Stefanos Tsitsipas, and survived a three-setter, and a long rain delay, against Gael Monfils. Djokovic has yet to drop a set, and on Tuesday he was in vintage cruise control in a 6-2, 6-2 win over Lorenzo Musetti, a player who has pushed him to the limit on a couple of occasions before.

Djokovic and Korda have played once, in the Adelaide final in 2023, and it was good one. The Serb escaped 6-4 in the third, but Korda used that performance to launch himself into the second week at the Australian Open soon after.In this meeting, Djokovic is the steadier rally player, which means that Korda will likely have to take chances and be the aggressor to win. Korda has a penetrating forehand and an excellent two-handed backhand; how much damage can he do, and how well can he combine pace with consistency, over the course of two or three sets? A win is there for the taking for Korda, but I'll say Djokovic will make it a little too high a hill to climb. Winner: Djokovic—Steve Tignor👉 Click here for more news on the Miami Open.

Grayson Bellwin prepares for a forehand for the Dogs. 

It's a tale of two teams for the Mary Persons Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs as the boys dropped both matches last week to Whitewater and Stratford, while the girls beat the same schools.

On Thursday, March 20, MP hosted the Stratford Eagles at the Dog Pound and the girls won 4-1 while the boys lost 1-4.

The girls kicked off the winning with Millie Meadows breaking a personal 4-game losing streak by defeating her Lady Eagle 1 Singles adversary 6-3, 7-6(5) after being down 1-5 in the second set. After being named player of the match, Meadows told her coaches that she didn't want to play a tiebreaking 3rd set and turned in some of her best tennis of the season thus far by making it all the way back to a 2nd set tiebreak to secure the victory. 

Barnes felt the same way about not wanting a 3rd set, but her match was less dramatic, securing a 6-0, 6-1 victory at the 2 Singles line. Barnes controlled her shots well and was able to take advantage of opponents' mistakes on a very windy afternoon. 

Clay won at 3 Singles arena to seal the win. She turned in a gritty performance against her Stratford 3 Singles opponent, who played a very similar game to her. At the end of the night, Clay defended Court 5 well with a 6-4, 7-6(3) win.

Hickman and Bass knocked off the Stratford 1 Doubles 6-2, 6-3, using a variety of shots to keep their opponents off balance, and did a great job finishing points in adverse weather conditions. The only loss of the evening came from 2 Doubles, where Berlin and Fleckenstein fell in a 3rd set tiebreaker 3-6, 6-4, 0-1(3). The girls now sport an 8-2 record on the season and eye a top 10 ranking in the GHSA playoffs.

The boys had a more difficult time with Stratford, with Morris taking a set to gain any traction before ultimately falling 0-6, 3-6. The sophomore Morris and the rest of the Bulldogs will look to bounce back in his next match against region foe Spalding. Dowdy and Spence each struggled with the wind and unforced errors by losing 0-6, 0-6, and 1-6, 0-6 respectively.

1 Doubles turned in the best performance of the evening, etching a 5-7, 6-4, 1-0(2) win. Player of the match, Chris Simpson, played marvelous tennis with partner Reid Hilton, as they tinkered with their game until they found the opening to overcome the attack from the Stratford 1 Doubles duo. Their success did not spread to 2 Doubles, however, as House and Rainey fell 0-6, 2-6. The boys are now 6-3 and will need a victory in at least 1 of the next 2 region matches to host a play-in match after Spring Break to advance to the Region tournament and a berth in the GHSA playoffs.

Coach Trey Bernard had these insights after last week's match-ups:

“The ladies are peaking at the right time of the season, having won 5 matches in a row and having a shot to secure the 2 seed in the region prior to the tournament. Our gentlemen have an opportunity to right the ship this week against Spalding and put them back on track. We've faced quality opponents and have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. It's now up to us to use that experience well and put any negative thoughts in the past. We must grow together and celebrate wins and losses by what we gain, not by what we lose. Coach Ellison, Coach Berlin, and I continue to support each and every one of our players on and off the courts as they grow and mature through experiences.”

MP traveled to Fayetteville to square off against the Wildcats on Tuesday, March 18. The boys quickly found themselves with their backs against the wall against the Wildcats, who now sport an 11-4, 7-1 (2-AAA) record. Ben Morris and Tyler Dowdy failed to generate any traction against their 1 and 2 Singles players, losing both matches 6-0, 6-0. Aiden Spence had a bit more success against the 3 Singles line of Whitewater but ultimately fell 4-6, 2-6 despite serving well.

Doubles didn't fare much better as both doubles squads fell 2-6, 3-6 against their Wildcat opponents. Both the 1 Doubles team of Reid Hilton and Chris Simpson and the 2 Doubles team of Braxton House and John Rainey were defeated with a combination of unforced errors and well-placed shots by their adversaries. This loss dropped the gentlemen to 6-2 overall and 4-2 in Region 2-AAA.

The ladies looked as if they were following the same path as the gentlemen as 1 Singles player, Millie Meadows, fell 1-6, 0-6 against her counterpart from Fayetteville. Rebekah Barnes had a back-and-forth first set but was also defeated by a margin of 4-6, 1-6. The comeback was afoot, however, when Sarah Clay brought her undefeated record to the floor and survived her match 6-2, 7-5. The 2 Doubles team of Brooklyn Fleckenstein and Marlee Berlin capitalized on mistakes and breezed through their match 6-2, 6-3, leaving the 1 Doubles match to be the decider.

Ava Bass and Izzy Hickman (eventual player of the match) went to war against the Wildcat 1 Doubles players as they wrapped up a 6-4 first set. Unforced errors and timely shots from their opponents left them on the wrong side of a 4-6 second set, which brought us to the ultimate set. Bass and Hickman raced out to a 3-0 lead and never looked back, finishing off the Wildcats 1 Doubles 6-1 and securing a huge victory. With the victory, the ladies improved to 7-2, 5-1 in Region 2-AAA, putting them in a great position to advance to the GHSA Playoffs after play-in matches conclude following Spring Break.

Next up for the Bulldogs will be Thursday against the Spalding Jaguars. It will also be Sponsor Night to celebrate all the Friends of the Program for the MP/MCMS Tennis Teams. Tuesday, April 1, MP will host ACE and celebrate Senior Night with our senior Ava Bass, and Thursday, April 3, will conclude the regular season slate in a region match-cup against Trinity Christian. All matches start at 4 p.m., and the team would love to see as many folks as possible come to cheer them on in their matches.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

World No. 2 Iga Swiatek has been granted extra security after an incident in which an unruly fan verbally abused her during a practice session at the Miami Open last weekend, according to a report by the BBC. The increase in security comes ahead of Swiatek's match on Wednesday, where the five-time world champion is set to face Alexandra Eala in the quarterfinals.

The spectator, who was characterized as ""aggressive and taunting,"" allegedly shouted personal insults about Swiatek's family after previously having sent her abusive messages online. The BBC reports that Swiatek's team reported the incident, leading tournament organizers and the WTA to put extra security in place ahead of her match on Wednesday.

""Security is a top priority. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues,"" a spokesperson for Swiatek said. ""Constructive  criticism is one thing, and threats, hate speech or even disturbance  during training is another -- this cannot be condoned.""

The matter involving Swiatek comes on the heels of another incident in which fan behavior proved disturbing for a women's tennis star. At the Dubai Championships, a stoppage in play occurred after Emma Raducanu was frightened by the presence of a man who had been stalking her during her second round match, leading to enhanced security being put in place for her. The man in question has since been banned from all WTA tournaments.

Dragon Boys Tennis has started this week, and according to Head Coach Jeff Adams, it is looking to be an exciting season! The Dragons have returning players and many new players, as well as new teams on the schedule. 

One of the main challenges of tennis is having such a short regular season.  Coach Adams said that any delays in practices or any postponements of matches can really impact the team in a negative way.  

“We are lucky that again this year, we are not shoveling snow off the courts.  Also, with such a short regular season, we need to keep everyone healthy and free from injury,” he said. 

Adams also commented, “As players are learning new skills, we try to apply them to both singles and doubles play.  We want our players to be strong in both singles and doubles, so we will use many different line-ups like we did last year to determine what will work best against our opponents when we head into the postseason play. We also have many new players this season at some of the younger grades. We want to give them a solid foundation in the fundamentals of tennis while having fun and playing many matches against a variety of different teams.” 

Adams and his assistant coaches are already planning and strategizing what will work best for the Dragons this season as they hope again to be a contender for the conference and section title.

There are four returning seniors who earned varsity letters last year; Bryer Berube, Julian Kozisek, Aaron Rootkie, and Tucker Wasson.  

“These guys have grown up playing tennis since they were in elementary school and have been such great role models for the underclassmen. They are all great leaders for the tennis program,” reported coach Adams. “We also have many returning players from last year who are all battling for the 10 starting spots on the varsity team.  Many of the guys worked on their skills during the off season and have experience playing against some tough opponents.”

The captains for this upcoming season are senior Bryer Berube and junior Brady Berglund. “Both of these guys were captains last year, said Adams, “and the team will lean on their experience and leadership throughout the season.” 

Adams is assisted by Anna Miller and Samantha Tate. Both of these coaches have high school and college playing experience. Dennis Howard (varsity volunteer) has been an integral part of the tennis program for many years. Coach Howard works mainly with the varsity boys and the summer program. Coach Adams is grateful for his willingness to volunteer his time to help the tennis program grow over the years.  

“We also get the expertise of Coach Eberhart and Coach Unverzagt during the season!” said Coach Adams.

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, has written a new book, ""My Mother and I."" It details the monarch's upbringing and his relationship with Queen Elizabeth II.

Prince Harry is parting ways with Sentebale, an African charity he co-founded in honor of his mother, Princess Diana, nearly two decades ago. 

On Monday, the Duke of Sussex, his co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and fellow trustees resigned amid tensions with Dr. Sophie Chandauka, the chair of the charity's board.

""Nearly 20 years ago, we founded Sentebale in honour of our mothers. Sentebale means ‘forget-me-not' in Sesotho, the local language of Lesotho, and it's what we've always promised for the young people we've served through this charity,"" Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, who co-founded the charity in April 2006, said in a joint statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

PRINCE HARRY CONFIRMS $1.5 MILLION FROM MEMOIR PROCEEDS WILL BE DONATED TO CHARITY

""Today is no different. With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organization until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same. It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.""

The Duke of Sussex co-founded the charity with Seeiso, whose mother died in 2003, after visiting Lesotho during his gap year in 2004. Sentebale was created to help people in Lesotho and Botswana living in poverty and those suffering from HIV and AIDS.

According to The Times, the charity had carried out a ""restructuring"" of its board as ""confirmation of its strategy to redeploy senior roles to be proximate to most of the team and programs in southern Africa."" The outlet reported that Chandauka is believed to be suing the charity's trustees after they voiced concerned over her leadership.

Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso shared that the trustees ""acted in the best interest of the charity,"" despite ongoing tensions with Chandauka. 

""These trustees acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down, while keeping the well-being of staff in mind. In turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.""

""We thank all the trustees for their service over the years and are truly heartbroken they've had to follow through with this act,"" the statement continued. ""What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.""

""Although we may no longer be patrons, we will always be its founders, and we will never forget what this charity is capable of achieving when it is in the right care,"" the statement concluded.

Former trustees Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Dr Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West also explained why they chose to unanimously resign from the charity. 

""As a group of British and African trustees, we have made the difficult decision to unanimously resign as board members of Sentebale,"" the former trustees said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""We are deeply proud to have supported the visionary work of the Founding Patrons Prince Seeiso and Prince Harry, who founded Sentebale in memory of their mothers. For two decades, Sentebale has championed hundreds of thousands of children and young people, providing them with care, training and life skills, which not only benefit each individual child they support, but their families and their communities as a whole.  

""Today's decision is nothing short of devastating for all of us, but we see no other path forward as the result of our loss in trust and confidence in the Chair of the board,"" the statement continued. ""Our priority has always been, and will always be, what's in the best interest of the charity, and it's desperately sad the breakdown in relationship escalated to a lawsuit by the Chair against the charity, to block us from voting her out after our request for her resignation was rejected. We could not in good conscience allow Sentebale to undertake that legal and financial burden and have been left with no other option but to vacate our positions. This was not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity.""

""Our sincere hope is that with this decision, the road ahead steadies for the sake of our staff and the communities we serve,"" the statement concluded. ""Sentebale is simply too important to us.""

Chandauka has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Sentebale in the High Court, and accused both princes of playing the ""victim card,"" CBS reported. 

""I chose to join Sentebale first and foremost as a proud African who understands that – in the spirit of Ubuntu [interconnectedness] – to whom much is given, much is expected,"" she said in a statement to CBS. ""Everything I do at Sentebale is in pursuit of the integrity of the organization, its mission, and the young people we serve. My actions are guided by the principles of fairness and equitable treatment for all, regardless of social status or financial means.""

""There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct,"" the statement continued. ""Discerning readers will ask themselves: why would the chair of the board report her own trustees to the Charity Commission? Why would the High Court of England and Wales accept her application to hear the matter at all if the case had no merit?

""Well, because beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir [misogyny directed towards Black women] and the cover-up that ensued. I could be anyone.""

We might feel like we know Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash already. We have seen them live off rice and beans in the Australian rainforest in I'm a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! We have watched Joe learn to ice skate in Dancing on Ice and Stacey declutter homes in Sort Your Life Out.

But now the couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.

It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, ""and then you panic a bit"", she tells the BBC.

But ultimately, they are just a normal family ""doing our best in every aspect of our lives"", she says.

""So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.

""That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect.""

There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.

""We don't want to glamourise anything,"" says Joe. ""Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting.""

Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016. 

They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.

""When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,"" says Stacey, ""so they were little.""

When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. ""To be honest, we're just a family.""

Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.

""I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,"" he says. ""There's no distinction.""

When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.

""We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,"" says Stacey. ""And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.""

As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.

""We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,"" says Joe. ""It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.""

Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.

Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a ""mother lion"".

""Don't go near her cubs, she'll have you,"" he says.

""She's just the most wonderful person,"" he says. ""She's kind, she's loving. I mean there's nothing about Stacey I would change. People love her in the streets and, imagine me, I'm so lucky, I get to spend the rest of my life with her.""

Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is ""so magic"" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.

Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are ""polar opposite"" she says.

""I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',"" says Joe. ""So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.""

Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.

""I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be… fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,"" she says.

For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.

Stacey says the teenage boys can revert to being younger again which is important because they grow up so quickly in the modern world. They have the chance to still play, with the excuse being ""oh, I'm only doing it because it's with my little brother or little sister"", she says.

It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.

Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.

""I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,"" says Stacey. ""When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.""

She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.

Stacey relied on Zach and ""asked a lot of him"", she says, needing him to help her.

""I haven't done that with the younger ones, because I've had Joe,"" she says, ""and that's just the reality of my situation. It's been different through the years.""

But Zach, now 17 himself, is ""probably one of the most empathetic, caring, emotionally intelligent young teenagers that I know,"" says Stacey.

""I feel like that has a lot to do with how we grew up together, and how life was for us in the beginning.""

Having more children is not currently on Stacey's radar, she says, as her body is still recovering from having three children in five years.

""My pelvic floor is dying,"" she laughs. Although Joe would love to have more.

Stacey still has plans to increase their brood - but this time it is their animals. 

""I literally walked into a conversation the other day and I heard 'cow',"" says Joe, ""and I was like, 'No way, we can't have a cow'.""

""We were just throwing a few ideas around,"" says Stacey. ""I would love to have animals and make our own milk and collect our own eggs and grow our own vegetables.

""That's a dream of mine - but in the future. At the moment, we're still rearing children.""

Stacey & Joe starts on Tuesday 1 April at 20:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.

Carol Alt explained her ""Paper Empire"" co-star, Denise Richards, and her husband played a major role in her decision to launch an OnlyFans account.

Denise Richards' husband plays a key role in the behind-the-scenes work of her OnlyFans page.

During the latest episode of her reality show, ""Denise Richards & Her Wild Things,"" the OnlyFans model revealed how her account has revitalized her acting career, with the help of her husband, Aaron Phypers.

""I will say that I'm in the top 1% of creators on OnlyFans, so I am very grateful,"" she said, via People. ""It's very empowering, especially for someone my age, that people still want to see me that way.""

OnlyFans is a subscription-based platform that allows creators to share and monetize their content, which can be explicit.

Richards credited her husband for helping curate her risqué content, explaining, ""He's so supportive. He knows what men love, and he'll go through all the photos and say, ‘This is good. Do this. This is what guys like.'""

She admitted that she had previous reservations about the adult content site. But once she dived into OnlyFans, she found the platform to be ""quite lucrative.""

""When I joined OnlyFans, I was very concerned that I possibly could lose some jobs, but it was the opposite. I got more offers. I get roles where I'm like, the trophy wife or the sexy one.""

Richards continued to debunk any misconceptions of OnlyFans and added that she enjoys engaging with her fans in a different way.

""People think that I'm just doing whatever — that's not true,"" she explained. ""I actually look at it as a way of communicating with fans, and not the way that you're thinking.""

Meanwhile, Richards' daughter has recently had the opposite experience.

Sami, the daughter of Richards and Charlie Sheen, slammed Hollywood's ""double standard"" as she confessed that OnlyFans had hurt her modeling career. 

""I really want to get headshots done to transition into modeling,"" the 21-year-old OnlyFans model explained later in the episode. 

""I've met with a couple agencies, and they don't like that I do OnlyFans. It's so frustrating because it's like, that's how I pay my rent. If you'll take me seriously, I won't have to do it anymore.""

Her mother shared the same sentiments as her daughter and applauded Sami for breaking into a bold industry. 

""That's the shame of it,"" Richards said. ""Why judge based on them trying to make a living while they're trying to pursue their career?""

""I really am so proud of Sami. I wish I had her f---ing balls when I was her age.""

Sami replied, ""Well, look who my f---ing family is. You guys are crazy. In a good way!""

""Denise Richards & Her Wild Things,"" sheds light on Richards' life as a mom of three. Richards shares daughters, Sami, 20, and Lola, 19, with Sheen. She adopted her youngest daughter, Eloise, 13, on her own in 2011 after her divorce from Sheen.

 Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.

Jennifer Lopez made a hefty purchase following her divorce from Ben Affleck.

According to property records obtained by People, the 55-year-old A-lister purchased an $18 million home in California ""near Los Angeles.""

In July 2024, the ""Jenny From the Block"" singer and the 52-year-old actorput their shared Beverly Hills mansion on the market for $68 million — which, per People, has yet to sell. The former power couple originally purchased the property for $60.8 million in 2023.

Also in July, one month before their divorce, Affleck purchased a $20.5 million five-bedroom, six-bathroom residence in Los Angeles, which he has lived in since. Meanwhile, the Monster in Law actress sold her New York City penthouse for $23 million that month.

Lopez's big move comes about three months after her divorce from the Good Will Hunting star was finalized. After splitting up in the early 2000s, the duo reconciled their romance in 2021 and had a whirlwind romance as they tied the knot in a Las Vegas ceremony in July 2022. Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck in August 2024, the same day of the two-year anniversary of their second wedding ceremony in Georgia.

Affleck opened up about his divorce from the""Let's Get Loud"" singer in an interview with GQ published earlier this week. The Gone Girl actor explained that no big event led to the marriage's demise.

""There's no scandal, no soap opera, no intrigue. The truth is, when you talk to somebody, 'Hey, what happened?' Well, there is no: 'This is what happened,'"" the three-time Golden Globe winner revealed. ""It's just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do.""

Affleck praised the Grammy-nominated singer and noted that he would not share the reasoning behind their breakup.

""There is no 'So-and-so did this' or 'This was the big event.' It sounds more like a couple's therapy session, which — you would tune out of someone else's couple's therapy after a while,"" he remarked. ""For one thing, you start going, 'Okay, clearly this person has got these issues. Clearly they have these issues.' And the reason I don't want to share that is just sort of embarrassing. It feels vulnerable.""

We now know who will direct Zendaya in the Ronnie Spector biopic.

Barry Jenkins will helm the film about the lead singer of The Ronettes for A24, ABC Audio has confirmed.

David Kajganich will write the original screenplay. Rather than reading like a traditional biopic, the film's story will reportedly center on the singer's life with her first husband, the troubled producer Phil Spector.

Zendaya was first announced to be in talks to play the rocker in 2020. She was hand-selected by Ronnie Spector, who was an executive producer on the film before she died, to play her. Shortly after Ronnie Spector died in January 2022, Zendaya took to Instagram to pay tribute to the star.

""This news just breaks my heart. To speak about her as if she's not with us feels strange as she is so incredibly full of life,"" Zendaya wrote. ""There's not a time I saw her without her iconic red lips and full teased hair, a true rockstar through and through.""

Zendaya also thanked Ronnie Spector for the time she spent helping to prepare her to take on the role.

""Ronnie, being able to know you has been one of the greatest honors of my life,"" Zendaya wrote. ""Thank you for sharing your life with me, I could listen to your stories for hours and hours. Thank you for your unmeasured talent, your unwavering love for performing, your strength, resilience and your grace.""

This marks the third collaboration between A24 and Jenkins after the Oscar-winning Moonlight and the upcoming film Sorry, Baby, for which he serves as a producer.

Daisy Edgar-Jones is collecting internet boyfriends like infinity stones.

The actress told Elle in a recent cover story that she just happens to have worked with many actors that the internet loves — including Paul Mescal, Jacob Elordi, Harris Dickinson, Andrew Garfield, Sebastian Stan and Glen Powell.

“Just Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler left!” Edgar-Jones said. “I have worked with basically all of the internet's boyfriends.""

Edgar-Jones said she feels lucky to have worked with actors who are secure enough in themselves to let her be the first-billed actor.

“I'm lucky that every actor I've worked with has been incredibly supportive of me being the lead. Glen, Sebastian, Paul, all of them. I think that's why they're so successful and so loved and so good: that they are so generous, and they really serve the story and are not serving themselves,"" Edgar-Jones said.

In particular, she described acting alongside Mescal in Normal People as being ""like playing tennis with your best friend.""

This good luck seems to have Edgar-Jones pinching herself in anticipation it one day runs out.

""I'm nervous for the point that it comes to working with someone who might not be so chill with it,"" Edgar-Jones said. ""Because there's so much ego that can exist in this industry.”

The Oscar-winning No Other Land filmmaker spoke out following the horrifying news that his Palestinian co-director was beaten by settlers and detained by Israeli military in the West Bank days ago, until he was ultimately freed.

“Sadly, the US Academy, which awarded us an Oscar three weeks ago, declined to publicly support Hamdan Ballal while he was beaten and tortured by Israeli soldiers and settlers,” Yuval wrote on X.

The new series Dope Thief is currently streaming on Apple TV+. The show follows longtime friends Ray and Manny, who met while incarcerated as teens. They become low-level grifters upon release, posing as DEA agents and robbing small-time drug dealers until things go left and they find themselves on the run.

Brian Tyree Henry, who portrays Ray, tells ABC Audio that people like Ray and Manny who get caught up in a cycle of violence while trying to survive should receive support from those around them. 

""What we tend to do sometimes is that we see people in those situations and we immediately come up with our own prejudices about how they got there,"" he shares. ""Here you have these two men who've been incarcerated, whatever their circumstances were, since they were 15 years old. And usually you have a system that keeps you there and wants to keep you trapped into that dynamic for the rest of your life.""

""And it's like, well, how do we embrace them? How do you see a future when the system is telling you you don't deserve?"" Brian continues. ""And so for me, it's really about the people who are there to embrace them when they come out. When you see them on the street, when you see them trying to make it ... you have to in some way open yourself up in a way to understand them, to listen to them [and] allow them to be vulnerable instead of keeping them trapped within this system that told them that they couldn't be anything."" 

Wagner Moura portrays Manny in the show.

Even hours after the latest Daredevil Born Again two-part premiere dropped on Tuesday (Wednesday in India), Episodes 5 and 6 continued climbing trends on social media. With some Ms Marvel and The Champions teases being sprinkled in the latest episodes and the fifth episode being hailed as one of the best “filler” episodes “in a minute,” fans couldn't stop raving about the renewed Marvel TV brilliance. On top of that, Daredevil Born Again Episode 6 fleshed out an explosive and savage instance of “cross-cutting” between Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock and Vincent D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk / Kingpin. 

While the March 26 (India) two-episode schedule witnessed viewers blowing up social media trends, Daredevil's brand-new and refurbished journey on Marvel TV is far from over. After the successful ride of Daredevil Born Again Episodes 5 and 6 (“Sic Semper Sysema” and “Isle of Joy”), we're still left with three more offerings before the season wraps up, presumably on a dark and bloody note, and Season 2 gives way. 

Next time, the action-packed saga returns to its usual weekly schedule. Here's what lies ahead.

A post shared by Matt Murdock (@daredevil)

As a revival and continuation of the original Netflix series, the Daredevil TV saga was reborn earlier this month. The crime drama adventure commenced with Daredevil Born Again's two-episode premiere on Disney Plus on Tuesday, March 4, in the US. Fans were treated to episodes titled “Heaven's Half Hour” and “With Interest.” 

The following week on March 11, Episode 3 “The Hollow of His Hand” dropped. Thereafter, Episode 4 “Straight to Hell” brought fans back to their Marvel haven on March 18. Finally, this week, the show again resorted to a two-episode release with Episodes 5 and 6.

Titled “Excessive Force,” the upcoming episode will be out on Tuesday, April 1. Fans in the US are advised to tune in to Disney Plus at 9 pm ET / 6 pm PT. Meanwhile, Indian fans may redirect their attention to JioHotstar on Wednesday, April 2, at 6:30 am IST.

The final two episodes of the season will follow the same Tuesday/Wednesday release pattern. Episode 8 “Art for Art's Sake” will be out on Tuesday, April 8 (ET/PT), or Wednesday, April 9 (IST). Similarly, the Daredevil Born Again Season finale will start streaming on April 15 (ET/PT) or April 16 (IST).

The official synopsis of the latest Marvel Television offering reads, “Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), a blind lawyer with heightened abilities is fighting for justice through his bustling law firm, while former mob boss Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) pursues his own political endeavours in New York. When their past identities begin to emerge, both men find themselves on an inevitable collision course.”","{'href': 'https://www.financialexpress.com', 'title': 'The Financial Express'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=entertainment+news","Kesari Chapter 2: Before Akshay Kumar, this OTT actor played lawyer CS Nair, who troubled British Empire","https://www.indiatvnews.com/entertainment/news/kesari-chapter-2-before-akshay-kumar-this-ott-actor-played-lawyer-cs-nair-who-troubled-british-empire-2025-03-26-982406","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 08:09:32 GMT","

The teaser of Akshay Kumar's much-awaited film Kesari Chapter 2 was released on Monday and the actor is receiving rave reviews for his presence. The 2019 film Kesari was inspired by the historic Battle of Saragarhi, while the latest installment Kesari Chapter 2 depicts the brutal Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 and its aftermath. For those who don't know, the upcoming film is adapted from the book 'The Case That Shook the Empire' written by Pushpa Palat and Raghu Palat and the film also stars R Madhavan and Ananya Panday. But do you know, the role that Akshay Kumar is playing in Kesari Chapter 2 has already been played by OTT actor Taaruk Raina? Moreover, know who was Sir Chettur Sankaran Nair, whose life story has made it to films and series. 


Waking Of A Nation was also based on the similar incident

SonyLIV's last release Waking Of A Nation is also based on a similar foreground, where a lawyer looks deep into the aftermath and events leading to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The show is headed by Taaruk Raina and it also features Bhawsheel Singh, Nikita Dutta and Sahil Mehta in pivotal roles. While the series was not much appreciated due to its overdramatic and sloppy. However, people have a lot of expectations from Kesari Chapter 2. 

In the film, Akshay Kumar plays the role of the famous lawyer Sir Chettur Sankaran Nair, who not only raised his voice against the killings but also shook the British Empire. He not only resigned from his prestigious position in the Viceroy's Executive Council but also raised his voice against British atrocities. 

Sir CS Nair, first Indian to be appointed as Advocate General

Born in an aristocratic family in Manakara village of Palakkad, Kerala in 1857, he received his schooling in an English medium school in his hometown. After his schooling, he joined Presidency College, Madras. In the 1870s, Nair earned a law degree from Madras Law College and began his career in the Madras High Court. In 1887, he was elected President of the Indian National Congress. He became the first Indian to be appointed Advocate General of the Madras Government in 1907 and later became a judge in the same court.

CS Nair had resigned from the post of Viceroy's Executive Council

At the time of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, CS Nair was serving as the Education Minister and the only Indian representative in the Viceroy's Executive Council, a great honour for any Indian. When the massacre took place, press freedom was curtailed in Punjab. The British distorted many facts about the events. But when the news reached CS Nair, he was deeply upset. Angered by this act, CS Nair decided to resign from the Executive Council as a protest. In his letter, he wrote, 'If a country is to be governed, it is necessary to massacre innocent people…and if any civil official can call in the army at any time and together they can massacre people like Jallianwala Bagh, the country is not worth living in.'

CS Nair refused to apologise to Michael O'Dwyer

CS Nair's resignation shocked the British, which led to the lifting of martial law in Punjab. In 1922, CS Nair wrote a book called Gandhi and Anarchy, in which he accused Michael O'Dwyer of promoting atrocities during the massacre. Michael O'Dwyer was a lieutenant of the Punjab government, and by that time he had been dismissed and returned to England.

Nair's accusation led to Michael O'Dwyer suing him for defamation, which was heard in the High Court of London. The judge hearing the case was biased against the Indian defendant. The case lasted for five weeks and was the longest in the history of the court. Since there was no unanimous verdict in the case, Nair was faced with two options: apologise to O'Dwyer or pay a sum of 7,500 pounds, and he chose the second option. The film Kesari Chapter 2 is based on this case.

Though the case did not go in CS Nair's favour, his efforts to bring the massacre to light had an immediate impact. From the abolition of press censorship and martial law to the investigation of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the fight of lawyer CS Nair made him a poignant figure in our history books.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt slams The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg as an ""anti-Trump hater"", after he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat with top US officials

She also repeats the Trump administration's position that there was no classified information in the leaked messages 

Messages from the group chat newly published by The Atlantic appear to show Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing information about US air strikes on Yemen earlier this month

One message from Hegseth outlines timings for ""when the first bombs will definitely drop"". We explain three sensitive messages from the Signal chat here

Earlier, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told a House committee that adding a journalist to a high-level chat about air strike plans was ""a mistake""

Goldberg says he did not originally plan to publish the most sensitive messages from top US military and intelligence officials, but now wants the public to draw their own conclusions after the White House attempted to ""downplay the significance"" of the messages

Watch: White House says there were 'certainly no war plans discussed' in group text

Edited by Brandon Livesay, with Bernd Debusmann reporting from White House

Secretary of State Marco Rubio just spoke to media in Jamaica, where he is on a state visit.

He's asked about the Signal scandal and says it's obvious that ""someone made a big mistake and added a journalist"". 

""Nothing against journalists, but you ain't supposed to be on that thing,"" he says.

Rubio downplays his role in the Signal chat group, saying he messaged to identify his point of contact, and then messaged again after the strikes were carried out to offer his congratulations.

He says the information shared on Signal wasn't intended to be made public, but says the Pentagon has said none of the information threatened the lives of service members.

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

Karoline Leavitt, in her recently concluded White House press conference, presented the American public with a choice. 

Who did they believe in the group-chat controversy? Jeffrey Goldberg, whom she characterised as an “anti-Trump sensationalist reporter"", or Pete Hegseth, the Senate-confirmed secretary of defence who “honourably served our nation in uniform”.

That's the kind of framing that's a red meat appeal to Donald Trump's base. The administration's strategy for handling this crisis is to trust that Trump's loyal supporters - and the Republican politicians they help elect - will stick with the president. 

Such faith has carried Trump through more formidable situations than this, and White House officials seem to believe that it will do so again.

There are risks to this strategy, however. While the base may keep Trump afloat, Republicans need more than their core supporters to win elections – such as state races later this year and in the 2026 congressional mid-terms. 

Undecided middle-of-the-road Americans may look at the details of the text messages and be less willing trust that Hegseth is honestly assessing whether his own actions put national security at risk. 

And trust, once eroded, is difficult to win back.

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has again denied sending war plans in the Signal chat group.

Speaking to reporters from an air strip in Hawaii, Hegseth says the information in the messages released today ""doesn't look like war plans"".

""They know it's not war plans"", he says, ""there's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information"".

His job, Hegseth adds ""is to provide updates in real time... that's what I did"".

The messages from Hegseth, which were shared by The Atlantic, noted what time F-18 fighter aircraft were scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes would take place and in what time frame ""trigger-based"" attacks could occur.

Mike Waltz criticised Joe Biden's team for email-related security conduct in the past

By Jake Horton

Several of the Trump officials apparently included in the Signal chat have previously criticised other people for their handling of classified information.

In June 2023, Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who appears to have added the Atlantic journalist to the chat - criticised President Biden's National Security Adviser, external for sending ""top secret emails"" to a private account.

In January 2023, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, who was a Fox News host at the time, criticised Biden as ""nefarious, sloppy and dumb"" after classified documents were found in his garage.

Talking about the same incident, Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: ""Any time documents have been removed from their proper setting it's a problem, I don't care who did it.""

And earlier this month US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, when posting about government leaks, external, said that ""any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such"".

JD Vance gave a very quick set of remarks to US Marines this afternoon, making no mention of the Signal scandal that is dominating headlines. 

He talked about the importance of investing in the military and praised the Marines for their sacrifices to the US. 

Minutes ago, White House Press Secretary Karoline said she needed to cut her media briefing short so it wouldn't overlap with Vance's speech.

Leavitt faced dozens of questions from reporters about the Signal chat group.

The White House briefing just wrapped up a bit earlier than usual, with Karoline Leavitt saying she didn't want to interfere with JD Vance's speech.

So let's pivot to that.

The vice-president is speaking to US marines in Quantico, Virginia as his team battles allegations that they mishandled sensitive military information. A reminder that Vance was one of the members of that Signal group chat which inadvertently included a journalist.

During his first few minutes of speaking, Vance is yet to address the Signal scandal that is gripping the White House. He talks to Marines about investing in the US military ""like we never have before"".

We're listening in and will bring you more updates as they happen.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

We've just wrapped up an unusually short - and tense - news briefing at the White House. It lasted 24 minutes. 

The ending was abrupt, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt citing a desire to not ""counter-programme"" Vice President JD Vance's remarks at a US Marine Corps base in Quantico. 

News briefings vary in length, but in this administration have rarely timed in at under 45 minutes. 

As a reminder, we're now also going to hear directly from President Trump from the Oval Office at 16:00 ET. 

Billionaire Elon Musk will look into how a journalist from The Atlantic was added to a Signal chat that included some of the highest-ranking officials in Washington DC, Leavitt says.

Musk, who has made news headlines for leading the charge to terminate thousands of federal workers, will now ""figure out how this number was inadvertently added"" to the Signal chat, she says.

Musk's assistance will help ""ensure this can never happen again,"" Leavitt continues.

Watch: Signal messaging app is 'secure and efficient', says White House

A reporter has just asked Leavitt whether Trump's team will review how often they'll use Signal in the wake of the scandal, and other applications like it. 

Leavitt repeats her earlier remarks that the app is ""improved"", and claims that Signal is the ""most safe and efficient way of communicating"" when officials can't be inside a room together. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

As part of her defence of the administration, Leavitt says that Pete Hegseth - the defence secretary - and Mike Waltz would ""never do anything intentionally"" to put American lives at risk. 

The attacks in Yemen, she says, were successful. 

""We are not going to be lectured about national security and American troops by Democrats in the mainstream media who turned the other cheek with the Biden administration because of their incompetence,"" she says. 

Specifically, Leavitt pointed to the deadly US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, claiming that Biden believed the operation to be ""acceptable"".

Reporters are continuously pressing Leavitt on why the White House would not describe details about airstrikes - as were discussed on Signal - as classified information. 

Leavitt sticks to the messaging that has come from both Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, that ""none of this was classified"". 

When reporters continue to pushback, Leavitt interjects: ""Do you trust the Secretary of Defense, who was nominated for this role?

""Or do you trust Jeffrey Goldberg, who is a registered Democrat and an anti-Trump sensationalist reporter?"" Leavitt says, continuing her attacks on The Atlantic's editor-in-chief who was inadvertently added to a group chat where top US officials discussed an impending strike on Houthi targets.



As Leavitt continues to be pressed by reporters, she says that National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - the one who allegedly added The Atlantic's editor-in-chief to the Signal messaging thread - has ""taken responsibility"" for the mistake. 

The president ""continues to have confidence in his national security team,"" Leavitt adds. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

Karoline Leavitt often criticises members of the media during these briefings, and has often taken a combative tone towards some journalists - particularly those of the Associated Press amid its ongoing spat with the White House. 

Her remarks today, however, demonstrate a harsher tone than we've seen before. 

In nearly every answer of hers regarding Signal, Leavitt has included direct attacks on journalist Jeffrey Goldberg and his career as a reporter, accusing him of lying to help ""get us into the Iraq war"". Leavitt has also claimed Goldberg publicly discredited himself by ""absurdly"" reporting on allegations of collusion between Trump and Vladimir Putin in 2016. 

Some reporters in the room audibly gasped when Leavitt started to speak about Goldberg.

Watch: White House says there were ""certainly no war plans discussed"" in group text

As expected, Leavitt is being pressed by reporters about the White House's description of the Signal group chat conversation. 

One reporter notes that the text messaging thread detailed the exact time of the planned attacks before they occurred as well as some of the military assets that were to be used. 

He asks Leavitt, what would you call this discussion if not war plans? 

Leavitt responds that the texts contained ""sensitive policy discussions"", but she adds, that the conversation should reassure the American people of Trump's ""dynamic"" military and intelligence team. 

Leavitt again states that ""no war plans"" were discussed, and that ""no classified materials"" were sent in the group chat.

Leavitt has finished her opening remarks and is now taking questions from reporters, including one who asks how ""comfortable"" President Trump was with the conversations shared on the Signal messaging thread by some of his top officials.

Leavitt says Trump's response to the situation has remained the same. She says he himself has wanted to address the scandal. 

Leavitt says Trump told her he will ""tackle this story"". 

Leavitt also says that Signal is an ""approved app"" that the Department of Defense and CIA have loaded onto government phones because it is ""secure"". 

After a lengthy criticism of the journalist who was inadvertently invited to a group chat with top US officials on Signal, Leavitt then pivots to attacking former President Joe Biden.

She claims the reason why Trump approved attacks on Houthis in Yemen in the first place was ""because of Joe Biden's incompetence and pathetic weakness on the world stage"".  

Leavitt says the Houthis grew emboldened ""immediately"" after Biden took office in 2021. 

""President Trump's strength and resolve eliminated those terrorists,"" Leavitt says. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

In keeping with what has become standard practice, today's briefing begins with Karoline Leavitt touting what the administration sees as its most notable achievements of the last several days. 

She then quickly pivots to attacking the media for coverage of ""Signalgate"". 

""There were certainly no war plans discussed,"" Leavitt says, echoing a talking point she shared on social media earlier. 

She directly attacks The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg as an ""anti-Trump hater"" and registered Democrat. She also criticises his career as a reporter, including during the Iraq War and the 2016 electoral campaign. 

""The real story here is the overwhelming success of decisive military action against Houthi terrorists,"" Leavitt continues. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has a briefing planned to begin shortly.

Reporters are filing into the room. 

Those without assigned seats are crowding the aisles, jostling for spaces they believe will give them a higher chance of being called on. 

Briefings are relatively infrequent in Trump's administration so far, with only one or two happening each week. 

They are often crowded - but today promises to be particularly well-attended by the US and global media that covers Washington as the Signal group chat story continues to develop. 

Without even the slightest exaggeration, I've not heard anything else being discussed among reporters since I arrived here several hours ago. 

You can watch the briefing by clicking ""watch live"" at the top of this window.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

I've been exchanging messages with Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East and a retired CIA paramilitary officer, who since yesterday has been expressing concern with how the information in the Signal chat was being handled.

Of particular concern, Mulroy tells me, are the messages which depict a ""real time order of battle sequence of an ongoing operation"". 

""It is highly classified and protected,"" he says. ""Disclosure would compromise the operation and put lives at risk. Next to nuclear and covert operations, this information is the most protected."" 

Mulroy also pushed back on the assertion, from White House officials, that the contents of the group chat do not constitute ""war plans"". 

The primary difference between ""war"" and ""attack"" plans - which are both sensitive and classified - is one of scale. 

""War plans are generally the plan to conduct an entire conflict,"" he adds. ""Attack plans stem from that and go down to the individual unit level and are very detailed."" 

""One could actually make the argument that attack plans are more sensitive, because they are more detailed and specific on time, place and manner.""

In one part of the newly published Signal chat, CIA Director John Ratcliffe notes that the US is ""mobilising assets"" to help a strike, but that a delay would ""not negatively impact"" the agency's work in Yemen.

Ratcliffe has said there was no classified information discussed in the chat.

US President Donald Trump has ordered the declassification of all FBI files related to the agency's investigation into his first election campaign's alleged contacts with Russia.

The FBI launched the ‘Crossfire Hurricane' investigation in July 2016 to examine whether Trump – then a presidential candidate – or members of his campaign were colluding or coordinating with Moscow to influence the election.

In a memorandum released on Tuesday by the White House, Trump directed the Attorney General to make the materials available to the public “immediately.”

Crossfire Hurricane was prompted by the ‘Steele Dossier' – a compilation of unverified rumors about Trump and his alleged links to Russia. The dossier was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, and reportedly funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign.

Crossfire Hurricane preceded the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose subsequent ‘Russiagate' investigation found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.

In 2023, the US Justice Department's (DOJ) special counsel John Durham – appointed to review the origins of the Crossfire Hurricane probe – concluded that the FBI and DOJ had “failed to uphold their mission” by relying on biased information to surveil Trump.

Durham criticized the FBI for showing a “serious lack of analytical rigor,” particularly when handling information from politically-affiliated sources.

It was also revealed that the Steele Dossier had been used by the FBI to obtain court permission to spy on Trump's campaign. In 2019, Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz reported that the FBI had made “basic, fundamental, and serious errors” in its warrant application.

‘Crossfire Hurricane' and Mueller's Russiagate investigation cast a long shadow over Trump's presidency, with allegations of “Russian collusion” persisting in the media even after Mueller's report found no evidence to back them up.

In a video posted on Tuesday on Truth Social, Trump said after signing the order: “This was total weaponization. It's a disgrace…but now you'll be able to see for yourselves.”

Addressing journalists, he added: “You probably won't bother because you're not going to like what you see.”

Trump had previously ordered a full declassification of Crossfire Hurricane during the final days of his first term, but the documents were never released. According to a 2023 CNN report, a binder containing highly classified information later went missing.

Western military aid to Kiev and sanctions against Russia cannot shift the balance of power in the Ukraine conflict, according to the US Intelligence Community's 2025 Annual Threat Assessment.

The intelligence community's official coordinated evaluation of an array of threats lists Russia, China, North Korea and Iran as countries which represent a challenge to US interests.

Moscow holds the advantage on the battlefield, having adapted to outside efforts to assist Ukraine, the report's authors explain. The “grinding war of attrition” is expected to further weaken Kiev, “regardless of any US or allied attempts to impose new and greater costs on Moscow.”

While the conflict has taken a significant toll in terms of manpower, the assessment notes that it has also afforded Moscow “a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war.”

This experience probably will challenge future US defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.

Russia has proven to be “adaptable and resilient” during what it views as a Western proxy war, enhancing its military capabilities across several domains, including unmanned systems, electronic warfare, and the integration of cyber operations with conventional military maneuvers, the report explains.

It warns that Western efforts to undermine the Russian economy “have accelerated its investments in alternative partnerships and use of various tools of statecraft to offset US power, with China's backing and reinforcement.”

Beijing considers the US use of unilateral sanctions illegal under international law and rooted in a “Cold War mentality.” The US assessment states that major non-Western nations are poised to align with Russia in order to pursue policies that challenge American dominance, such as de-dollarization.

The continuation of the Ukraine conflict risks unintentional escalation, the document cautions. Russia is prepared for such scenarios, armed with a substantial strategic arsenal that includes both conventional and nuclear weapons, as well as cyber-warfare and anti-satellite operations capabilities.

“Russia's air and naval forces remain intact, with the former being more modern and capable” than at the start of direct hostilities, the report states.

The US intelligence community posits that both Moscow and Kiev may have reasons to avoid a hasty resolution on unfavorable terms. Russian President Vladimir Putin perceives that “positive battlefield trends allow for some strategic patience,” while Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky likely fears that a clear defeat could “prompt domestic backlash.”

Israel's controversial plan to relocate the people of Gaza abroad – a proposal supported by US President Donald Trump but widely condemned by the international community – has left the lives of millions hanging in the balance. Hailed as an “opportunity for renewal” by its proponents and labeled “ethnic cleansing” by critics, the plan aims to empty the war-torn enclave, offering those leaving a chance to rebuild their lives abroad. 

However, with Arab and African nations firmly closing their doors, and Gazans themselves torn between despair and defiance, the question remains: Is this truly a route to stability, or merely another chapter of displacement and uncertainty?

Israel remains committed to relocating Gazans. Earlier this week, the Political-Security Cabinet approved Defense Minister Israel Katz's proposal to establish a voluntary transitional administration for residents willing to move to third-party nations, aligning with President Trump's vision.

Initially announced in February at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the initiative proposes relocating nearly two million Gazans to various countries, away from the now devastated territory described as a “demolition site.” Abroad, Palestinians would supposedly gain opportunities previously unavailable to them.

Meanwhile, Hamas – the governing authority in Gaza – would be disarmed and dismantled, allowing reconstruction efforts to turn the Strip into a Middle Eastern riviera.

The proposal quickly drew widespread condemnation. The United Nations characterized the plan as “ethnic cleansing,” underscoring that forced displacement violates international law. Several Arab nations denounced the proposal as an “injustice” impossible to support. European countries labeled it “unacceptable,” and Hamas dismissed it as “ridiculous and absurd,” with spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warning it could ignite regional tensions.

Inside Gaza, criticism is similarly fierce.

“This is a ridiculous proposal without value,” said Asmaa Wael, a teacher from Gaza сity. “We rightfully own this land and deserve to live here with dignity. We were born here, grew up here, and faced every obstacle and injustice, oppression, and war. We've endured tremendous pressure, and we won't abandon our home.”

The problem is that Gaza, a 140-square-mile territory along the Mediterranean coast, has been completely destroyed. 

Since the war began in October 2023, nearly 70 percent of Gaza's infrastructure has been destroyed. Over 170,000 homes, 200 government buildings, 136 schools, 823 mosques, and numerous hospitals have been bombed.

The human toll is immense, with over 50,000 killed, according to official Hamas statistics. More than 113,000 have been injured, and 1.8 million urgently need shelter.

Asmaa realises that the Palestinian people have no other choice but to live on “the streets and in tents”. But she says that her people have enough patience to pull through.

Asmaa is far from being alone. Other Palestinians we have spoken to but who preferred to remain anonymous said they would rather stay on their land simply because they doubted the outside world would have anything better to offer them. Others were scared their departure would have a bad impact on their extended family that would remain; and there were also those who were afraid they would never be able to go back.

But not everyone shared that pessimism. Omar Abd Rabou, a young journalist based in Gaza, views the Trump proposal as “an opportunity for renewal and reconsideration of the Palestinians' futures.” He believes that relocation “may provide those who wish to change their environment with access to new resources and better opportunities”. It would give people, he reasoned, a personal and economic growth.

Some have already taken that path. According to Israel's channel 12, 35,000 Gazans have left the Strip since October, 2023. In March alone, a thousand Gazans have evacuated themselves, with 600 new applicants on their way out. And Israel believes their numbers will only be going up.

Many of those who left so far are Palestinians with foreign passports, or those who have residence or relatives abroad. Those, who stayed, have nowhere to go but Israel and the US are actively looking for volunteers, who would be willing to absorb the masses.

Yet no countries have stepped forward. Jordan, despite agreeing to accept 2,000 sick children and their families, rejected broader displacement plans. Egypt's President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi canceled a planned visit to Washington, fearing US pressure to accept Gazans – an action he refuses.

African nations, including Sudan, Somaliland, and Somalia, have also been approached. Sudan was offered military and reconstruction aid, Somaliland international recognition as an independent state, while Somalia denied any talks had occurred. 

Negotiations remain stalled, despite the US pressure suggesting Egypt's military aid could be at risk if Cairo refuses to accept half a million Gazans – a scenario Egypt is unlikely to accept given its own economic challenges.

In recent years, Egypt has faced significant economic difficulties. In 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded Egypt's GDP growth forecast to 3.6%, a reduction from the previous projection of 4.1%. Similarly, forecasts for 2025-2026 were adjusted downward from 5.1% to 4.1%. Accepting half a million additional residents on top of its current population of 117 million is thus not feasible.

Egypt's hesitations extend beyond economic concerns. Cairo has long battled terrorism linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and fears radical elements disguised as civilians could infiltrate, threatening national security.

To Asmaa, the reluctance of neighboring Arab countries borders on betrayal.

“Arabs are fearful and incapable of taking meaningful action,” she laments. “They're preoccupied with oil, agreements, and business deals. Our children are slaughtered in their infancy, and these countries respond with empty slogans because they're not the ones suffering.”

Asmaa believes the solution will not come from Gaza's neighbours. The resolution will only be achieved, she believes, if the war ends and with it Israel's occupation. 

But for Omar, the situation is not black and white. Unlike many in the Strip, who have taken a rather militant approach towards Israel, especially after October 7, Omar is speaking about co-existence and about solving the conflict through diplomatic means. 

“Resolving this conflict does not require escalation but rather a constructive dialogue. There must be room for negotiation that ensures security and rights, away from the use of force or continued escalation,” he reasoned.

Yet, with the resumption of hostilities on March 17, and the ground incursion that followed shortly after, the prospect of peace seems nowhere in sight.

US government officials are permitted to use the Signal encrypted messaging app for work purposes if decisions made during communications are also recorded through formal channels, CIA Director John Ratcliffe has said.

On Monday, The Atlantic magazine detailed purported confidential conversations among top members of the administration of US President Donald Trump regarding military strategies against Houthi fighters in Yemen.

The author of the article, Jeffrey Goldberg, claimed to have gained access to the information after being added to a chat on Signal called ‘Houthi PC small group' by US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. According to Goldberg, the chat included Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and other high-ranking officials.

During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday, Ratcliffe acknowledged that he was also a member of the group, in which airstrikes on Yemen were discussed by cabinet members.

“One of the first things that happened when I was confirmed as CIA director [in late January] was Signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA as it is for most CIA officers,” he recalled.

According to the CIA chief, the practice of communicating via Signal had already been in place during the previous administration of US President Joe Biden.

“It is permissible to use [Signal] to communicate and coordinate for work purposes. Provided that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels,” Ratcliffe explained, adding that his “staff implemented those processes.”

Gabbard, who had also been questioned, insisted that “there was no classified material that was shared” in the chat.

Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia insisted during the hearing that the leak was “one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior” by Trump's team. “If this was the case, the behavior of an intelligence officer, they would be fired,” he insisted.

Politico reported on Tuesday, citing sources in the White House, that roughly a half of the administration thought that Waltz “should not survive” in his post after mistakenly adding a journalist to a government chat.

However, Trump later downplayed the incident, calling it “the only glitch in two months” and asserting that it had “no impact at all” on the military operation. “Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he is a good man,” the president said.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Wednesday that four U.S. soldiers who went missing while training in Lithuania have died, but that he did not yet know the details. 

A U.S. official would say only that the four soldiers were involved in a training accident. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not comment on the status of the soldiers. 

Rutte said during a trip to Warsaw that he had received word of the deaths of the four soldiers and that his thoughts were with their families and with the United States. 

“This is still early news so we do not know the details. This is really terrible news and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones,” Rutte told reporters in Warsaw. 

A statement from U.S. Army Europe and Africa public affairs in Wiesbaden, Germany said the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time.

Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported that four U.S. soldiers and vehicle were reported missing Tuesday afternoon during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Belarus. 

The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all NATO members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. 

Relations soured further over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Ukraine in its fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte appealed for unity on Wednesday as European nations scale up their armed forces and defense industries after the United States warned that Europe must take care of its own security in future.

Trust between the 32 member countries is at a new low. NATO was formed 76 years ago to provide stability in Europe; a guarantee underwritten by the United States. But the Trump administration says America's security priorities now lie in Asia and on its own borders.

“Let me be absolutely clear, this is not the time to go it alone. Not for Europe or North America,” Rutte said in a speech in Warsaw. “The global security challenges are too great for any of us to face on our own.”

Rutte said that “there is no alternative to NATO” even as some allies worry about the U.S. commitment to the organization's central principle that an attack on one ally must be considered an attack on them all, while Washington demands that European countries stop free-riding on its massive military budget.

His warning comes as Europe tries to wean itself off its security dependence on the United States, just as it reduced its reliance on Russian energy after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine three years ago, amid a drive to buy more European military equipment.

“Yes, Europe needs to know that Uncle Sam still has our back, but America also needs to know that its NATO allies will step up and play their full part, without restrictions and without capability gaps,” Rutte said. “It's only fair. Reassurance is a two-way street.”




His comments come on the eve of a visit to Greenland by U.S. Vice President JD Vance. President Donald Trump has not ruled out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory belonging to NATO and European Union member Denmark and this has deeply unsettled many allies. 

Still, Rutte said he is “absolutely confident” about the U.S. commitment to NATO's Article 5 security guarantee. He added that “nothing can replace America's nuclear umbrella, the ultimate guarantor of our security.” Britain and France are also nuclear powers but their arsenals are tiny by comparison.

Asked on March 13 whether U.S. forces would defend an ally which came under attack from Russia, Trump said: “We'll make sure it doesn't happen.” Trump also said that “you have to keep NATO strong. You have to keep it relevant.”

Rutte said he believes that when Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands in June, “we will begin a new chapter for our transatlantic alliance where we build a stronger, fairer and more lethal NATO to face a more dangerous world.”

He said that ambitious new spending targets would be set. Twenty-three NATO member countries are estimated to be meeting the current guideline of more than 2% of their gross domestic product on national defense budgets. Rutte has said that the new target would be “well north of 3%.”

Earlier on Wednesday, at talks with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Rutte warned Russia that the alliance would always stand by Poland or any other member and that its reaction to an attack would be “devastating.”

Tusk said it was important to be prepared for any outcome of talks between Russia and the United States aimed at ending t he 3-year-old war in Ukraine.

NATO members along its eastern flank, particularly Poland and the Baltic states, are extremely worried that the talks could end with a settlement that is favorable to Russia. They fear such an outcome would allow Putin to rebuild his country's forces and threaten other countries in the region in the coming years.

Rutte said that neither Putin nor anyone else should assume they could get away with something like that.

“If anyone were to miscalculate and think they can get away with an attack on Poland or on any other ally, they will be met with the full force of this fierce alliance. Our reaction will be devastating. This has to be very clear to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and anyone else who wants to attack us,” Rutte said.

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A panel of Brazil Supreme Court justices on Wednesday unanimously accepted charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro over an alleged attempt to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, and ordered him to stand trial.



Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet has accused Bolsonaro and 33 others of attempting a coup that included a plan to poison his successor, current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and kill a Supreme Court judge.



The justices said seven close allies should also stand trial on five counts: attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage characterized by violence and a serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.

The former president has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and says he's being politically persecuted. A lawyer for Bolsonaro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.



“It seems that there is something personal against me,” Bolsonaro told journalists after the panel's decision. “The accusations are unfounded.”



Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction carries a sentence of up to 12 years. When combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars.



“Coups kill,” Justice Flávio Dino said when casting his vote. “It doesn't matter if it happens today, the following month or a few years later.”






Gonet on Tuesday said those facing the charges sought to keep Bolsonaro in power “at all costs,” in a multi-step scheme that accelerated after the far-right politician lost to the current president.



As in his February indictment, Gonet said part of the plot included a plan to kill Lula and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who were put under surveillance by the alleged conspirators. The plan did not go ahead at the last minute because the accused failed to get the army's commander on board, Gonet said.



“Frustration overwhelmed the members of the criminal organization who, however, did not give up on the violent seizure of power, not even after the elected president of the republic was sworn in,” he said.



That was a reference to the Jan. 8, 2023, riot when Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Supreme Court, presidential palace and Congress in Brasilia a week after Lula took office.

De Moraes on Wednesday showed the panel a video with scenes from that day. “We had a very violent coup attempt,” he said. “A savage violence, in total incivility, with the request for military intervention in the coup d'état.”



Bolsonaro's running mate during the 2022 election and former Defense Minister Walter Braga Netto, ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres and his aide-de-camp Mauro Cid, among others, will also stand trial. The court will decide on the others' fate later.



Bolsonaro, a former military officer who was known to express nostalgia for the country's past dictatorship, openly defied Brazil's judicial system during his 2019-2022 term in office.



He has sought to shore up political support before the possible trial, including with a protest in Rio de Janeiro earlier this month. Local media said around 18,000 people attended, based on figures from a monitoring project linked to the University of Sao Paulo.



Bolsonaro's allies had hoped to draw 1 million people. Some analysts have said his ability to mobilize voters is diminishing. He has called for a new demonstration on April 6 in Sao Paulo.



The former president and his allies also will push for Congress to grant amnesty to those in jail for their roles in the Jan. 8, 2023, riot.



Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo, said he didn't expect Wednesday's decision to have much impact on next year's presidential election.



Bolsonaro has already been banned by Brazil's top electoral court from running in elections until 2030 over abuse of power while in office and casting unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system.



“Bolsonaro will claim he's a candidate anyway. Why? To avoid being sidelined. He will claim it's him, or someone he appoints. He doesn't want to give up a political asset he has,” Melo said.

COJIMAR, Cuba (AP) — From a distance, they look like tiny white dots floating on the sea. But get closer, and you'll see people sitting on polyfoam rectangles.



They are fishermen floating on makeshift rafts that have become common on the waters off the coast of Havana, as Cubans find innovative ways to fish in a country where it's complicated — if not impossible — to buy a fishing boat.

As dawn breaks on calm days, hundreds of fishermen set sail in their unusual rafts, known as “corchos” (or corks), along the coasts surrounding the capital, including Cojimar, a fishing village immortalized by Ernest Hemingway, who was passionate about fishing.



The “corchos,” which are usually made of polyfoam sheets pressed by aluminum rods, are about 2 meters long (6 feet) by 1 1/2 meters (5 feet) wide, creating enough space for a person to climb aboard with his fishing rod, reels, pliers and hooks. Most use oars, but some fishermen have installed small engines to ease the physical effort at sea.



They may not be pretty, but they float, and the fishermen claim they don't sink regardless of how strong the waves might be.



“It's in our blood,” said Miguel González, 36, proudly holding up an albacore tuna. “We enjoy it whether there's fish or not.”

Equipped with water for their five-to-six-hour trips, these fishermen also rely on their ingenious “jigs,” handmade squid imitations of resin and iridescent paper, to lure large fish avoiding live bait.



For the “corcho” fishermen, who cannot afford to buy or build a boat, these makeshift rafts mean food on the table and, if the catch is good, some fish to sell at markets or restaurants for extra income.



A small boat in Cuba cost around $30,000, according to some of them, a stark contrast to an average monthly salary of $25. And although many Cubans receive remittances from family members in the U.S., it's still not enough.

Despite the challenges, the “corcho” men are deeply passionate about their work and have formed a close-knit community.



“We help and support one another,” said Rayner Sánchez, a 35-year-old fisherman. “We all fish together here. If anything happens to one of us, we're all in it together. Nobody fishes alone.”

BANGKOK (AP) — Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra easily survived a no-confidence vote in Parliament on Wednesday, following a two-day debate in which rivals charged that she has mismanaged the country and let her father, a former prime minister, control her administration.

Opposition lawmakers argued that she has been unduly influenced by her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin is a popular but highly controversial political figure who was ousted in a 2006 military coup, fled into exile and recently returned to Thailand. 

Paetongtarn's opponents said her administration has improperly favored the personal and financial interests of her family and her father. They also accused her of tax evasion and mishandling many of the country's chronic problems including the slumping economy, air pollution, crime and corruption.

Paetongtarn received 319 votes, with 161 voting against her and seven abstaining in the first no-confidence vote she faced since she took office last year after another Pheu Thai prime minister was removed by the Constitutional Court after it found he'd committed a serious ethical breach.

Afterward, she posted on social media thanking all parties for taking part in the vote.

“Every vote, whether in support or in opposition, is a force that will drive me and the Cabinet to continue to devoutly work for the people,” she wrote.




Paetongtarn heads the Pheu Thai Party, the latest in a string of populist parties affiliated with Thaksin. Thaksin has been at the heart of nearly two decades of deep political divisions pitting a mostly poor, rural majority that supported him against royalists, the military and their urban backers, who accuse him of threatening their status and that of the revered monarchy.

TORONTO (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war is hurting Americans, noting that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low. 

Carney also said the kinship that exists between U.S. and Canada is under more strain than at any point in the two countries storied histories.

“His trade war is hurting American consumers and workers and it will hurt more. I see that American consumer confidence is at a multi-year low,” Carney said while campaigning in Windsor, Ontario ahead of Canada's April 28 election. 

The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its U.S consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021. Trump has plunged the U.S. into a global trade war — all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.

Trump put 25% tariffs on Canada's steel and aluminum and is threatening sweeping tariffs on all Canadian products — as well as all of America's trading partners — on April 2.

“He wants to break us so America can own us,” Carney said. “And it will never ever happen because we just don't look out for ourselves we look out for each other.”

Carney, former two-time central banker, made the comments while campaigning against the backdrop of the Ambassador Bridge, which is considered the busiest U.S.-Canadian border crossing, carrying 25% of all trade between the two countries. It plays an especially important role in auto manufacturing.




Carney said the bridge carries $140 billion Canadian dollars ($98 billion) in goods every year and CA$400 million ($281 million) per day. 

“Now those numbers and the jobs and the paychecks that depend on that are in question,” Carney said. “The relationship between Canada and the United States has changed. We did not change it.”

Carney announced Wednesday a CA$2 billion ($1.4 billion) “strategic response fund” that will protect Canadian auto jobs affected by Trump's tariffs. 

Autos are Canada's second largest export, and the Liberal Party leader noted it employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries, many of them union jobs.

“Canada will be there for auto workers,” Carney said. 

Earlier this month, Trump granted a one-month exemption on his stiff new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada for U.S. automakers, as worries persist the newly launched trade war could crush domestic manufacturing. 

In the auto sector, parts can go back and forth across the Canada-U.S. border several times before being fully assembled in Ontario or Michigan.

Trump has declared a trade war on his northern neighbor and continues to call for Canada to become the 51st state, a position that has infuriated Canadians. The American president has threatened economic coercion in his annexation threats and suggested the border is a fictional line.

The new prime minister, sworn in March 14, still hasn't had a phone call with Trump. It is unusual for a U.S. president and Canadian prime minister to go so long without talking after a new leader takes office.

        The emergency kit should include food, water, and copies of important identity documents, among other items.
    

The EU wants every member state to develop a 72-hour survival kit for citizens to face any new crisis that might emerge as part of its Preparedness Union Strategy which also calls for more stockpiling of essential supplies and for improved civilian-military cooperation. 

The strategy unveiled on Wednesday by the European Commission includes a list of 30 concrete actions it says EU member states need to take to boost their preparedness against potential future crises ranging from natural disasters and industrial accidents to attacks by malicious actors in the cyber or military domains. 

""In the EU we must think different because the threats are different, we must think bigger because the threats are bigger too,"" Hadja Lahbib, the Commissioner for humanitarian aid and crisis management, told reporters. 

Roxana Mînzatu, the Commission for preparedness, speaking alongside her, added that the bloc is ""not starting from scratch"". 

""The COVID pandemic has shown that the added value of acting together in solidarity, in coordination, in the European Union framework is absolutely crucial, This is what makes us more efficient, makes us stronger,"" she said. 

One of the key areas identified is the need to enhance population preparedness with the Commission urging member states to ensure citizens have an emergency kit that allows them to be self-sufficient for a minimum of 72 hours in the event they are cut off from essential supplies.

Several member states already have such guidelines with varying timeframes. France, for instance, calls for a 72-hour survival kit that includes food, water, medicines, a portable radio, a flashlight, spare batteries, chargers, cash, copies of important documents including medical prescriptions, spare keys, warm clothes and basic tools such as utility knives. 

The Commission's plan aims to harmonise guidelines across the 27 member states in order to make sure that ""everyone, at different levels have, to put it this way, a manual of what to do when the sirens go off,"" said a senior EU official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

""The level of preparedness across the Union, across different member states is very different. Preparedness is definitely understood in different ways across member states,"" the same official added.

Another key focus of the strategy is to increase stockpiling of essential equipment and supplies, medical countermeasures such as vaccines, medicines and medical equipment, critical raw materials so industrial production of strategic equipment can continue, and energy equipment. 

Brussels has already put forward over the past few weeks proposals to boost the stockpiling of critical medicines and essential minerals, a competence that lies with member states. 

The Preparedness strategy aims to ""bring this together and to identify how the stockpiles interact, what are the common experiences to learn from each other,"" another senior EU official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said. 

This could entail developing more stockpiles at the EU level for civil protection that would add to existing stocks from the RescEU mechanism. But ""some of these could be at national level, some of them are virtual, basically agreements with the private sector, some of them are physical"".

""That's a discussion we need to have: what's the best possible configuration to guarantee the ultimate objective of continuation of these vital societal functions under all circumstances,"" the official added. 

Improving cooperation between civilian and military authorities in the event of a crisis is also identified as a key priority. The Commission said it will establish a civil-military preparedness framework with clear roles and responsibilities and has called for regular exercises to be carried out to test best practices. 

""We have plenty of examples, unfortunately, in real life, of what kind of threat we need to be prepared (for),"" one of the officials quoted above said, including acts of sabotage, disinformation campaigns, and cyberattacks. 

Identifying the roles of the civilian and military authorities is a process that has already started, the official added, citing sabotage acts in the Baltic Sea.

""We are now analysing how we are reacting and where are the blind spots, where we could be more efficient, where we could be swifter, what else we could do,"" they added. 

All of this work will be underpinned by a new EU crisis coordination hub, and by a risks and threats assessment, the first of which is to be released in late 2026.

Quizzed on why the EU executive needs over a year to produce this document, one of the officials said that that it's a ""complex"" process with ""lots of contributions from member states feeding"" into it and other sectorial analyses released on different timeframes. 

""To bring this together, to analyse this, and to produce a document that is digestible and provides added value, it needs a bit of time. That's why we wouldn't want to do this in a number of weeks, because there's a risk that something is overlooked (...)  and some pieces of analysis and information is missing,"" they said.

The Commission will in the meantime release ad-hoc early warnings and will set up this year a crisis dashboard to keep member states updated about the risks ahead and gather data to prepare.

        Waltz said he couldn't explain how Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was included in the group chat in what the US president called a ""minor glitch"".
    

US National Security advisor Mike Waltz took full responsibility for the group chat in which top officials in the Trump administration slammed Europe while planning strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. 

""I take full responsibility. I built the group,"" Waltz told Fox News on Tuesday, adding he didn't know how the Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who leaked details of the text thread, was added. 

""It is embarrassing,"" Waltz admitted of the bombshell leak critics say has put US national security at risk. 

His comments come a day after Goldberg reported that a user named Mike Waltz added him to the Signal chat.

Goldberg, in an article that broke the story, says he saw classified military plans for US strikes in Yemen and detailed conversations between US officials in which they criticised what they said was ""European free-loading.""

""I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's pathetic,” US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth is reported to have said when discussing how unblocking trade routes via strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen would benefit Europe more than the US. 

Vice President JD Vance, who questioned the necessity of launching immediate strikes, said: ""I just hate bailing Europe out again"".

Furthermore, Washington officials discussed potentially finding ways to get Europe to pay for the US protecting key shipping lanes in the Red Sea. 

Waltz could not explain how Goldberg was added to the group, telling Fox News that he didn't know the journalist and that another, unnamed contact was supposed to be there instead of Goldberg. 

He contradicted US President Donald Trump by saying that a member of his staff was not responsible. 

Trump on Tuesday alleged that somebody who worked with Waltz at a lower level had Goldberg's phone number. 

The US president sought to downplay the entire incident, calling it a ""minor glitch"" that turned out to be ""not a serious one"".

In a Senate hearing on Tuesday, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied that any classified information was shared in the chat, despite Goldberg reporting that the message thread included ""precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing"" on imminent strikes against Houthi militias. 

The leak has sparked fierce backlash from Democrats and several Republicans, who have condemned the incident as a dangerous security failure and questioned the use of the app Signal, which was not approved for sharing classified information.  

European leaders have kept silent on the disdain aimed at the continent revealed in the conversation, which builds on previous public comments by US officials criticising Europe and demanding it should step up and fund its own defence without relying on Washington's support.

        The Democrats have increased their calls for US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign for sending Yemen war plans via a messaging app.
    

A national security scandal involving senior US intelligence and defence officials has intensified with the release of screenshots showing Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing detailed information about airstrikes in Yemen via a messaging app.

The Pentagon leader used a group chat on Signal to communicate with other top Trump administration figures about imminent airstrikes against the Iran-backed Houthis on 15 March this year. 

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, revealed the existence of the chat on Monday, explaining that he had mistakenly been added to the group by Michael Waltz, the US national security adviser. 

Since Goldberg's bombshell piece was published, Democrats have called for Hegseth  and Waltz to resign over what they have called a serious intelligence breach, while the Trump administration has sought to limit the fallout. 

After Trump and his allies insisted that no classified information had been shared in the group, the Atlantic decided to publish a longer transcript of the conversation on Wednesday along with screenshots from the group chat.

In the course of the discussion, Hegseth lists the precise timings of US military operations against the Houthis mere hours before they are due to take place. He also details the weapons and aircraft that will be used. 

In response to the latest revelations, Democrats have ramped up their demands for Hegseth to step down. 

Andy Kim, a Democratic senator from New Jersey, posted on X: “This new signal chat is shocking. Clearly incredibly sensitive and classified information.” 

“As someone who worked in the Situation Room before, I cannot believe Hegseth would recklessly text info that could put a target on our pilots and service members. He needs to resign,” Kim wrote. 

Jim Himes, a Democratic congressman representing Connecticut, thought it was lucky that the US' enemies had not intercepted the messages and handed them to the Houthis. 

“It's by the awesome grace of god that we are not mourning dead pilots right now,” he said. 

During an appearance before the House intelligence committee on Wednesday, Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence, continued to insist that the country's national security had not been endangered.

“There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,” she said.

Hegseth, who is currently on a tour of the Indo-Pacific, has denied revealing “war plans”. 

Analysts have questioned why Hegseth and his colleagues were using Signal, an encrypted messaging app that cannot be used on secure government devices, to exchange such sensitive information. 

One day before the 15 March strikes against the Houthis, the defence department warned its staff about the vulnerability of Signal, saying Russia was trying to hack the app, according to an anonymous US official. 

The US government has been targeting the Iran-backed group in Yemen over its attacks against ships in the Red Sea.

Wednesday marked the eighth day of consecutive protests in the capital, but with protests beginning to lose momentum, some people have started to question whether opposition parties are doing enough themselves to oppose government-led processes seen as undemocratic.  “You sit in the opposition, which means you are fighting the government for the public,” said the activist group Yalla Tikva, in a post on Instagram. This sentiment has led protestors like Yalla Tikva to compare the actions of Israel's opposition leaders with those in other countries, where they have taken more dramatic steps in response to government actions.  Israeli opposition parties have primarily relied on legal challenges rather than direct action. Opposition parties Yesh Atid, National Unity, Yisrael Beytenu, and The Democrats submitted a petition to the High Court of Justice on Friday demanding an injunction against the dismissal of Shin Bet (Israeli Security Agency) chief Ronen Bar. Opposition head MK Yair Lapid also addressed a protest in Tel Aviv's Habima Theater square on Saturday evening. On Wednesday, opposition leaders are expected to join protestors outside the Knesset for the first time, according to Walla.

MK Gilad Kariv was violently pushed by a policeman during a protest for the Gaza Hostages in Tel Aviv in February, after asking the police officer under what authority the officer was allowed to confiscate equipment from protesters.However, it is questionable whether these actions have been substantial enough in comparison to the bolder actions taken by opposition members worldwide.   This has led some to call for opposition members to engage in non-violent direct action rather than just parliamentary action. Protesters have not called for opposition members to engage in violent activity, as the protest movement is defined by non-violence.""How opposition parties around the world have responded to crisisSerbiaA few weeks ago, Serbian opposition lawmakers threw smoke grenades and used pepper spray inside parliament to protest against the government and to support demonstrating students.Four months of student-led demonstrations, sparked by the deaths of 15 people when a railway station roof collapsed, have become a significant threat to President Aleksandar Vucic's decade-long rule, with many denouncing rampant corruption and incompetence in government.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  At the legislative session, after the ruling coalition approved the agenda, some opposition politicians rushed towards the parliamentary speaker and scuffled with security guards.Others tossed smoke grenades and used pepper spray, with a live TV broadcast showing black and pink smoke billowing inside the parliament.Under Serbian law, parliamentary deputies enjoy immunity from prosecution unless they commit serious crimes.  South KoreaIn December, when President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, which he said was necessary to defend the country from pro-North Korean anti-state forces, the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) called for Yoon's resignation and otherwise threatened impeachment.""We couldn't ignore the illegal martial law,"" DP lawmaker Kim Yong-min told reporters. ""We can no longer let democracy collapse."" Within hours of the declaration, South Korea's parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion for martial law to be lifted.The South Korean opposition leader, Lee Jae-myung, went so far as to jump over the fence of Parliament after the entrance was blocked off by the military. He live-streamed himself the whole time, in a video which went viral on X/Twitter.While the situation in South Korea was vastly different from the current one in Israel, it is difficult to imagine an MK doing something similar in the current climate.TurkeyLast week, protests erupted across Turkey after the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a key opposition figure and potential challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was detained and later arrested. Imamoglu faced charges including graft and aiding a terrorist group. His Republican People's Party (CHP), the main opposition, condemned the move as politically motivated and encouraged peaceful protests.""Break down those barricades without harming the police, take to the streets and squares,"" said CHP leader Ozgur Ozel, who called the bans on demonstrations illegal, and urged people to demonstrate peacefully in defense of their voting rights.On Sunday, the CHP announced Imamgolu as its presidential candidate for the next elections, and the party even allowed for non-party members to vote in order to boost public resistance.In contrast to these dramatic actions abroad, Israel's opposition has taken a more measured approach despite ongoing protests against the government's recent controversial decisions.The firing of Ronen Bar was also politically motivated; it was allegedly related to investigations into ties between Qatar and three of Netanyahu's current or previous advisors. However, opposition leaders did not actively lead the public to engage in protest, as the opposition did in Turkey.Nearly a thousand soldiers have lost their lives since Israel launched its invasion of Gaza in the aftermath of the October 7, 2023, massacre by Hamas. Additionally, 16,000 soldiers have been wounded in fighting, and 59 hostages remain captive in Gaza. Amid this crisis, the Israeli government also fired Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar, a move that sparked outrage. It is notable that when 15 people die because of a roof collapsing, the opposition throws smoke grenades in Parliament, but when the Israeli government decides to resume fighting in Gaza and fires the Shin Bet chief, the opposition remains largely passive.As protests continue, pressure is mounting for Israeli opposition leaders to take bolder action, or risk losing public support.Eve young contributed to this report.

This sentiment has led protestors like Yalla Tikva to compare the actions of Israel's opposition leaders with those in other countries, where they have taken more dramatic steps in response to government actions.  Israeli opposition parties have primarily relied on legal challenges rather than direct action. Opposition parties Yesh Atid, National Unity, Yisrael Beytenu, and The Democrats submitted a petition to the High Court of Justice on Friday demanding an injunction against the dismissal of Shin Bet (Israeli Security Agency) chief Ronen Bar. Opposition head MK Yair Lapid also addressed a protest in Tel Aviv's Habima Theater square on Saturday evening.

 New York, Two US lawmakers have introduced a bill seeking to sanction Pakistan's Army chief General Asim Munir for engaging in the ""wrongful persecution and imprisonment"" of political opponents and the release of detainees including former premier Imran Khan, a media report said. 

 The “Pakistan Democracy Act” was introduced by Republican representative from South Carolina Joe Wilson and Democratic representative from California Jimmy Panetta on Monday, The Hill reported. 

 The bipartisan bill accuses Gen Munir of “knowingly engaging in the wrongful persecution and imprisonment of political opponents"", and would place sanctions on the military chief within 180 days under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. According to the news portal, violators can be subjected to denial of entry to the US and ineligibility for US visas. 

 It also seeks the identification of other key individuals involved in the “persecution” and the imposition of similar bans on them. 

 The bill gives the president the power to drop the sanctions if “military rule has ended in Pakistan and rule of law and civilian-led democracy has been restored” and “all wrongfully detained political detainees have been released from detention.” 

 Wilson called the 72-year-old former leader Khan a ""political prisoner"", and blamed Pakistan's powerful military for his ""unjust detention"", according to the news portal. 

 Khan has been implicated in dozens of cases since his government was dismissed through a no-confidence motion in 2022. He was arrested in August 2023 and is currently incarcerated in Rawalpindi's high-security Adiala Jail. 

 According to his party, he faces over 200 cases, got bail in some of them, was convicted in some others, and hearings are going on for some more. 

 Wilson told The Hill that he wrote a letter to President Trump urging him to “put pressure on Pakistan's military leadership including through visa bans, to restore democracy and release Mr Khan.”

Federal authorities have detained an international student studying at Tufts University near Boston and have revoked their visa, the university said in a statement Tuesday night.

Tufts said the graduate student was taken into US custody from an off-campus apartment building in Somerville, Massachusetts and that it had no further details about the incident or the circumstances surrounding the student's status.

Representatives for the US Department of Homeland Security, US Customs and Border Protection and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be immediately reached for comment on the university's statement.

A lawyer representing the student could also not be immediately reached.

The detention is the latest move by Republican US President Donald Trump's administration targeting international students as it seeks to crack down on immigration, including ramping up immigration arrests and sharply restricting border crossings.

Trump and his top diplomat Marco Rubio in particular have pledged to deport foreign pro-Palestinian protesters, accusing them of supporting Hamas operatives, posing hurdles for US foreign policy and being antisemitic.

At Columbia University, student protester and lawful permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil was arrested this month. He is legally challenging his detention after Trump, without evidence, accused him of supporting Hamas, which Khalil denies.

Federal immigration officials are also seeking to detain a Korean American Columbia University student, who is a legal permanent US resident and has participated in pro-Palestinian protests, a move blocked by the courts for now.

Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor and assistant professor at Brown University in Rhode Island was denied re-entry to the US and deported to Lebanon after Trump's administration alleged her phone contained photos ""sympathetic"" to Hezbollah. Dr. Rasha Alawieh said she does not support the operative group but held regard for its leader, who's now dead, because of her religion.

Following denials by US President Donald Trump, the White House and several top officials that no classified information was shared in the messaging group discussing plans of an attack on the Houthis in Yemen on March 15, The Atlantic has shared the full text of the chats, including screenshots, highlighting that it had received very specific information more than two hours before the start of the bombing. 

This information and particularly the exact times US aircraft were taking off for Yemen, the magazine emphasised, would have exposed American pilots and other personnel to ""even greater danger"" if they had fallen into the wrong hands.

The Atlantic's Editor In Chief Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently invited to the group chat on the Signal messaging app in which the bombing plans were being discussed. The chat reportedly included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Hegseth, Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of State Marco Antonio Rubio, Director Of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and others.

Explaining its rationale for putting out details of the chat in a new report on Wednesday, The Atlantic pointed out that Hegseth had claimed ""nobody was texting war plans"" and Trump and others had said ""it wasn't classified information"". 

The article, written by Goldberg and staff writer Shane Harris, said this presented a dilemma for The Atlantic. The magazine, it said, withheld specific information in an earlier report on weapons and the timing of the attack in keeping with its general rule to avoid publishing information about military operations that could jeopardise the lives of US personnel. 

""The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump - combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts - have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions. There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,"" the magazine said. 

The Atlantic said it asked various officials whether they objected to the full text of the chat being shared and got a response from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, who reiterated that no classified information was shared but that does not mean ""we encourage the release of the conversation"".

""This was intended to be a an (sic) internal and private deliberation amongst high-level senior staff and sensitive information was discussed. So for those reason (sic) - yes, we object to the release,"" the report quoted Leavitt as responding. 

'Threat To National Security'

The magazine said experts had repeatedly told them that using a Signal chat for such sensitive discussions ""poses a threat to national security"" and pointed out that Goldberg had received information on the attacks two hours before the scheduled start of the bombing. 

""If this information - particularly the exact times American aircraft were taking off for Yemen - had fallen into the wrong hands in that crucial two-hour period, American pilots and other American personnel could have been exposed to even greater danger than they ordinarily would face. The Trump administration is arguing that the military information contained in these texts was not classified - as it typically would be - although the president has not explained how he reached this conclusion,"" Goldberg and Harris wrote. 

Aircraft Information

At 11.44 Eastern Time, Hegseth wrote that F-18s which made up the first strike package would launch at 12.15 ET and that a Houthi ""Target Terrorist"" was expected to be attacked at 13.45 ET - over two hours after the message was sent. 

Pointing to the possible consequences of this, the magazine wrote, ""If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests - or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media - the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds. The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic.""

At 14.10 ET, more F-18s were expected to launch and the second strike was to start at 15.36, with sea-based Tomahawk missiles also being launched, Hegseth wrote. 

""1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)""1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier 'Trigger Based' targets)""1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts - also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched,"" the defense secretary wrote. 

""I will say a prayer for victory,"" Vice President Vance wrote soon after.

At 13.10, Waltz shared details of an attack site, apparently in Sanaa, writing, ""The first target - their top missile guy - we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed.""

""Excellent,"" Vance replied, and Waltz later sent a text with fist, fire and American flag emojis.

Damage Control

National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes had said on Monday that the chat cited by The Atlantic appeared to be ""authentic"" but Vance had accused the magazine of ""overselling"" the story.

The scandal is being seen as one of the biggest challenges Trump and his administration have faced since the billionaire returned to power two months ago. There have also been calls for Hegseth and Waltz to resign over the leak. 

After Wednesday's article was released, Waltz reiterated that no war plans were leaked and stressed that the bottom line was that Trump was protecting the US and its interests. 



No locations.No sources & methods.NO WAR PLANS.Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests.



""No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE:  President Trump is protecting America and our interests,"" Waltz wrote. 

Press Secretary Leavitt also argued that the Atlantic had conceded that no war plans were released and said the story was a hoax.

Sharing a screenshot of the report, ""The Atlantic has conceded: these were NOT “war plans"". This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.""

In a briefing later on Wednesday, Leavitt repeated that no classified information had been shared in the chat. 

""The National Security Adviser has taken responsibility for this matter and the National Security Council immediately said, alongside the White House counsel's office, that they are looking into how a reporter's number was inadvertently added to this messaging thread,"" she said.

""We have said all along that no classified material was sent on this messaging thread. There were no locations, no sources or methods revealed, and there were certainly no war plans discussed,"" she added.

When repeated questions were asked on the same topic, a visibly annoyed Leavitt said, ""I have answered the same question in different ways. There are many other things going on in the world... President Trump will also announce tariffs later in the day.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Chinese doctors said Wednesday that they had transplanted a liver from a genetically modified pig into a brain-dead human for the first time, raising hopes of a live-saving donor option for patients in the future.

Pigs have emerged as the best animal organ donors, with several living patients in the United States having received pig kidneys or hearts in the last few years.

Livers have proved trickier -- and had not previously been tested out inside a human body.

But with a huge and growing demand for liver donations across the world, researchers hope that gene-edited pigs can offer at least temporary relief to seriously ill patients on long waiting lists.

Doctors at the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi'an, China, announced the field's latest breakthrough in a study in the journal Nature.



A liver from a miniature pig, which had six edited genes to make it a better donor, was transplanted into a brain-dead adult at the hospital on March 10, 2024, according to the study.

The trial was terminated after 10 days at the request of the family, the doctors said, adding that they had followed strict ethical guidelines.

'Bridge organ' 

The patient, whose name, gender and other details were not revealed, still had their original liver, receiving what is called an auxiliary transplant.

The hope is that this kind of transplant can serve as a ""bridge organ"" to support the existing liver of sick people waiting on a human donor.

Over the 10 days, the doctors monitored the liver's blood flow, bile production, immune response and other key functions.

The pig liver ""functioned really well"" and ""smoothly secreted bile"" as well as producing the key protein albumin, study co-author Lin Wang of the Xi'an hospital told a press conference.

""It's a great achievement"" that could help people with liver problems in the future, he added.

Other researchers also hailed the breakthrough but emphasised that this early step could not confirm whether the pig organ would work as a replacement for human livers.

Transplants of livers have proved difficult because they carry out several different functions -- unlike hearts, for example, which simply pump blood, Lin said.

Livers filter the body's blood, breaking down things like drugs and alcohol, as well as producing bile that carries away waste and breaks down fats.

The pig liver produced far smaller amounts of bile and albumin than a human liver could achieve, Lin said.

More research is needed -- including studying the pig liver for more than 10 days, he added.

Next, the doctors plan to trial the gene-edited pig liver in a living human.

'Impressive' 

Oxford University transplantation professor Peter Friend, who was not involved in the study, said the results were ""valuable and impressive"".

However, ""this is not a replacement for liver transplantation from human donors (at least in the near-term),"" he told AFP in an email.

""This is a useful test of the compatibility of genetically modified livers with humans and points to a future in which such livers can provide support for patients in liver failure.""

Lin emphasised that collaboration with US researchers was crucial.

""To be frank, we have learned quite a lot from all the research performed and investigated by the United States doctors,"" he said.

Last year, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania attached a pig liver to a brain-dead patient -- but instead of being transplanted, the organ remained outside the body.

Both US recipients of pig heart transplants died.

But Towana Looney, 53, is back home in Alabama after receiving a pig kidney on November 25, 2024.

Heads of both NPR and PBS testify amid renewed Republican effort to defund US public media

The heads of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service testified in a heated congressional subcommittee hearing on Wednesday amid a renewed Republican effort to defund US public media.

“NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical leftwing echo chambers,” said the Georgia Republican representative Marjorie Taylor Greene during her opening remarks, accusing NPR of having a “communist agenda”.

The hearing, called “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable”, was chaired by Greene who is head of a “delivering on government efficiency” group within the House oversight committee.

The Doge subcommittee hearing comes as the Trump administration, including the senior presidential adviser Elon Musk, wage a months-long campaign against public broadcasters and critical media more broadly. The FCC, led by a recent Trump appointee, opened an investigation into NPR and PBS in January. A day before the hearing, President Donald Trump said he would “love to” end public funding for the public broadcasters.

In their opening statements, the NPR CEO, Katherine Maher, and the PBS CEO, Paula Kerger, highlighted surveys showing public support for their broadcasting as well as programming intended to serve a range of audiences.

“For over two decades, the American public has consistently ranked public television as one of the best investments the government makes,” Kerger said.

Although Greene's Doge subcommittee is separate from Musk's “department of government efficiency” initiative, it bears the same ideological goals. Musk has likewise repeatedly demanded to defund public media. The world's richest man also previously clashed with NPR in 2023 after he acquired Twitter and forced the broadcaster to be listed as “state-affiliated media” on the social media platform. NPR announced it would stop posting on the platform as a result.

Democratic members of the subcommittee repeatedly mentioned Musk in their statements, claiming that the hearing was a partisan distraction from Doge's dismantling of government services.

“Leave Elmo alone, bring Elon in for questioning instead,” the Texas representative Greg Casar said.

The hearing also featured testimony from two witnesses representing each side. Mike Gonzalez, a fellow from the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank, called for the dissolution of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and reiterated Greene's argument that the internet makes government-funded broadcasters obsolete. The president and CEO of Alaska Public Media, Ed Ulman, spoke out on behalf of public broadcasters, stating that they were crucial for reaching rural communities and funding local news services.

While NPR and PBS receive part of their budget from federal funding, the majority of their funds come from other sources including corporate underwriting and donations. NPR receives about 1% of its budget from direct federal funding via the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, while PBS receives 16%. More than 70% of the CPB's funding goes to locally owned public radio and television systems, however, making it a key source of their budget.

The subcommittee hearing on Wednesday is part of a longstanding rightwing campaign against public broadcasters, whom conservatives accuse of using government funding to produce liberally biased reports. Republican efforts to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which President Lyndon Johnson's administration created in 1967, have persisted under every conservative administration since then but failed to convince Congress.

A renewed attack against NPR and PBS began last year, however, following a conservative campaign alleging leftwing bias and anti-Trump sentiment during the election. Conservative activists such as Christopher Rufo also seized on an essay from the then-NPR senior business editor, Uri Berliner, who claimed that the newsroom had prioritized diversity, equity and inclusion over journalism.

Multiple NPR journalists publicly criticized Berliner's article as self-serving and misrepresenting the newsroom, including the Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep who wrote a blogpost dissecting the essay that stated “my colleague's article was filled with errors and omission”. Greene and other members of the subcommittee cited Berliner's essay repeatedly in their remarks, as well as repeating disputed claims from it during the hearing. Berliner later left NPR and joined the Free Press, recently writing an article entitled “What Congress Should Ask NPR's Chief”.

Musk, who frequently attacks critical media outlets, joined in the initial conservative campaign against NPR and amplified its backers on X, the social media platform that he owns. In April of last year, Musk called to “Defund NPR” in response to a post from Rufo and described the broadcaster as a “hard-left propaganda machine” while retweeting Berliner's Free Press essay.

Several members of the subcommittee questioned Maher over NPR's coverage of conservative media-favored issues such as the leak of Hunter Biden's laptop. At times Maher took a conciliatory tone, conceding that she would have covered Biden's laptop differently and walking back statements made in old tweets that criticized Trump as racist.

The attacks on PBS, meanwhile, heavily focused on opposition to LGBTQ+ content in its programming. “They are now part of transing children, brainwashing children about gender,” Greene said of PBS on Tuesday during an interview on the rightwing channel Newsmax.

Greene repeatedly attacked PBS during the hearing over claims that it featured a drag performer on one of its shows, holding up a poster of the performer who she described as “child predator” and “monster”. Kerger responded that the performer Greene showcased did not actually air on PBS, but instead was a New York City affiliate station's digital project in collaboration with the city's department of education. Greene ended the hearing by playing a clip from the segment of the performer singing a children's song, which she called “repulsive”.

“After listening to what we've heard today we will be calling for the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Greene said in her closing remarks.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Senior GOP figures warn of potential ‘significant political problem' for Trump administration in rare sign of unrest

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly.

“This is what happens when you don't really have your act together,” the Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski told the Hill.

The Trump administration has been facing criticism from Democrats – and now Republicans – after Monday's embarrassing revelation that a team of senior national security officials accidentally added a journalist to a private group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app. The group, which included Vice-President JD Vance, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and others, discussed sensitive plans to engage in military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

On Wednesday morning the Atlantic posted another tranche of messages that contained details of the attack on Yemen, including descriptions of targets, launch times and even the details of weather during the assault.

Senior national security officials testified before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday, where the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA director, John Ratcliffe, were grilled by lawmakers over the scandal. The national security officials said “no classified material” was shared in the chat. Republicans are now calling for investigations, as well.

According to reporting from the Hill, top Republican senators are calling for various committees to investigate the leak, including the Senate armed services committee and the Senate intelligence committee. The Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the armed services committee, told the Hill he would be asking the defense department's inspector general to investigate the scandal.

The national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who reportedly added Goldberg to the group chat, took “full responsibility” for the leak on a Tuesday night Fox News appearance. However, he did not describe how the leak happened and trashed Goldberg, calling him “the bottom-scum of journalists”. During his television appearance, Waltz said he started the Signal group chat but unknowingly added a contact that happened to have Goldberg's number.

“Of course I didn't see this loser in the group, it looked like someone else,” he said, and denied that a staffer was responsible.

Tensions are rising among Republicans, with the two wings of the party divided on what should happen with Waltz, according to reporting from Politico.

On the one hand, traditional, hawkish Republicans see Waltz as a strong vehicle to push Trump officials towards a more aggressive foreign policy, and advocate for him to stay in the administration. On the other hand, Trumpian Republicans like Vance, oppose the hawkish approach to foreign policy. Waltz's position, for now, seems to be safe, with Donald Trump calling Waltz a “very good man”.

Despite the prospect of congressional investigations, there are still significant questions left unanswered about the leak, with Waltz and Trump contradicting each other in separate interviews. Waltz on Tuesday said that a staffer was not responsible for the leak.

“Look, I take full responsibility, I built the group,” Waltz said. But Trump suggested the opposite during an interview.

“What it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody that worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level, had Goldberg's number or call through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call,” Trump said. His statements were unclear, since the Atlantic journalist was added to a text chat, not a phone call.

The use of Signal for internal government discussions has also been called into question. A non-profit organization, American Oversight, sued members of the Trump administration on Tuesday afternoon, saying the app's use violated the Federal Records Act. The organization is requesting that a federal court order the officials to preserve the messages “to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Officer intercepted message of encouragement slipped into socks going to accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO

Someone tucked a heart-shaped note of encouragement into socks packed for Luigi Mangione to wear to court recently in the case surrounding the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, prosecutors said in a court document released on Wednesday.

Writings and words on bullets recovered from the scene reflected Mangione's alleged hostility toward health insurers and corporate America. The case has made him something of a cult celebrity to people frustrated with corporate health insurers in the US. Others, including elected officials, decry what they see as glorifying violence and vigilantism.

A court officer intercepted the note, which urged the accused killer to “know there are thousands of people wishing you luck”, Manhattan prosecutors wrote in responding to recent requests from Mangione's lawyers. They include a request for him to get a laptop to review legal material in his cell while he awaits trial in the December shooting of Brian Thompson. Mangione, 26, has pleaded not guilty.

A message seeking comment on the prosecutors' filing was sent to Mangione's attorneys.

Objecting to the proposed laptop as a request for unmerited special treatment, prosecutor Joel Seidemann wrote “special treatment to the defendant's benefit was violated when [prosecutors] made accommodations for defendant's fashion needs during the last court appearance”.

Most jailed defendants wear jail uniforms at routine court dates like the 21 February hearing, the prosecutor explained. Mangione, however, was allowed to change into clothes brought by his legal team.

The note – plus another heart-shaped message addressed to someone called “Joan” – was hidden in a piece of cardboard at the center of a new pair of argyle socks, Seidemann wrote. It is not clear who wrote the note or slipped it into the socks.

Mangione donned the socks but later took them off “because he felt that ‘they did not look good'”, according to Seidemann.

Mangione appeared in court in loafers without socks, his feet shackled at the ankles.

Thompson, 50, was shot in December outside a Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare was about to hold an investor conference.

In addition to the Manhattan case, Mangione faces federal charges in Thompson's killing and state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania. He has yet to enter any pleas in those cases.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Former intelligence head said leak and White House response was ‘very worrying' to allies of the US

Canada's former spy chief has said the Trump administration's attempts to downplay the leak of top-secret attack plans is a “very worrying” development, with implications for broader intelligence sharing among US allies.

On Wednesday, the Atlantic magazine published new and detailed messages from a group chat, including plans for US bombings, drone launches and targeting information of the assault, including descriptions of weather conditions. Among the recipients of the messages was a prominent journalist, who was inadvertently added to the group.

“This is very worrying. Canada needs to think about what this means in practical terms: is the United States prepared to protect our secrets, as we are bound to protect theirs?” said Richard Fadden, the former head of Canada's intelligence agency. “Every country has experienced leaks, of varying severity. The problem with this one is that it's being generated at the highest levels of the US government – and they haven't admitted that it's a problem.”

Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand have for decades shared intelligence in a pact informally known as the Five Eyes. But the leak of classified information is likely to put further strain on the group as it weighs how seriously the current American administration takes the handling of top secret information.

“When we have intelligence leaks, we admit it, we try to sort out what's happened and we try to fix it. One doesn't get the impression today that the US cabinet members will admit there's a problem,” said Fadden, who also served as national security adviser to Canada's Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. “They're just trying to clean it up from a political perspective. That worries me.”

Despite a far more detailed picture of the information leaked to the journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, the White House and key figures in the message thread have redoubled efforts to claim none of the information was classified.

The Pentagon chief, Pete Hegseth, said on Tuesday that “nobody was texting war plans” in the thread. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, wrote on social media “these were NOT ‘war plans'. This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin.”

“No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS,” national secruity adviser Mike Waltz wrote on X. “Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests.”

Fadden disputed the “cleanup exercise” by the current administration.

“This is intelligence, and it should be kept confidential. It would be useful if somebody in the US administration admitted they made a mistake, acknowledged there were problems, but that on the sharing of critical intelligence, wanted the current relationships to continue,” he said. “I don't think that is the kind of thing the administration is inclined to do. There are ways to lower the temperature. Their lack of willingness to do that makes it worse.”

The use of Signal by senior members of the Trump administration has also become a focus of the leak. The commercial messaging app is popular among journalists for its sophisticated encryption but cannot be download on devices issued by the federal government, meaning those involved in the discussions were probably using private phones.

“It may well be that Signal is easier, but that's not the issue. When you join government, you have to accept some sort of restrictions,” said Fadden. “Even though Signal is quite good in terms of encrypting, that doesn't mean that people who are wandering around with their iPhones can't be hacked. That is worrying.”

The revelations came as Canada grapples with a rapidly deteriorating relationship with the United States, its largest trading partner and closest military ally.

On Tuesday, the prime minister, Mark Carney, said that, increasingly, Canadians “have to look out for ourselves” as decades-long relationships face fresh scrutiny.

“My responsibility is to plan for the worst, is to think about the most difficult evolution of the new threat environment, what it means for Canada and how do we best protect Canada,” he told reporters on Tuesday.

Despite bilateral tensions precipitated by Trump's trade war and threats to annex Canada, “transactional” relationships were still possible, said Fadden.

“Our political and strategic difficulties with the United States aren't going to go away tomorrow. But I would like to think that on things like the sharing of critical intelligence, we would be able to survive.”

But Fadden suggests the nature of the leaks – and the denials – will provoke intense conversations among US allies.

“Should we think more carefully about what we call ‘Canadian eyes only' intelligence, or should we continue to share very, very broadly? I imagine that United Kingdom and Australia, New Zealand will go through the same sort of exercise. The Five Eyes will survive this. But over the short to medium term, it probably will mean a few adjustments.”

Canada's department of national defence declined to comment on the leaks.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Ukraine's president says drone attacks just hours after ceasefire talks were ‘a clear signal to the whole world'

Ukraine's president has accused Russia of being insincere about making peace as he reported an attack by 117 drones, before he headed to Paris for a discussion with EU and Nato leaders about establishing a post-conflict security force.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that launching nationwide strikes after negotiations over maritime and energy ceasefires was proof of Russia's true intentions, though the Kremlin insisted the US-brokered talks were proceeding constructively.

Four people were reported killed and six injured across Ukraine by regional governors overnight, while the country's air force said it shot down 56 of the 117 incoming drones and another 48 were decoys that caused no damage.

“Last night, there were another 117 proofs in our skies of how Russia continues to drag out this war,” Zelenskyy posted on X. “Launching such large-scale attacks after ceasefire negotiations is a clear signal to the whole world that Moscow is not going to pursue real peace.”

Russia's defence ministry countered by saying that Ukraine had sought to strike Russian energy facilities overnight, targeting a gas storage site in occupied Crimea and electricity transmission in the border region of Bryansk.

“Thus, the Kyiv regime, while continuing to damage the Russian civilian energy infrastructure, is actually doing everything it can to thwart the agreements reached” by negotiators from Russia and the US, the Russian ministry said, though it was not immediately possible to verify the claims.

Parallel talks between Russia and the US and the US and Ukraine in Saudi Arabia this week had reached agreement on implementing a ceasefire in the Black Sea and a 30-day halt to strikes on energy targets already agreed to in principle by the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.

But the Kremlin emphasised that its agreement to a ceasefire was conditional on the US helping ease access to its exports of food and fertiliser, and the reconnection of state agricultural bank Rosselkhozbank to the Swift payments system. The US said it was studying the Russian request.

At a briefing on Wednesday, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, praised the talks. “We are satisfied with how pragmatically and constructively our dialogue is developing and by how it is yielding results,” he said.

A list of Russian and Ukrainian targets to be covered by the energy moratorium had been agreed with the help of US negotiators, Peskov added, a point that had been announced by Zelenskyy the day before. Ukraine's leader said the energy ceasefire should be ready to come into force from today.

Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris and attend a meeting of political and military delegations from 31 countries led by France and the UK, represented by prime minister Keir Starmer. Together they are trying to stitch together a “reassurance force” to provide security to Ukraine in the event of a negotiated armistice or peace.

Details about who will participate and the size of the force have been sparse with speculation that it could contain 10,000 to 30,000 troops plus fighter jet policing to secure Ukraine's air space, as well as maritime patrols de-mining the Black Sea to protect grain exports.

European sources have stressed that the force would not police or be based closed to the current front lines, but the deputy head of Ukraine's presidential office, Ihor Zhovkva, said the reassurance force had to be strong enough to fend off any Russian aggression, if necessary.

Though Zhovka said Kyiv had to “first and foremost” rely on its own military, members of any reassurance force had to show a “readiness to fight” and “to be ready to be engaged in the real combat” and recognise that defending Ukraine was “an inevitable part of European security”.

Donald Trump has been pressing for a full end to the fighting in Ukraine, declaring on the campaign trail before his election that he could end the war in 24 hours, though earlier this month he described his own statement as “a little bit sarcastic”.

So far the parallel negotiations that took place in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, have brought relatively modest results – and raised questions over whether a full ceasefire is possible given the lack of trust between Moscow and Kyiv and ongoing fighting.

Overnight, the US president even questioned whether Putin was committed to a peace deal at this stage. “I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they're dragging their feet,” Trump said in a TV interview.

“I've done it over the years, you know; I don't want to sign a contract, I want to sort of stay in the game, but maybe I don't want to do it, quite … I'm not sure. But no, I think Russia would like to see it end, and I think Zelenskyy would like to see it end at this point,” he told Newsmax.

Ukraine's strategy is to engage constructively in the talks, showing it is ready to agree to intermediate ceasefire proposals, and switch the onus on peace to Russia in the belief the Kremlin will raise more pre-conditions.

Moscow, however, appears focused on what it can obtain from the US, with Trump acknowledging the US had had discussions about a division of Ukrainian territory with the Kremlin. No such negotiations had been had with Ukraine, Zelenskyy said on Tuesday.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

As White House takes aim at medical missions, SVG says it gave US proof that workers aren't human-trafficking victims

The prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) said his government has provided evidence to the US that Cuban health workers in the country are not victims of human trafficking, as the Trump administration takes aim at the medical missions.

Speaking in advance of US secretary of state Marco Rubio's visit to the Caribbean on Wednesday, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said he was confident that the information he provided would settle US concerns about the deal under which Cuban medical professionals work in SVG.

Rubio, who is the child of Cuban immigrants, announced in February the expansion of an existing policy to target “forced labor” and “abusive and coercive labor practices”, which he claimed were part of Cuba's overseas medical missions.

But Caribbean leaders have consistently rejected the claims of human trafficking and stressed the important role the Cuban medical professionals play in saving lives in the region.

Gonsalves said he had provided US officials with evidence that there was “no human trafficking here, no forced labour, none of that”.

“We have modern labour laws, we follow all the international conventions when Cubans come here. They do excellent work, and they have their own bank accounts and are compensated comparably to nationals. They have a lot of benefits, including paid holidays. You can enter the program freely and leave the program,” he said.

Since its 1959 revolution, Cuba has been sending medics to both developed and developing countries around the world, including Italy, Brazil, and countries in the Caribbean and West Africa. Its doctors and nurses have been instrumental in tackling outbreaks such as Covid-19 and Ebola.

But under the expanded US policy, “current or former Cuban government officials, and other individuals, including foreign government officials, who are believed to be responsible for, or involved in, the Cuban labor export program” and their immediate family will be subjected to visa restrictions.

Cuba's ambassador to the SVG, Carlos Ernesto Rodríguez Etcheverry, earlier this month described the announcement as a “shameful decision”, saying that it has no legal basis and will deprive millions of people around the world of medical services.

“We really reject the idea … that Cuban doctors, Cuban nurses are slaves and that the Cuban government is involved in any trafficking issue with regard to our medical brigades. Because we respect our doctors, our nurses,” he told local media.

Describing the idea that Caribbean nations are involved in trafficking as “propaganda”, Gonsalves said that Cuban doctors operate private practices in SVG while they are employed by the government, and some apply for permanent residency in the country. “It's very clear that there isn't any sort of issue around trafficking as suggested,” he said.

Barbados's prime minister, Mia Mottley, currently chair of the Caricom group of Caribbean nations, told parliament that although Barbados does not currently have Cuban medical staff, “we could not get through the [Covid] pandemic without the Cuban nurses and the Cuban doctors”.

She added: “I will also be the first to tell you that we paid them the same thing that we pay Bajans, and that the notion, as was peddled not just by this government in the US, but the previous government, that we were involved in human trafficking by engaging with the Cuban nurses was fully repudiated and rejected by us.”

Mottley said that “like others in this region”, she is prepared to lose her US visa if “we cannot reach a sensible agreement on this matter”.

Caricom met on Friday, 21 March, to discuss Rubio's visit among other matters, Gonsalves said. During his visit to Jamaica, Rubio will hold bilateral meetings with officials from Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados, before going to Guyana and Suriname. Gonsalves said that he was sure the issue of Cuban doctors would be raised by Caribbean governments.

A statement from Trinidad and Tobago announcing the meeting with Rubio said discussions would “focus on US foreign policy and the effect on Trinidad and Tobago and the wider region”, but did not specify whether the issue of Cuban doctors was on the agenda.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Criticism of defense secretary grows as Democrats rejected assertions by Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe that no classified material was included in the chat

“Classified information is classified for a reason. Sec. Hegseth was openly sharing classified materials on an insecure channel that potentially endangered service members. And then he lied about it. He should resign,” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said on X, just moments after questioning intelligence officials at Wednesday's hearing.

“It is completely outrageous to me that administration officials come before us today with impunity, no acceptance of responsibility,” said Jason Crow of Colorado. He said the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, “must resign immediately. There can be no fixes, there can be no corrections until there is accountability.”
 Other Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee rejected assertions by Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe that no classified material was included in the chat. They pointed to chat messages released by the Atlantic on Wednesday as evidence the leak could have jeopardized the mission's success or endangered US service members' lives.

Secretary of state Marco Rubio said the accidental inclusion of the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg onto the Signal group chat was a “big mistake” but said that that “none of the information on there at any point threatened the operation or the lives of our service members.”

Speaking to reporters from Jamaica, Rubio said:

“Obviously someone made a mistake, someone made a big mistake and added a journalist. Nothing against journalists but you ain't supposed to be on that… I contributed to it twice. I identified my point of contact…and then later on, I think 3 hours after the White House's official announcements have been made, I congratulated the members of the team.”

Rubio went on to add:

“I've been assured by the Pentagon and everyone involved that none of the information that was on there…at any point threatened the operation of the lives of our servicemen and in fact it was a very successful operation… I want everybody to understand why this thing was even set up in the first place and also understand very clearly the mission was successful and at no point was it in danger and that's coming from the highest ranking officials…”

Another Democrat, the Florida representative Maxwell Alejandro Frost, has criticized the contents of the Signal group chat to which the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was accidentally added.

Writing on X in response to a screenshot that featured JD Vance's reply to the US's bombing in Yemen, Frost said:

“Another disgusting part of all this is the proof of a blatant war crime to which the vice president of the United States responded: Excellent.”

During a press briefing in Warsaw, Poland, Nato secretary general Mark Rutte was asked if Europeans could still trust the Americans after the Signal leaks.

“Absolutely. Can we trust the Americans? Yes, they are our biggest partner, the biggest allies in Nato. They have freed my country together with Poland and Canada after the Second World War. Yes, absolutely. We can trust the Americans.”

He was later asked about some of the comments made about “free-loading” Europeans.

Rutte said he would not want to offer running commentary as that “would not be appropriate,” but acknowledged two main irritants in the new US administration's relations with European Nato allies, on fair burden sharing and some caveats in “collective endeavours.”

“We are addressing them because we are spending much more and we are working on, as I said, on the lethality of Nato, which is crucial,” he said.

Here's a look at where the day stands:

Democrats are calling on defense secretary Pete Hegseth to resign following the Signal group chat scandal. One Democrat, Illinois's representative Raja Krishnamoorthi said: “Classified information is classified for a reason. Sec. Hegseth was openly sharing classified materials on an insecure channel that potentially endangered service members. And then he lied about it. He should resign.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Elon Musk's team is investigating how the Atlantic's editor-in-chief was added to the group chat discussing a military strike in Yemen. “As for your original question about who's leading, looking into the messaging thread: the national security council, the White House counsel's office, and also, yes, Elon Musk's team,” she said during a press briefing.

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly. “This is what happens when you don't really have your act together,” the Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski told the Hill.

The US district court judge James Boasberg, whom the government has argued cannot be trusted with sensitive information in the Alien Enemies Act case, has been assigned to oversee a lawsuit alleging that government officials violated federal record-keeping laws when they used a group chat to discuss a planned military strike in Yemen, Politico reports. “Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations,” the plaintiffs argue.

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who grilled top security officials during Tuesday's Senate intelligence committee briefing, appeared on Morning Joe this morning to discuss the recently released text messages published by the Atlantic on Wednesday. “Well it sure answers that the two witnesses I believe lied when they said, ‘Oh, nothing to see here, nothing classified,'” he said.

Republican senator Roger Wicker, chair of the Senate armed services committee, said he and the senator Jack Reed, the committee's top Democrat, will request an inspector general investigation into the use of Signal by top national security officials to discuss military plans, The Associated Press reports.

Wicker is also calling for a classified Senate briefing from a top national security official and verification that the Atlantic published an accurate transcript of the Signal chat.

This move is notable given the Trump administration's defiance that no classified information was posted to the Signal chat.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed that Elon Musk's team is investigating how the Atlantic's editor-in-chief was added to the group chat discussing a military strike in Yemen.

“As for your original question about who's leading, looking into the messaging thread: the national security council, the White House counsel's office, and also, yes, Elon Musk's team,” she said during a press briefing.

“Elon Musk has offered to put his technical experts on this to figure out how this number was inadvertently added to the chat again to take responsibility and ensure this can never happen again,” Leavitt added.

She also said that the Signal messaging app, where senior Trump administration officials accidentally shared military plans in a group containing a journalist, is an approved app.

Leavitt said it is loaded on to government phones at the Pentagon, Department of State and Central Intelligence Agency.

Donald Trump will hold a press conference to announce tariffs on the auto industry today at 4pm, according to the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Wednesday's press conference will be in the Oval Office.

National security adviser Michael Waltz said on Fox News that a staffer wasn't responsible for adding the Atlantic's editor-in-chief to the group chat and that he “takes full responsibility” for building the group and maintaining coordination.

“Have you ever had somebody's contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else's number?,” Waltz said.

“You have somebody else's number on someone else's contact, so of course I didn't see this loser in the group,” he added, referring to the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.

The Guardian's Peter Beaumont offers an analysis of what the latest Signal leak revelations expose:

The disclosure by the Atlantic of further devastating messages from the Signal chat group used by the Trump administration's most senior security officials has nailed the lie that nothing that threatened the safety of US servicemen and women was shared on the group.

After the vague and evasive assertions by Trump officials at Monday's Senate intelligence committee hearing, from the White House, and from the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that no war plans or classified material was shared, readers can make up their own minds.

Despite Hegseth's angry denial, the exchanges in the leaked group chat did contain details of war planning, shared recklessly by him in advance of the attack on 15 March, on a messaging system and perhaps devices which he and others in the chat could not have been certain were secure.

Most damning is the fact that Hegseth sent details in advance of the F-18s and other aircraft that would take part in the attack, including the timing of their arrival at targets, and other assets that would be deployed.

As Ryan Goodman, a law professor who formerly worked at the Pentagon, put it after the latest release: “The Atlantic has now published the Signal texts with attack plans in response to administration denials. I worked at the Pentagon. If information like this is not classified, nothing is. If Hegseth is claiming he declassified this information, he should be shown the door for having done so.”

In attempting to cover up and diminish their culpability for a shocking breach of operational security – including the fact that two participants in the chat were overseas (including one in Moscow at the time) – the Trump administration has made the scandal immeasurably more serious than it was already.

At the most simple level, the pilots who flew on those strikes should rightly be furious that the most senior civilian defence official placed them in harm's way.

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly.

“This is what happens when you don't really have your act together,” the Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski told the Hill.

The Trump administration has been facing criticism from Democrats – and now Republicans – after Monday's embarrassing revelation that a team of senior national security officials accidentally added a journalist to a private group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app. The group, which included the vice-president, JD Vance; the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and others, discussed sensitive plans to engage in military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

On Wednesday morning the Atlantic posted another tranche of messages that contained details of the attack on Yemen, including descriptions of targets, launch times and even the details of weather during the assault.

Senior national security officials testified before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday, where the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA director, John Ratcliffe, were grilled by lawmakers over the scandal. The national security officials said “no classified material” was shared in the chat. Republicans are now calling for investigations as well.

Under a $6m US deal, hundreds of migrants from Colombia and Ecuador were deported back to their home countries

Outside the Lajas Blancas migrant camp in southern Panama, wooden shops are boarded up. A bed of cold ash lies in an iron drum barbecue which once served meat skewers to hungry migrants.

Six months ago, hundreds of people would pass through the camp every day, emerging from the jungles of the Darién Gap between Colombia and Panama to receive humanitarian aid, before continuing their journey north towards the US.

Now, however, migration through the gap has slowed to a trickle and the footfall is in the opposite direction, as many migrants from South America try to return home.

Adriangela Contreras was one of 300,000 migrants to make the perilous crossing in 2024, carrying her two-year-old daughter, Arianna, as she stepped over dead bodies on the trail.

She arrived at Lajas Blancas in November amid a crackdown by Panamanian authorities who rolled out barbed wire in the jungle and introduced biometric tests at the border.

Under a $6m agreement with the US, hundreds of migrants from Colombia and Ecuador were returned to their home countries on deportation flights.

Most Venezuelans were allowed to proceed, however, and Contreras' group made it as far as southern Mexico, sleeping in the street and selling candies or washing windscreens to earn bus fares. But when on his first day in office Donald Trump shut down the CBP One app used by asylum seekers to request appointments, Contreras felt she had little option but to retrace her steps.

“I'm so disappointed, I didn't [decide to migrate] for myself but for my family,” she said. “Now I just want to go home, it's been a long and difficult journey.”

The shutdown of CBP One and the increased Panamanian controls have all but extinguished the Darién migrant route.

In February, crossings were down 96% compared with the previous year. At the end of that month Lajas Blancas – which once regularly sheltered over 3,000 migrants in plywood buildings and tents – held just 485 migrants, 90% of whom had come from the north.

So far this year, 4,091 migrants have returned to Panama and the government has struggled to deal with the logistics of this reverse flow.

Oscar Ramírez, a 52-year-old Venezuelan, arrived at Lajas Blancas with barely $1 in his pocket. He had sold his truck to follow the “American dream”, but said he was robbed in Mexico City and then held prisoner by people smugglers in a hotel near Monterrey. “The only thing sure about Mexico is that you will be mugged,” he said.

When he eventually made it into the US he was arrested by Ice that same morning and detained for three months before being deported to Villahermosa, Mexico, in January.

“They tricked us,” he said, “they told us we would be able to get a repatriation flight from Panama.”

Many of the migrants, including Contreras, say they were promised that, upon reaching Panama, they would be offered a place on a plane to Cúcuta, a Colombian city on the border with Venezuela.

When the flight never materialized, some migrants who could afford it began taking small boats back to Colombia. On 22 February, a boat containing 19 migrants capsized and a nine-year-old Venezuelan girl drowned.

Since then, the Panamanian government has introduced a new route, bussing migrants from Lajas Blancas to Miramar, a port on the Caribbean coast, and boarding them on to ferries to La Miel, an isolated village close to the Colombian border.

“It was a horrible experience,” said Jessica Álvarez, who had never been on a boat before. “There were times when I thought we were going to turn over, it was really scary. I vomited and my son was really sick, everyone was so seasick.”

From La Miel the migrants are sent on small boats to the villages of Capurganá and then Necoclí in Colombian territory. From there many, including Álvarez, have opted to stay with friends or family in Colombian cities.

But Contreras and her daughter remain stuck in Necoclí.

“When we first arrived they gave us nothing, not a bite to eat, not a mattress, nothing,” she said, speaking by phone from the Colombian port. With the help of some friends she managed to find a space on the floor of a guesthouse, but she is unsure how she will raise the money to return to Venezuela to see her son who recently underwent eye surgery.

“I just want to be back with my family. I hope Venezuela has something better in store for me,” she said.

The presidents of Panama and Colombia will meet in Panama City on 28 March with migration at the top of the agenda. Humanitarian aid agencies have started to depart Lajas Blancas, which is due to be closed in the coming weeks. Any further migrants arriving through the Darién Gap will be immediately deported to their home country or to Colombia, according to Panama's ministry of public security.

Ramírez had the funds to pay for a bus to Cúcuta and by Wednesday was back with his family in the state of Barinas. Over the phone he said he was happy to be home, even if he no longer had his truck.

“Us migrants, we all had the same thing in our heads, the American dream,” he said. “But after the things we lived, I realized it's just that: a dream.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Research suggests those who push themselves when working out perceive time to move more slowly

If your sessions at the gym seem to drag on for hours, you are in good company. People who push themselves when working out report a form of time warp, making it feel as if they have been exercising for longer than they have, researchers say.

Adults who took part in 4km cycling trials on exercise bikes perceived time to have slowed down, scientists said, with the cyclists overestimating how long they had been pedalling for by about 10%.

The finding suggests people who are trying to improve their fitness might feel their workouts are shorter and more enjoyable if they are distracted from the intensity of the activity by listening to music or training in a more competitive setting.

“People perceive time as moving more slowly during exercise,” said Andrew Edwards, a professor of psychology at Canterbury Christ Church University in Kent, and the first author on the study. “This distortion may affect pacing and the enjoyment of physical activity.”

In the study, 33 physically active adults took part in three cycling trials on an exercise bike. Before, during and after the trial, they were asked to estimate a time period of 30 seconds. The first trial was performed solo. The second was accompanied by a virtual avatar on the bike's screen. And on the third trial, they were told to beat the virtual opponent.

Writing in Brain and Behaviour, the researchers described how time appeared to run slow when people were exercising but not before or after. The effect was the same across the trials, suggesting the virtual opponent had no noticeable impact.

The time warp does not seem to be specific to cycling, but linked to the intensity of the exercise or how uncomfortable it feels, Edwards said. What drives the shift in time perception is not clear, but he believes that at high intensities, exercise makes the body more aware of the pain it is enduring, making the duration feel longer.

“Exercise, particularly hard exercise, increases focus on the body, creating a heightened awareness of each moment,” he said. “That makes time feel like it's dragging.”

The researchers compared the effect to Einstein's special theory of relativity, which said time was not absolute and depended on the observer's frame of reference. In 1929, Einstein was claimed to have said: “When you sit with a nice girl for two hours you think it's only a minute, but when you sit on a hot stove for a minute you think it's two hours. That's relativity.”

“This study is the first to experimentally demonstrate that time and relativity can be demonstrated through the medium of exercise … showing that time is distorted,” the authors wrote.

The intensity of the exercise may not be the only factor. In follow-up research on professional footballers, Edwards found that training sessions involving a football seemed to pass more quickly than cardio training and video analysis sessions.

“If time feels slower, workouts may feel longer and less enjoyable. Making exercise more engaging could help people stick with it,” Edwards said. “Repetitive or unenjoyable exercise might enhance this time-slowing effect, while distractions or enjoyment might reduce it.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Lithuanian military and rescue services and U.S. troops were searching for the men, who were on an armored vehicle when they went missing Tuesday near the Belarusian border.

RIGA, Latvia — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told news agencies on Wednesday that four U.S. soldiers that had gone missing during military exercises in Lithuania had died.

He told reporters during a trip to Warsaw it was still early news and there were no details. Earlier the U.S. military said a search-and-rescue effort was underway after the four soldiers were reported missing during a military exercise at a training ground.

Lithuanian military and rescue services and U.S. troops mounted a search for the men, who were in a tracked armored vehicle when they went missing Tuesday afternoon at the training ground near Pabrade in eastern Lithuania near the Belarusian border.

The Lithuanian media outlet LMT said they were traveling in an M88 recovery vehicle, a large tracked armored vehicle used to recover other tanks.

The men are part of the 3rd Infantry Division, 1st Brigade, that was carrying out a tactical training exercise, according to the U.S. military.

Ignas Grinevicius, a spokesman for the Lithuanian Defense Ministry, said men and helicopters from the Lithuanian air force and border guard service were involved in the search.

German and U.S. forces are deployed in Lithuania alongside Lithuanian troops as part of NATO's eastern flank defenses to deter a Russian attack on the Baltic states.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said he was being constantly updated on the rescue operation. Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene was on her way to the training ground late Wednesday to inspect the search and to show solidarity with American forces, according to her office.

Lt. Gen. Charles Costanza, commander of the U.S. V Corps, thanked the Lithuanian military and first responders who assisted in the search.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Sudan's military says it has recaptured the international airport in the capital, Khartoum, after nearly two years of fighting against a rival paramilitary group

CAIRO — Sudan's army said Wednesday it had recaptured Khartoum's international airport and a key base of the rival Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, bringing it closer to regaining full control of the capital for the first time in nearly two years of war .

The military announced the seizure of the airport on social media, saying Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan had landed there and inspected troops. It posted a video showing a smiling Burhan in a military helicopter descending to the tarmac, where some traces of wreckage were visible.

Troops also recaptured the RSF's last stronghold in Khartoum, the Teiba al-Hasnab camp, army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Nabil Abdullah Ali said on social media.

There was no immediate RSF comment.

Sudan's military on Friday retook the Republican Palace , the seat of the prewar government. The RSF had held the palace, the airport and large parts of the capital since the war began in April 2023.

“This is a pivotal and decisive moment in the history of Sudan,” Information Minister Khalid Aleiser, spokesman of the military-controlled government, declared on social media. “Khartoum is free, as it should be.”

Military control of the airport, along with calm in Khartoum, could allow aid groups to fly more supplies into the country where the fighting has driven some 14 million people from their homes and pushed some areas into famine.

At least 28,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher.

The RSF is still believed to hold scattered positions in Khartoum. But liberating the capital doesn't end the conflict , as the RSF still controls parts of the western Darfur region and other areas.

The war erupted when the military and the RSF turned against each other in a struggle for power. Their battles around Khartoum quickly spread across much of the country.

For most of the war, Burhan and the government have been based in the Red Sea coastal city of Port Sudan.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

            Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene on Wednesday used a DOGE subcommittee hearing to call for the defunding and dismantling of the company that provides NPR and PBS with federal funds.
    


            For Taylor-Greene and other House Republicans, today's hearing was about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding. For the broadcasters, today was about defending their existence.
    


            The hearing, titled “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,” started at 10 am ET, and featured testimony from NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger, as well as a local station operator and a conservative critic of taxpayer-funded media.
    


            The hearing, which was chaired by Taylor-Greene, was meant to advance long-held Republican arguments against PBS and NPR, including that their programming is “communist.”
    


            In the final minutes of the two-hour hearing that saw repeated conservative attacks on the public broadcasters, Taylor-Greene said that “we can look no further than the Corporation for Public Broadcasting” as the culprit for US debt.
    


            “After listening to what we've heard, today, we will be calling for the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Taylor-Greene said.
    


            President Donald Trump on said Tuesday that the networks are a “waste of money” and claimed “he would love to” defund them. And yet the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this month included $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations. Congress budgets money for CPB two years in advance, so the recent bill means public broadcasting is funded through 2027.
    


            Throughout the hearing, legislators pressed Maher and Kruger on their roles in allegedly circulating disinformation, accusing the pair of fostering newsrooms that cater to elite audiences.
    


            “NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white urban liberals and progressives who generally look down on and judge rural America,” Taylor-Greene said at the hearing's overture before accusing the pair of “grooming and sexualizing” children, using DEI for listener demographics, and wasting taxpayer dollars.
    


            Maher and Kruger also faced attacks from Rep. James Comer, who, in addition to accusing NPR and PBS of peddling “disinformation” and “propaganda,” claimed the public broadcasters are obsolete in an age marked by a “menu of media options” that includes podcasts and satellite radio.
    


            Congressional Republicans repeatedly peppered Maher and Kruger with accusations regarding their coverage of the COVID-19 origins lab leak theory, Russian collusion, and Hunter Biden's laptop.
    


            Maher said that the public broadcaster was “mistaken” in “failing” to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story sooner and more aggressively. When Cloud asked Maher about the lab leak theory, the NPR boss emphasized that the outlet's current editorial leadership recognizes that “the new CIA evidence is worthy of coverage,” stressing that it has reported just that.
    


            Maher and Kruger spent the two-hour hearing defending their respective organizations, pushing back against conservative claims by stressing that most Americans trust public broadcasters to service local communities and provide a wide variety of reporting and educational programming. To elucidate her point, Maher noted that more than 60% of all Americans — and more than half of Republicans — trust public broadcasting to deliver fact-based news. Kruger noted “there's nothing more American than PBS as a membership organization.”
    


            Local TV and radio stations also used the opportunity to justify their federal funding. From North Country Public Radio in upstate New York, to New Mexico PBS in Albuquerque, to Hawaiʻi Public Radio in Honolulu, publicly supported stations are using the right's political attacks to galvanize grassroots support and raise money from donors.
    


            Hawaiʻi Public Radio CEO Meredith Artley, the former editor in chief of CNN Digital, wrote that her news and classical music stations are “94% community supported,” with the remaining 6% coming from CPB. If the federal funds were diminished, the Hawaii stations would survive, but “there would likely be damage to the nationwide system that provides programming and infrastructure that HPR and many other stations rely on,” she wrote.
    


            That's the key point: It's a system. And smaller stations tend to need more help from the system. At KTOO Public Media in Alaska, for example, fully 30% of the budget comes from CPB. “This federal funding is essential in ensuring that Juneau's only local-owned newsroom can continue to deliver you the news from our community,” the station said.
    


            Congressional Democrats came to the public broadcasters' aid throughout the hearing, stressing that journalism and the free press are currently under attack by “extremists” and are needed “more than ever.”
    


            “Public broadcasting is a tool for education, for emergencies, and a cherished part of our national fabric,” Rep. Robert Garcia said. “The majority and our chairwoman should drop this attempt to silence media voices they don't like.”
    


            Rep. Greg Casar chastised the committee for focusing on defunding NPR and PBS instead of DOGE's head, Elon Musk, whose companies — which include X, SpaceX, Tesla, and Starlink — make billions each year while still taking home $3 billion per year in government contracts.
    


            “That's six times the money that goes to all of public broadcasting. Private insurers and Medicare Advantage overcharged taxpayers $83 billion,” Casar said. “Just last year, that could pay for public broadcasting 160 times over.”
    


            “To borrow a phrase from Sesame Street, the letter of the day is C and it stands for corruption,” he said.
    


            Press freedom groups have also defended the public broadcasters. Ahead of the hearing, the Center for Democracy & Technology's president and chief executive, Alexandra Reeve Givens, called the meeting an attempt by the Trump administration “to bully their perceived enemies and silence legitimate journalism.” Reporters Without Borders executive director Clayton Weimars said he was “deeply concerned the House hearing on bias in NPR and PBS is a political stunt that will create a slippery slope towards politicians dictating the programming of public news outlets.”
    


            Stations large and small also highlighted their local responsibilities.
    


            “Whatever happens in Washington, DC — WQED is not going anywhere,” Jason Jedlinski, CEO of Pittsburgh's PBS station, wrote on LinkedIn. His post listed recent features (segments about a local farm, a reading club, and so on) that, quite frankly, few other media outlets would spend time on.

Vilnius, Lithuania, March 26th, 2025, FinanceWire

WhiteBIT, the largest European cryptocurrency exchange by traffic, is entering the Australian market, unlocking new opportunities for investment in digital assets. The platform's launch in Australia is a strategic move in the company's global expansion, reinforcing its presence on the international stage.

The WhiteBIT.au platform was launched in December 2024, but this launch was preceded by months of internal work and preparation. WhiteBIT has registered with AUSTRAC as a Digital Currency Exchange Provider and Independent Remitter Dealer. The company is just beginning to scale up its activities in Australia, planning to build on its already strong local team. As of now, spot trading is available; however, the product line will keep on growing. The company's focus is to provide the highest quality products while staying within the regulatory approvals in each country. 

WhiteBIT is the largest European centralized crypto exchange by traffic. It has 8 million registered users and offices in 7 countries and is part of the WhiteBIT Group, a leading ecosystem of blockchain and crypto solutions with more than 35 million users worldwide. This launch in Australia comes amidst the growing demand for cryptocurrencies among Australian investors, creating the perfect environment for the development of digital asset infrastructure in the region.

For Australian users, WhiteBIT offers fast and secure transactions and access to a range of new cryptocurrency trading tools, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced traders.
		



Australia's Crypto Adoption Surges as Investment Interest Grows

According to Triple-A data, 9.6% of Australians already own digital assets, highlighting the high level of crypto adoption in the country. This creates an ideal environment for the continued growth of the crypto industry, particularly given the stable economy and increasing popularity of cryptocurrency investments among younger Australians.

Despite its complexity, Australia presents an attractive landscape for crypto businesses. The nation boasts a resilient economy that is steadily recovering from post-COVID challenges. With a consistently growing average salary, Australians have the financial means, an investment culture, and access to a wide range of financial instruments. Notably, derivatives and cryptocurrencies are among the preferred options for younger investors.

The country's crypto market infrastructure is well-developed, with clear regulations and an established legal framework ensuring a structured environment for industry players. As a result, both local and global crypto companies are actively expanding their presence, competing to meet the needs of Australian investors.

Oops, something went wrong

More than 9 million Americans could see “substantial declines” in their FICO scores in the coming months as delinquent student loans begin showing up on credit reports for the first time since the pandemic, according to a new analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The report finds that over 15% of all student loan holders are likely now behind on debts, slightly more than before the pandemic. Those affected could face a tougher time getting access to home or auto loans or see their credit card limits lowered.

Borrowers have been required to make normal monthly payments on their student loans for well over a year, since the Biden administration ended the COVID-era pause on the program. But they temporarily benefited from a so-called “onboarding” phase, during which loan servicers were not allowed to report late or missed payments to credit agencies.

That grace period ended in September. Since servicers cannot report a loan as delinquent until it is 90 days past due, late student loan payments are only just now showing up on Americans' credit scores.

For those who are behind, the impact on their creditworthiness could be significant. In its report, the New York Fed's researchers found that a student loan delinquency can knock more than 150 points from the FICO score of someone with around average credit. For subprime borrowers — those with scores below 660 — it can subtract 87 points.

The Biden administration took several steps aimed at helping student borrowers get current on their loans as repayment resumed. Those included the Fresh Start program, which allowed people who had defaulted on their debts to get current without facing penalties. But only about 900,000 individuals took advantage of the offer, according to the Department of Education, leaving millions more lingering in default.

Recent confusion around the state of the student loan program may not be helping matters. For the past month, for instance, the administration had blocked access to income-driven repayment plans, which cap what borrowers owe each month at a percentage of their earnings, in response to a court ruling, leaving many with fewer options to manage their debts. Those applications finally reopened on Wednesday.

The Trump administration is also widely expected to restart involuntary collections on defaulted student loans sometime this year, though it's unclear if they have a plan worked out for resuming that process, which can involve garnishing paychecks and government benefits like Social Security payments. The administration's recent announcement that the student loan program would be moved out of the Department of Education to the Small Business Administration has made things additionally murky.

The New York Fed has traditionally tracked the number of delinquent student loans based on credit bureau data. But that was effectively made impossible during the pandemic payment pause and onboarding period, since late payments were no longer being reported to the agencies. For its new estimate, it combined information on delinquencies on loans not owned by the government as well as the Department of Education's own data on its student debt portfolio. The credit modeling company VantageScore similarly estimated that there are about 9 million delinquent loans outstanding.

Oops, something went wrong

Following its failed attempts at a merger with Honda, Nissan (NSANY) is back at it, trying to reassure investors with a new product game plan and claiming it is still open to a deal or partnership.

At an event outside of Tokyo on Wednesday, the Japanese automaker said 10 new and updated vehicles are coming to North America by 2027.

Nissan said a next-gen Sentra sedan, Rogue SUV, and even the return of the Xterra SUV as an EV are in the works.

The Sentra, with 109,000 vehicles sold in the US, and Rogue, with nearly 250,000 US units sold, are big sellers for Nissan, and updates to them and vehicles like the Kicks SUV, Altima sedan, and Frontier pickup are important to the business.

To that end, Nissan previewed the new Leaf EV, showcasing a new sportier exterior, with underpinnings coming from the Ariya EV, which rides on Nissan's newer CMF-EV platform.

The new Leaf will be more efficient and have a longer range than the current Leaf and will launch in the US in Q3.

Nissan's recent troubles stem, in part, from the company building too many vehicles and having to cut prices in order to move bloated inventory. The company has also struggled to develop new vehicles, especially in China, where automaker has hemorrhaged sales.

An emphasis on smart cars and making more compelling products for markets like China are “going to require a lot of work and a lot of investment that probably will need some partner,” said Ivan Espinosa, Nissan's new CEO, per Bloomberg. “I'm open to Honda or other partners as long as these partners are helping us drive the vision of the business.”

Espinosa's predecessor, Makoto Uchida, left his post after Nissan's failed merger with Honda. While various excuses arose for the deal's unraveling, it was assumed Uchida's presence was a hindrance, though the veteran CEO did say it would be “difficult to survive” without future partnerships.

One of Espinosa's main prerogatives is resurrecting a deal or partnership for Nissan, which doesn't necessarily mean partnering with traditional automakers or OEMs (original equipment manufacturers).

“There's another avenue, which is who should you partner with in order to develop this intelligent part of the future. There are some traits and some competencies that traditional OEMs don't have,” Espinosa said.

Espinosa's comments hint at what had been in the works just as of last month, a tie-up involving Taiwanese device maker Foxconn, which has auto ambitions of its own.

Reports suggested a consortium including Foxconn, and even Tesla, would swoop in to rescue Nissan with a cash infusion, with Foxconn and Tesla gaining access to Nissan's large manufacturing footprint in the US.

Tesla and others refuted the deal, though Foxconn has been open to partnering with Nissan in some capacity.

A new partner with cash or the ability to share development costs can't come soon enough for Nissan. Last month the company cut annual profit forecast for the third time as fiscal Q3 profit fell 78% from a year ago.

Oops, something went wrong

Toss another big Wall Street bank on the list of those becoming more cautious on stocks after a volatile start to the year.

Barclays strategist Venu Krishna slashed his 2025 S&P 500 (^GSPC) price target to 5,900 from 6,600 on Wednesday, citing tariffs and ""deteriorating"" economic data. The S&P 500 currently sits at 5,822, down about 2.3% year to date.

The estimate cut reflects Barclays' expectation that S&P 500 companies will have reduced earnings power in large part due to tariffs from the Trump administration.

Krishna cut his views on the economically sensitive Consumer Discretionary and Industrials sectors to Negative from Neutral.

""We think it will be tough for stocks to work versus deteriorating consumer sentiment, lower growth, higher inflation and tariffs,"" Krishna wrote. ""Industrials look expensive versus history and are exposed to both trade policy and tenuous manufacturing PMI amid factories front-running tariffs and government contract cancellations.""

Barclays upgraded its outlook on Financials to Positive from Neutral, citing the potential for deregulation this year after tariff issues are settled.

The investment bank follows the likes of Goldman Sachs in cutting its S&P 500 price target this month.

It also arrives on the heels of Wall Street growing more concerned about the economy.

JPMorgan strategist Bruce Kasman raised eyebrows last week by calling out a 40% recession probability for this year. This is the second-highest recession probability on the Street behind BCA Research's veteran forecaster Peter Berezin — he's called a 75% chance.

Goldman Sachs' chief economist Jan Hatzius said on Monday he thinks the market will be negatively surprised by tariffs should they go into effect on April 2 as the Trump administration suggested.

Meanwhile, a wobbly economy also continues to play out in the data.

Spending at US retailers last month was much weaker than expected, per the latest retail sales report. This is on top of weakness in consumer confidence data and various Fed activity surveys.

Big companies Delta (DAL), FedEx (FDX), and Nike (NKE) have warned on near-term demand trends this month.

""We have to be realistic,"" former director of the National Economic Council and current IBM vice chair Gary Cohn said on the Opening Bid podcast (video above). ""The market came into the year on relatively all-time highs.""

""Ambiguity is the No. 1 enemy of a market,"" the Goldman Sachs alum Cohn added. ""When a company creates ambiguity in their earnings profile, in their growth profile, in their business model, the market will punish that stock. When politicians, legislators create ambiguity in the way that taxes are going to work, the way that capital gains are going to work, the way that they're going impose tariffs, they create ambiguity to a market and the market as a whole reprices.""

Oops, something went wrong

Boeing, Bud Light, Facebook — these are just a few of the biggest brands that at one point faced a major public relations crisis. This is where electric vehicle stalwart Tesla (TSLA) finds itself. The company's stock has been in free fall since the start of the year, with sales slipping in key regions like Europe and China and even in the US.

CEO Elon Musk's closeness to President Trump and embrace of right-wing politicians in Europe has seen Musk — and Tesla's brand — suffer. Protests both in the US and abroad at Tesla showrooms are growing, as are acts of vandalism on Tesla EVs. Another wave of Tesla protests is slated for March 29.

Yahoo Finance spoke to crisis management expert Eric Dezenhall, founder of Dezenhall Resources and veteran of many high-profile crisis responses. Though he declines to name his clients, Dezenhall has reportedly worked with large corporations like General Electric, Exxon Mobil, and Procter & Gamble. He also authored the book ""Wiseguys and the White House,"" which is about the history of organized crime's influence on the presidency.

The following is a condensed version of a conversation with Dezenhall about his thoughts on Tesla, Musk, and what, if anything, can be done now to repair the brand damage.

Pras Subramanian: What's your take on where things stand now with Musk, Tesla, vis-à-vis the general public?

Eric Dezenhall: It's almost impossible to be a politically divisive figure while running a consumer brand. X/Twitter is one thing: You could make the argument that its purpose is political, and if you can build a consumer base on that, fine.

Tesla is something different. It's a consumer product that was marketed as an alternative to fossil fuel-burning cars. This was appealing to progressives and even some conservatives. It's lost its status as a progressive ""badge"" product.

Elaborate more on what ""badge""-like status means for a brand, and can you think of another brand that suffered a similar fate?

Bud Light. Beers tend to be badge products as they inspire loyalty for reasons other than the product itself. ""Come over for the Super Bowl. We'll have Bud Light."" It's about feeling. The Dylan Mulvaney fiasco blew that up because it told loyalists, ""We have no idea who you are, and we don't care.""

Tesla really was and is a unique product, but now there are other EVs, so it's not as special as it once was. Other brands have a shot at the eco-friendly badge.

What do Tesla and Musk have to do to limit the damage, perceived or real, that we see right now?

A lot depends on two things: Does Musk stay in his DOGE position? If so, it will be hard to build Tesla back unless the product itself is so much more extraordinary than competitors — which it once was.

If he leaves DOGE and gets back to what made him, the public can forget the recent unpleasantness over time. If he stays with DOGE and keeps the slash-and-burn at this pace, it will be hard to balance both.

If Musk remains at DOGE, do you really think new products would be enough for Tesla to overcome his political ambitions that are alienating customers?

People can overlook a lot if they love a product. Look how many years we ignored the perils of social media because they were addicted to their phones. In the face of overwhelming evidence, we're just starting to ask tough questions about our phone addiction.

If Musk comes up with something amazing, people may revisit their sentiments, but I have no idea what that could be.

With things as they are, how would you advise Musk under these circumstances if he were your client? What are some steps he or management could take?

The problem is that you can't advise guys like this. I've had clients in this stratosphere. They view advisers as their deep inferiors because they have prospered by violating norms that would have destroyed anyone else. What goes around never comes around, so why listen?

But my advice would be simple: The aim of crisis management is to stop an attack, not improve an image. First, get back to business. Leave politics to somebody else. This isn't your thing. But that advice doesn't matter because he's at the center of global discourse. That's the main thing that has value in 2025.

Is the board asleep at the wheel here? What would you tell them given the circumstances with their CEO? Bloomberg just reported that Tesla chair Robyn Denholm refused to answer questions at an event about Musk and whether he was too distracted.

Boards at companies with charismatic founders are different from regular boards. They're about supporting the king more than anything else. They're not asleep: They know exactly what's happening but are likely tiptoeing around the king or banging their heads against a wall. There is no earthly reason why Musk would listen to anyone. Gravity has never applied to him — and may never.

Drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy have the power to block the forces driving obesity, but the knock-on societal effects may not necessarily be so positive

By Alexandra Thompson


                                    26 March 2025

Oprah Winfrey's TV special Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution has been streamed more than 4 million times since it aired in March 2024. In it, the talk show host described Ozempic as being “the relief and support and freedom” that some people have been waiting for their whole lives.

This might have been easy for a billionaire like Winfrey to say. Weight-loss drugs can be game-changing for people who are obese, but getting hold of them is far from a level playing field, with knock-on effects for the obesity levels of the rich versus the poor. But this inequality is just one of many societal issues on the horizon. Ultra-slim beauty norms may be re-emerging, and some analysts predict changes to our collective appetite for junk food. In the era of Wegovy, we could also see an increase in the stigma around obesity that exists in some countries.

In the UK, only those with a body mass index of more than 35 (within the obesity range) and at least one weight-related health complication are generally eligible to receive Wegovy or Mounjaro on the National Health Service (see “How they work”, below). In the US, the use of these drugs for weight loss often isn't covered by insurers, which means many people are paying out of pocket. With costs of roughly $1000 a month in the US and between £150 and £200 a month in the UK, “better-off people will have access and poor people won't,” says Margaret Steele at…

A study of thousands of people finds that neural connections in the brain start to break down quickly around age 44, but the research hints that ketone supplements could potentially help slow that brain aging.

The human brain suddenly starts aging much faster around age 44, and that aging reaches a maximum speed at age 67, a new study finds.

The research, published March 3 in the journal PNAS, seems to align with the results of a different study that Live Science recently reported on, which looked at aging using blood samples and found that periods of accelerated aging take place around ages 44 and 60.

The new neuroscience study also found that brain aging was linked to insulin resistance, in which cells need more insulin than usual to keep blood sugar in check. Furthermore, it uncovered early hints that ketone supplements may offer some protection against certain measures of brain aging.

Ketones are compounds in the body that act as an alternative fuel source, standing in for sugars. So if the brain is aging because it's not getting enough sugars, ketones could help fill the gap, the team theorized.

However, much more research is needed to back this idea.

Related: 13 proteins tied to brain aging seem to spike at ages 57, 70 and 78

The researchers used four existing datasets of brain scans that together included scans from 19,300 people ages 18 to 90. To study how different brain regions are linked in networks, the team looked at two types of brain scans: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures blood flow in the brain, and electroencephalograms (EEGs), which measure electrical firing between neurons in the outermost layer of the brain.

In these scans, the scientists looked for signs that blood flow and electric firing between brain regions either disappeared or became inconsistent, suggesting there was a breakdown in communication between nodes in the network. They had considered this network disintegration a hallmark of aging in previous research wherein they assessed the impact of diet on the brain. Such disruptions are also seen in age-related neurodegenerative diseases, and the degree of disruption typically reflects the person's overall degree of aging.

Through their analysis, the researchers found that the brain starts to age more quickly around age 44 and that the aging accelerates to a maximum rate around age 67. After that, brain aging starts slowing down, until the rate stabilizes around age 90.

""What we did not anticipate was that the effects might be occurring as early as the 40s,"" study senior author Lilianne Mujica-Parodi, a neuroscientist at Stony Brook University, told Live Science.

The network disruptions the researchers observed resembled changes previously documented in the brains of people ages 50 to 80 with type 2 diabetes. Mujica-Parodi and her team wondered if the changes arose because neurons were not responding well to insulin, the hormone responsible for shuttling sugar from the blood into cells.

This effect wouldn't affect only people with diabetes. About ""88% of North Americans have at least one detectable sign of insulin resistance,"" said Dr. Luis Adrian Soto-Mota, a metabolism researcher at the Monterrey Institute of Technology in Mexico who was not involved with the study but previously worked with the team.

Looking at all the brain scans, which included scans from people with and without insulin resistance, the team found that people in their 40s with high blood sugar levels experienced faster brain aging than people of the same age with no signs of insulin resistance.

In addition, across all of the scans, certain parts of the brain aged more quickly than others, so the researchers wondered if those brain regions might be more insulin dependent. It's known that a protein named GLUT4 relies on insulin to move sugar into cells. So the team turned to the Allen Brain Atlas, which includes data on the activity of the GLUT4 gene, and found that the fast-aging regions did depend more on GLUT4.

The slow-aging brain regions, on the other hand, had higher levels of a protein that moves ketones into cells, suggesting that those regions use ketones as an alternative energy source.

Related: Biological aging may not be driven by what we thought

That raised the question of whether ketone supplements might be able to slow brain aging. To test this idea, the team recruited 53 men and 48 women, ages 20 to 79, who got fMRI scans after fasting overnight to deprive the brain of sugar.

Half an hour after the scan, the participants received either a ketone-filled drink or a sugary drink with the same number of calories. The researchers then waited 30 minutes for the energy source to reach the participants' brains, before repeating the fMRI scans.

Even over this short time frame, the ketone drink appeared to reduce brain network disruptions tied to aging, while the glucose beverage didn't, the team found.

The ketone drink had the greatest effect on people ages 40 to 59, where its impact was over 80% higher than in younger adults ages 20 to 39. The ketone drink had the smallest effect in the 60-to-79 age group. That might hint that, if ketone supplements prove to be effective for slowing brain aging, early intervention could be necessary.

This part of the study was limited in that the researchers tested the effects of ketone and glucose drinks only at a single time point; they didn't monitor brain aging over time or conduct any cognitive tests. They also considered only specific fMRI data, which may not reflect all aspects of brain aging, so we don't know if ketone supplements would help across the board.

Mujica-Parodi said future studies could track brain aging in people taking these supplements over time and thus provide more insight into its long-term potential. In addition, if the ketone supplements are making up for insulin resistance, the best measure people could take might be to avoid developing insulin resistance in the first place, she suggested, which could be achieved through dietary changes.

Soto-Mota added that when glucose levels are low enough, the body can make more ketones on its own than it can obtain from supplements. That's the goal of the ""keto diet,"" although maintaining the diet for a long time comes with downsides.

Mujica-Parodi said that ketone supplements could be helpful in people with extreme insulin resistance who are incapable of making their own ketones, due to metabolic changes in the body.

Editor's note: Some of the authors on the new paper have patented the ketone supplement tested in the research, and one is the director of a company aimed at developing products based on the science of ketone bodies in human nutrition.

The latest time crystal innovation may expand the known boundaries of quantum mechanics.

Physicists have created a new type of time crystal that may help confirm some fundamental theories about quantum interactions.

A standard time crystal is a new phase of matter that features perpetual motion without expending energy. According to Chong Zu, an assistant professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis and one of the team's lead researchers, a time crystal resembles a traditional crystal.

However, unlike a traditional crystal, which repeats a pattern across the physical dimension of space, a time crystal repeats a pattern of motion, rearranging its atoms in the same way over time, Zu said. This causes the time crystal to vibrate at a set frequency.

A time crystal is theoretically capable of cycling through the same pattern infinitely without requiring any additional power — like a watch that never needs to be wound. The reality, however, is that time crystals are incredibly fragile and thus succumb to environmental pressures fairly easily.

Although time crystals have been around since 2016, a team has achieved something unprecedented: They've created a novel type of time crystal called a time quasicrystal. A quasicrystal is a solid that, like a regular crystal, has atoms arranged in a specific, nonrandom way, but without a repeating pattern.

This means that, unlike a standard time crystal that repeats the same pattern over and over, a time quasicrystal never repeats the way it arranges its atoms. Because there's no repetition, the crystal vibrates at different frequencies. As the researchers state in their findings, published in the journal Physical Review X, time quasicrystals ""are ordered but apparently not periodic.""

To create these new time quasicrystals, the researchers started with a millimeter-sized piece of diamond. Then, they created spaces inside the diamond's structure by bombarding it with powerful beams of nitrogen. The nitrogen displaced carbon atoms within the diamond's interior, leaving behind empty atomic chambers.

Nature abhors a vacuum, so electrons quickly flowed into these empty spaces and immediately began to interact with neighboring particles on a quantum level. Each time quasicrystal represents a network of more than a million of these empty spaces inside the diamond, though each measures just one micrometer (one-millionth of a meter).

""We used microwave pulses to start the rhythms in the time quasicrystals,"" Bingtian Ye, a researcher at MIT and a co-author of the paper, said in a statement. ""The microwaves help create order in time.""

One of the most important outcomes of the team's research is that it confirms some basic theories of quantum mechanics, according to Zu. However, time quasicrystals may have practical applications in fields such as precision timekeeping, quantum computing, and quantum sensor technology.

—Scientists just made the largest quasicrystal ever — because one of them bet it couldn't be done

—Physicists link two time crystals in seemingly impossible experiment

For sensors, the crystal's fragility and sensitivity are actually a boon; because they're so sensitive to environmental factors like magnetism, they can be used to create extremely precise sensors.

For quantum computing, the material's potential perpetual motion quality is the key.

""They could store quantum memory over long periods of time, essentially like a quantum analog of RAM,"" Zu said. ""We're a long way from that sort of technology, but creating a time quasicrystal is a crucial first step.""

Behold, the human brain: Often compared to a computer, the body's most complex organ operates using a code of electrical and chemical signals. These signals transmit through wires, nodes and networks to process and store information.

Through these operations, the brain directs our unconscious bodily functions, such as our appetites and levels of wakefulness, as well as ""higher order"" cognitive abilities — solving problems, generating ideas, planning for the future. The brain has inherent plasticity, meaning it dynamically responds to novel information and literally restructures itself to accommodate new memories and new interpretations of the world around us.

Scientists are still unraveling the brain's inner workings, but over the decades, they've learned quite a lot about what makes the organ tick. Check out the quiz below to test your knowledge of the human brain and its many unique features.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22science%20news%22%20site%3Alivescience.com","The Nikon D850 is the best DSLR ever made, and it now has a huge $1,000 discount — its lowest-ever price","https://www.livescience.com/animals/we-think-its-the-best-dlsr-ever-made-and-the-nikon-d850-is-now-at-its-best-ever-price-discounted-by-a-massive-1000-usd","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 15:20:04 GMT","

No DSLR comes close to the Nikon D850, a camera that many photographers still choose over mirrorless. And with a huge $1,000 saving, now's the time to take the leap. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Fancy saving a massive $1,000 on what we think is the best DSLR money can buy? The Nikon D850 has been reduced from $2996.95 to $1,996.95, which is an unmissable discount if you're in the market for a leading DSLR. It's the first time we've seen the D850 come in at under $2,000, even beating out the Black Friday price (which was $2,200).

Editor's note: Walmart has a cheaper price at $1,859, although it's sold through a third party and strictly speaking, is not a deal as there is no previous RRP. But it's still live and better than Amazon.

Our resident camera expert James Artaius calls the D850 the best DSLR ever made, and as a result it's featured in our best camera for wildlife photography guide and we've chosen it as the best DSLR in our best astrophotography cameras guide. This is an all-singing, all-dancing camera packed with incredible features, and no matter what type of photography you're into, this camera won't disappoint.

Our sister site Space calls the Nikon D850 the best DSLR in their best camera buyers guide.

Save $1,000 on the Nikon D850, which we think is the best DLSR camera on the market. This superb and versatile camera delivers pro-level results with ease. You'll need to provide your own lens as this deal is for the body only, but with a massive 33% discount off the Amazon RRP, you'll have some cash left over to buy an equally nice Nikon camera lens .

Price check: Walmart $1,859 | Best Buy $1,999.95

There's a long, long list of accolades to throw at the Nikon D850, but perhaps one of the most important is its high resolution compared to other DSLRs on the market. It's capable of capturing gorgeous imagery with a stunning level of detail, largely thanks to its back-illuminated sensor which works incredibly well in low-light conditions. Incidentally, that makes the D850 a great choice for astrophotography.

The Nikon D850 has a fantastic ISO ranging from 320 to 102400, and its 9fps continuous shooting range means it's capable of capturing fast-moving subjects — great if you like to photograph wildlife. We also think the autofocus detection is second-to-none on this camera: it goes as low as -4EV, which also helps when capturing the perfect wildlife action shot.

This DLSR camera deal is US-only. If you're not in the US, you'll find Nikon D850 deals for your region at the bottom of this post.

Key features: 45.7MP full-frame CMOS sensor, 9fps burst rate, 8K UHD video, ISO range from 32-25,600 (extendable to 32-102,400) and superb auto-focus.

Product launched: September 2017.

Price history: This is the cheapest we've seen, and beats last year's Black Friday/Cyber Monday price of $2,196.95.

Price comparison: The Nikon D850 is even cheaper at Walmart and a third-party seller at Walmart for $1,859 and at Best Buy for $1,999.95.

Reviews consensus: The D850 features in our best camera for wildlife photography buyers guide and buyers guide for astrophotography. It gets top marks across our sister sites thanks to its versatile performance. It's an incredibly powerful tool for almost every kind of photography and video. At this current price, the D850 is terrific value for such a highly-rated camera.

Live Science: ★★★★½ | TechRadar: ★★★★★ | Space: ★★★★½

Featured in guides: Best camera for wildlife photography and best camera for Astrophotography.

✅ Buy it if: You want mind-blowingly detailed images, 8K UHD video footage and a superbly versatile offering that makes the D850 one of the best DLSR cameras ever made.

❌ Don't buy it if: You want a lighter camera, then the Nikon Z8 or Canon R5 are two of the best mirrorless cameras around.

If not listed, please contact your TV provider.

This week, it apparently became clear to Russell Wilson that his time with this Pittsburgh Steelers had come to an end. Wilson wanted to stay in Pittsburgh right up until he came to terms with the New York Giants on Tuesday night, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 

It's easy to see why Wilson wanted to stay in Pittsburgh. He started 6-1 as the team's starter before the Steelers ended the 2024 season on a five-game losing streak. Wilson (who missed significant time during last year's training camp while dealing with a calf injury) clearly wanted a chance to right that ship in 2025. 

Off the field, Wilson probably didn't want to relocate his family for a second straight offseason. Wilson only spent a year in Pittsburgh, but he quickly embraced the community while becoming a regular Tuesday visitor at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. 

Unfortunately for Wilson, it wasn't meant to be as far as getting another season in Pittsburgh. The Steelers, despite team president Art Rooney II previously stating that his preference was the team re-signing either Wilson or Justin Fields, decided to go in a different direction after Fields chose to sign with the New York Jets. The Steelers are reportedly in pursuit of Aaron Rodgers, who had reportedly been trying to decide between signing with the Steelers, Giants or retirement. 

What changed regarding the Steelers and Wilson? There have been rumblings that the Steelers' decision to move on from Wilson had more to do with off-field matters regarding Wilson's relationship with several people within the organization, specifically offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Those are just rumors, however, as no direct member of the Steelers' coaching staff/front office has publicly given this narrative any credence. That being said, it's safe to assume that several factors played into the Steelers' decision to move on from Wilson after just one season. 

Fortunately for Wilson, it appears that he will get another starting opportunity with the Giants, who among other things have an impressive receiving corps that is led by Malik Nabers. Nabers is coming off a stellar Pro Bowl rookie season that included becoming the fastest player to reach 100 career receptions, needing only 14 games to do so.

The New York Giants significantly altered their quarterback room this offseason, evidenced by the free agent signings of Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston over the past week. New York arguably had the worst quarterback room in the NFL last season, especially after the release of Daniel Jones.

The Giants started Jones for 10 games, Drew Lock for five and Tommy DeVito for two. Only DeVito is back on the roster heading into 2025, which showcased how poor the quarterback position has been for New York since Eli Manning retired. New York has started eight different quarterbacks since Manning left the NFL in 2019, only managing one winning season over the past five years. 

Somehow, the Giants were able to win a playoff game during that stretch, but that doesn't discount the quarterback futility the franchise has endured since Manning. And that's not even including Manning's final few seasons, when he struggled to produce at a high level. 

Even if the additions of Wilson and Winston aren't exciting for a rebuilding franchise, the two have a case to be the best quarterbacks the Giants have had in years. 

So, where do they rank? Beware Giants fans. This could be sore on the eyes. 

Fromm started two games for the Giants, but neither of them were memorable. (The Giants lost both contests.) In his three games played for the franchise, he went 27 of 60 passing (45%) for 210 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions for an abysmal 38.5 passer rating. Fromm averaged just 3.5 yards per attempt and hasn't played a game since his departure form the Giants after the 2021 season.

The veteran quarterback spent his ninth NFL season with the Giants, playing six games and starting four. The Giants went 0-4 in Glennon's four starts in 2021, as he completed 53.9% of his passes with four touchdowns and 10 interceptions (two of which were pick-sixes). Glennon's yards per attempt weren't much better than Fromm's (4.7), and his passer rating was just 49.7. 

It's easy to forget Webb started a game for the Giants, as he completed 23 of his 40 passes for 168 yards and a touchdown with no interceptions (75.8 rating) in the season finale against the Eagles in 2022. (The Giants had already clinched a playoff spot, so the game was meaningless). Even though Webb played in a meaningless game, he still performed better than Fromm or Glennon. 

McCoy's year with the Giants in 2020 wasn't so memorable for the veteran quarterback, as he completed just 60.6% of his passes with a touchdown and an interception in his four games -- averaging just 5.7 yards per attempt and recording a 75.0 passer rating. The Giants went 1-1 in McCoy's two starts.

DeVito's story is a great one for any player who has pro aspirations, yet the Giants offense didn't move the ball well in his starts. The Giants eventually benched DeVito during halftime of a game in 2023 for Tyrod Taylor and for Drew Lock late in the 2024 season. DeVito did complete 65.3% of his passes with eight touchdowns to three interceptions for an 88.4 passer rating, but he was sacked on an astonishing 16.23% of his dropbacks. The Giants went 3-5 in his eight starts. 

DeVito actually beat out Lock when the Giants decided to bench Jones last November, but New York eventually benched DeVito in favor of Lock. The results weren't any better, but the Giants did win one of Lock's five starts (their only win in their last 12 games). Lock completed 59.1% of his passes with six touchdowns to five interceptions for a 75.5 rating, and also had 133 rushing yards and two touchdowns in his eight games. 

Taylor spent two years with the Giants as a backup to Jones, but eventually got the starting quarterback job after Jones went down with a torn ACL in 2023. The Giants went 2-3 in Taylor's five starts, as he completed 66.9% of his passes with six touchdowns to four interceptions and an 88.9 passer rating during his two seasons in New York. The Giants' passing game was somewhat decent with Taylor, who averaged 7.4 yards per attempt. 

The successor to Manning as the franchise quarterback, the Giants failed to surround Jones with a competent offensive line during his six years in New York. Jones completed 64.1% of his passes with 70 touchdowns to 47 interceptions in his 70 games in New York while rushing for 2,179 yards and 15 touchdowns. Jones' best season was in 2022, when he threw 15 touchdowns to five interceptions and had a 92.5 passer rating -- leading the Giants to a playoff victory on the road against Minnesota. 

Jones struggled after the Giants gave him a four-year, $160 million extension, going 3-13 in his final 16 starts with 10 touchdowns to 13 interceptions. He didn't even finish the second year of the extension before the Giants released him. 

In terms of success, Winston has more pedigree than all the other quarterbacks the Giants have started since Manning retired. The former No. 1 overall pick led the NFL in passing yards in 2019 (5,109), but also led the league in interceptions with 30 in that same season. Winston has the only 30-30 season (30 touchdowns and 30 interceptions) in NFL history. 

Winston is 36-51 in his 87 starts, completing 61.2% of his passes for 154 touchdowns to 111 interceptions for an 86.4 passer rating in his 10 seasons. He completed 61.1% of his passes with 13 touchdowns to 12 interceptions and an 80.6 passer rating with the Cleveland Browns last season. 

As bleak as the Giants quarterback situation has been, they have a veteran in the clubhouse with Wilson -- who won a Super Bowl title in MetLife Stadium over a decade ago. Wilson has just a 23-32 record over his last four seasons with three different teams, but still has a 121-77-1 record in his 199 career starts with 10 Pro Bowl selections. 

The NFL leader in touchdown passes in 2017 (34), Wilson has thrown 350 touchdowns to 11 interceptions in his career -- sporting a 99.8 passer rating. Last season for the Steelers, Wilson completed 63.7% of his passes with 16 touchdowns to five interceptions and a 95.6 rating -- but was 0-5 in his final five starts with just seven touchdowns to four turnovers. 

Signing Wilson may not have been an exciting move, but he's the best quarterback the Giants had on their roster since Manning.

While he is not recruiting Aaron Rodgers, Cameron Heyward is definitely open to the four-time league MVP coming to Pittsburgh after recent comments made by the longtime Steelers captain suggested otherwise. 

On Wednesday, Heyward clarified what he recently said on his podcast when asked what lengths he would go to to get Rodgers to join his team. Heyward said he won't go too far to recruit Rodgers, but is indeed on board with the veteran becoming his teammate as the Steelers continue to try to find stability at the most important position in all of sports. 

""It was misconstrued,"" Heyward said during an appearance on NFL Network, via ESPN. ""I was asked a question, 'Would you go to the lengths of going to a darkness retreat to recruit Aaron Rodgers.' I said, 'I'm not doing that. The pitch is, if you want to be a Steeler, be a Steeler.' That's all it was. It wasn't that I don't like Aaron Rodgers or I'm against it.

""When I look at our team right now, it would be really cool to have a guy like Aaron Rodgers. But I can't be the guy who gets it over the finish line. He's got to make those decisions for himself. I'm excited to see what happens.""

Heyward's approach is in stark contract to his handling of Russell Wilson last offseason. Heyward was among Pittsburgh's veteran players who reached out to Wilson about joining the Steelers despite the fact that the team already had a starting quarterback in place in Kenny Pickett. Pickett, who went 12-4 in his last 16 starts in Pittsburgh that saw him play the majority of the game, was granted his request to be traded after Wilson was signed. 

Wilson's time in Pittsburgh started off well, but five straight losses to close out the 2024 season compelled the Steelers to go in a different direction at quarterback once again this offseason. Wilson recently signed a one-year deal with the Giants, while the Steelers are continuing to build their quarterback room after Justin Fields chose to sign with the Jets instead of re-signing with Pittsburgh. The Steelers did re-sign Mason Rudolph (who spent the 2024 season in Tennessee) as a contingency plan. 

It's certainly possible that part of Heyward's approach this time around has something to do with how last year played out. More than that, it's clear that Heyward feels that he shouldn't have to convince someone to come play for one of the most stable sports organizations. The Steelers haven't had a losing season since 2003 and are the NFL's winningest franchise since the 1970 merger. 

For all of their success, the Steelers haven't won a playoff game since 2016, a drought they desperate want to end in 2025. They're hoping that Rodgers can help them end that drought. For Heyward, Rodgers represents an opportunity to possibly get to a Super Bowl, something that has eluded Pittsburgh's seven-time Pro Bowler to this point in his career.

A Power Four football job unexpectedly opened on Tuesday when Stanford general manager Andrew Luck fired Troy Taylor. Already adjusting to bicoastal life in the ACC, a Stanford football coaching search is underway as the Cardinal try to stabilize a program that has gone six years without a winning season. Despite recent struggles, Stanford still has a rich history and deep ties in the coaching ranks in both college and the NFL. Who are the top names to watch in the Stanford football coaching search?

One name the staff has identified as a potential target on the Stanford football coaching hot board is Maryland offensive coordinator Pep Hamilton. The 50-year-old veteran coach has spent most of his career as an offensive coordinator and/or quarterbacks coach for major collegiate programs and in the NFL.

Most notable is his direct connect to Luck, who he coached both at Stanford and with the Indianapolis Colts. Hamilton was Luck's offensive coordinator during his senior season in Palo Alto and then joined him in the same capacity in Indianapolis from 2012-15. 

Hamilton's only head-coaching experience, however, was in the XFL with the DC Defenders during the COVID-shortened 2020 campaign.

Argentina will host Brazil in Buenos Aires on Tuesday in a key game for  2026 World Cup qualifiers. The Albiceleste won the 2022 World Cup and are set to defend their title next year and they can officially clinch qualification against the historical rivals. Argentina are sitting at the top of the group with 28 points after 13 games while Brazil are currently third with 21 points. In South America each of the ten national teams play every other team home and away. With FIFA expanding the World Cup to 48 teams, CONMEBOL has been allocated six spots, and the 7th-placed team advances to the inter-confederation playoffs for a possible additional spot. 

Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni continued to praise his team's effort in the 1-0 win at Uruguay, done without star Lionel Messi, who is off the roster and recovering from an injury. He also spoke about what Brazilian star Raphinha said before the game. The FC Barcelona winger said that he's going to score a goal. ""We're going to give them a thrashing on the field, and, if necessary, off it too.""

Scaloni seemed quite disappointed about Raphinha's words: ""An Argentina-Brazil match is an important game, but it remains just a football match. It shouldn't go beyond that. I remember the image of Messi with Neymar after the 2021 Copa America final, both of them sitting on the steps of the Maracana. And that's the image that should stay with us of our rivalry. The best in the world, and probably the second best together at that time, being friends. We both want to win and will be lions on the field, but friends off it. We all have a Brazilian friend, I know a ton of them, it shouldn't go beyond that."" 

Here's what you need to know before tuning in.

Inter Miami star Lionel Messi was not called up to the Argentina national team for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers against Uruguay and Brazil due to a minor injury as he suffered a low-grade adductor muscle injury during Inter Miami's 2-1 victory over Atlanta United on March 16. Scaloni initially named him in the provisional 33-player squad on March 2 before the national team manager decided to exclude him to avoid further injuries. 

The two teams have met 109 times in their history, with Argentina winning 41 matches and Brazil 45, while only 23 games ended with a draw. In the last matchup, which happened on November 2023 for the 2026 World Cup qualifiers, Nicolas Otamendi's goal gave the guests the victory. Scaloni's side managed to win their third game in the last five meetings, which also included the 2021 Copa America final. 

Possible Argentina XI: Martinez; Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico; De Paul, Mac Allister; Simeone, Fernandez, Almada; Alvarez. 

Possible Brazil XI: Bento; Vanderson, Marquinhos, Ortiz, Arana; Joelinton, Andre, Rodrygo, Raphinha, Vinicius; Pedro. 

Argentina are currently leading the 2026 World Cup qualifiers table and a win against Brazil can potentially secure them a spot in the World Cup. Pick: Argentina 1, Brazil 1.

Former New York Yankees star Brett Gardner and his entire family became ill at their Costa Rican resort hours before his son Miller, 14, was found dead on Friday, March 21. 

An official for Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) told Daily Mail in a story published Wednesday, March 26 that the Gardners — Brett, 41, his wife, Jessica, their older son, Hunter, and Miller — suffered from “severe stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhea” after eating at a nearby restaurant on the evening of Thursday, March 20. 

A doctor from the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort, where the family was staying, was called immediately and gave them all medication for their symptoms. 

The next morning, Miller was found dead in his hotel room. 



Miller's preliminary cause of death was originally classified as asphyxia “after a possible intoxication after apparently ingesting some food.”

An official from Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Police (OIJ) then told CNN on Tuesday, March 25, that Miller likely died from “asphyxiation due to intoxication related to food poisoning.”

However, an official from OIJ told Us Weekly on Tuesday that asphyxia had been entirely ruled out as the cause after Miller's airwaves were observed to be unobstructed. 

Authorities are now investigating whether the medication given to Miller the night before his death might be to blame.

“We're doing toxicology tests to determine if this medicine could have caused the death,” the OIJ official told DailyMail.

The official also said they are investigating whether Miller “brought an existing bacterial infection” with him when he traveled to Costa Rica from the family's home in Summerville, South Carolina. 

Results of Miller's autopsy and toxicology reports will take months due to an outbreak in gang violence in Costa Rica, according to the OIJ. 

“We're having a hike in homicides as these drug gangs battle for territory and every one of them needs an autopsy,” the official told Daily Mail.

The official added, “I can confirm that an autopsy has been carried out on Miller, But the full analysis and results, as in every one of them, will take at least two to three months due to these constant killings causing a backlog of cases. That's the reality.”

Miller's death was announced on Sunday, March 21, via a statement by the Yankees, for whom Brett played all 14 of his MLB seasons. 

“With heavy hearts we are saddened to announce the passing of our youngest son, Miller,” the statement read. “He was 14 years old and has left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation. We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st.”

The statement continued, “Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile. He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”

Doomsday is coming — luckily, Marvel has assembled a star-studded lineup for Avengers 5, which is now in production.

Robert Downey Jr.‘s return was announced last year, but instead of playing Iron Man/Tony Stark, he'll play the evil Doctor Doom. Avengers: Doomsday will reunite the actor with some familiar faces as well as some newbies, including several stars from the upcoming Fantastic 4 movie (set to hit theaters in July).

Marvel revealed several major Doomsday stars on Wednesday, March 26, during a lengthy live stream that showed the actors' names on the back of director's chairs.

See the full list of confirmed Avengers: Doomsday cast members below:



The biggest surprise among the Avengers 5 cast seems to be Huerta Mejía's Namor, who was introduced as an antagonist in Black Panther 2.

Avengers: Doomsday is expected to deal with characters across parallel universes, meaning actors can play various roles. Though Chris Evans exited the franchise as Steve Rogers, the original Captain America, in Avengers: Endgame, there have been reports he'll return as another character in the 2026 movie.

“That's not true, though,” Evans, 43, told Esquire of the rumors in a January interview. “This always happens. I mean, it happens every couple years – ever since Endgame. I've just stopped responding to it.”

Meanwhile, there are more familiar faces working behind the camera. Joe Russo and Anthony Russo will return to direct both Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars. The brothers previously helmed Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2012), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018) and Avengers: Endgame (2019).

The massive Endgame, which earned over $3 billion, clocked in at a whopping 3 hours — and the Russos expect at least one of their upcoming flicks to match that run time.

“If I were a betting man, I would say the first one is two and a half, and the second one's three hours,” Joe told Collider in an interview earlier this month.

Avengers: Doomsday will hit theaters on May 1, 2026, while Avengers: Secret Wars is set for May 7, 2027.

On March 31, Searchlight Pictures' underrated black comedy The Menu will be leaving Netflix along with several other films. But this is the one you should catch before the end of the month, in part because it's probably going to stay with you for a while. Director Mark Mylod and screenwriters Seth Reiss and Will Tracy crafted a tale that has some horror elements, but it's more funny than scary.

The casting for the film is also impeccable, with Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy in the lead roles, with Nicholas Hoult, Hong Chau, Janet McTeer, Judith Light, and John Leguizamo rounding out the supporting cast. The story follows Taylor-Joy's Margot Mills on the trip of a lifetime to Hawthorne, one of the world's most exclusive restaurants on a remote island. But once Margot and her date arrive, she finds out that they may never be able to leave with their lives. And they aren't the only ones facing a dire fate.

But if you're looking for a more complete explanation about why The Menu is the one Netflix movie you can't miss in March, then keep reading.





Ralph Fiennes is a terrific villain in The Menu, in part because his character believes that he's justified in his actions. In his own way, Chef Julian Slowik can be just as intimidating as Fiennes' role as Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. However, Slowik has more nuance, even though he's also out of his mind.

Without giving too much away, the entire evening was orchestrated by Slowik and his followers, who carefully selected their guests. They're going to serve up more than a full-course meal for their patrons, and in Slowik's mind, they're all getting what they deserve.

More importantly, Slowik doesn't feel he's immune from retribution. He's one of the rare antagonists who is fully aware that what he has planned is brutal, and he's literally willing to suffer the same fate for his art. He's not just a parody of chef Gordon Ramsay. Instead, Slowik resembles a cult leader, and everyone follows his lead.



It's a plot point in the movie that Taylor-Joy's Margot doesn't belong with the rest of the patrons, and yet her presence is absolutely essential to the movie. She's the only one that the audience truly has any sympathy for, and as Slowik routinely demonstrates, she's also the only one there who isn't guilty of a crime, either against the law or of the heart.

Before the insanity begins, Margot shines because she isn't intimidated by Slowik and she's more than willing to call him out on the ridiculous things he does to his dishes. Margot won't even dignify those courses by describing them as appetizers or even food.

Unlike Taylor-Joy's leading character in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Margot has to use her mind and her wit as her weapons as she tries to make her way through the night.

The last 30 minutes are probably the most satisfying part of the movie. In real life, the rich and powerful rarely get justice for the things they've done or the people they've hurt. But in The Menu, the 1 percent are finally getting what's coming to them.

Not all of the characters necessarily deserve their fates, but there is a certain cathartic sensation when characters who have all of the money in the world can't use it to barter for their lives. Slowik and his followers are far beyond bargaining when this film begins, and it's going to be a bloody good time in Hawthorn for elevated horror and dark comedy fans alike.

Watch The Menu on Netflix.

        The study offers the latest evidence that gene-modified pig organs could be a viable option for people suffering from organ failure.
    

Scientists in China have transplanted a modified pig liver into a brain-dead human – the latest step toward using pig organs to help extremely ill patients with liver failure.

In one of the first trials of its kind, surgeons from Xijing Hospital at the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi'an attached a genetically modified pig liver to a brain-dead patient in March 2024, two months after a related experiment in the United States.

It's the latest in a wave of research into xenotransplantation, or organ transfer from one species to another. 

Several pig kidneys and hearts have been transplanted into living patients since 2022, with some people surviving for weeks afterward.

Scientists hope the practice could eventually help meet the demand for organs among the thousands of people who die each year waiting for a donor.

The Chinese transplant in a brain-dead patient was first reported last year. But the new peer-reviewed study, published in the journal Nature, sheds light on how exactly it worked – and how the next attempts to use pig organs for human patients could unfold.

“This is the first time we've tried to unravel whether the pig liver could function well in the human body,” Dr Lin Wang, one of the study's senior authors and a surgeon at Xijing Hospital, told journalists.

Notably, the surgeons did not remove the brain-dead patient's own liver. They inserted the modified pig liver into the patient, with limited disruption to the original liver.

Six of the pig's genes had been edited to boost the odds that the transplant would succeed, for example adding altered human genes and removing pig genes that facilitate organ rejection.

Over 10 days, the pig liver maintained stable blood flow and did not show signs of rejection.

Most exciting to the researchers, it also produced bile, which aids digestion, and albumin, a protein released into the bloodstream to help regulate fluids.

However, the pig liver did not produce the same amount of bile and albumin as a human liver does, and the study authors said it is “unlikely” that it was enough to support the human body over a long period.

They also don't know how long the pig liver could have functioned, because they ended the experiment after 10 days at the request of the patient's family.

Even so, the findings serve as the earliest indicator that pig livers may be a viable temporary option for people with severe liver failure who are waiting for a permanent transplant.

In that scenario, “the original liver still could work partially, and the pig liver could give it a great supplement or additional support,” Wang said. “This is what we call a ‘bridge therapy'”.

That would be a significant development for patients with liver failure who need a transplant.

Globally, there were more than 41,000 liver transplants in 2023. But organ shortages mean many patients wait months for a donation, which can be taxing.

“Optimising this approach could expand the pool of available organs and save lives in liver emergencies,” Iván Fernández Vega, a professor of pathological anatomy at the University of Oviedo in Spain, who was not involved with the new study, said in a statement.

However, he said the results of the experiment shouldn't be generalised until bigger studies with more people are done. Trials with living patients are still a ways off.

“Although this is a pioneering advance, studies with a larger sample and in living recipients will be necessary to confirm the safety, efficacy, and reproducibility of the procedure,” Vega added.

The study has some other limitations, notably that the patient's original liver had not been removed, which could make it difficult to identify how well the pig liver would have worked on its own.

The researchers also did not study whether the pig liver could take on more complicated functions, like metabolising drugs and detoxing harmful substances.

Additional experiments using pig livers are already on the way. In recent months, Wang's team removed the liver of another brain-dead patient and replaced it with a modified pig liver.

He said the researchers plan to publish their results soon.

        This is not the first time the debate has surfaced in Italy, with a 2022 judgement from Italy's Constitutional Court ruling it unconstitutional to automatically assign a baby their father's surname.
    

A centre-left Italian politician has sparked controversy with a proposal to automatically assign babies their mother's surname. 

Democratic Party Senator Dario Franceschini, a former Minister of Cultural Heritage and Activities, said his proposed measure would serve as ""a compensation for a centuries-old injustice"", in a post shared on X.

As he argued for a break from the tradition of assigning newborns their father's surnames, Franceschini said this convention was a ""cultural source"" for gender inequality.

In response, Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the far-right Lega party Matteo Salvini mocked Franceschini's proposal on X, labelling it ""one of the great priorities of the Italian left"".

""Let's erase these dads from the face of the earth, that way we'll solve all the problems,"" Salvini added. 

Meanwhile, Federico Mollicone, who serves in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, said the proposal marked a shift “from patriarchy to matriarchy”.

However, he did not rule out the option of giving children both of their parents' surnames. 

While it is relatively common in European countries such as Spain and Portugal for children to bear both of their parents' surnames, the father's surname typically comes first. 

This is not the first time that the surname issue has taken hold in Italy. 

In 2022, a judgement issued by Italy's Constitutional Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to automatically assign a father's surname to a baby. Instead, it offered two alternatives: either babies should either be given both of their parents' surnames in an agreed-upon order, or parents should decide together which of the two surnames the child receives. 

Yet when Meloni's government came to power in October 2022, her government did not take any action to draft legislation which would implement the ruling.

Since taking office, Meloni has staunchly defended ""traditional"" Catholic families and values, with her policies harshly impacting families who do not fit into this category. 

In turn, she has been accused of eroding LGBTQ+ parenting rights by criminalising surrogacy carried out abroad and banning non-biological parents from being listed on babies' birth certificates.

Mike Waltz, US National Security Advisor, on Tuesday claimed “full responsibility” for accidentally adding a senior journalist to a group chat in which top American officials discussed impending strikes in Yemen.

""I take full responsibility. I built the group; my job is to make sure everything's coordinated,"" Mike Waltz told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in his first interview on the security breach.

He added that he does not personally know The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the chat group on Signal.

President Donald Trump, however, downplayed the texting of sensitive plans for a military strike against Yemen's Houthis this month, saying it was “the only glitch in two months” of his administration as Democratic lawmakers heaped criticism on the administration for handling highly sensitive information carelessly.

Talking to NBC News, Donald Trump said the lapse “turned out not to be a serious one"", and expressed his continued support for Mike Waltz.

Mike Waltz, according to an article posted online Monday by The Atlantic, appeared to have mistakenly added the magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a chat that included 18 senior administration officials discussing planning for the strike.

“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" Trump said. He also appeared to point the blame on an unnamed Waltz aide for Goldberg being added to the chain. “It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there.""

Waltz said he was not sure how Goldberg ended up on the chat.

""This one in particular, I have never met, don't know, never communicated with,” Waltz said.

Later on Tuesday, Waltz said in an appearance on Fox News Channel's “The Ingraham Angle” that he built the message chain and that White House technical experts were trying to figure out how Goldberg's contact “may have been sucked in.”

On Signal, Trump said “we won't be using it very much” in the future. “That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly.”

One official reported to be on the Signal chain, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, acknowledged during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday that she was travelling overseas during the exchange. She wouldn't say whether she was using her personal or government-issued phone because the matter is under review by the White House National Security Council.

UPI Services were restored for users on Wednesday following an outage that affected several UPI users across India.



""NPCI had faced intermittent technical issues owing to which UPI had partial decline. The same has been addressed now and the system has stabilised. Regret the inconvenience,"" said the National Payments Corporation of India in a post on social media platform X (Formerly Twitter).

Users had reportedly faced unexpected technical issues in transactions while trying to make payment on popular apps like Google Pay, Paytm and others.

Military officials say soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training outside Vilnius

Four United States army soldiers have been killed in Lithuania during training, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said while visiting Warsaw on Wednesday.

“Whilst I was speaking the news came out about four American soldiers who were killed in an incident in Lithuania,” Rutte told reporters, adding that he did not know any details.

The US army later said that a vehicle used by the soldiers had been found submerged in water, adding that the search for the missing troops continued.

“The M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle the four missing US Soldiers were operating during a training exercise has been located in Lithuania,” it said in a statement.

Lithuania's military earlier on Wednesday said they were searching for four US soldiers and a tracked vehicle that had gone missing on Tuesday afternoon.

A statement from the US army's Europe and Africa public affairs office in Wiesbaden, Germany, said the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time.

“A possible scene has now been identified, and a search and rescue operation is under way,” the Lithuanian military said in a statement.

It said further information would be provided as new information becomes available.

The Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported that four US soldiers and a vehicle were reported missing on Tuesday afternoon during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10km (6 miles) from the border with Belarus.

The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all Nato members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.

Relations soured further over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and the Lithuanian president, Gitanas Nausėda, has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Ukraine in its fight against the Russian president, Vladimir Putin's, forces.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Experiment onboard upcoming SpaceX mission will examine how nutrient-rich oyster mushrooms grow in microgravity

An Australian company will attempt to be the first to grow a crop of mushrooms in space, aboard SpaceX's Fram2 mission set to launch in early April.

In an experiment aboard Fram2, the first human spaceflight mission to orbit Earth's polar regions, the Australian firm FOODiQ Global is aiming to grow oyster mushrooms in microgravity.

Launching from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the Fram2 mission is planned to last between three and five days. The mushroom experiment will be conducted on the last day by the Australian adventurer Eric Philips.

Phillips will be only the fourth Australian-born person to go to space, after Dr Paul Scully-Power and Dr Andy Thomas, who flew for Nasa as US citizens, and Dr Chris Boshuizen in 2021, whose suborbital journey aboard a Blue Origin vehicle lasted about 10 minutes.

FOODiQ Global's chief executive, Dr Flávia Fayet-Moore, described mushrooms as a “perfect space crop”, citing their fast growth, ability to be eaten raw and nutritional value.

“Because we don't have technology to process food in space yet … Nasa is currently prioritising research into ‘grow, pick and eat' crops – things like lettuce, tomatoes and mushrooms,” she said.

Mushrooms are one of the few foods that naturally contain vitamin D, which increases when they are exposed to ultraviolet light.

“They double in size every day,” Fayet-Moore said. “They don't need a lot of inputs: they don't need any special fertilisers, they don't need a lot of water.”

“They also have potassium that's found in vegetables, but then they also have selenium and copper, which are typically found in nuts and seeds,” she said. “It's a very versatile example of a nutrient-dense food.”

Food and nutrition for lunar and Mars missions numbers among the top 30 priorities in Nasa's list of civil space challenges.

It is not the first time fungi have been sent to space. Last August, an Australian experiment led by Swinburne University astrophysicists Dr Sara Webb and Dr Rebecca Allen sent vials containing lion's mane, turkey tail and Cordyceps to the International Space Station.

The vials contained mycelia (root-like networks of fungi) but did not have adequate space for mushrooms (the fruiting bodies of the organisms) to grow.

Aboard Fram2, if the mycelia fruit into oyster mushrooms, Philips will be responsible for documenting mushroom growth, crop yield and signs of contamination.

Upon return to Earth, FOODiQ Global will analyse the mushrooms' nutritional content to see how microgravity affected their growth, comparing the results to control kits stored in Florida.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Russian foreign minister's comments come after Kyiv and Moscow agree to maritime ceasefire, despite Kremlin citing need for sanctions relief first. What we know on day 1,127

A Black Sea maritime security deal aims to bring Moscow back to predictable grain and fertiliser markets that would allow for profit and ensure global food security, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said in remarks published late on Tuesday. “We want the grain and fertiliser market to be predictable, so that no one tries to ‘ward us off' from it,” Lavrov told the Russian state Channel One television. “Not only because we want … to make a legitimate profit in fair competition, but also because we are concerned about the food security situation in Africa and other countries of the Global South.”

Russia and Ukraine agreed to “eliminate the use of force” in the Black Sea after parallel talks with US negotiators in Saudi Arabia, though the Kremlin said a maritime ceasefire would start only if it received sanctions relief on agricultural exports. Donald Trump said that the US was reviewing the Russian conditions after the Kremlin insisted it had negotiated concessions with the White House that would mark the first major recision of sanctions since the full-scale invasion of 2022.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the deals did not require sanctions relief to come into force – which he said would weaken Ukraine's position – and would come into force immediately. If Russia violated them he would ask Trump to impose additional sanctions on Moscow and provide more weapons for Ukraine, he said. “We have no faith in the Russians, but we will be constructive,” he said.

The Ukrainian president also said there had been no agreement on an unconditional ceasefire because “the Russians didn't want it”. He said he believed as the negotiations continued “people will not believe the Russians more and more with every day”.

Zelenskyy criticised Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, who had said in the run-up to the talks that Russia's staged referendums in the four Ukrainian regions it partially or completely occupies were legitimate and had demonstrated that “the overwhelming majority” wanted to be “under Russian rule”. The Ukrainian president said Witkoff's comments “are very much in line with the messages of the Kremlin”, but he added that he hoped that over time the US negotiator and others in the White House would gradually come to see that the Russian leadership was insincere.

Russia's foreign ministry said the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant was a Russian facility and transferring control of it to Ukraine or any other country was impossible. Russian forces seized the plant early in the invasion. Donald Trump, during a phone conversation this month with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suggested the US could help run and possibly own Ukraine's nuclear power plants, including Zaporizhzhia.

Estonia's top diplomat said Russia has gained an upper hand in the ceasefire talks and suggested the US consider a time limit if there is no progress, ahead of a meeting with secretary of state Marco Rubio. Estonian foreign minister Margus Tsahkna and his counterparts from Latvia and Lithuania met jointly on Tuesday in Washington with Rubio as the Baltic nations lead concerns over the new US push on Russia and Ukraine. “Putin has now an upper hand in some ways,” Tsahkna told AFP in an interview late Monday ahead of his talks with Rubio. “The question is now, how long is Trump actually going to give Putin to play the games?” he said.

The mayor of Ukraine's southern port of Mykolaiv, Oleksandr Senkevych, said there were emergency power outages early on Wednesday in the city, following a report by the region's governor that seven drones were destroyed overnight in the region.

A Russian court sentenced on Tuesday a woman to two years' jail for holding protest signs opposing President Vladimir Putin and the Ukraine conflict, the latest in a series of convictions targeting dissent. Elena Abramova, a translator from the north-western city of St Petersburg, publicly held up placards in 2023 that read “A world without war, a Russia without Putin!” and “Freedom for Navalny! Freedom for all political prisoners”, according to the city's court service.

Ukraine's SBU security service said on Tuesday it had detained a serviceman in the Sumy region it accused of helping Moscow attack Ukrainian troops fighting in Russia's Kursk region by giving away their location. “While at the front, the ‘mole' was preparing coordinates for the aggressor's missile and bomb attacks on the locations of Ukrainian troops,” the SBU alleged on Telegram.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Scientists may have just found a canal the Romans built 2,100 years ago while battling the Celts.

Scientists in France may be hot on the trail of a long-lost canal that the Romans built over two millennia ago while battling the Celts.

The waterway, known as the Marius Canal, was built around 2,100 years ago within the Rhône River delta. It was the first major Roman water hydraulic feature in what was then Gaul, preceding dams, watermills and aqueducts. According to historical accounts, it was built between 104 and 102 B.C. by the troops of Julius Caesar's uncle, the general Gaius Marius. Its construction was meant to aid efforts in the Cimbrian Wars, a series of conflicts between the Roman Republic and Celtic tribes, the Cimbri and Teutones, that were migrating south from Jutland, present-day Denmark.

At that time, the Roman Republic was protecting its new province in Gaul, a region that covered what is now France, Belgium and parts of western Germany. But the encroachment of the Celts put that land, as well as the rest of the Roman Republic, at risk.

""The Roman general Marius came to southern Gaul in 104 B.C. to head off the risk that the Cimbri and Teutones ravaging Gaul and Spain would reach Italy,"" Simon Loseby, an honorary lecturer in medieval history and an expert on southern Gaul at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. who was not involved in the study, told Live Science. ""He headed a very large force, and urgently needed to supply it by sea from Rome.""

So, Marius ordered the canal be built so it could supply his troops. It bypassed the treacherous Rhône River mouths and connected the city of Arles to the Mediterranean, enabling the safe passage of large supply boats. Ultimately, the canal was a success, and the Romans defeated the Cimbri and Teutones in 101 B.C. The canal was subsequently gifted to Rome's ally in the region, the Greek settlement of Massalia, now Marseille, which is said to have gained significant revenue from its commercial use before the canal vanished from the historical record a few centuries later.

""Despite all the research carried out in recent centuries, the Marius Canal hasn't been found,"" study lead author Joé Juncker, a geoarchaeologist at the University of Strasbourg in France, told Live Science in an email. It was last mentioned by the Roman author Pliny the Elder in the first century A.D., but its traces have all but disappeared.

In 2013, a geophysical survey of a delta in the Vigueirat marshes just south of Arles revealed an underwater feature that scientists hypothesized could be an ancient canal. Subsequent excavations around the site unearthed 69 pieces of Roman ceramics, two ancient wooden stakes and two extensive cobblestone platforms. Radiocarbon dating of the stakes placed them within the first to fourth century A.D., while organic materials within the platforms dated between the first century B.C. and third century A.D. when the Marius Canal would have been used.

Since the site's discovery 12 years ago, researchers have been trying to gather evidence to confirm whether this area really hosts the long-lost Marius Canal.

In the new study, Juncker and his team drilled sediment cores from the ancient canal and its banks and took physical measurements to compare with the geophysical surveys conducted in 2013.

""The canal length, width, orientation, sediment content and the measured radiocarbon dates confirm that it was a navigable canal in Roman times, partially excavated in a former branch of the Rhône and an ancient lagoon,"" Juncker said.

Natural tributaries in river channels are usually around 360 to 590 feet (110 to 180 meters) wide, while the new analysis shows the putative Marius Canal is much narrower at around 98 feet (30 m) wide. This aligns with other Roman canals. This width would have enabled large Roman ships to navigate the area, the authors reported in the study, published in the April issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.

The new research strengthens the case that there was a canal here, Loseby said. ""It's yet another indication of the Roman capacity to conceive of and undertake large infrastructural projects at speed, despite relative technological limitations.""

Both Loseby and Juncker hope future archaeological discoveries will further establish whether the canal is the Marius Canal. Specifically, they hope excavations could lead to the discovery of quays (landing platforms for ships) or towpaths (waterways where draft animals would tow boats), which could help confirm the use of the canal and the duration of its use.

""Geoarchaeology is a science full of potential, but we must bear in mind that, without confirmation from archaeological studies, it is not possible to attribute this canal to Marius for the moment,"" said Juncker. Research there is ongoing.

The case has faded from view for Tom Yeager. But back in 2006 the former Colonial Athletic Association commissioner presided over one of the bigger NCAA infractions cases of the decade.

Then Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson (and his staff) were accused of making hundreds of phone calls to prospects against NCAA rules. All of it was distilled to a series of major violations. Not only that, but Sampson did the same thing after he moved on to Indiana. He and that school were sanctioned as well in 2008. 

A five-year show cause order applied by the NCAA essentially rendered Sampson unhirable in the college space. He spent six years in the NBA as an assistant before getting back to college with Houston in 2014. 

You should be familiar with what has happened since. Once a pariah, Sampson led the Cougars back to becoming a national power. They're currently in their sixth consecutive Sweet 16 this week playing Purdue Friday night in a Midwest Region semifinal in Indianapolis. 

Time heals all infractions, it seems. The transgressions that altered Sampson's career and life are so distant they seem almost laughable now. In an age when NIL marketing agents run amok and the going rate for top football and basketball prospects is $1 million, wrongdoing not only has been redefined, the concept has almost been eliminated.

""I had dinner with Dave Berst,"" Yeager said, referring to the former all-powerful NCAA enforcement chief. ""We were joking. What in the heck is against the rules now?""

Not much. But back in 2006 Yeager sat in judgment over Sampson and Oklahoma as chairman of the NCAA Committee on Infractions in that Oklahoma case.

""It was a hearing where kind of the behavior escalated it more than the actual violations …,"" Yeager said. ""I have a real vague recollection. It was kind of argumentative. I won't say fighting. He left right in the middle of the case [for the Indiana job], right before it was coming to the hearing. So it was kind of a get out of town ahead of the posse showing up. 

""It wasn't on the top 10 most egregious list by any stretch.""

But those were the days when – the saying goes – the NCAA could convict a ham sandwich if it desired. Not so now. With the Power Four set to assemble its own investigative staff in the House settlement, there may not be much left for the NCAA to investigate. 

""I get disappointed when I see a couple of the cases that have come out that sound like escalated parking tickets,"" Yeager added. ""I'm well aware that escalated parking tickets can be a problem. But sooner or later you'd like to see some felons convicted. If there are any more. It may be tough to become a felon.""

But this is not so much a NCAA rehash, but about a (career) remake. This is also about a ladder. Sampson still has it. Oklahoma AD Joe Castiglione sent it as a gift when Sampson got that Houston job in 2014. The same Joe C who watched the OU hoops program get slapped after Sampson's transgressions.

The same Castiglione who is rooting just as hard as any Houston fan this week. 

""I just believed in him. We had such a great working relationship,"" Castiglione said. ""He had done a wonderful job at Oklahoma.""

After the NBA, Sampson started over at Houston. When he arrived the program hadn't won an NCAA Tournament game since the Phi Slama Jama days in 1984. It took him until Year 4 at Houston to finally break a 33-year tournament drought

The ladder was both symbolic and practical. Ladders are used to cut down nets following championships. Castiglione's congratulatory note that went with the gift read, ""I hope you'll need to use this a lot during your journey as a Houston Cougar.""

The ladder has been broken out to cut down nets each time Houston clinches a regular-season championship. That has happened eight times since Sampson arrived. (Either after clinching at home, or the next home game after clinching on the road.)

Nineteen years after the fact, the lens through which to judge/remember Sampson has refocused. How many of us are at the peak of our careers at age 69? How many of us are among the most beloved figures in our profession? Sampson is both. 

""There's a lot to explain,"" Castiglione said. ""There really wasn't animosity. Obviously we were very disappointed having gone through that and we self-imposed our own penalties. After the infractions committee there were a few more [penalties]. No one wants to have that happen.

""It wasn't like we were dismissing the disappointment. [But Sampson] was totally forthcoming.. Even the NCAA investigative staff were remarking on how much cooperation there was. 

""For whatever season he thought he was outworking his competition.""

Besides, we live in an age when coaches' images get remade like multi-million dollar Play-Doh. 

Under Rick Pitino, Louisville became the first men's basketball program to have a national championship vacated. Now he is the toast of New York with St. John's. 

Disgraced former Baylor coach Dave Bliss has had four combined pro, high school and college jobs since resigning amid a player's murder and NCAA scandal. 

Chris Beard is leading Ole Miss into the Sweet 16 after being fired at Texas in 2023. 

Sampson's misdeeds were nowhere similar to the issues for those coaches. An allegation that he misled NCAA investigators at Indiana was denied by the coach. 

""There wasn't anything else,"" Castiglione said. ""There were phone calls."" 

For 12 years Sampson and Castiglione were a powerful partnership. Sampson took OU – a football school – to 11 NCAA Tournaments and the 2002 Final Four. Four years later the partnership was over. Sampson resigned at Oklahoma. 

The ban on cell phone contact was so ludicrous that the NCAA eventually changed the rules. What Sampson did is now legal. Coaches can make unlimited calls and texts to recruits following a prospect's high school sophomore year. 

""Everything he did was [eventually] allowed …,"" former Houston AD Mack Rhoades, now at Baylor, told CBS Sports back then. ""Yes, those rules are no longer applicable but rules are rules.""

""It's important to consider the context of the Oklahoma and IU phone call violation cases …,"" said Josh Lens, head of The Compliance Group, a firm that shepherds schools through NCAA compliance reviews and audits. ""The recruiting phone call rules at the time were very technical and complicated. On top of that, the NCAA and Committee on Infractions expected coaches to document their recruiting calls … The recruiting phone call rules have changed considerably since [then]. Coaches have more freedom to make calls today.""

From two NCAA cases, a case can be made -- that Sampson's excellence lifted Houston the final step into the Big 12 a couple of years ago. Certainly, Houston was valued as a market, a recruiting territory and for its football potential. But the potential to have both programs humming at a Power Five level was important. 

""He built that program when it was from the ashes,"" Castiglione said of Sampson. ""It's beyond impressive.""

And it's not over. That six-year Sweet 16 run leads the nation. For a third straight year, the Cougars have a No. 1 seed. They talk much more about the Cougars as that national power, not their coach who landed two programs in NCAA jail. 

A lot of the past has indeed faded from view – depending on the eye of the beholder.

Grant Ellis found his happily ever after in fiancée Juliana Pasquarosa — but not before seemingly blindsiding runner-up Litia Garr.

While Grant broke things off with Litia in the Monday, March 24, finale of The Bachelor, she claimed Juliana should have “a lot of questions” based on what the lead had promised her. Fast-forward to the live portion of the episode and Litia reunited with Grant on stage for the first time — and claimed he previously told her he could “stop the show” early because she was his No. 1.

Grant, for his part, exclusively told Us Weekly that he and Juliana — who said she hadn't watched the finale — had spoken about Litia's reaction to him ending things. While he apologized to Litia at the finale, Grant told Us there was “a lot” she said that he “didn't align with.”

“But I let her speak her truth and her piece. I'm not gonna sit up there and argue with her on stage about what she thought I said,” he told Us. “But I think that having a little more clarity — when you are the Bachelor, you do see your final two contestants as somebody that could be your wife. That's where some confusion came into play. There's room for interpretation when things are said, ‘off camera.' At that point in time, I can't really say much. I'm not gonna argue, I just have to accept whatever the conditions are and apologize and let her feel how she feels because she's in a tough situation and she's hurt. I understand.”



Scroll down to see what Grant and Juliana have said about Litia after the finale:

Juliana told Entertainment Weekly that Grant shared “everything” with her about his indecision when it came to popping the question.

“Nothing that I saw was a surprise. Nothing shocked me,” she told the outlet. “I felt really prepared about the fact that he had a relationship and a connection with somebody else on there, and a couple other ladies. It made it easier to watch back because I knew even seeing the relationship that you had with Litia, it is just a different relationship than we have, and that's OK. You had to make the best decision for yourself. But nothing shook me or made me nervous. I was prepared.”

Watching it back, Grant said it's “very emotional.” He added, “ I'll continue to reiterate this, being in the position I'm in, there's an opportunity for Litia to speak her truth and what she felt like happened. The difference between it is a lot of those things are not on camera, so there's a lot of room for interpretation. Me being being a lead, I just have to own it, and I just have to apologize. It's a unique situation where you're dating multiple people and if you have feelings for somebody, you're going to tell them how you feel or you're going to tell them that you do see a future — because at that point in time, you do. It's just coming down to what fits you best, and with the combination of the limited time, it is a recipe for some turmoil.”

Juliana — who chose not to watch Grant and Litia's live conversation — said that even if she did, she's “sure” that nothing Litia said would come as a surprise since the couple had “so much conversation” before the episode.

“I trust him and I choose him and I think he handled himself the best that he could in that really tough situation,” Juliana said.

Grant exclusively told Us why he chose to have a conversation with Juliana about Litia. “We definitely talked about it,” Grant said. “It's always a situation where it's uncomfortable, but I think not being able to sit there and watch it, we went into our moment just thinking about the weight of our moment. Looking back, it might have been a benefit — it may have not been — but it's definitely hard to go from an extreme low to an extreme high and to not wear it on your face. I just was happy that we were able to express our relationship and do it in a way that everybody saw.”

While reflecting on his journey with Litia, Grant told Parade, “Looking back at some of the things she said that she chose that time to get really personal, that's OK. I hope this isn't a detriment, [but] me being in a lead [role], whatever darts are thrown my way, I kind of just gotta take it. I understand that she is hurt. I understand that it's a situation or opportunity to express how she feels and to garner maybe an audience to back her up. I feel sorry for hurting her. And yeah, I just apologize. What more can I do?”

When asked about Litia's remark that she would have “questions” if she were Juliana, the winner said that she and the runner-up are “two different people.”

“We tried to go through this process as true to ourselves as we could,” she said. “And I think at the end of the day, I didn't have to ask any questions because I was provided with all the information I needed before the season started airing. Nothing shocked me at all.”

Juliana reiterated that she made a “choice” not to watch Litia on stage. “I decided not to listen,” she told Glamour. “We've done so good this far watching it all back that there was no point in trying to taint that by listening and hearing it. I wanted him to be able to go in with a clear mind and give Litia some grace and compassion, and I didn't need to hear it.”

“[Litia] is so deserving of love and I hope that she gets that,” Juliana told E! News.

Juliana told Us that she and Litia “have to go through this process very uniquely and very true to who we are,” adding, “And I wish her well.”

US President Donald Trump has distanced himself from the Signal chat group scandal, saying he had ""nothing to do with it"", and ""I was told it was Mike (Waltz)"" who was responsible

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says ""someone made a big mistake"" inviting journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to a Signal group chat with top US officials, but he says none of the messages put the lives of service members at risk

Read the messages Trump officials exchanged on the leaked Signal thread here

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticises The Atlantic's editor Goldberg as an ""anti-Trump hater"", as the Trump administration reacts to the fallout of the scandal

She also repeats the Trump administration's position that there was no classified information in the leaked messages 

Messages from the group chat newly published by The Atlantic appear to show Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing information about US air strikes on Yemen earlier this month

One message from Hegseth outlines timings for ""when the first bombs will definitely drop""

Goldberg says he did not originally plan to publish the most sensitive messages from top US military and intelligence officials, but now wants the public to draw their own conclusions after the White House attempted to ""downplay the significance"" of the messages

Watch: White House says there were 'certainly no war plans discussed' in group text

Edited by Brandon Livesay, with Bernd Debusmann reporting from White House

The BBC's North America editor Sarah Smith has spoken with The Atlantic's editor Jeffrey Goldberg to find out what the reactions have been since he reported that Trump administration officials accidentally invited him to a Signal group chat. 

Today, the White House has vigorously defended the group chat, saying no war plans were shared and no classified information was texted. 

Goldberg tells the BBC the text messages seem like ""sensitive, war-planning information to me"".

""This is why we put the all the information on our website, just so people can read themselves and make up their own minds,"" Goldberg says.

Goldberg says the Trump administration is more interested in blaming reporters than ""actually acknowledging that they have a massive national security breach, and that they should just go fix it"". 

""I mean, that's, that's the point,"" he says. ""That's the point about leadership. Leadership, you deal with your mistakes, try to make things better, move on. But that's not the playbook here.""

The Signal chat leak ""doesn't bother me"", Trump tells reporters in the Oval Office.

The president goes on to suggest that Signal may be a ""defective"" platform and ""isn't very good"". 

""Everybody uses signal, but it could be a defective platform, and we're gonna have to find that answer,"" Trump says

He offers no evidence as to why he thinks the Signal app could be defective.

For context, Signal is the publicly available messaging app that was used by top US officials to discuss military strikes on Houthis. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently invited a journalist to that group chat.

President Trump is asked who was responsible for the Signal leak.

""Mike Waltz, I guess he claimed responsibly,"" Trump says about his National Security Advisor. ""I was told it was Mike.""

He adds that Waltz ""took responsibility"" and that no other of his officials are responsible. 

""Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this.""

Trump also speaks about the success of the military strike on Houthi targets, saying it was ""beyond our wildest expectations"".

He says the strikes will continue ""for a long time"".

Asked about the Signal scandal, Trump claims it is a ""witch hunt"" that is being overhyped by the media.

He goes on to says he had ""nothing to do with it"" and ""wasn't there"", and that the US campaign against Yemen's Houthis is going well.

When asked if there was classified information sent in the Signal chat, he says ""I don't know,"" but he has ""heard"" that there wasn't. ""I really don't know,"" he says.

""You'll have to ask the various people involved."" 

President Trump has just announced new tariff measures at an event inside the Oval Office. 

He's now taking questions from reporters and we're expecting one or two about the Signal scandal.

You can follow all the action by pressing Watch live at the of the page.

We're expecting to hear from US President Donald Trump later today.

He is scheduled to speak in the Oval Office about tariffs, but he usually takes questions from reporters - so expect the president to be asked about the Signal chat group scandal.

Trump has previously said that nothing in the chat could have ""compromised"" the attack plans in Yemen, though he did admit a member of his team may have ""screwed up"".

The president yesterday said ""there was no classified information, as I understand it"" in the messages. 

Earlier today White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt re-iterated that stance.

The leader of the Republican majority in the Senate has said that those involved in the Signal chat affair had made a mistake and should own up to it.

“The important thing here is these guys, they made a mistake, they know it. They should own it and fix it so that never happens again,” John Thune told CNN.

When asked whether Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth should resign, the majority leader avoided answering and said that the strikes on the Houthis alluded to in the chat seemed to have been ""pretty flawless"".

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, and other members of the Trump administration, have spent a lot of time today talking about what the Signal group chat text messages were not. 

They weren't “war plans”, they didn't include a detailed list of targets or specific military units, they didn't contain detailed flight paths or routes, and they didn't reveal intelligence sources of methods.

Trump officials have tended to avoid discussion of what was actually in those messages – including timings of the strikes, military assets used and post-strike damage reports – and whether sharing those details through a commercial messaging service put American national security at risk.

For an administration that regularly touts how it is restoring “common sense” to government, such misdirection and semantic wordplay may seem decidedly out of step with reality. 

As the political pressure continues, the administration's ability to hold this line will be tested.

Top of the news agenda today is the release of the full Signal group chat, which the US administration has repeatedly said did not include any classified information. 

The new information includes a thread of messages apparently written by defence secretary Pete Hegseth, where he tells officials - and inadvertently The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg - specific timings of US strikes in Yemen.

A month before the breach of Signal group chat of high-level US officials was revealed, the National Security Agency (NSA) sent out an operational security special memo to its employees to caution them about using the encrypted messaging application, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports, citing internal NSA documents.

""A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application,"" the agency said in February. ""The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information.""

The memo warned that Russian hackers were using phishing scams to get access to conversations on the application and bypassing encryption.

The agency also said that the application - as well as WhatsApp - were permitted for unclassified uses but not for communicating about more sensitive information, CBS reports.

Since the messages were first released there's been a distinct partisan divide in the reaction from lawmakers:

Democratic Senator Mark Kelly said ""this is what happens when you put unqualified people in important jobs where lives are on the line,"" while Senator Ruben Gallego said ""the incompetence and cover-up is embarrassing"".

Some, including Gallego, have called for Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi pushed this message while displaying larger print-out screenshots of the messages during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier today.

Republicans, meanwhile, have by and large defended their colleauges.

President Donald Trump has insisted that none of the information was classified, and ""there was nothing in there that compromised"" the operation - something reiterated by his press secretary earlier today.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said the administration has ""acknowledged it was a mistake"" to add the journalist to the chat, but ""no one was jeopardised because of it"". That was echoed by Senator Ted Cruz who called it a ""screw up"" but that the Trump administration ""took responsibility"" for it.

However one top Republican is among those calling for an official probe into the incident - Senator Roger Wicker said based on his knowledge, ""I would have wanted it classified"".

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier

Secretary of State Marco Rubio just spoke to media in Jamaica, where he is on a state visit.

He's asked about the Signal scandal and says it's obvious that ""someone made a big mistake and added a journalist"". 

""Nothing against journalists, but you ain't supposed to be on that thing,"" he says.

Rubio downplays his role in the Signal chat group, saying he messaged to identify his point of contact, and then messaged again after the strikes were carried out to offer his congratulations.

He says the information shared on Signal wasn't intended to be made public, but says the Pentagon has said none of the information threatened the lives of service members.

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

Karoline Leavitt, in her recently concluded White House press conference, presented the American public with a choice. 

Who did they believe in the group-chat controversy? Jeffrey Goldberg, whom she characterised as an “anti-Trump sensationalist reporter"", or Pete Hegseth, the Senate-confirmed secretary of defence who “honourably served our nation in uniform”.

That's the kind of framing that's a red meat appeal to Donald Trump's base. The administration's strategy for handling this crisis is to trust that Trump's loyal supporters - and the Republican politicians they help elect - will stick with the president. 

Such faith has carried Trump through more formidable situations than this, and White House officials seem to believe that it will do so again.

There are risks to this strategy, however. While the base may keep Trump afloat, Republicans need more than their core supporters to win elections – such as state races later this year and in the 2026 congressional mid-terms. 

Undecided middle-of-the-road Americans may look at the details of the text messages and be less willing trust that Hegseth is honestly assessing whether his own actions put national security at risk. 

And trust, once eroded, is difficult to win back.

Pete Hegseth reaffirms there was 'no classified information' in Signal chat

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has again denied sending war plans in the Signal chat group.

Speaking to reporters from an air strip in Hawaii, Hegseth says the information in the messages released today ""doesn't look like war plans"".

""They know it's not war plans"", he says, ""there's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information"".

His job, Hegseth adds ""is to provide updates in real time... that's what I did"".

The messages from Hegseth, which were shared by The Atlantic, noted what time F-18 fighter aircraft were scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes would take place and in what time frame ""trigger-based"" attacks could occur.

Mike Waltz criticised Joe Biden's team for email-related security conduct in the past

By Jake Horton

Several of the Trump officials apparently included in the Signal chat have previously criticised other people for their handling of classified information.

In June 2023, Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who appears to have added the Atlantic journalist to the chat - criticised President Biden's National Security Adviser, external for sending ""top secret emails"" to a private account.

In January 2023, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, who was a Fox News host at the time, criticised Biden as ""nefarious, sloppy and dumb"" after classified documents were found in his garage.

Talking about the same incident, Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: ""Any time documents have been removed from their proper setting it's a problem, I don't care who did it.""

And earlier this month US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, when posting about government leaks, external, said that ""any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such"".

JD Vance gave a very quick set of remarks to US Marines this afternoon, making no mention of the Signal scandal that is dominating headlines. 

He talked about the importance of investing in the military and praised the Marines for their sacrifices to the US. 

Minutes ago, White House Press Secretary Karoline said she needed to cut her media briefing short so it wouldn't overlap with Vance's speech.

Leavitt faced dozens of questions from reporters about the Signal chat group.

The White House briefing just wrapped up a bit earlier than usual, with Karoline Leavitt saying she didn't want to interfere with JD Vance's speech.

So let's pivot to that.

The vice-president is speaking to US marines in Quantico, Virginia as his team battles allegations that they mishandled sensitive military information. A reminder that Vance was one of the members of that Signal group chat which inadvertently included a journalist.

During his first few minutes of speaking, Vance is yet to address the Signal scandal that is gripping the White House. He talks to Marines about investing in the US military ""like we never have before"".

We're listening in and will bring you more updates as they happen.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

We've just wrapped up an unusually short - and tense - news briefing at the White House. It lasted 24 minutes. 

The ending was abrupt, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt citing a desire to not ""counter-programme"" Vice President JD Vance's remarks at a US Marine Corps base in Quantico. 

News briefings vary in length, but in this administration have rarely timed in at under 45 minutes. 

As a reminder, we're now also going to hear directly from President Trump from the Oval Office at 16:00 ET. 

Billionaire Elon Musk will look into how a journalist from The Atlantic was added to a Signal chat that included some of the highest-ranking officials in Washington DC, Leavitt says.

Musk, who has made news headlines for leading the charge to terminate thousands of federal workers, will now ""figure out how this number was inadvertently added"" to the Signal chat, she says.

Musk's assistance will help ""ensure this can never happen again,"" Leavitt continues.

Watch: Signal messaging app is 'secure and efficient', says White House

A reporter has just asked Leavitt whether Trump's team will review how often they'll use Signal in the wake of the scandal, and other applications like it. 

Leavitt repeats her earlier remarks that the app is ""improved"", and claims that Signal is the ""most safe and efficient way of communicating"" when officials can't be inside a room together.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive order to overhaul the American election system, including requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration.

The order, titled ‘Preserving and protecting the integrity of American elections,' calls on states to work with federal agencies and share voter rolls, as well as prosecute election crimes. It also threatens to slash federal funding for states that fail to comply.

“Despite pioneering self-government, the United States now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing,” the text of the order reads, listing measures taken by other nations to make the election process more secure, including the introduction of biometric identification and limiting voting by mail.

“Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional republic.  The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,” the document says.

Among other things, the order requires proof of citizenship for voters to be registered in federal elections. The measure is effectively aimed at doing the same thing as the long-anticipated Republican-backed Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act). While voting in federal elections by non-citizens is already a felony, Republicans have long argued that more is needed to restore public confidence in elections.

Voting rights groups, however, have been critical of the proposed change, arguing that many voting-age Americans do not have proof of citizenship readily available. According to a 2023 report compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice and other groups, some 21.3 million people, around 9% of US citizens of voting age, do not have such documents on hand.

Trump has long been critical of the US voting system, arguing that it is very susceptible to irregularities and fraud. He has been particularly opposed to voting by mail. Under the executive order, votes must now be “cast and received” before the election day, with federal funding conditional on state compliance.

The move has already faced criticism from various parties that have vowed to challenge it in court. Oregon's secretary of state, Tobias Read, branded the order an “action against democracy.” His state relies heavily on mail-in balloting.

“It is every American citizen's right to hold politicians accountable at the ballot box. This executive order is a threat to that right and a threat to our responsibility as states to run fair, secure elections. This illegal action against American democracy will be challenged, and it will not stand,” Read said in a statement.

PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that a proposed European armed force for possible deployment in Ukraine in tandem with an eventual peace deal could “respond” to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.

Macron spoke after talks with Ukraine's president and ahead of a summit in Paris of some 30 nations on Thursday that will discuss the proposed force for Ukraine that Macron suggested could be deployed in “important towns” and elsewhere.

“If there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it's our usual framework of engagement,” Macron said. “Our soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.”

Macron, together with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, has been driving an effort to build a coalition of nations willing in one way or another to support the deployment of an armed force in Ukraine, with the aim of securing a lasting peace by dissuading Russia from attacking the country again. 

Macron didn't specify what sort of response he envisaged in the eventuality of a Russian attack.

He said the proposed European forces wouldn't be stationed on the frontlines in Ukraine, “nor be engaged on the first day opposite Russian forces.” They would “be forces that dissuade the Russians from attacking again. And by holding important towns, strategic bases, mark the clear support from several European governments and allies,” he said.




“So we are not on the frontlines, we don't go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It's a pacifist approach,” he said. “The only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.” 

Macron is expecting 31 delegations around the table Thursday morning at the presidential Elysee Palace. That's more than the French leader gathered for a first meeting in Paris in February — evidence that the coalition to help Ukraine, possibly with boots on the ground, is gathering steam, according to the presidential office.

The big elephant in the room will be the country that's missing: the United States. 

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has shown no public enthusiasm for the coalition's discussions about potentially sending troops into Ukraine after an eventual ceasefire to help make peace stick. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has dismissed the idea of a European deployment or even the need for it. 

“It's a combination of a posture and a pose and a combination of also being simplistic,” he said in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.

That's not the view in Europe. The shared premise upon which the coalition is being built is that Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine — starting with the illegal seizure of the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and culminating in the 2022 full-scale invasion that unleashed all-out war — shows that he cannot be trusted and that a European force could help dissuade another attack.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Macron both suggest that a foreign contingent in Ukraine could also provide military training, something allies already have been doing outside Ukraine, preparing more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops for battle against Russia's larger and expanding military and helping to make up for some of Ukraine's losses from more than three years of intense fighting.

“Primarily, any contingent consists of combat units, but they are above all intended to control the situation, monitor it, carry out joint training, and also to prevent any desire by Russia to return with renewed waves of aggression,” Zelenskyy said at Wednesday's news conference with Macron.

European officials say that in any peace-deal scenario, Ukraine's first line of defense against any future Russian aggression would be Ukraine's own army. The 27-nation European Union is pressing ahead with a so-called steel “porcupine strategy” aimed at making Ukraine an even tougher nut for Russia to crack, by strengthening its armed forces and defense industry. Britain is also pledging continued military aid so Ukraine can keep fighting if peace talks fail or a ceasefire is broken.

Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros (US$ 2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support. 

The basket of possible options that European military chiefs and planners have been looking at includes an array of scenarios they have been preparing for government leaders to consider and, ultimately, green light. 

A possible option that France has been pushing would be a deployment by coalition members of a sizable force in central Ukraine, somewhere along the Dnieper River, away from frontlines, said a French official who spoke on condition of anonymity about the closed-door discussions.

The official said other possible options being examined are deploying a support force even further away from the fronts, in Ukraine's far west, or in a neighboring country. 

British officials have said a force could consist of between 10,000 and 30,000 troops — which would be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming.

RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A panel of Brazil Supreme Court justices on Wednesday unanimously accepted charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro over an alleged attempt to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat, and ordered him to stand trial.



Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet has accused Bolsonaro and 33 others of attempting a coup that included a plan to poison his successor, current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and kill a Supreme Court judge.



The justices said seven close allies should also stand trial on five counts: attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organization, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage characterized by violence and a serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.

The former president has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and says he's being politically persecuted. A lawyer for Bolsonaro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.



“It seems that there is something personal against me,” Bolsonaro told journalists after the panel's decision. “The accusation is very serious and (is) unfounded.” 



Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction carries a sentence of up to 12 years. When combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars.



“Coups kill,” Justice Flávio Dino said when casting his vote. “It doesn't matter if it happens today, the following month or a few years later.”






Gonet on Tuesday said those facing the charges sought to keep Bolsonaro in power “at all costs,” in a multi-step scheme that accelerated after the far-right politician lost to the current president.



As in his February indictment, Gonet said part of the plot included a plan to kill Lula and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who were put under surveillance by the alleged conspirators. The plan did not go ahead at the last minute because the accused failed to get the army's commander on board, Gonet said.



“Frustration overwhelmed the members of the criminal organization who, however, did not give up on the violent seizure of power, not even after the elected president of the republic was sworn in,” he said.



That was a reference to the Jan. 8, 2023, riot when Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Supreme Court, presidential palace and Congress in Brasilia a week after Lula took office.

De Moraes on Wednesday showed the panel a video with scenes from that day. “We had a very violent coup attempt,” he said. “A savage violence, in total incivility, with the request for military intervention in the coup d'état.”



Bolsonaro on Wednesday denied any involvement and said he was in the U.S. at the time, having left a few days before the end of his term. “One of the five charges against me is destruction of property. Only if it were by telepathy,” he told journalists. 



Bolsonaro's running mate during the 2022 election and former Defense Minister Walter Braga Netto, ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres and his aide-de-camp Mauro Cid, among others, will also stand trial. The court will decide on the others' fate later.



Observers had expected the charges to be accepted. 



“The votes were not at all surprising,” said João Pedro Pádua, a law professor at the Fluminense Federal University. But he said they were historic. “It is the first time a former head of state will be tried for the crimes of coup d'état and violent abolition of the democratic and legal state.” 



Bolsonaro, a former military officer who was known to express nostalgia for the country's past dictatorship, openly defied Brazil's judicial system during his 2019-2022 term in office.



He has sought to shore up political support before the possible trial, including with a protest in Rio de Janeiro earlier this month. Local media said around 18,000 people attended, based on figures from a monitoring project linked to the University of Sao Paulo.



Bolsonaro's allies had hoped to draw 1 million people. Some analysts have said his ability to mobilize voters is diminishing. He has called for a new demonstration on April 6 in Sao Paulo.



The former president and his allies also will push for Congress to grant amnesty to those in jail for their roles in the Jan. 8, 2023, riot.



Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo, said he didn't expect Wednesday's decision to have much impact on next year's presidential election.



Bolsonaro has already been banned by Brazil's top electoral court from running in elections until 2030 over abuse of power while in office and casting unfounded doubts on the country's electronic voting system.



“Bolsonaro will claim he's a candidate anyway. Why? To avoid being sidelined. He will claim it's him, or someone he appoints. He doesn't want to give up a political asset he has,” Melo said.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — After three days of intense negotiations, the Trump administration, Ukraine and Russia agreed to a limited ceasefire in which the key details, including what was covered and how it will start, were disputed by the warring sides, indicating the road to a complete truce will be long and mired with contention.

The negotiations focused on easing Black Sea shipping and halting long-range strikes on energy infrastructure, relatively low-hanging fruit that both sides had experience in negotiating before the U.S. brokered indirect talks.

While much is yet unknown, here is a breakdown of the key elements of the partial ceasefire and what is at stake in the coming weeks as talks continue.

Conflicting statements emerged immediately after the talks on Tuesday. Both sides differed on the start time of halting strikes on energy sites and accused the other of violating the ceasefire. 

Russia also conditioned its part in opening Black Sea shipping on the U.S. lifting sanctions, which Kyiv dismissed.

Russian officials have greeted the results of the talks with optimism, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described it as a good start, though some Ukrainian officials have expressed discontent.

“Something tells me this is more advantageous for the enemy,” Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak told the Interfax Ukraine news agency.




The U.S. said Tuesday it had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine and Russia to stop fighting and ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea in separate talks with the two sides.

Details of the deal were not released, including how or when it was to be implemented and monitored, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey was halted by Russia one year later, in July 2023.

Russia said the Black Sea deal announced Tuesday could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial institutions involved in food and fertilizer trade were lifted and their access to the SWIFT system of international payments was ensured.

Zelenskyy said Moscow was lying about the terms of the agreement, despite the U.S. later saying it would help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports.

While the benefits to Russia are clear, Ukrainian officials questioned how the Black Sea deal announced Tuesday would profit them. It isn't clear, for instance, if it would also halt attacks on Ukrainian ports.

“Personally, I don't think this will significantly boost our export capacity. Frankly speaking, thanks to Ukrainian naval drones, we have considerably expanded our capabilities in the Black Sea,” Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. 

That's because Ukraine took matters into its own hands after Russia backed out of the grain deal in July 2023. It carved out a trade route requiring ships to sail near the coast lines of Bulgaria and Romania, guided by the Ukrainian Navy. At the same time, Ukrainian forces launched a campaign of sea drone attacks to further push back Russia's fleet. 

The new deal, Zhelezniak said, “unfortunately worsens our position in terms of influence in the Black Sea.” 

The ceasefire also included a halt to long-range strikes on energy infrastructure, but sharp difference emerged immediately after Tuesday's announcement over when the halt to fighting would begin.

Moscow said the ceasefire had started on March 18 and accused Kyiv of violating the terms by striking energy sites inside Russia, a charge that Ukraine's General Staff denied on Wednesday. 

The Kremlin later posted a list of the types of facilities covered by the limited ceasefire. 

It included refineries, oil and gas pipelines, oil storage facilities, including pump stations, power-generating and transmitting infrastructure, as well as power plants, substations, transformers, distribution switchgear, nuclear power plants and hydropower plant dams.

        Bolsonaro, who fought to stay in power after losing the 2022 election, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and claims he is being politically persecuted.
    

Brazil's Supreme Court has accepted charges against former President Jair Bolsonaro over an alleged attempted coup to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat.

The five justices voted unanimously in favour of putting Bolsonaro and seven other allies on trial on five counts, including involvement in an armed criminal organisation and attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law.

The populist Bolsonaro, who swept to power after a shock win at the 2018 election, has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and says he's being politically persecuted.

Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction alone carries a sentence of up to 12 years. When combined with the other charges, it could potentially see Bolsonaro spend decades behind bars.

Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet said those facing charges sought to keep Bolsonaro in power ""at all costs,"" in a scheme that accelerated after the far-right politician lost to current President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the election.

As in his February indictment of Bolsonaro and 33 others, Gonet said part of the plot included a plan to kill Lula and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who were put under surveillance by the alleged conspirators. The plan did not go ahead because at the last minute the accused failed to get the army's commander on board, he explained.

""Frustration overwhelmed the members of the criminal organisation who, however, did not give up on the violent seizure of power, not even after the elected president of the republic was sworn in,"" Gonet said.

That was a reference to the 8 January 2023 riot, when Bolsonaro's supporters stormed and trashed the Supreme Court, presidential palace and Congress in the capital Brasilia a week after Lula took office.

The Supreme Court is looking into whether to accept the charges against eight of the 34 people Gonet accused of participating in the coup plan.

Observers say that it's likely that the charges will be accepted.

As well as Bolsonaro, the court will vote on the accusations faced by his running mate during the 2022 election and former Defence Minister Walter Braga Netto, ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres and his aide-de-camp Mauro Cid, among others.

The court will decide on the fate of the others later.

The Orthodox Union Advocacy Center, the public policy arm of the Orthodox Union, urged the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday to confirm Governor Mike Huckabee as the next US ambassador to Israel, the organization said in a statement.In a letter sent to all senators on the committee, the OU emphasized Huckabee's longstanding support for Israel's security and his recognition of the Jewish people's historical connection to the land of Israel.  While the organization noted it does not typically take positions on nominations, it said it made an exception in this case due to what it described as misrepresentations of Huckabee's views by certain Jewish groups claiming to represent the wider American Jewish community.Huckabee has publicly supported the annexation of the West Bank, a position that has drawn criticism from liberal Jewish groups, as previously reported by The Jerusalem Post. AdvertisementNathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center, addressed what he called misconceptions about Huckabee's views, arguing that they align with the positions of many in the American Jewish community.

""We deeply value the support of the Christian Zionist community, including Governor Huckabee, in standing against antisemitism and defending Israel's right to exist in peace and security,"" Diament added.

Elon Musk sent a strange warning to Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters after she recommended that First Lady Melania Trump should be investigated and potentially deported from the US.

Musk attacked Waters after a clip of her addressing a rally against the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Los Angeles, California, went viral on social media.

Musk reacted to one of the viral videos of Walters on X. “At some point, the many crimes of Maxine Waters will catch up to her,” he stated.

Maxine Waters issues empty threat to Melania TrumpWalter's video, which was shared by Fox News commentator Sean Hannity on Tuesday and “End Wokeness” on X features Waters issuing a message for President Donald Trump, ""If he wants to start looking so closely to find those who were born here and their parents were undocumented, maybe he ought to first look at Melania.” Continuing her tirade against the First Lady, she said that nobody knows if her parents were documented or not, adding that “maybe we better just take a look.” Waters was alluding to the executive order that Trump signed on his first day of office, which outlaws birthright citizenship.

Did you know India and Singapore share many similarities across culture, history and cuisine, creating a sense of connection that resonates with Indian travellers. India and Singapore are both vibrant multicultural societies where diverse communities coexist and celebrate their traditions.

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Renjie Wong, Area Director of India, Middle East and South Asia (Mumbai) - Singapore Tourism Board, shared, “In Singapore, the widespread use of Tamil, Mandarin and Malay mirrors India's rich linguistic diversity, while festivals like Deepavali and Thaipusam are observed with the same enthusiasm in both nations. The Indian Heritage Centre stands as a testament to the deep historical ties between the two, and during festive seasons, Singapore's streets come alive with sarees, lehenga cholis and sherwanis, echoing the celebratory spirit of India. Little India, with its bustling markets, temples and cultural landmarks, further enhances this sense of familiarity for Indian travellers.”

 



Beyond cultural traditions, the historical and economic ties between the two nations run deep. Renjie Wong revealed, “Positioned along ancient maritime trade routes, Singapore was shaped by the same merchant networks that linked India to the Far East. The very name Simha Pura, derived from Sanskrit, and its origins as a Hindu-Buddhist kingdom highlight India's enduring influence on Singapore's identity. However, the most profound connection between the two countries lies in their people. The Indian diaspora has been an integral part of Singapore's story since its founding, and today, this relationship continues to thrive. To spotlight the many facets of Singapore from both local and Indian perspectives, 60 Insiders, a panel of prominent personalities from both countries, has been curated by us to offer expert insights on the destination.”

The food culture in both countries is also rich and diverse, with bold flavours and a shared love for spices. Renjie Wong said, “Indian cuisine has had a significant impact on Singapore's food scene, with popular dishes like Chicken Biryani, Masala Dosa and Roti Prata enjoyed by many. A prime example of how food bridges cultures is the creation of Fish Head Curry, a unique dish developed by Indian migrants in Singapore. Similarly, in India, influences from Southeast Asia, such as Laksa-inspired curries, can be found in the southern regions.”





She added, “Both countries also have a strong street food culture and cater to vegetarian preferences, with local restaurants like Komala Vilas and Ananda Bhavan offering familiar dishes that remind Indian travellers of home. To celebrate this shared legacy of vibrant flavours, later this year, we will be launching a Singapore inspired programming, honouring the rich resonances between India and Singapore through food and design along with Subko – Specialty Coffee Roasters, Bakehouse, and Fine Cacao.”

Insisting that for Indian travellers, Singapore feels like a home away from home, where familiar flavours, languages and traditions create an immediate sense of belonging, Renjie Wong said, “The city's warm hospitality, thriving Indian communities and vibrant festival celebrations, particularly around Serangoon Road, make it an easy and inviting destination. Whether dining at an iconic Indian eatery or shopping at Mustafa Centre and Little India Arcade, Singapore seamlessly blends heritage with modernity, offering an experience that is both exciting and reassuring.”



 

She concluded, “Adding to this deep cultural resonance, HIDDEN GEMS, an upcoming initiative by us with one of India's celebrated artists, will take audiences on a unique musical journey later this year. Set to reveal Singapore's best-kept secrets through an evocative blend of urban sounds and melodies that feel like home, this experience will offer Indian visitors a fresh yet familiar perspective of the city.”

Right-wing commentator Laura Loomer on Wednesday suggested that there could be a possible ‘China link' to the recent Signal chat leak row that is troubling the Trump administration. The 31-year-old brought up principal deputy national security advisor Alex Wong's wife Candice Chiu, whose parents worked in Hong Kong. However, Loomer did not provide any concrete evidence to back her claim.

Laura Loomer's social media post came days after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that top Trump officials mistakenly added him to a Signal group where potential plans for strikes on Houthis were discussed.

Vice President JD Vance and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed Goldberg's claims as a ‘hoax'. National Security adviser Mike Waltz took complete responsibility, admitting that ‘we made a mistake'.

Staunch Trump ally Loomer tweeted about Waltz's deputy Alex Wong's alleged China links.

Wong ‘is married to U.S. Attorney Candice Chiu Wong, a Chinese Woman who was one of the key attorneys involved in PROSECUTING J6ers,' she tweeted.

“I have discovered that Alex's wife, Candice Chiu Wong, worked under the Obama administration and the Biden administration as an Assistant United States Attorney in the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, where she led the Violence Reduction and Trafficking Offenses Section for more than two years,” Loomer added on X, platform formerly known as Twitter.

Chiu's father is a retired senior manager of satellite operations at AsiaSat in Hong Kong. Her mother worked as a dietitian at Grantham Hospital, The New York Times reported back in 2014.

Several social media users noted that Trump's Special Envoy to the Middle East and Ukraine, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow when he was included in the Signal chat group. CBS News cited open-source flight information and Russian media reporting to confirm the same.

The report further noted that Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal. However, Jeffrey Goldberg has not mentioned Witkoff making comments in the group chat. As of now, it is not clear whether the phone used by Witkoff was a government-issued device or a personal one.

South Korea is reeling from one of the most destructive wildfire outbreaks in its history, as wind-driven blazes have scorched the country's southern regions, claiming at least 24 lives, including a helicopter pilot, and forcing more than 27,000 people to evacuate.

The National Fire Agency confirmed on Wednesday that the infernos, which erupted last Friday, have destroyed over 200 structures, including homes, factories, and an ancient Buddhist temple. The fires have consumed approximately 43,330 acres of land, making this one of South Korea's largest wildfires by area burned.

Among the victims was a pilot whose helicopter crashed while battling flames in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas. Authorities confirmed there were no other crew members on board. The death toll also includes four firefighters and government workers who perished in Sancheong after being overtaken by rapidly advancing flames.

At least 26 people have sustained injuries of varying severity, while thousands remain displaced as emergency crews struggle to contain the fires.

The fires have devastated parts of Gounsa, a Buddhist temple originally built in the 7th century. Nearly half of the temple complex's 30 structures were destroyed, including two state-designated ""treasures"":

However, a stone Buddha statue dating back to the 8th century was successfully evacuated and placed in a safe location, according to government and Buddhist officials.

Despite the deployment of 4,650 firefighters, soldiers, and emergency personnel, aided by 130 helicopters, strong overnight winds caused the flames to intensify, forcing crews to temporarily suspend their operations.

In a televised address, South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo acknowledged the unprecedented scale of destruction.

""Damages are snowballing. There are concerns that we'll have wildfire damages that we've never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week,"" Han said.

Firefighting efforts are expected to continue throughout the week, with 5-10 millimeters of rain forecast for Thursday, providing a glimmer of hope for containment.

Officials in several southeastern cities and towns, including Andong, Uiseong, Sancheong, and Ulsan, issued evacuation orders on Tuesday as firefighters struggled to prevent the flames from spreading further.

In Cheongsong, authorities evacuated 500 inmates from a detention center as a precaution, though no damage was reported to the facility.

The Korea Forest Service raised the national wildfire warning to its highest ""serious"" level on Tuesday, requiring local governments to increase emergency personnel and tighten forest entry restrictions. Military units were also advised to suspend live-fire exercises to prevent accidental ignitions.

While the exact causes of the wildfires are still being investigated, authorities suspect human error played a role. Officials believe the fires may have been sparked by negligence during tomb clearing or by welding sparks during maintenance work.

Federal authorities have detained an international student studying at Tufts University near Boston and have revoked their visa, the university said in a statement Tuesday night.

Tufts said the graduate student was taken into US custody from an off-campus apartment building in Somerville, Massachusetts and that it had no further details about the incident or the circumstances surrounding the student's status.

Representatives for the US Department of Homeland Security, US Customs and Border Protection and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be immediately reached for comment on the university's statement.



A lawyer representing the student could also not be immediately reached.

The detention is the latest move by Republican US President Donald Trump's administration targeting international students as it seeks to crack down on immigration, including ramping up immigration arrests and sharply restricting border crossings.

Trump and his top diplomat Marco Rubio in particular have pledged to deport foreign pro-Palestinian protesters, accusing them of supporting Hamas operatives, posing hurdles for US foreign policy and being antisemitic.

At Columbia University, student protester and lawful permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil was arrested this month. He is legally challenging his detention after Trump, without evidence, accused him of supporting Hamas, which Khalil denies.

Federal immigration officials are also seeking to detain a Korean American Columbia University student, who is a legal permanent US resident and has participated in pro-Palestinian protests, a move blocked by the courts for now.

Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor and assistant professor at Brown University in Rhode Island was denied re-entry to the US and deported to Lebanon after Trump's administration alleged her phone contained photos ""sympathetic"" to Hezbollah. Dr. Rasha Alawieh said she does not support the operative group but held regard for its leader, who's now dead, because of her religion.

Trump's administration has also targeted students at Cornell University in New York and Georgetown University in Washington.

Palestinian operator group Hamas warned on Wednesday that hostages may be killed if Israel attempts to retrieve them by force and air strikes continue in the Gaza Strip.

The group said in a statement that it was ""doing everything possible to keep the occupation's captives alive, but the random Zionist (Israeli) bombardment is endangering their lives"".

""Every time the occupation attempts to retrieve its captives by force, it ends up bringing them back in coffins,"" it said.

Israel restarted intense air strikes across the densely populated Gaza Strip last week followed by ground operations, shattering the relative calm afforded by a January ceasefire with Hamas.

Since Israel resumed its military operations in Gaza, at least 830 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.



The war was sparked by the operator group's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.

Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 50,183 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.

President says levies will take effect on 2 April when he is expected to unveil reciprocal tariffs on other imports

Donald Trump announced plans to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on cars from overseas on Wednesday, days before the US president is expected to announce wide-ranging levies on other goods from around the world.

“What we're going to be doing is a 25% tariff for all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said in the Oval Office. “We start off with a 2.5% base, which is what we're at, and go to 25%.”

The tariffs will go into effect next week, on 2 April, the president claimed, and the US will start collecting them the following day. “This is very exciting,” he said, suggesting the move would spur economic growth.

In February, Trump floated the idea of a 25% tariff on imported vehicles but had offered no other details. On Monday, the president hinted that the auto industry levies could come in “the very near future”.

On 2 April – a day Trump has dubbed “liberation day” – the president is expected to unveil a wide range of so-called reciprocal tariffs – levies on imported goods that the Trump administration argues are unfairly taxed by the US's trading partners.

Trump has long argued that the US is being cheated by its trading partners and that tariffs are the best remedy. However, he has delayed or watered down his tariff plans on several occasions. His stance has worried investors, leading to sharp sell-offs in US stock markets, and has proved unpopular with both corporate America and consumers.

Many economists have expressed alarm, too, warning that the president's tariff plan would risk increasing prices across the US. A study by Anderson Economic Group, an automotive consultant, for example, found that blanket tariffs on Canada and Mexico risked increasing US car prices by as much as $12,000.

Mexico, Japan, South Korea, Canada and Germany are among the top car exporters to the US. Will Scharf, a White House official, claimed the new car tariffs would result in more than $100bn in annual revenue to the US.

“Have no fear, we will WIN everything!!!” Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this month, claiming that tariffs were already “pouring money” into the country.

But a Harris poll conducted for the Guardian found that the majority of Americans were already worried about the impact tariffs will have on their finances. Ninety per cent of Democrats, 69% of independents and 57% of Republicans reported they were concerned about tariffs.

Industry groups sounded the alarm on Wednesday. “Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America's auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here,” said Candace Laing, president and CEO of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. “This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Rescue mission off Lost Coast Trail required US Coast Guard, fire department, helicopter team and swimmers

Two hikers were rescued from California's rugged and remote north coast over the weekend after one of them slid more than 100ft (30 metres) down a steep cliff and was clinging to a “near vertical” bluff with hiking poles, authorities said.

The Shelter Cove fire department and a US Coast Guard team responded to a call on Saturday afternoon for a hiker stranded on a cliff near the Lost Coast Trail, which traces more than 50 miles (80km) of the wild and undeveloped coast in far northern California, in the King Range national conservation area. The difficult terrain and conditions required a “highly technical” rescue operation that included a boat, jet ski and several rescue swimmers as well as a helicopter team, the agencies said.

The two hikers were off trail, along a deer or game trail, on Saturday when one of them fell more than 100ft, causing injuries that left him unable to move and preventing rescuers from accessing him by land, according to the Shelter Cove fire department. He was “barely holding on” roughly 60ft above another unstable cliff, the US Coast Guard sector in Humboldt Bay said in a statement.

Because of the rugged terrain and history of rescues in the area, the fire department had requested assistance from the Coast Guard in Humboldt Bay. The Coast Guard team used a 160ft hoist to evacuate the stranded hiker, who was bleeding and had a dislocated shoulder, and transported them to a nearby airport where emergency response workers were waiting. They then returned to the hillside to rescue the uninjured hiker. The rescues “required intense crew coordination due to the loose cliffside, dead trees, and limited power”, the Coast Guard said.

The helicopter had just 15 minutes left of fuel, the Coast Guard statement said, and waited at a nearby airport until a Cal Fire truck brought additional fuel.

The response to the incident required significant resources, the Shelter Cove fire department said. The agency urged would-be Lost Coast hikers to stay on marked trails, and to be prepared for delays. Experts say hikers should not attempt the challenging coastal trail – sections of which are inaccessible during high tide – without experience.

“This rescue required the coordinated efforts of six different agencies, utilizing millions of dollars of specialized equipment and extensive training to ensure a safe and professional outcome,” the fire department said in its statement, praising the 20 rescuers, most of whom are volunteers, for their work.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Tyron McAlpin was attacked by police responding to a report of a white man causing a disturbance in a store

The Phoenix police department has disciplined three officers who violently used a stun gun on and punched a deaf Black man with cerebral palsy last year.

The department's interim police chief, Michael Sullivan, announced that he had issued 24-hour unpaid suspensions to the officers who were involved in the arrest of Tyron McAlpin last August, which was filmed on video. Two of the officers will also be required to attend de-escalation training, Sullivan said.

Sullivan did not name the three police officers, but in the video of McAlpin's arrest the two officers who were seen assaulting him were identified in media reports as Benjamin Harris and Kyle Sue. The third officer has been identified in media reports as Jorge Acosta.

In a statement on Tuesday reported by 12News, Sullivan said: “We understand the concerns raised by this incident, and we take them seriously. The decision to suspend the officers reflects our commitment to accountability and maintaining public trust.”

Last October, McAlpin's attorneys released video footage of his violent arrest which occurred on 19 August outside a Circle K convenience store in Phoenix.

According to a police incident report, officers responded to a call about a fight in the store. ABC15 reports that the 911 caller said a white man was causing a disturbance in the store. The police officers, Harris and Sue, approached the man who claimed that he was assaulted while trying to stop someone from stealing a bike. The man proceeded to point to McAlpin, who was walking nearby, as the aggressor.

Body-camera footage showed the officers approaching McAlpin in a parking lot, where they ordered him to lie on the ground. In the police incident report, Harris wrote: “His hands raised to deliver targeted punches at my face/head, and multiple swings with closed fists at my head.” Harris also claimed that McAlpin had a “fighting stance with his legs planted for stability and force delivery” and that McAlpin “made it clear to me in the moment that he was not simply assaulting me in order to get away but engaging in assaults to cause me harm and injury”.

However, the body-camera footage as well as additional surveillance camera footage showed Harris lunging out of his car first and charging towards McAlpin, who initially had his arms by his side. The body-camera footage proceeds to show one of the officers saying “tase him”, and while McAlpin is pinned to the ground the officers stun him four times. The body-camera footage also showed the officers punching McAlpin at least 10 times on the head and back.

Last November, McAlpin filed a $3.5m notice of claim against the city and the three officers who were involved in his arrest.

In response to the release of McAlpin's footage last year, Andre Miller, vice-president of the Arizona chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said: “This brutal assault was due to the false claims of a white citizen, reminiscent of many falsehoods like Emmett Till that have claimed the lives of black citizens in America … Tyron was not a suspect in an actual crime, he had not done anything wrong, and he also has communication challenges.”

Meanwhile, the president of the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, Darrell Kriplean, condemned the officers' latest suspensions, saying: “We are appalled by the determination made by interim chief Sullivan to suspend the three officers involved in the McAlpin case. A situation that was previously reviewed internally by subject matter experts of the force evaluation and review unit and deemed to be within policy has suddenly been reversed due to public pressure, based on biased media reporting.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

President calls latest tariff announcement ‘beginning of liberation day' as he attempts to impose 25% levy on all cars imported to US

“This is the beginning of liberation day in America,” Donald Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office now for his remarks on new tariffs on cars made outside the United States. At the start of remarks being streamed live on the White House YouTube channel, the president said that tariffs of 25% will be imposed on all imported cars.

The tariffs will apply to finished cars and trucks that are shipped into the United States, including those made by US auto companies whose automobiles that are made overseas.

In response to a reporter's question about the status of a possible deal to keep TikTok open in the United States, Trump said he is likely to extend the deadline for a deal if an agreement over the social media app is not reached and could offer a cut if tariffs to secure Chinese approval of a sale of the company's US arm.

“With respect to TikTok, China is going to have to play a role in that, possibly, in the form of an approval, maybe, and I think they'll do that. Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done”, Trump said.

Asked by a reporter if he has been “briefed about the soldiers in Lithuania, who are missing”, the president replied: “No, I haven't. I haven't”.

Earlier on Wednesday, the US army said in a statement that the “M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle the four missing US soldiers were operating during a training exercise has been located”.

“The vehicle was discovered submerged in a body of water in a training area,” the statement added. “Search efforts for the soldiers continue.”

The soldiers went missing during a military drill during an exercise at a training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10km (6 miles) from the border with Belarus.

Asked by a reporter how he responds to Republican lawmakers who have called on his administration to take more accountability and not downplay the Signal messages that were revealed today, the president said: “I don't know about downplaying, the press up-plays it, I think it's all a witch-hunt, that's all. I think it's a witch-hunt. I wasn't involved with it. I wasn't there”.

A short time later, when another reporter asked if the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who texted detailed attack plans on the nonsecure group chat, should consider resigning, an agitated Trump replied: “Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this. Hegesth? How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it. Look, it's all a witch-hunt … I think Signal could be defective to be honest with you.”

As a giant blow-up of the Signal chat messages displayed in the House on Wednesday shows, Hegseth had a lot to do with it, by texting the precise sequence of planned attacks, and weapons systems deployed, via the messaging app two hours before the strikes in Yemen.

Asked by a reporter if the tariffs could be lifted before the end of his term of office, Trump said that the new 25% rate on foreign-made cars are “permanent, 100%”.

The president just signed an executive order to put 25% tariffs on cars imported into the United States which, he says, will take effect on 2 April.

Asked by a reporter how he will ensure that a car made largely outside the country is not completed in the US to avoid tariffs, Trump claims that there will be “strong policing” to prevent automakers from dodging tariffs.

The president called the current system, in which cars are made in multiple countries, “ridiculous”.

“This is the beginning of liberation day in America,” Donald Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office now for his remarks on new tariffs on cars made outside the United States. At the start of remarks being streamed live on the White House YouTube channel, the president said that tariffs of 25% will be imposed on all imported cars.

The tariffs will apply to finished cars and trucks that are shipped into the United States, including those made by US auto companies whose automobiles that are made overseas.

While fears have been raised about the possibility that Steve Witkoff, the president's envoy to Russia, was vulnerable to hacking because he was in Moscow when he was added to the Signal messaging chat about attacking Yemen (a concern Witkoff dismissed by saying he did not use his personal device on that trip), it has been somewhat overlooked that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who created the group, was in Saudi Arabia on the day he accidentally invited the journalist Jeffrey Goldberg to connect with him on the messaging app.

In his first report on the incident for the Atlantic, Goldberg wrote: “On Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz.”

Since Goldberg did not specify the time of day that the invitation was sent, it is not certain where Waltz was when he sent the request, which was almost certainly sent from his nonsecure, personal phone. (It has been previously reported that the open-source Signal app cannot be downloaded on to secure government devices, although recent statements from the CIA director suggest that might no longer be true.)

But we do know that Waltz spent much or all of that day in the Saudi city of Jeddah, where he and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, engaged in talks with senior Ukrainian officials over a plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine's war to repel the full-scale Russian invasion that began in 2022.

Since Waltz and Rubio spoke to reporters after 9pm local time in Jeddah that night, to announce that Ukraine had accepted the proposal, we know that Waltz was in a Saudi government-secured facility for most of that day, when, presumably, his personal phone would have been vulnerable to hacking by US adversaries, like Russia or China, and even US allies, including Saudi Arabia and Ukraine.

It is not clear when Waltz left Saudi Arabia, but he was certainly there for most, if not all, of 11 March. Waltz and Rubio met with the Saudi crown prince, Mohamed bin Salman, in Jeddah on the evening 10 March, and Rubio's itinerary on the state department's website indicates that the secretary of state did not leave Saudi Arabia until 12 March, when he flew to Ireland and then to Canada.

Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois released a statement calling for defense secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation.

“Pete Hegseth is a f*cking liar. This is so clearly classified info he recklessly leaked that could've gotten our pilots killed. He needs to resign in disgrace immediately,” reads the statement.

“Hegseth and every other official who was included in this group chat must be subject to an independent investigation. If Republicans won't join us in holding the Trump Administration accountable, then they are complicit in this dangerous and likely criminal breach of our national security.”

Secretary of defense Pete Hegseth denied claims that the information he texted other Trump officials in a group chat earlier this month discussed classified war plans.

“Nobody's texting war plans,” he told reporters in Hawaii. “As a matter of fact, they even changed the title to attack plans, because they know it's not war plans,” he said.

Canada's former spy chief says White House response to Signal leak threatens ‘Five Eyes' security

Canada's former spy chief has said the Trump administration's attempts to downplay the leak of top-secret attack plans is a “very worrying” development, with implications for broader intelligence sharing among US allies.

On Wednesday, the Atlantic magazine published new and detailed messages from a group chat, including plans for US bombings, drone launches and targeting information of the assault, including descriptions of weather conditions. Among the recipients of the messages was a prominent journalist, who was inadvertently added to the group.

“This is very worrying. Canada needs to think about what this means in practical terms: is the United States prepared to protect our secrets, as we are bound to protect theirs?” said Richard Fadden, the former head of Canada's intelligence agency. “Every country has experienced leaks, of varying severity. The problem with this one is that it's being generated at the highest levels of the US government – and they haven't admitted that it's a problem.”

Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand have for decades shared intelligence in a pact informally known as the Five Eyes. But the leak of classified information is likely to put further strain on the group as it weighs how seriously the current American administration takes the handling of top secret information.

“When we have intelligence leaks, we admit it, we try to sort out what's happened and we try to fix it. One doesn't get the impression today that the US cabinet members will admit there's a problem,” said Fadden, who also served as national security adviser to Canada's Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper. “They're just trying to clean it up from a political perspective. That worries me.”

Despite a far more detailed picture of the information leaked to journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, the White House and key figures in the message thread have redoubled efforts to claimed none of the information was classified.

Israeli PM warns of seizure of territories and ‘other measures' if Hamas refuses to release remaining hostages

Benjamin Netanyahu has repeated Israeli threats to seize territory in Gaza if Hamas refuses to release the remaining Israeli hostages, as, for the second consecutive day, hundreds of Palestinians joined protests against the militant group and demanding the end of the war.

The Israeli prime minister's warning came a week after Israel resumed its military operation in the territory, shattering the relative calm of a January ceasefire with Hamas.

“The more Hamas continues in its refusal to release our hostages, the more powerful the repression we exert will be,” Netanyahu told a hearing in parliament, which was occasionally interrupted by shouting from opposition members.

He added: “I say this to my colleagues in the Knesset, and I say it to Hamas as well: this includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here.”

Hamas warned on Wednesday that hostages may be killed if Israel attempts to use its military to retrieve them. “Every time the occupation attempts to retrieve its captives by force, it ends up bringing them back in coffins,” the group said in a statement.

Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 that the Israeli military says are dead.

For the second consecutive day, hundreds of Palestinians have joined protests in northern Gaza, shouting anti-Hamas slogans and calling for an end to the war with Israel, in a rare display of public anger against the militant group.

On Tuesday, videos and photographs shared on social media, which appeared to be authentic, showed hundreds of people, mostly men, chanting: “Hamas out” and: “Hamas terrorists” in Beit Lahiya.

Some protesters were seen carrying banners emblazoned with slogans including: “Stop the war” and: “We want to live in peace”. At least one appeal to join the protest was circulating on the social media network Telegram.

“I don't know who organised the protest,” one man told Agence France-Press. “I took part to send a message on behalf of the people: enough with the war.” He said he had seen “members of the Hamas security forces in civilian clothing breaking up the protest”.

A statement released by family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's offensive and its tightened blockade. They also said the community fully supported armed resistance against Israel and rejected “any attempt to exploit legitimate popular demands by a fifth column”, apparently referring to opponents of Hamas.

In a separate development on Wednesday, at least nine Palestinians were killed by two separate Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza, medics said.

One strike hit a group of Palestinians gathered outside a charity providing hot meals in the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least five people, including a woman and her adult daughter, were killed by the strike, according to the al-Awda hospital, which received the casualties.

The resumption of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip had displaced 142,000 people in seven days, the UN said on Wednesday, warning of dwindling stocks of humanitarian aid.

“In just one week, 142,000 people have been displaced,” the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said, adding that about 90% of Gaza's population had been displaced at least once between the start of the war on 7 October 2023 and January of this year.

There has been no sign that Israel will open entry points to allow essential aid to flow or ease its new offensive.

The Gaza health ministry said more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 wounded since the beginning of the war.

Senior officials warn nations including China, Pakistan and Iran could attempt to subvert vote with sophisticated tools

The spectre of interference by India has already rocked the early days of Canada's federal election, with officials warning that sophisticated efforts from other hostile nations are expected in the coming weeks.

As Canadians prepare to cast ballots on 28 April, senior officials say that India, China, Pakistan and Iran are all expected to make efforts to subvert the national vote through increasingly sophisticated disinformation campaigns.

The use of artificial-intelligence tools is likely to figure prominently in efforts to deceive voters and sway diaspora communities. Earlier this year, a landmark inquiry into foreign interference found that information manipulation is the biggest risk to democratic institutions.

“Most threat actors remain likely to conduct threat activities and have likely adapted their tradecraft to further conceal their foreign-interference activity, making it even more challenging to detect,” Vanessa Lloyd, deputy director of operations for Canada's spy agency and chair of the security and intelligence threats to elections taskforce, told reporters earlier this week as the agency laid out its plan to blunt the effects of interference campaigns.

Between late January and early February, China is believed to have targeted the Liberal leadership bid of the former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, in a “malicious” campaign on WeChat that was viewed as many as 3m times, the security and intelligence threats to elections taskforce said in a news release.

On Wednesday, the Globe and Mail reported that former Liberal leadership hopeful Chandra Arya had been disqualified amid concerns over his relationship with India and concerns he could be susceptible to outside influence.

Arya, elected to the House of Commons in 2015, was told he was barred from formally entering the Liberal leadership race in later January. Earlier this month, he was also told he was ineligible to run again in his electoral district. In both cases, the Liberal party did not provide further details.

According to a security source who spoke to the Globe, while Canada was grappling with the fallout of India's assassination of a Sikh activist on Canadian soil, Arya travelled to India in August and met the prime minister, Narendra Modi. Arya is not believed to have not informed the government of his meetings.

“As a member of parliament, I have engaged with numerous diplomats and heads of government, both in Canada and internationally. Not once have I sought – nor been required to seek – permission from the government to do so,” he said in a statement. “The sole point of contention with the Liberal party has been my outspoken advocacy on issues important to Hindu Canadians and my firm stance against Khalistani extremism.”

The Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, who doesn't have a seat in the House of Commons, announced late last week he would contest the electoral district of Nepean, previously held by Arya.

Carney was asked on Wednesday whether foreign-interference concerns had prevented the party from nominating a full slate of candidates for the current federal election. He told reporters hostile actors were not to blame for the party's delay in nominating candidates.

But accusations of outside influence have also shaken the opposition Conservative campaign, following allegations that India interfered in the 2022 leadership race, with the aim of helping the winner, Pierre Poilievre.

The allegations, first reported by the Globe and Mail, suggest the Tory leader's win was not attributable to outside influence and Poilievre is not believed to have been aware of India's efforts.

“Let's be honest, I won the leadership fair and square,” he told reporters.

But Canada's spy agency could not share the information with Poilievre because he does not have the necessary security clearance. Poilievre is the only federal party leader who has declined an offer to obtain a security clearance – a position that has received widespread criticism and incredulity.

“It's very weird, because I can't imagine, from a political perspective, why it's worth it. I have top-secret clearance, it's not that hard,” said Lori Turnbull, the director of Dalhousie University's school of public administration. “It's very hard for me to get my mind around why a leader who wants to be prime minister would not go ahead and do this. To give your rival something like that, for free, is stupid when you're fighting a close election.”

While intelligence officials have long anticipated and experienced efforts from hostile nations like India and China to sway a federal election, less predictable is the role Donald Trump might play. The US president has launched a trade war with Canada, and threatened to annex the country.

Trump has a reputation for sharing false information and his close ally and senior adviser Elon Musk, the owner of the social media network X, has been implicated in the amplification of misinformation.

Canada's chief electoral officer, Stéphane Perrault, has said his office was not aware of any specific threats coming from the US.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Universities UK says ruling raises concerns about how to prevent harassment and hate speech on campus

A landmark freedom of speech ruling against the University of Sussex that resulted in a fine in excess of half a million pounds has prompted fears other institutions could face investigation and even bigger penalties.

The record £585,000 fine, the biggest ever from the higher education regulator in England, was issued after an investigation into the university's handling of the case of the philosophy professor Kathleen Stock, who resigned after protesters targeted her over her views on gender identification and transgender rights.

In a ruling that prompted a furious reaction from Sussex, which is planning a legal challenge, the Office for Students (OfS) found the university had failed to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, breaching two conditions of registration.

The resulting fine, described as “wholly disproportionate” by the university, was lower than it might have been, having been reduced since it was the first of its kind. Without mitigating factors the OfS said it could have been as high as £3.7m, at a time when the sector is struggling owing to financial pressures.

The OfS's main criticism was targeted at Sussex's policy on trans and non-binary equality, which included a requirement to “positively represent trans people”. The regulator warned of a “a chilling effect” that could lead staff and students to self-censor and avoid voicing opposing views, for fear of disciplinary measures.

Amid concerns that every university in the country will have policies designed to prevent harassment and hate speech on campus, Universities UK (UUK), which represents the sector, is seeking urgent clarification from the OfS in order to be able to advise members.

“It's absolutely essential that universities uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, and they are legally bound to do so,” said Vivienne Stern, UUK's chief executive.

“This judgment, however, raises concerns about how universities can, in practice, discharge freedom of speech and academic freedom duties alongside other important legal obligations, for example under legislation to prevent harassment and hate speech.

“We will therefore be writing to the OfS to ask for clarity as the judgment appears to find that it is a ‘failure to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom' if a university has policies to prevent ‘abusive, bullying and harassing' material or speech.”

In a briefing with the media after the publication of the investigation findings, Arif Ahmed, the director for freedom of speech and academic freedom at the OfS, acknowledged there was a potential for higher fines in future cases.

“Clearly, future cases will not be the first case of their kind, so there will be a potential for higher fines in the future,” he said, adding: “I think universities should be looking at their policies and thinking carefully about what they need to do to comply with the law and to comply with regulatory requirements.”

Ahmed was forced to defend the investigation and its findings against ferocious criticism from Sussex's vice-chancellor, Prof Sasha Roseneil, who said they were “egregious and concocted” and claimed no one at the university had been interviewed during the course of the three-and-a-half-year investigation.

Describing the process as “Kafkaesque”, she accused the OfS of “perpetuating the culture wars” and said the findings meant it was now all but impossible for universities to prevent abuse, harassment or bullying on campuses.

Ahmed responded: “I've been really clear since my appointment, we've got no interest in getting involved in any kind of culture wars. Our interest is simply protecting freedom of speech.”

He acknowledged that much of the engagement with Sussex was in writing, although the OfS did interview Stock. “But we did engage with the university. We looked at the university's representations to us and considered [them] very carefully, and we took our time over this because we wanted to make sure that we got it right.”

Stock welcomed the OfS ruling, saying: “I'm very pleased to see the OfS finding and I hope it sends a strong message to the many universities that still have policies with the very clauses the OfS has ruled against. There is no doubt in my mind that these policies chill lawful speech.”

The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “If you go to university you must be prepared to have your views challenged, hear contrary opinions and be exposed to uncomfortable truths. We are giving the OfS stronger powers on freedom of speech so students and academics are not muzzled by the chilling effect demonstrated in this case.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Critics say industry threatens the endangered Maugean skate and laws were rushed through with 'no proper process'

Controversial legislation to protect the Tasmanian salmon industry has passed parliament after the government guillotined debate to bring on a vote in the Senate on Wednesday night.

Government and Coalition senators voted in favour of the bill, which was designed to bring an end to a formal reconsideration by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, into whether an expansion of fish farming in Macquarie Harbour in 2012 was properly approved.

It followed a fiery debate on Wednesday, during which the Greens' environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, waved a dead salmon in the Senate after asking if the government had sold out its environmental credentials for “rotten, stinking extinction salmon” on the eve of an election.

Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio also weighed in, telling his 60.4 million Instagram followers that the Australian government should take urgent action to “shut down destructive industrial non-native salmon farms” and save the endangered Maugean skate, an endemic species found only in the harbour, from extinction.

The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, had promised the government would legislate to ensure there were “appropriate environmental laws” to “continue sustainable salmon farming” in the harbour and protect local jobs.

Hanson-Young told the Senate that government has rushed through the bill in budget week with “no proper process, no proper scrutiny”.

She said there had been no time for officials to detail the potential consequences of the legislation, which lawyers have suggested could extend beyond the salmon industry and stop communities challenging other decisions, including coal and gas developments.

“This is a stitch up between the Labor government and Peter Dutton's Liberal party… to gut Australia's environment laws to facilitate the continuation and expansion of an industry that is polluting the Macquarie Harbour and that is pushing the Maugean skate, our wildlife, to the brink of extinction,” Hanson-Young said.

Despite supporting the bill, the opposition's environment spokesperson, Jonno Duniam, criticised the process as an “11th-hour fix to get this off the political agenda”. “This government has stuffed it royally,” he said.

Labor MPs consider the legislation important in the party's bid to win the seat of Braddon, in north-west Tasmania, at the upcoming election. Senator Anne Urquhart, who is attempting top move to the lower house by running in Braddon, told the Senate the debate was in part about “good, well-paid jobs in Tasmania, which I've spent my working life standing up for”.

The reconsideration of the Macquarie Harbour decision was triggered by a legal request in 2023 from three environment groups after concern about the impact of salmon farming on the skate. It prompted Plibersek to announce a review into a 2012 decision that deemed the farming was not a controlled action – meaning it did not need a full federal environmental assessment.

An environment department opinion released under freedom of information laws suggested the review could lead to salmon farming having to stop in the harbour while an environmental impact statement was prepared.

The new legislation is designed to prevent this by stopping reconsideration requests in cases in which developments had been deemed “not a controlled action” and the minister had specified that the development required state or territory oversight. It would apply when the development was already under way and had been ongoing or recurring for at least five years.

The government said the bill was “a very specific amendment” to address a flaw in national environment legislation and that “existing laws apply to everything else, including all new proposals for coal, gas, and land clearing”.

The Australia Institute's Eloise Carr said preliminary legal advice suggested the changes could stop people from requesting reviews of other developments.

David Barnden, the principal lawyer at Sydney firm Equity Generation Lawyers, said the bill was “so poorly drafted” that it risked not even applying to the salmon industry in Macquarie Harbour. “Legal challenges are almost guaranteed,” he said.

The Maugean skate has been listed as endangered since 2004. Concern about its plight escalated last year when a government scientific committee said numbers in the wild were “extremely low” and fish farming in the harbour was the main cause of a substantial reduction in dissolved oxygen levels – the main threat to the skate's survival. The committee said salmon farms in the harbour should be scaled back and recommended the species be considered critically endangered.

A separate report by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies last month said surveys suggested the skate population was likely to have recovered to 2014 levels after crashing last decade. It stressed the need for continued monitoring.

The government announced $3m in the budget to expand a Maugean skate captive breeding program. It said earlier this week it remained committed to improving the national law and creating a national Environment Protection Agency despite shelving those commitments and would consult on specifics in a second term.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Leo Brent Bozell III, founder of a conservative media group, is president's nomination amid rising diplomatic tensions

Donald Trump has nominated a conservative, pro-Israel media activist as US ambassador to South Africa, at a time when the relationship between the two countries is at a nadir.

Leo Brent Bozell III founded the Media Research Center – whose website states it is “a blog site designed to broadcast conservative values, culture, and politics [and] to expose liberal media bias” – in 1987.

His son Leo Brent Bozell IV was sentenced to 45 months in prison in May 2024 for assaulting police and smashing windows in the 6 January 2021 Capitol riots. He was released in January as part of Trump's mass pardon.

The 69-year-old's nomination, which needs to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, comes after South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled earlier this month, and amid US claims that South Africa is discriminating against its white minority.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, had called Rasool “a race-baiting politician who hates America” after Rasool told a thinktank that Trump's Maga movement was partly a response to “a supremacist instinct”.

In February, Trump signed an executive order cutting aid to South Africa, accusing it of racial discrimination against white Afrikaners, who ruled the country during apartheid. The order also offered them refugee resettlement.

South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, told reporters on Tuesday he would appoint a “top-class” replacement for Rasool. He added that US funding cuts were “entirely within their own right … and in many ways a wake-up call … [to be] more self-reliant.”

The US-South Africa relationship had worsened under the previous US president, Joe Biden, after South Africa refused to take sides when Russia invaded Ukraine. In 2023, the then US ambassador, Reuben Brigety, accused South Africa of supplying Russia with arms.

Things soured further when South Africa brought a case accusing Israel, a US ally, of genocide in Gaza at the international court of justice. The UN court ordered Israel to take measures to prevent potential acts of genocide. Israel, which reacted furiously to the allegations, has until July to answer South Africa's case.

However, Trump's overturning of norms and spreading of misinformation about South Africa has catapulted the relationship into new territory.

“There is just an absolute disagreement on the way in which Ramaphosa and Trump see the world,” said Ziyanda Stuurman, an independent political risk analyst.

Trump's executive order criticised South Africa for its case against Israel.

It also claimed that a law signed in January allowing land to be expropriated with “nil compensation” in limited circumstances enabled South Africa to “seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property”. The South African government has said that the US has similar laws allowing the government to take over land for public purposes.

Conservative Afrikaner groups that have the ear of Trump allies have promoted conspiracy theories of a “white genocide” in South Africa.

Meanwhile, land and wealth remain concentrated among white South Africans, who make up 7% of the population (about half Afrikaans), while black people represent 81%.

“How do you respond when it seems like the main motivation for the breakdown of the relationship is based on a complete and utter untruth, ie that whites are being treated badly,” said Melanie Verwoerd, a former ambassador to Ireland and MP for the African National Congress, the former liberation movement that has led all South African governments since the end of white minority rule.

South Africa's history of successful negotiations to end apartheid, in which Ramaphosa led the ANC delegation, were cause for hope in improving relations, though, she said.

Some analysts suggest South Africa could build bridges through Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire who is leading Trump's bid to slash the size of the US government. Musk has been increasingly critical of South Africa, with Trump echoing some of his statements.

Musk, who wants to expand his satellite internet business Starlink globally, has repeatedly railed against a requirement that telecoms investors cede 30% of equity in their South African subsidiary to black owners.

On Monday, Musk posted on X: “The legacy media never mentions white genocide in South Africa.”

Last week, he criticised the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party for singing the controversial Kill the Boers song at political rallies. A South African court ruled in 2022 that the song was not meant to be taken literally.

Dropping the equity condition could be part of a “pragmatic” deal that doesn't compromise sovereignty, said Ronak Gopaldas, a director at risk consultancy Signal Risk: “I would focus on the commercial rather than the moral aspects.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

With a plummeting birth rate and a rapidly aging population, China faces a demographic crisis. The city of Tianmen is an outlier — at least temporarily.

TIANMEN, China — There is a lot riding on the shoulders of toddlers being wheeled around the lakeside parks and fluorescent-lit shopping malls of this city in the plains of central China.

Tianmen, population 1 million, is being held up as proof that this country of 1.4 billion — and falling — can spend its way out of a looming demographic crisis. The city's birth rate suddenly grew by 17 percent last year, the first rise in eight years and well above a national increase of 5.8 percent.

State media has praised Tianmen's turnaround and noted its generous subsidies, among the highest in the country, for couples who have second or third children: Parents can in theory receive up to $39,616 for a second child and $49,107 for a third — though most get far less.

“Tianmen's policy is great. It has solved my housing problem because I have many children,” said Xie Fei, who gave birth to her third child in her hometown of Tianmen in September, even though she lives and works in Wuhan, a two-hour drive away.

The 37-year-old, who works at a state-owned chemical engineering firm, will receive a total of $5,600 before her son turns 3. She has already used a $25,000 housing coupon to cover more than one-third of the cost of a Tianmen apartment.

More than 100 officials from across the country have visited Tianmen in recent months to learn its “fertility secret,” state-run Xinhua News Agency said this month, as the Chinese leadership tries to replicate its success nationwide and reverse a stubbornly shrinking population.

China's fertility rate has been less than half of the replacement rate of 2.1 for three years, despite the government having now spent a decade trying to persuade people to have more babies.

The government ended its one-child policy in 2016, but instead of spurring a baby boom, there was a slump in births at a pace rarely seen in peacetime. For Beijing, an irreversible decline could grow into an economic disaster.

Many young people, weary from the rat race at work and concerned about the soaring costs of raising children, prefer to have only one child — if they want any at all.

Boosting fertility was a top priority at China's big political meetings in Beijing this month. The government noted — for the first time — the need for “child-rearing subsidies,” among various efforts to hit an ambitious economic growth target of “around 5 percent.”

It also announced a gradual shift toward free preschool education, expanded state health-care coverage for childbirth and improved pediatric services — many of which Tianmen introduced in 2023.

According to state media, Tianmen's formula for motivating young couples to reproduce is simple: subsidies, subsidies, subsidies — and a heavy dose of birth-positive propaganda from local officials.

The support starts with coverage for prenatal tests. A one-time payout of $275 for a second child or $314 for a third child follows at birth, then monthly payments of $110 or $137 until the child is 3. Some get additional support for maternity leave.

Perhaps most significantly, the policy includes generous housing coupons. The parents of a third child can claim $16,500 off a new home — a substantial amount in Tianmen's struggling property market.

It's unclear how Tianmen, which was $1.9 billion in debt as of 2023, can afford such a high level of expenditure.

Despite its apparent success, the Tianmen city government declined multiple requests to speak with The Washington Post about its policies to encourage childbirth.

Kids really are everywhere on Tianmen's streets. But their parents — and demographers — doubt the recent uptick will continue.

Many residents said Tianmen happened to introduce the policy as a wave of young couples moved back to the city. After the coronavirus pandemic forced migrant workers to return home from east coast factory towns, many stayed to work in a local textile industry that has thrived in the age of online shopping.

Almost every new parent whom The Post spoke to during a visit this month said they planned to have a second or third child regardless of subsidies. State support, while welcomed, was not the deciding factor.

“I chose to have a second child because I grew up in a house with two kids and thought it was great,” said a 29-year-old woman with the surname Dong, who only found out about the subsidies after becoming pregnant.

“Those who want to have children will not care about the subsidies and will naturally have children anyway,” she added, speaking on the condition that her full name not be used to avoid reprisals from officials.

The city's impressive performance was also helped by expectant mothers from Tianmen, like Xie, who were living in other cities and came back to take advantage of low-cost health care and steep discounts on housing. Three parents who spoke to The Post returned only temporarily to give birth.

If the 2024 rise turns out to be short-lived, that would be bad news for Tianmen — the city plans to renovate 30 kindergartens and open 100 after-school programs this year.

Tianmen's ability to quickly boost fertility shows the importance of comprehensive support for families, but it may be difficult to sustain or replicate elsewhere, said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, who focuses on China's demography.

As a relatively small city where living costs and work pressures are low — the average monthly disposable income was $440 in 2023 — Tianmen has the budget to afford large payouts relative to local salaries.

That makes the city a potential outlier. Elsewhere in China, the governments of poorer regions may struggle to afford subsidies, while big cities are too expensive and full of stressed young people more concerned with finding a job than starting a family.

In places such as Shanghai, “the labor market is very competitive for the younger generation, so these financial incentives won't easily change their minds,” Peng said.

China became the world's second-largest economy partly because young people worked hard to achieve a better life.

Now, as the economy loses momentum, the Chinese Communist Party is increasingly concerned that the dwindling labor force will soon struggle to support the rapidly aging population. It will need many more Tianmens to avoid a demographic crisis.

The introduction of “baby bonuses” often creates a moderate and immediate increase, said Shuang Chen, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. But this is usually because people have children earlier — or, in Tianmen's case, back in their hometown — not because they decide to have more children.

“You're simply encouraging the same group of people who were going to have children anyway to have them now,” Chen said. “That's why these effects are very temporary.”

China's demographic woes are worsened by the lingering traumas of the one-child policy, which resulted in local officials forcing women to have abortions and undergo compulsory sterilization surgery. It also left behind a generation of young women determined to make their own choices about having children, free from state interference.

But the Chinese Communist Party has once again turned to its army of neighborhood officials and volunteers who enforced the one-child policy to encourage births.

For Yin Li, an official in charge of family planning in one Tianmen neighborhood, that means making daily phone calls and home visits to try to persuade couples to keep reproducing.

“It will be hard to match last year,” she said, adding that the number of births in her neighborhood “is already starting to decline.”

The 47-year-old mother of two (unsubsidized) children is concerned that too few young couples want to get married or have children. Out of 11 newlyweds on her list, only three intend to have kids. “The rest tell me they have no plans to have children,” she said.

Democrat James Malone is projected to win a special election for Pennsylvania's 36th state Senate district on Tuesday night, narrowly triumphing in a district President Donald Trump won by 15 percentage points in November. 

Malone's victory over Republican Josh Parsons is a significant upset, and an encouraging sign Democrats' coalition of highly engaged, highly educated voters continues to give them an advantage in low-turnout but crucial special elections. It's also an early but small sign of growing voter anger with Republicans.

Before the election, Malone told local media that voters in the county were frustrated with the role billionaire Elon Musk has played in the Trump administration. 

“Josh Parsons might be OK with that, but I'm not,” Malone told Lancaster Online. “On Tuesday, you'll get to make the choice between more Musk, or Lancaster values.”

Malone led Parsons 50% to 49%, a lead of less than 500 votes, according to results posted by the Pennsylvania Secretary of State. The district includes most of Lancaster County, a rural county in the south central part of the state best known for its Amish population.

Malone is the mayor of East Petersburg, a small borough in Lancaster County. Parsons is a Lancaster County commissioner. The two were running to fill a seat vacated by Republican Sen. Ryan Aument, who took a job working for freshman U.S. Sen. Dave McMormick. 

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), who recorded a robocall encouraging Democrats to vote for Malone, celebrated the victory on social media.

“Tonight in Lancaster County, Pennsylvanians rejected a candidate who embraced the extremism and division coming out of DC,” Shapiro wrote. “In a district carried comfortably by Donald Trump just a few months ago, they chose a better way forward — an embrace of competence, commonsense, and a desire to bring people together.”

Malone's victory shrinks the GOP advantage in the state Senate to 27-23. In a separate election outside Pittsburgh, the Democratic candidate ran well ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris' margins in a Democratic seat to maintain the party's narrow 102-101 advantage in Pennsylvania's state House. 

Democrats similarly flipped a heavily Republican state Senate seat in Iowa in January. Some Democratic operatives were looking at Malone's victory as a sign the party could be competitive in a tentatively scheduled congressional special election in upstate New York this summer.","{'href': 'https://news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News'}"

The fallout continues over a security breach in which high-ranking members of the Trump administration accidentally shared plans about a forthcoming U.S. military attack on Yemen with the top editor of the Atlantic magazine on the Signal messaging app.

Military and intelligence experts, along with some members of Congress, have expressed shock over the inadvertent leak, leading to questions about national security protocols and the use of unsecured channels for sensitive information.

President Trump and U.S. intelligence officials have tried to downplay the security risks, and insist no classified material was shared.

The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed in an article published on Monday that he knew about U.S. airstrikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen hours before they happened, because he was added to a Signal group chat where members of the Trump administration appeared to be discussing such war plans.

Goldberg said he received a Signal connection request on March 11 from someone whom he believed to be Michael Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser. Two days later, Goldberg said he was added to a conversation with 18 members of the administration — including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard — where they talked about plans to bomb Yemen.

U.S. air and naval assets hit multiple Houthi targets in Yemen on March 15.

Goldberg said that he initially did not believe the Signal group chat was real. “I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,” he wrote. ""I have never seen a breach quite like this.

“It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal,” Goldberg added. “But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters — not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I've never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.""

Related from Yahoo News: What is Signal, anyway?

White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that the message thread described by Goldberg “appears to be authentic” and that security council officials were “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

Trump first told reporters on Monday that he knew nothing about the incident. Then, in a phone interview with NBC News, the president said he stood by Waltz.

“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" Trump said. The president suggested that a member of Waltz's staff accidentally added Goldberg to the group.

Speaking to reporters at the White House Tuesday, Trump disparaged Goldberg and the Atlantic, calling the editor a “total sleazebag” and the 167-year-old publication a “failed magazine.”

On Wednesday, White House reporters asked Trump which members of his administration bore responsibility for the chat.

“It was Mike, I guess, I don't know,” Trump responded.

When pressed on Hegseth's role in the scandal, the president did not seem fully briefed on the fact that his defense secretary had shared sensitive information on Signal.

“How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,” Trump said.

In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday night, Waltz said he takes “full responsibility"" for the “embarrassing” security breach, and that he built the group chat himself.

“I take full responsibility. … I built the group,” Waltz said. “My job is to make sure everything's coordinated.”

But Waltz also said he doesn't know how Goldberg was added to the chat.

""I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy,"" Waltz said, adding that he had spoken to Elon Musk for help in finding out what happened.

Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe were grilled by Democrats over the breach, which they both sought to downplay

During a House Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday, Gabbard acknowledged the inclusion of a Goldberg on the Signal chat was a “mistake,” but said no classified information was shared.

Speaking to reporters in Hawaii on Monday, Hegseth flatly denied sharing any sensitive military information.

“Nobody was texting war plans,” Hegseth said. “And that's all I have to say about that.”

He reiterated those comments on Tuesday.

“Nobody's texting war plans,” Hegseth said. “I know exactly what I'm doing.”

During a news conference in Kingston, Jamaica, on Wednesday, Rubio said he hoped ""there'll be reforms and changes made so this never — it's not going to happen again. It can't.""

“Obviously, someone made a mistake. Someone made a big mistake and added a journalist. Nothing against journalists, but you ain't supposed to be on that thing,” Rubio added.

In the article published Monday, Goldberg did not reveal details of the strike plans, saying the information “could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.”

But on Wednesday, the Atlantic published the full text thread from the Signal group under the headline: “Here Are the Attack Plans That Trump's Advisers Shared on Signal.”

“The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump — combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts — have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions,” Goldberg and colleague Shane Harris explained.

The messages include specific details on the timing of launches by U.S. military jets that were to strike Houthi targets.

The Atlantic said that the thread it published was the entire text chain except for the name of a CIA officer that it withheld at the agency's request.

Current, former intelligence officials and Democratic lawmakers have expressed shock over the breach, wondering how members of the Trump administration would be discussing security plans on Signal in the first place.

""This Signal chat situation sheds light on a sloppy and grossly incompetent national security strategy from the Trump administration,"" said Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.

“Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that they'd be this reckless and careless with our national security,” Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who was deputy to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Biden administration, told NPR.

Price said he had spoken to former national security officials and colleagues involved in military planning, adding, “It's fair to say ... that heads are exploding.”

While most Republicans have avoided criticizing the administration over the breach, a few have spoken out.

Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday that the panel is calling for an independent investigation into the leak.

“Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels — and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican from New York, wrote on X. “Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.”

Scientists have discovered a new species of dinosaur in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. Called Duonychus tsogtbaatari, the dinosaur has 2-foot-long clawed fingers on each hand, one fewer than its fellow Therizinosauria.

Duonychus, which means “two claws” in Greek, stood about 10 feet tall and weighed roughly 570 pounds and belonged to the group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which were characterized by an odd set of traits: huge claws believed to have been used to shear leaves off trees, leaf-shaped teeth, backward-facing hip bones and a long neck ending in a small head, and it was covered in down and quill-like feathers.

“It kind of blew my mind,” the lead author of a study published Tuesday in the journal iScience, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, an associate professor at the Hokkaido University Museum, told NBC News. “I felt this rush of excitement, like, ‘Wait… am I actually looking at something completely new here?'”

Therizinosaurs were already the “weirdest dinosaurs out there,” Kobayashi said. “Duonychus takes that weirdness and pushes it further. It's like evolution said, ‘Let's try something different,' and just ran with it.”

Therizinosaurs lived in Asia and North America during the Cretaceous Period, 145 million to 66 million years ago.

Despite having only two claws, Duonychus was an “effective grasper” that could reach branches or swaths of vegetation up to nearly 5 inches in diameter.

“Dinosaurs weren't just stuck in one body plan — they were constantly experimenting, evolving, doing weird stuff,” Kobayashi added, calling them “total oddballs.”

A study co-author, Darla Zelenitsky, an associate professor at the University of Calgary in Canada, described Duonychus' claws as “sharp and huge,” about 1 foot long.

Duonychus would have used their claws to grasp and pull vegetation to the mouth during feeding, Zelenitsky said in an email Wednesday, adding that claws could also have had other functions, like self-defense or grappling.

Though Therizinosaurs were part of the theropod group, which included meat-eaters like Tyrannosaurus and Spinosaurus, Duonychus mainly ate leaves from large shrubs and trees.

The specimen was excavated in 2012 by researchers from the Mongolian Academy of Sciences' Institute of Paleontology from the Gobi Desert's Bayanshiree Formation, which dates back 90 million years and is known for its exceptional diversity of Therizinosaurs.

The fossil was a partial skeleton without a skull and legs, but the hands were “exceptionally preserved,” according to the study. The Duonychus individual was not fully mature.

It's a “great new discovery, and the two claws is interesting,” said Michael Benton, professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bristol in the U.K., who was not involved in the study.

Dinosaurs used to have five fingers, just like human beings, but they quickly lost two over time, with most dinosaurs having three fingers, Benton said Wednesday.

“So, to go down to two was unusual,” he said.

The number of digits doesn't matter when it comes to hooking and pulling, Benton said, adding that the third finger may have been an “encumbrance” due to its short length.

Fossil records of Therizinosauria are “notably abundant” in Cretaceous deposits across eastern Asia, particularly in Mongolia and China, according to the study.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) called the Mongolian Gobi Desert the world's “largest dinosaur fossil reservoir.”

Donald Trump has said he is placing 25% tariffs on motor imports, a move the White House claims will foster domestic manufacturing but could also put a financial squeeze on car makers that depend on global supply chains.

“This will continue to spur growth,” the president told reporters. “We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff.”

The tariffs could be complicated as even US car makers source their components from around the world, meaning that they could face higher costs and lower sales. Shares in General Motors fell by about 3% in Wednesday afternoon trading. Ford's stock was up slightly, but shares in Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, dropped nearly 4%.

Mr Trump has long said that tariffs against car imports would be a defining policy of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would cause more production to relocate to the US.

But American and foreign firms with domestic plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles, meaning prices could increase and sales could decline as new factories take time to build.

“We are going to be doing automobiles, which you've known about for a long time,” Mr Trump said on Monday. “We'll be announcing that fairly soon, over the next few days probably.”

The tariffs are part of a broader reshaping of global relations by Mr Trump, who plans to impose what he calls “reciprocal” taxes on April 2 that would match the tariffs and sales taxes charged by other nations.

He has already placed a 20% tax on all imports from China for its role in the production of fentanyl. He similarly placed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10% tax on Canadian energy products.

Parts of the Mexico and Canada tariffs have been suspended, including taxes on cars, after firms objected and Mr Trump responded by giving them a 30-day reprieve which is set to expire in April.

The president has also imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports, removing the exemptions from his earlier 2018 taxes on the metals. He also plans tariffs on computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs, lumber and copper.

His taxes risk igniting a broader global trade war with escalating retaliations that could crush global trade, potentially damaging economic growth while raising prices for families and businesses as some of the costs of the taxes get passed along by importers.

When the European Union retaliated with plans for a 50% tariff on US spirits, Mr Trump responded by planning a 200% tax on alcoholic beverages from the EU.

He also intends to place a 25% tariff on countries that import oil from Venezuela, even though the US also imports oil from that nation.

Mr Trump's aides maintain that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico are about stopping illegal immigration and drug smuggling, but the administration also wants to use the tariff revenues to lower the budget deficit and assert America's pre-eminence as the world's largest economy.

The president on Monday cited plans by South Korean car maker Hyundai to build a 5.8 billion dollar (£4.5 billion) steel plant in Louisiana as evidence that tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs.

Slightly more than a million people are employed domestically in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts, about 320,000 fewer than in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Another 2.1 million people work at auto and parts dealerships.

The US last year imported nearly eight million cars and light trucks worth 244 billion dollars (£189 billion). Mexico, Japan and South Korea were the top sources of foreign vehicles.

Imports of car parts came to more than 197 billion dollars (£153 billion), led by Mexico, Canada and China, according to the Commerce Department.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on automobiles and light trucks imported into the U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.  

""This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,"" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. ""We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.""

Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.

""This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.""

White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue. 

Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S. 

Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.

The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4. 

Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts. 

Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers — Ford, General Motors and Stellantis — all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and consumer unhappiness over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, fell nearly 6% on the day and are down 33% this year.

Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a defining policy of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil. 

Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.

One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as $12,200 for some models due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy. 

Targeting imported cars could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.

""I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,"" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. ""Tariffs are taxes — bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.""

About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.

Stocks skidded in afternoon trading after the White House signaled that President Trump on Wednesday would announce more tariffs, with the latest salvo targeting U.S. auto imports. 

The S&P 500 dropped 64 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,712, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite nosed down 2% as investors pulled back from major technology players. 

After a delayed announcement, Mr. Trump said he is imposing a 25% tariff on all vehicles imported into the U.S. ""This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,"" he said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. ""We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.""

Shares of automakers slid ahead of the announcement, with General Motors sinking 3.2% and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram, dropping 3.5%. The Detroit automakers' manufacturing plants and supply chains are spread across North America, so additional tariffs would raise their costs and crimp profits. 

Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and consumer unhappiness over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, fell nearly 6% and are down 33% this year.  

Consumers are also likely to feel the sting of additional import duties. New tariffs on U.S. car imports could drive up vehicle costs between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, Anderson Economic Group has estimated. 

Beyond the impact on the auto sector, investors have been rattled by President Trump's protectionist trade policies. The U.S. is scheduled to announce a raft of tariffs on April 2, including 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with even more sweeping matching levies on a number of U.S. trading partners. 

""The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence,"" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors. 

He added, ""Even those who might agree with the long-term benefits of tariffs have to acknowledge there will be a multi-quarter period of substantial disruption to the economy, with softer growth and higher inflation.""

The Federal Reserve earlier this month cited the likely impact of tariffs in lowering its outlook for U.S. economic growth to 1.7%, while also forecasting a pickup in inflation. 

A new analysis by Oxford Economics found that U.S. tariffs could raise the cost of some products by as much as 4%, with home appliances, musical instruments, tableware and utensils, and personal care items potentially seeing the biggest price hikes.

Lunch Break: The Atlantic Has Receipts

Andrew Harnik|Getty Images

National security adviser Michael Waltz, left, Vice President JD Vance, center, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office on March 13.

There's an old saying somewhere: ‘Don't poke the bear if the bear has the receipts.'

And after the Trump administration spent much of yesterday insisting the contents of the Signal group chat inadvertently leaked to an editor at The Atlantic were not classified, the outlet dropped the receipts, releasing a full, minimally redacted version of the messages this morning.

The release came just hours before Trump cabinet officials like Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel began their testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Some Democrats have begun calling for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation over Signalgate, and the rest of Washington – including President Donald Trump, who has a light public schedule again today – will be watching with bated breath to see what happens next.

Here's the lunchtime lowdown, which U.S. News will be publishing each weekday to keep track of the goings-on in Washington and beyond:

The Atlantic published the full text thread from the infamous group chat that detailed U.S. military strikes carried out against the Houthis in Yemen. In the newly public texts, Hegseth can be seen sharing extraordinary details like “Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,” and “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based' targets).” Read more.

Several members of Trump's national security team are facing the House Intelligence Committee today, including Gabbard, Patel and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, where they are being grilled on that group chat. Gabbard admitted that accidentally adding the reporter was a “mistake” but maintained that no classified information was compromised. Read more.

District Judge James Boasberg, who has drawn the Trump administration's ire for his handling of a lawsuit over deportation flights, was assigned a lawsuit over Signalgate this morning filed by watchdog group American Oversight. The organization's suit against Hegseth, Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and others argues their use of Signal violated federal record-keeping laws, as some of the messages were reportedly set to auto-delete, among other violations. Read more.

Chief executives from NPR and PBS are defending their funding and pushing back against accusations of bias in a heated congressional hearing today. At it, NPR's CEO and President Katherine Maher admitted she regretted calling Trump a “racist” and “sociopath” on social media in 2020, while PBS chief Paula Kerger defended the outlet's handling of a presidential debate and other coverage. Meanwhile, the director of Voice of America – another federally funded media outlet – filed a lawsuit today over its intended shuttering. Read more.

Democrats in Pennsylvania won a special election in state House race to ensure they keep majority control of the chamber by a single representative, and appeared to flip a state Senate race in a deep red district.The latter result was cheered by high-profile Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are eager for wins amid a Republican trifecta at the federal level. Read more.

Oops, something went wrong

President Trump made good on his promise to impose tariffs on foreign automakers, imposing 25% duties on all cars and light trucks not made in the United States.

“This will continue to spur growth that you've never seen before,"" Trump said from the White House on Wednesday, signing an executive order putting the tariffs in place.

The 25% tariffs are set to take effect April 2 and add to existing tariffs. The White House estimates that $100 billion in annual duties will be collected.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would make the announcement earlier today during a news briefing with reporters. Shares of BMW (BMW.DE), Porsche (P911.DE), Volkswagen (VOW.DE), and Mercedes-Benz (MBG.DE) dropped following Leavitt's announcement, while GM (GM), Stellantis (STLA), and Tesla (TSLA) traded lower in sympathy.

Though the new tariffs will hit mostly foreign automakers, domestic automakers, including the Big Three — Ford (F), GM, and Stellantis — are concerned about their impact too. GM, Ford, and Stellantis build vehicles in Canada, Mexico, and China, and they foresee higher production costs due to tariffs' effect on the auto supply chain.

While Wednesday's tariffs seem to only target finished auto products, existing tariffs on Chinese goods, for example, are affecting costs for domestic automotive production due to the number of parts imported from the country.

Trump has deemed April 2, the day on which he is slated to announce further tariffs, ""Liberation Day"" for the US, saying other countries have ""ripped [us] off"" and that any new tariffs are ""reciprocal.""

While the costs of the new auto tariffs on foreign imports are hard to quantify, analysis from various data firms suggest price hikes of $3,000 to as much as $12,000 for non-premium autos.

European automakers have suggested a range of options for dealing with tariffs. BMW said it will absorb the costs for a short time, while Porsche suggested it would pass on costs directly to consumers.

Oops, something went wrong

GameStop (GME) stock slid more than 8% in after-hours trading Wednesday as the company announced it's attempting to raise $1.3 billion to buy bitcoin (BTC-USD).

The company will attempt to raise the funds via convertible senior notes.

The news comes one day after GameStop shares rose more nearly 12% when the video game operator turned popular meme stock said in a release that its board ""has unanimously approved an update to its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.""

The planned bitcoin investment comes about a month after CNBC reported GameStop was exploring cryptocurrency investments. On Feb. 8, a social media post from GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen sparked speculation over GameStop's interest in cryptocurrency. Cohen posted a picture on X with Strategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who has famously hitched his company to bitcoin. It now holds more than 447,000 tokens, per a February filing.

The strategy has worked out well for Saylor's company, with the stock up over 84% in the past year amid a rise in the price of bitcoin. But Wall Street strategists are hesitant to conclude that GameStop investing in bitcoin would mean the video game retailer's stock has upside.

""The company's strategy, which has changed about six times in three years, is they're going to buy cryptocurrency and be just like MicroStrategy,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance on Monday ahead of the earnings release. 

He added, ""The problem with that thinking is MicroStrategy trades at about two times their bitcoin holdings. If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their $4.6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings,] the stock would drop five bucks.""

Also after the bell on Tuesday, GameStop reported fourth quarter earnings results. The company posted $1.28 billion in net sales for the quarter, marking a 28% decline from the year-earlier period. For the full year, GameStop reported an adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million, down from $64.7 million seen the year prior.

Nvidia (NVDA) continues to ride the AI wave as cloud giants Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) snatch up as many of its data center chips as they can.

And while shares of the chip company are off 10% year to date, they're still up 27% over the past 12 months and more than 700% since 2023. Revenue is also soaring, jumping from $27 billion during the company's fiscal 2023 to $130 billion in fiscal 2025.

But during Nvidia's GTC event last week, CEO Jensen Huang repeatedly made the case for the company's next major AI innovation: robotics. Huang is looking to use Nvidia's digital AI prowess to grow what he calls physical AI, including self-driving cars and humanoid robots.

""We are ... world class with robotic safety. I believe this expertise is going to pay off big someday,"" the CEO said during a press briefing during the conference.

""We've been investing in this area for 10 years now. It's a multibillion-dollar business for us already ... and I think this is going to be one of the largest businesses for the company long term,"" Huang added.

A quick tour of Nvidia's GTC showcase at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center offered a glimpse at Nvidia's robotics ambitions, with exhibits ranging from robotic arms to human-size bipedal robots.

On one side of the large hall, the company displayed its own prototype of a robotic ultrasound machine as an example of how businesses can take advantage of its technologies.

The voice-activated bot included a single mechanical arm with a camera and scanner. When I told it to perform a liver scan, it quickly located the organ on a dummy torso and performed the procedure. A display mounted behind the setup showed the live results, which I can only assume is what a liver looks like on an ultrasound.

I'm a reporter, not a doctor.

In the next stall, Agility Robotics showed off its Digit robot as it grabbed items off a faux store shelf and put them into a shopping basket, completing the task over and over again like some kind of Sisyphean nightmare. A litany of other robotic arms and a Boston Dynamics Spot were also on display at the event.

Huang is banking on robot makers relying on a three-computer system that Nvidia has developed to train and run the machines.

The first system includes Nvidia's DGX AI systems, which customers use to develop AI robot models. Then there's the Nvidia Omniverse system, which customers use to train their robotic models to navigate the real world in a virtual setting.

The idea is to ensure customers can subject their robots' AI models to a litany of potential scenarios ranging from falling down stairs to crashing into walls to trying to avoid falling air conditioners without having to put them — or the people around them — in any real-world danger.

""You want to simulate ... millions of miles of [a car] driving, test it out beforehand, and then deploy it,"" Nvidia vice presidence of Omniverse and simulation technology Rev Lebaredian told Yahoo Finance.

""And [it's] the same for all robots. I'm using cars as an example, but the robots we have in our factories. These are multimillion-dollar factories. Any amount of downtime costs millions of dollars and opportunity cost, or they can be dangerous too. You don't want them hurting the robots themselves or hurting people that are also in those factories.""

The final component is Nvidia's Jetson Thor onboard computer, which runs those trained AI models. Think of it as something of a robotic brain. Vehicles would use Nvidia's AGX Thor.

Nvidia isn't the only company looking to capitalize on the promise of a robot-filled future. Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla are each working on some element of the robot ecosystem.

Then there are the practical hurdles companies must overcome before robots become a part of our everyday lives. Humanoid robots are still incredibly expensive — upwards of tens of thousands of dollars — and their batteries still don't last very long before needing a top-off.

And while self-driving cars continue to expand to more cities, we're still some time from the day when you can hop into your car's driver's seat and take a nap on the way to the office.

Nvidia, however, has a history of continuing to develop technologies it believes in until they break into the market. Look no further than its graphics card software and AI capabilities. And if Nvidia can do the same with robotics, it could be a whole new opportunity for the chip giant.

Oops, something went wrong

The Department of Education plans to reopen applications for a popular set of student loan repayment programs as soon as Wednesday after blocking access to them for several weeks, according to two sources familiar with the administration's plans.

The change will once again allow borrowers to sign up for income-driven repayment options that cap their monthly payments at a share of their earnings. The Trump administration abruptly took down the online forms for those plans last month in response to a federal appeals court decision, leaving many former students baffled about how to manage their loans.

When the portal reopens, borrowers will be able to enroll in one of three plans according to the sources: Income-Based Repayment, Pay as You Earn, or Income-Contingent Repayment. The Biden administration's SAVE plan and REPAYE, both of which were involved in last month's court ruling, will not be available. Neither will offer a feature that automatically selects a plan based on the lowest monthly payment.

Student loan servicers have been told to resume processing income-driven repayment applications in about two weeks, the sources said. They had been put on pause while applications were shuttered.

Department of Justice attorneys also indicated that the administration intends to reopen income-driven repayment applications as soon as Wednesday. The comments were made during a hearing Tuesday in a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of Teachers seeking to end the pause on the payment plans. AFT and the Student Borrower Protection Center announced the development in a press release after the initial publication of this article.

The Department of Education closed off access to income-driven repayment options in February after the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld an injunction stopping the government from implementing SAVE, which lowered monthly payments on undergraduate loans to 5% of discretionary income and shortened the path to forgiveness compared to previous repayment options. In doing so, the court also ruled that parts of REPAYE, which capped payments at no more than 10% of earnings, were likely illegal as well.

Student loan advocates criticized the decision to cut off access to programs like Income-Based Repayment, which was not part of the litigation, as an overreaction. The move may have been necessary, however, because borrowers apply to all of the income-driven plans using the same online form.

Many students already enrolled in income-driven plans were worried that they would not be able to submit their annual paperwork recertifying their incomes, which could cause their monthly payments to balloon. But last week, student loan servicers announced that the deadlines for those forms had been pushed back until February 2026.

According to one of the sources who spoke with Yahoo Finance, the staffers responsible for turning the IDR application back on were originally laid off as part of the Department of Education's massive reduction in force this month, aimed at cutting the agency's headcount in half. But they were brought back a week later after officials realized that nobody else understood how the technology behind the applications worked.

The Department of Education's press office did not return a request for comment.

The race is under way to make faster, cheaper and better GLP-1 drugs that will go beyond reducing obesity levels to treating some of our most difficult conditions

By Michael Le Page


                                    26 March 2025

Obesity rates have been increasing in the US for decades, but in 2023 they fell – at least in part because of the burgeoning popularity of the “miracle drug” semaglutide. Approved for treating obesity only in 2021, it is in short supply and is very expensive, but it has already had an extraordinary impact (“How semaglutide and similar drugs work”, below).

Yet this could just be start. With many companies racing to market rival versions of semaglutide in cheaper and easier-to-take forms, as well as mounting evidence that that GLP-1 drugs can target a host of health conditions, the treatments could have an impact that goes way beyond reversing the worldwide trend of rising obesity and possibly even putting a dent in alcohol sales. So what lies ahead for these drugs – and what are the stumbling blocks?

A growing number of studies show that semaglutide seems to have many beneficial effects in addition to weight loss. For instance, in a four-year trial involving nearly 18,000 people, 6.5 per cent of those on semaglutide had a heart attack or stroke compared with 8 per cent of those receiving a placebo.

The treatment may even reduce many kinds of craving, not just those for food (see What do GLP-1 drugs really tell us about the brain's reward system?). “There are anecdotal reports of people reducing their alcohol intake substantially on semaglutide,” says Helen Colhoun at the University of Edinburgh, UK. “I think that this is one of the exciting potential…

Scientists may have just found a canal the Romans built 2,100 years ago while battling the Celts.

Scientists in France may be hot on the trail of a long-lost canal that the Romans built over two millennia ago while battling the Celts.

The waterway, known as the Marius Canal, was built around 2,100 years ago within the Rhône River delta. It was the first major Roman water hydraulic feature in what was then Gaul, preceding dams, watermills and aqueducts. According to historical accounts, it was built between 104 and 102 B.C. by the troops of Julius Caesar's uncle, the general Gaius Marius. Its construction was meant to aid efforts in the Cimbrian Wars, a series of conflicts between the Roman Republic and Celtic tribes, the Cimbri and Teutones, that were migrating south from Jutland, present-day Denmark.

At that time, the Roman Republic was protecting its new province in Gaul, a region that covered what is now France, Belgium and parts of western Germany. But the encroachment of the Celts put that land, as well as the rest of the Roman Republic, at risk.

""The Roman general Marius came to southern Gaul in 104 B.C. to head off the risk that the Cimbri and Teutones ravaging Gaul and Spain would reach Italy,"" Simon Loseby, an honorary lecturer in medieval history and an expert on southern Gaul at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. who was not involved in the study, told Live Science. ""He headed a very large force, and urgently needed to supply it by sea from Rome.""

So, Marius ordered the canal be built so it could supply his troops. It bypassed the treacherous Rhône River mouths and connected the city of Arles to the Mediterranean, enabling the safe passage of large supply boats. Ultimately, the canal was a success, and the Romans defeated the Cimbri and Teutones in 101 B.C. The canal was subsequently gifted to Rome's ally in the region, the Greek settlement of Massalia, now Marseille, which is said to have gained significant revenue from its commercial use before the canal vanished from the historical record a few centuries later.

""Despite all the research carried out in recent centuries, the Marius Canal hasn't been found,"" study lead author Joé Juncker, a geoarchaeologist at the University of Strasbourg in France, told Live Science in an email. It was last mentioned by the Roman author Pliny the Elder in the first century A.D., but its traces have all but disappeared.

In 2013, a geophysical survey of a delta in the Vigueirat marshes just south of Arles revealed an underwater feature that scientists hypothesized could be an ancient canal. Subsequent excavations around the site unearthed 69 pieces of Roman ceramics, two ancient wooden stakes and two extensive cobblestone platforms. Radiocarbon dating of the stakes placed them within the first to fourth century A.D., while organic materials within the platforms dated between the first century B.C. and third century A.D. when the Marius Canal would have been used.

Since the site's discovery 12 years ago, researchers have been trying to gather evidence to confirm whether this area really hosts the long-lost Marius Canal.

In the new study, Juncker and his team drilled sediment cores from the ancient canal and its banks and took physical measurements to compare with the geophysical surveys conducted in 2013.

""The canal length, width, orientation, sediment content and the measured radiocarbon dates confirm that it was a navigable canal in Roman times, partially excavated in a former branch of the Rhône and an ancient lagoon,"" Juncker said.

Natural tributaries in river channels are usually around 360 to 590 feet (110 to 180 meters) wide, while the new analysis shows the putative Marius Canal is much narrower at around 98 feet (30 m) wide. This aligns with other Roman canals. This width would have enabled large Roman ships to navigate the area, the authors reported in the study, published in the April issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.

The new research strengthens the case that there was a canal here, Loseby said. ""It's yet another indication of the Roman capacity to conceive of and undertake large infrastructural projects at speed, despite relative technological limitations.""

Both Loseby and Juncker hope future archaeological discoveries will further establish whether the canal is the Marius Canal. Specifically, they hope excavations could lead to the discovery of quays (landing platforms for ships) or towpaths (waterways where draft animals would tow boats), which could help confirm the use of the canal and the duration of its use.

""Geoarchaeology is a science full of potential, but we must bear in mind that, without confirmation from archaeological studies, it is not possible to attribute this canal to Marius for the moment,"" said Juncker. Research there is ongoing.

The number of insect species is mind-boggling — and they are a critical part of the environment.

Exploring anywhere on Earth, look closely and you'll find insects. Check your backyard and you may see ants, beetles, crickets, wasps, mosquitoes and more. There are more kinds of insects than there are mammals, birds and plants combined. This fact has fascinated scientists for centuries.

One of the things biologists like me do is classify all living things into categories. Insects belong to a phylum called Arthropoda — animals with hard exoskeletons and jointed feet.

All insects are arthropods, but not all arthropods are insects. For instance, spiders, lobsters and millipedes are arthropods, but they're not insects.

Instead, insects are a subgroup within Arthropoda, a class called ""Insecta,"" that is characterized by six legs, two antennae and three body segments — head, abdomen and the thorax, which is the part of the body between the head and abdomen.

Most insects also have wings, although a few, like fleas, don't. All have compound eyes, which means insects see very differently from the way people see. Instead of one lens per eye, they have many: a fly has 5,000 lenses; a dragonfly has 30,000. These types of eyes, though not great for clarity, are excellent at detecting movement.

All insects descend from a common ancestor that lived about about 480 million years ago. For context, that's about 100 million years before any of our vertebrate ancestors — animals with a backbone — ever walked on land.

A species is the most basic unit that biologists use to classify living things. When people use words like ""ant"" or ""fly"" or ""butterfly"" they are referring not to species, but to categories that may contain hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of species. For example, about 18,000 species of butterfly exist — think monarch, zebra swallowtail or cabbage white.

Basically, species are a group that can interbreed with each other, but not with other groups. One obvious example: bees can't interbreed with ants.

But brown-belted bumblebees and red-belted bumblebees can't interbreed either, so they are different species of bumblebee.

Each species has a unique scientific name — like Bombus griseocollis for the brown-belted bumblebee — so scientists can be sure which species they're talking about.

Counting the exact number of insect species is probably impossible. Every year, some species go extinct, while some evolve anew. Even if we could magically freeze time and survey the entire Earth all at once, experts would disagree on the distinctiveness or identity of some species. So instead of counting, researchers use statistical analysis to make an estimate.

One scientist did just that. He published his answer in a 2018 research paper. His calculations showed there are approximately 5.5 million insect species, with the correct number almost certainly between 2.6 and 7.2 million.

Beetles alone account for almost one-third of the number, about 1.5 million species. By comparison, there are ""only"" an estimated 22,000 species of ants. This and other studies have also estimated about 3,500 species of mosquitoes, 120,000 species of flies and 30,000 species of grasshoppers and crickets.

The estimate of 5.5 million species of insects is interesting. What's even more remarkable is that because scientists have found only about 1 million species, that means more than 4.5 million species are still waiting for someone to discover them. In other words, over 80% of the Earth's insect biodiversity is still unknown.

Add up the total population and biomass of the insects, and the numbers are even more staggering. The 22,000 species of ants comprise about 20,000,000,000,000,000 individuals — that's 20 quadrillion ants. And if a typical ant weighs about 0.0001 ounces (3 milligrams) — or one ten-thousandth of an ounce — that means all the ants on Earth together weigh more than 132 billion pounds (about 60 billion kilograms).

That's the equivalent of about 7 million school buses, 600 aircraft carriers or about 20% of the weight of all humans on Earth combined.

All of this has potentially huge implications for our own human species. Insects affect us in countless ways. People depend on them for crop pollination, industrial products and medicine. Other insects can harm us by transmitting disease or eating our crops.

Most insects have little to no direct impact on people, but they are integral parts of their ecosystems. This is why entomologists — bug scientists — say we should leave insects alone as much as possible. Most of them are harmless to people, and they are critical to the environment.

—Soldier ants turned into foragers by scientists reprogramming their brains

—Parasitic 'horror' wasp that bursts from a fly's abdomen like an 'Alien' xenomorph discovered in Mississippi backyard

—Butterflies cross Atlantic ocean on 2,600-mile non-stop flight never recorded in any insect before

It is sobering to note that although millions of undiscovered insect species may be out there, many will go extinct before people have a chance to discover them. Largely due to human activity, a significant proportion of Earth's biodiversity — including insects — may ultimately be forever lost.

A 'no visiting' policy will remain in place across a number of Welsh hospitals due to an outbreak of norovirus. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board announced on March 21 that there would be no general visiting at their hospitals amid ""exceptional pressure"" they were facing due to a ""significant increase"" in norovirus cases.

The health board said they would be reviewing reviewing the restrictions in the coming days to see if the situation had improved. However in an update issued by the health board on Wednesday, March 26, it was confirmed the visiting ban would be extended.

A spokesman for Cardiff and Value UHB said: ""Last week we made the difficult decision to implement a no visiting policy across the health board due to a norovirus outbreak. Unfortunately the position remains challenging across the organisation and the no visiting policy will remain in place. We will review the restrictions at the end of the week if the situation improves."" They added that they ""recognise the importance of support from family and friends when patients are in hospital"" but emphasised that the restrictions were ""necessary to protect our patients, staff, and the wider community.""

Exceptions will be considered in some cases, particularly for those patients who are critically ill or receiving end-of-life care, birthing partners, and at the Children's Hospital for Wales. The policy also does not affect outpatient appointments which will be going ahead unless you have been contacted by the department directly to explain otherwise.

Cardiff and Vale UHB manage the following hospitals in and around the capital: University Hospital of Wales, University Hospital Llandough, Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales, Barry Hospital, St David's Hospital, Hafan y Coed Mental Health Unit, Cardiff Royal Infirmary, and the University Dental Hospital.

Those who are able to visit hospitals are expected to maintain good hygiene practice by washing their hands thoroughly with soap and water and by adhering to infection prevention and control precautions. Those who are feeling unwell are being asked to remain at home until you have been clear of symptoms for at least 48 hours. Stay informed on the latest health news by signing up to our newsletter here.

The health board said: ""Most norovirus cases can be managed at home with rest, fluids, and self-care and symptoms typically improve within two to three days. If you are unsure of your symptoms you can check them using the NHS 111 Wales online symptom checker, which has a wealth of information, advice, and guidance for a range of different conditions.

""If you think you need urgent healthcare advice or to access out-of-hours services please call 111 first and speak with a clinician.

World No. 2 Iga Swiatek has been granted extra security after an incident in which an unruly fan verbally abused her during a practice session at the Miami Open last weekend, according to a report by the BBC. The increase in security came ahead of Swiatek's match on Wednesday, where the five-time world champion was upset by Alexandra Eala in the quarterfinals.

The spectator, who was characterized as ""aggressive and taunting,"" allegedly shouted personal insults about Swiatek's family after previously having sent her abusive messages online. The BBC reports that Swiatek's team reported the incident, leading tournament organizers and the WTA to put extra security in place ahead of her match on Wednesday.

""Security is a top priority. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues,"" a spokesperson for Swiatek said. ""Constructive  criticism is one thing, and threats, hate speech or even disturbance  during training is another -- this cannot be condoned.""

The matter involving Swiatek comes on the heels of another incident in which fan behavior proved disturbing for a women's tennis star. At the Dubai Championships, a stoppage in play occurred after Emma Raducanu was frightened by the presence of a man who had been stalking her during her second round match, leading to enhanced security being put in place for her. The man in question has since been banned from all WTA tournaments.

While it's uncertain as to whether or not the harassment incident and subsequent reaction affected her play, Swiatek ended up losing her quarterfinal match on Wednesday to Alexandra Eala. At 19-years old, Eala pulled off a major upset after having made the Miami Open as a wild card before knocking off Swiatek, who won the event back in 2022.

Aaron Rodgers doesn't yet have an NFL team for the 2025 season, and one club in particular appears to be out of the mix for his services: the Minnesota Vikings. Or are they? A week after reports indicated the Vikings are not pursuing the former MVP, and rather plan to turn the top quarterback job to J.J. McCarthy, general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah addressed the situation, leaving the door open for additional Rodgers talks.

Adofo-Mensah first made it clear, while speaking with reporters Wednesday, that McCarthy has ""met the bar"" and ""exceeded our expectations at every point"" in his young NFL journey. Despite missing all of his rookie season due to knee surgeries, the 2024 first-round draft pick opening 2025 as the starter is ""the outcome we want and ... the outcome we're headed toward,"" Adofo-Mensah acknowledged.

""It's also our job to set up a quarterback room,"" the general manager continued, confirming the Vikings included Rodgers on a list of potential offseason targets for veteran competition or insurance.

""A player like him, he's always gonna be in those conversations,"" Adofo-Mensah said, noting that coach Kevin O'Connell had extensive dialogue with Rodgers during free agency. ""[But] we're happy with where we are right now. ... Right now, given all our scenario-planning, we're happy with our room. ... We got to a place where everyone was transparent. ... I know Kevin and him have a great relationship still.""

Could the Vikings resume talks with Rodgers, despite the team's public support of McCarthy?

""We didn't think it was the right move at this time,"" Adofo-Mensah said. ""It is also his decision whether he signs with another team. ... [but] for me to sit here and say anything's 100% forever, that's just not the job. So obviously things can change.""

While they are still expected to select Cam Ward with the No. 1 overall pick, the Tennessee Titans decided to add to their quarterback room with four weeks to go before the start of the 2025 NFL Draft. The Titans have signed veteran quarterback Tim Boyle, who is joining his seventh NFL team after breaking into the NFL in 2018 as a member of the Green Bay Packers. 

Boyle, 30, spent his first three seasons in the NFL as one of Aaron Rodgers' backups. He attempted just four regular season passes in Green Bay before getting three starts in 2021, his first and only season with the Detroit Lions. Boyle lost each of those starts and threw twice as many interceptions (six) as touchdowns (three), but he did complete an impressive 64.9% of his passes for a Lions team that went just 3-13-1 that season. 

Boyle spent the 2022 season in Chicago before getting two more starts during the 2023 season as a member of the Jets, where he again shared a quarterback room with Rodgers, who spent most of that season recovering from an Achilles injury. Boyle spent time with the Dolphins and the Giants in 2024, throwing for 274 yards with one touchdown and one pick in three regular season appearances. 

Boyle's longevity is impressive when you consider how his NFL career started. He went undrafted after attempting just 275 passes in three years at Connecticut and completing just 48.4% of said attempts. Boyle threw one collegiate touchdown pass against 13 interceptions. 

Despite those numbers, Boyle is preparing for his eighth NFL season with the Titans, whose quarterback room also includes fellow newcomer Brandon Allen and 2023 second-round pick Will Levis, who went 5-16 as the team's starter the past two seasons. 

As noted above, the Titans are expected to use the top pick in the draft to select Ward, the top-ranked quarterback prospect in the draft. But the Titans are keeping their options open regarding the pick, at least publicly. 

""I would say everything is still on the table,"" Titans general manager Mike Borgonzi said earlier this week, via the team's website. ""From the beginning I said I wanted to go through the whole process, and I felt like our priority was to build the offensive line first, and we added (tackle) Dan Moore and (guard) Kevin Zeitler.

""Now we're going through the process here with the college quarterbacks. But I'd say everything is still on the table right now.""

The Sweet 16 is upon us with some promising matchups ahead. There is a lot of parity this season and despite being down to 16 teams, picking a national champion still feels like an impossible task.

The next round is giving us some exciting rematches and might answer some of the biggest questions in this tournament. The main one being how the USC Trojans will adjust without JuJu Watkins, who tore her ACL in the second round. Their first full test without her will be against Kansas State.

Meanwhile, TCU has already made program history by reaching the Sweet 16 for the first time with Hailey Van Lith on the roster. South Carolina is trying to win its third national title in four years, and UConn -- the winningest program in basketball history with 11 championships -- wants to get Paige Bueckers a trophy before she leaves to the WNBA. 

Without further ado, let's take a look and rank the most interesting matchups in the Sweet 16.

Maryland gave us the most exciting game of the tournament in a double-overtime win against Alabama. That being said, the Terrapins had to overcome a 17-point deficit to make it happen and they can't put themselves in that kind of hole against one of the best teams in the country like South Carolina. However, the Gamecocks did not cruise through the second round as Indiana figured out how to give them a battle for the second consecutive year in the NCAA Tournament. Brenda Frese can take notes from the Hoosiers, but Dawn Staley can also use that game as extra motivation for her team.

Any chance to watch Lauren Betts play is worth it. She is one of the strongest candidates to win Player of the Year because of her dominance on both sides of the court. UCLA is the top overall seed and having its best season in program history with a well-rounded roster. Ole Miss has a tough task ahead, but the Rebels have been battle-tested this season. Coach Yolett McPhee-McCuin's Rebels have given multiple top opponents close battles and even pulled an upset against LSU earlier this month.

UConn is playing like a No. 1 seed and it's a well-known fact that Geno Auriemma's teams are always dangerous in March. The Huskies earned a ticket to their 31st consecutive Sweet 16 after Paige Bueckers tied a career-high with 34 points against South Dakota State in her last college basketball game at Storrs. However, Oklahoma also has clutch players like Raegan Beers, who played at Oregon State last year and guided the Beavers to an Elite Eight appearance.

This is Wes Moore vs. Kim Mulkey. The two coaches have incredibly talented teams playing at the highest levels in March. You can't really go wrong with that. Both teams have recent experience making deep runs in the NCAA Tournament as NC State made the Final Four last year and LSU won the 2023 national title. The Tigers took an 82-65 win during their meeting in November, but the Wolfpack got stronger as the season progressed and even pulled an upset over Notre Dame in February. 

The Trojans have heavily relied on JuJu Watkins this season, but it will be Kiki Iriafen's job to take on an even bigger role in her absence. Sometimes the Trojans lack consistency on offense, but the talent is definitely still there, especially on the defensive end. Kansas State will be a tough test for USC as the Wildcats showed a lot of grit while surviving a thrilling overtime game against Kentucky.

These two schools have one of the best-known rivalries in college sports, and very much on brand, they split their series during the regular season. This third meeting matters most as it is the first time the in-state rivals will face each other in the NCAA Tournament. One thing to keep an eye on is the status of Duke leading scorer Toby Fournier, who ""wasn't feeling well"" and missed the second round game against Oregon.

Notre Dame is of the most talented teams in the nation when fully locked in with the talented backcourt duo of Hannah Hidalgo and Olivia Miles, as well as players like Sonia Citron and Liatu King, who can make huge impacts on both sides of the court any given night. This is TCU's first Sweet 16, but an earlier highlight of this historic season was the Horned Frogs beating Notre Dame in November. The addition of Hailey Van Lith helped TCU level up, and a fun fact about her is that she has never missed an Elite Eight in her college career with Louisville and LSU. 

Tennessee almost upset Texas earlier this season, and this could be another tight contest between two of the most successful programs in women's basketball history. Both teams know how to go on runs and disrupt opponents by forcing turnovers. Tennessee has a fast, aggressive style of play and one of the best offenses in the nation with some strong 3-point shooting. Meanwhile, Texas has good guard depth and a suffocating defense that can stun any opponent.

The 19-year old leader of Sweet 16-bound Texas Tech has a favorite basketball player and it may surprise you.

JT Toppin, the Big 12 Player of the Year and a big reason the Red Raiders are still dancing in March, is a huge fan of a key member of those title-winning Chicago Bulls teams in the 1990s. 

No, it's not Michael Jordan or Scottie Pippen. 

Toppin was born five years after Dennis Rodman's last season in the NBA in 2000 but the passion for the ""Worm"" is real. Both played high school basketball in Dallas, both stand at 6-foot-7 and both appreciate the lost art of rebounding. Toppin might be the only person in college basketball who would genuinely pick Rodman as his favorite player. 

""JT would rather have 20 rebounds than 20 points any day of the week,"" said former NBA player Ramon Sessions, who is Toppin's agent and the president of On Time Agency. ""You'll see JT on a regular basis with a Dennis Rodman shirt. He wears his hoodies. Their games are very relatable from an energy standpoint. 

""He watches film on Dennis Rodman. Like, it's crazy."" 

Toppin's love of rebounding and his growing offensive prowess has been critical for Texas Tech this season, setting up a Thursday Sweet 16 game against 10-seed Arkansas. Toppin is averaging a double-double through two NCAA Tournament games, playing a critical role in the Red Raiders' second-round win over 11-seed Drake. Toppin went for 25 points and 12 rebounds, with 19 of those points (on 9 of 10 from the field) coming in the first half.

This is why Texas Tech had to have Toppin, who spent a year at New Mexico and was the Mountain West Freshman of the Year before entering the transfer portal. And perhaps at least partially why Texas is already out of the NCAA Tournament and its coach, Rodney Terry, out of a job. 

Toppin was invited to the NBA Draft combine after his standout freshman year, but also entered the transfer portal to keep his options open. He loved his time at New Mexico but liked the idea of the national spotlight that came with playing in a bigger conference. The interest in a bouncy, athletic big man who played hard and came with little ego was understandably big. 

""Value wise, he was the hottest one on the market,"" said Sessions, who played 11 years in the NBA before becoming an agent. ""People can speculate what that looks like, but he was the hottest name on the market. From a NIL standpoint, he was in a good place.""

Texas quickly emerged as the reported favorite to land Toppin. The school was actively working a relationship with Toppin's high school coach, Brandon Thomas, to help make it happen, according to sources familiar with the situation. Texas wanted Toppin and it's easy to imagine the Longhorns faring much better than a First Four exit that ultimately resulted in Terry's dismissal after three seasons. 

Texas boosters, which went all-in on NIL last season with the football program, didn't seem as willing to open up for Terry. It was an open secret in college basketball circles that Texas AD Chris Del Conte had his eye on other coaches before feeling like he had to promote Terry following an Elite Eight run as the interim coach in 2023. Coming into this season, it was known that Terry would likely have to make another NCAA Tournament run to hold on to his job, but the money didn't seem to pour in to help make that happen. Texas fired Terry last week and is expected to commit more resources to new coach Sean Miller. 

There is a newish phenomenon within this current era of college athletics where supporters can help nudge a coach out by turning off the NIL cash faucet. It famously happened to former Auburn football coach Bryan Harsin, according to sources, who didn't connect with the school's top boosters and felt the impact of not being able to compete for top players. His replacement, Hugh Freeze, smartly rectified that issue and has the money flowing to help sign what was just the nation's 8th-rated transfer portal class. 

Texas basketball sources say an asking price upwards of seven-figures ultimately proved too expensive for the Longhorns. Sessions didn't want to get into specifics on Toppin's NIL compensation, but if Texas was claiming it wasn't willing to spend that much, there were plenty others who were. 

""There was way more money thrown on the table for him. Way more,"" he said. ""But what does that do when you're sitting home in March? When you're in the Sweet 16 now, you're getting this, you're getting all this other different stuff that comes with it and you're getting to showcase who you are."" 

A big reason Texas Tech won the Toppin sweepstakes? General manager Kellen Buffington, who is well-known in Dallas circles after running camps and operating TheTB5Reports scouting. Buffington was a big fan of Toppin's long before he was a top transfer portal target for a bevy of Power Four programs. That belief in Toppin and the accompanying relationship led to a mutual trust between all parties. Toppin wanted the freedom to grow as a basketball player, to be able to show off he could be more than just a Rodman-esque rebounder, and believed Buffington and Texas Tech head coach Grant McCasland when they said he could do that in Lubbock.

That belief paid off for everyone on a terrific season that isn't over yet. Texas Tech, an advanced metrics darling, has all the makings of a team that can make a Final Four run and beyond if it can keep playing like it has. The ability to go all-in for Toppin when when others couldn't is a big reason why.

""He just has a knack for winning,"" Sessions said. ""You put JT with Texas, you put JT with Kansas State, you put JT with whoever, JT is gonna come out on top and he's gonna impact winning."" 

Texas Tech knows that well.

The 2025 MLB season is nearly here, and we're onto Day 2 of season predictions from the CBS Sports MLB staff. On Monday, we all laid out our predictions for how each of the six divisions would finish, 1-5, and picked our three wild-card teams in each league. Here, we'll take the next step and lay out who we think will still be standing at the end of the season. 

Below, we're picking our pennant winners in both leagues plus our 2025 World Series champion.

Let's rock. 

R.J. Anderson: There are two main approaches worth taking to preseason World Series picks: either you go with the best teams on paper, or you embrace chaos by choosing a couple viable dark horse clubs. With due respect to the Dodgers, in my estimation the team with the best individual chance of winning this year's World Series, I went with the chaos as an acknowledgement that Stuff Happens during the playoffs. Despite picking the Phillies to finish second in the NL East, I think we can all agree that their rotation catching fire at the right time could see them go from the wild card to World Series champions. The Orioles, meanwhile, continue to hold a lot of promise. This might be their year.

Mike Axisa: The Dodgers have the best roster among defending World Series champions since at least the 2018 Astros, and maybe since the late 1990s Yankees. It's a boring pick, I know, but they are the best team on paper, and I see no reason to pick against them. They can beat you with pitching, with offense, with whatever. The Rangers strike me as a team built better for the short postseason series than the regular season, especially if Jacob deGrom is healthy in October.

Kate Feldman: Welcome back to 1986. I said elsewhere that I'm not sure we should take the field over the Dodgers for World Series champion but whatever. Juan Soto's going to have the best season of his career and take the Mets to glory for the first time in almost 40 years. An added hot take? It won't be the only time this decade either.  

Julian McWilliams: If healthy, the Red Sox could make their first World Series appearance since 2018. While their roster has plenty of question marks, they boast one of the best offenses in the AL. Their pitching staff, anchored by Garrett Crochet, has depth, and Alex Cora remains one of the game's top managers, thriving in high-stakes matchups. The easy pick in the NL is the Dodgers, but let's make this more interesting. The Braves will find a way to win the World Series this year with the returns of Spencer Strider and Ronald Acuña Jr. Atlanta has somewhat become an afterthought, but they still have some of the best homegrown talent in the sport.

Dayn Perry: The Dodgers are the defending champs, and they have the best and deepest roster. Any number of teams can win the weakened AL, but I'll lean Tigers by a hair over, well, lots of other teams. Always take the field over any one team, but the 2025 Dodgers challenge that notion.   

Matt Snyder: The most likely team to win the World Series is the Dodgers and it's not even that close, but there's still a 75% chance it's someone else. Picking a repeat champ just felt too boring for me anyway. I wanted to look elsewhere. Both the Rangers and Phillies have rosters built for a strong postseason, as long as everyone gets hot at the right time. It would be a fun series with a lot of big home runs. Let's do it.

As we creep closer to the 2025 Major League Baseball season, one of the things we'd like to do here is highlight some props. 

More specifically, that would be discussing some of my favorite gambling plays for the season in the props section, which would be for individual players and their stats. If you aren't into gambling, that's cool, too, because we're basically just discussing who might be decent picks to lead the league in a stat. 

Let's dive right in and make eight picks on major stats. 

Wheeler and Tigers ace Tarik Skubal are tied for the favorites here at +1000. There are times I don't like taking favorites. First off, it seems like a copout or just plain boring, but secondly sometimes it just doesn't make sense from an odds standpoint. With the odds being 100 to 1, though, I have zero issue taking the favorite. I mean, are we trying to win or not? 

Wheeler is reliable, a workhorse by 2025 standards and plays for a team that'll win plenty of games. He won 16 last year -- only two away from the MLB lead -- despite not getting run support on a regular basis. In eight of his 32 starts, the Phillies scored two or fewer runs. In eight others, they scored just three runs. That's half of Wheeler's starts. For the sake of comparison, his teammate Aaron Nola only got three runs or less in support and if we went to two or less, it was only five times. 

I'll say Wheeler leads the majors with 20 wins this year. 

The chalk pick here is Paul Skenes at +400 and that's a reasonable play. I'm still not sure how much the Pirates will let him go with workload. I'll particularly zero in on the possibility of them falling out of the race and then just shutting him down. 

Meanwhile, Ragans is listed fifth in odds, tied with Jacob deGrom (who surely isn't going to come close due to workload). Ragans was only five off the lead last season with 223 strikeouts and worked more than 185 innings. A natural progression in workload says he'll be around 200 innings, which means he could approach 250 strikeouts. 

This is my single favorite prop this season. 

Emmanuel Clase (+700) and Ryan Helsley (+750) were the top two last season. Helsley actually led with 49. The favorite is Edwin Díaz at +650. Iglesias only had 34 last season, which equaled his career high (he's done it three times). He only had 33 saves in 2023 when the Braves won 104 games. 

What gives? 

I guess it's a lot of gut feeling here. The substance I've got is Iglesias remains great and has no competition whatsoever for saves in that Braves bullpen. I have them winning the NL East this season, so there should be plenty of chances. Will he end up in the mid-30s again while pitchers on teams with less high-powered offenses rack up a lot more? Maybe. His name was just calling out to me when I saw the odds. There's obviously a chance I'll miss. That's why it's called gambling. 

Alonso only had 88 RBI last season, but he led the majors with 131 in 2022 and also drove home 120 runs in his rookie season, 2019. He's now hitting behind Francisco Lindor and Juan Soto, both of whom I expect to be all over the bases this season. There's protection behind Alonso in the batting order with players like Brandon Nimmo and Mark Vientos, too. Basically, I expect Alonso to see a ton of good pitches this season with traffic on the bases. Bring on those RBI. 

I didn't head into this one thinking Olson would be my play. If there weren't odds attached, I don't think he'd be my pick. Aaron Judge (+360) and Shohei Ohtani (+650) are the best picks and obviously show up as favorites. Kyle Schwarber at +1200 is reasonable, too, but Olson is the 10th name listed. He just led the majors in 2023 with 54 homers. He doesn't miss games, either, as he's played in 162 games each of the last three seasons. He had a down year in 2024, but he's every bit powerful enough to bounce back and lead again.

Bonus: SportsLine expert Angelo Magliocca is taking an even bigger swing on a longshot to lead the league in home runs in SportsLine's MLB Futures Betting Guide. Check out all the best bets from SportsLine's staff of MLB experts for the 2025 MLB season.  

Witt is actually the favorite here, but the plus-550 isn't a bad price tag at all. He led the majors with 211 hits last season and he's an everyday player in the second spot in his team's batting order. He also doesn't walk a ton. The result last year was a .332 batting average and 211 hits in 636 at-bats. He was only 24 years old. I'll ride with the favorite here. 

It's been a while, but Bregman has led the majors in doubles before. He did so in 2018 when he had 51. He's not nearly as good a hitter now, but the move to Fenway Park has piqued my interest to the point that I'm going with him here. He is a dead pull hitter who has grown accustomed to play in Houston with the Crawford Boxes' short porch in left field. There's a short porch in Fenway to left, too, but the Green Monster means some of those homers from past years turn into doubles. For example, xHR estimates how many home runs a player would have hit if all of his games were played in each ballpark. Last year showed 31 in Houston but only 23 in Boston. Those misses would've hit off the Monster. 

Obviously, Bregman needs to stay healthy and have a good season -- and only half the games are played at home, instead of all of them in the xHR simulation -- but I like the number here. 

To lead in stolen bases, the chalk pick is Elly De La Cruz. I think he leads the majors again -- so he's my pick if you want one -- but the price tag of -120 isn't worth it for me on the chance that he either gets hurt or loses out to someone else. Fortunately, we can grab numbers like 30+ or 40+ and I really like this spot with these odds. 

PCA will need to show he can get on base. He hasn't done it yet through two games, having gone 0 for 7. Last year, he only had a .286 on-base percentage in 410 plate appearances. And he still stole 27 bases in 30 tries. It's possible he turned a corner down the stretch last season. In his last 57 games, he hit .289/.336/.469. If he's able to hit like that, he'll be an everyday starter all year and if that's the case, I can't see him falling short of 40 steals.

The NIL and transfer portal era has helped Texas football return to the top of its sport. Now, the Texas basketball team is hoping to do the same after two seasons under Rodney Terry. The Longhorns parted ways with Terry and officially replaced him with longtime Xavier head coach Sean Miller on Monday, the same day the college basketball transfer portal opened. Long viewed as one of the sport's best tacticians, Miller will have a number of resources to work with as he tries to elevate Texas to the top of the SEC.

What will the 2025-26 Texas basketball roster look like, and which Texas basketball transfer portal and Texas basketball recruits will Miller prioritize? If you love the Longhorns, or want the latest roster updates and college basketball transfer portal news, be sure to see what the proven team of insiders are saying at Horns247, the 247Sports affiliate that covers Texas.

Horns247 has two of the most experienced journalists in the Texas market in Chip Brown and Jeff Howe. They have broken countless stories over the last two decades. Newcomer Eric Henry has already made his presence felt in the market, and Hank South and Jordan Scruggs have Longhorns recruiting on lockdown. Get all the inside scoop on the new basketball staff and VIP intel on UT football, basketball and more, plus access to the Horns247 VIP message boards, where you can interact with other fans and program insiders. 

And right now, Horns247 is offering 50% off annual subscriptions*, so now is the time to sign up. The team at Horns247 already has news out on who is coming and going on the Texas basketball roster. Head to Horns247 now to see the latest updates.

Guard Tre Johnson and forward Arthur Kaluma accounted for approximately 40% of Texas's scoring in 2024-25. Kaluma is out of eligibility and Johnson is viewed as a virtual lock to enter the 2025 NBA Draft, so Miller will be looking for high-end scoring capability.

Some of that could come via returning guards Jordan Pope and Tramon Mark, both of whom averaged around 11 points per game last season. Pope, in particular, was a high-volume scorer at Oregon State before transferring to Austin, so he could handle a lot of that load if Johnson moves on.

Regardless, the Longhorns will be looking for help in the front court, where they return no significant contributors. Iowa center Owen Freeman and Indiana center Malik Reneau and power forward Mackenzie Mgbako are some of the big names already in the portal who Miller could pursue. Get the latest Texas basketball roster news at Horns247.

Miller is expected to go after some huge names in the transfer portal, and the Horns247 staff has identified one of his former players who could be a ""tailor-made replacement"" for a departing star. You can only see who it is at Horns247.

Who are the top names Texas basketball is pursuing under coach Sean Miller, and which one of his former players could give the Longhorns a huge boost? Go to Horns247 to see their insider information, all from a team of reporters with decades of experience covering the Longhorns, and find out. 

And reminder, Horns247 is offering 50% off an annual VIP membership for a limited time, so subscribe now before it's too late.

*Terms: This offer is only available for new members who sign up for an annual subscription to Horns247. After the first year, subscription will re-bill on an annual basis at the regular rate. 247Sports.com reserves the right to alter or cancel this promotion at any time.

Taylor Swift fans are ready for a brand-new musical era — but what and when?

Swift, of course, uses the term “era” to refer to each of her past and present albums from her self-titled debut in 2006 to 2024's The Tortured Poets Department. As she embarked on her 21-month, three-hour concert tour starting in 2023, she wanted to pay homage to each record.

“Every part of you that you've ever been, every phase you've ever gone through, was you working it out in that moment with the information you had available to you at the time,” Swift told TIME in December 2023. “You should celebrate who you are now, where you're going, and where you've been.”

By the end of Eras, Swift was seemingly ready to move on. In the introduction to her Eras Tour companion book released in November 2024, Swift signed off a prologue: “See you next era … Taylor.”



Since concluding Eras the next month, Swift has been enjoying a break from the spotlight that included vacations with boyfriend Travis Kelce.

Without sharing specifics about her now-elusive 12th album — or whether the re-recordings of Taylor Swift or reputation will be released first — Swift might be leaving Us clues about what to expect (or not). Keep scrolling for a full breakdown of what some obsessive Swifties think are Easter eggs for her next original LP:

After a 100-day social media hiatus, Swift returned to Instagram on March 22, 2025, to congratulate BFF Selena Gomez and her fiancé, Benny Blanco, on their I Said I Love You First album release.

“@selenagomez & @bennyblanco I LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH,” Swift gushed via Instagram Story, sharing the Spotify cover of the LP. “OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDD.”

For what it's worth, Swift used 12 D's in the last word that had fans wondering if it directly corresponds to the next LP.

Swift's outfit for the February 2025 ceremony also proved that exact numbers could be important. As Swift stepped out in a crimson Vivienne Westwood minidress with Lorraine Schwartz drop earrings, each earring featured 12 ruby stones.

During a January 2025 appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, Swift's boyfriend was asked if the new record will have any love songs. (Swift and Kelce have been dating since summer 2023, which inspired TTPD's “The Alchemy” and “So High School.”)

“There might be a few, I don't know,” Kelce teased that January. “There might be a few.”

While the Kansas City Chiefs tight end noted that he couldn't say whether he's “heard any” of the new tracks, he did reveal his excitement.

“I'll never chime in, but I'm here to support it,” Kelce gushed. “I'm here to see where it can go, you know what I mean?”

During an outing with pal Gigi Hadid in September 2024, Swift sported a gold chain necklace with a “12” pendant in the center. While some fans presumed it was an upside-down “TS” for her initials, the overall Swiftie consensus was that it was the double-digit numeral.

Garcelle Beauvais promises to keep shining — even without a Bravo diamond.

Hours before The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills aired its season 14 finale, Garcelle, 58, announced she was leaving the series after five years.

“I've decided to leave Beverly Hills,” she said in a video posted via Instagram on Tuesday, March 25. “It's been a wild ride. I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless.”

While she wants to spend more time with her youngest sons Jaid and Jax, both 17, as they begin their final year of high school, Garcelle also has her hands full with other opportunities.



“I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing and acting in,” she said. “I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon.”

As viewers prepare to say farewell to Garcelle in a shocking three-part reunion special, keep reading to see how the cast is reacting to her exit:

After making their debuts on RHOBH in 2020 during season 10, Sutton, 53, and Garcelle developed a strong friendship that lasted through four seasons.

“Congratulations to your next chapter,” Sutton wrote in the comments section of her costar's announcement post. “Can't wait to see what's up your sleeve. Nothing but greatness. This I know. 😽💗💗💗.”

Although season 14 was her first year working with Garcelle, Jennifer, 66, couldn't hide her sadness that her new friend was leaving the show.

“Oh my God! Garcelle, we will really miss you!” she wrote in the comments section. “You brought so much integrity and warmth and humor to the franchise.”

While appearing on the March 25 episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Boz, 48, alluded to tension between Garcelle and her costars at the RHOBH season 14 reunion.

“I am disappointed that she is departing like this,” she told Andy Cohen. “I wish that she would have stuck around to work [it] out another season.”

During her appearance on WWHL with Boz, Erika, 53, said she wasn't surprised by Garcelle's announcement.

“We've known that she's quit for two weeks. We knew this,” the “Pretty Mess” singer said. “She did not take the cast photo with us [at the reunion], which is a clear indication that, ‘I am leaving.'”

Kathy, 66, seemingly addressed Garcelle's announcement when she shared a fan site's reaction to the news.

Kyle Richards' sister reposted @BravoHousewives' Instagram Story that said, “You'll be missed Garcelle.” For emotional impact, Kathy added Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's “See You Again” song to the background.

After helping launch RHOBH in 2010, Camille, 56, has remained a frequent guest of the show. She expressed support for Garcelle's decision on social media.

“The show will not be the same without you,” she wrote in the comments section. “You are beautiful inside and out. A class act always. You will be missed. Congrats on your new venture! Wishing you so much success.”

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 8 p.m ET. Stream old episodes anytime on Peacock.

Andy Cohen revealed that he spoke to Garcelle Beauvais before she announced her exit from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

“We had a serious conversation before she was on Watch What Happens Live,” Cohen, 56, said during the Wednesday, March 26, episode of SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live. “She had a reunion that you will see play out and I'm not gonna [speak on it], you'll just watch it, but … she ended in a not good place.”

Cohen added that he had been “texting” with Beauvais, 58, and she told him, “I will speak to you in New York.”

“So we got together about an hour before her live show and she and I really hashed things out and she let me into where her head was at,” he admitted. “And there was not only stuff with the show, but .. the kids are entering their senior year.”



Beauvais is mother to son Oliver Saunders, 32, whom she shares with ex Daniel Saunders, and twins Jax and Jaid, 17, whom she welcomed with ex Mike Nilon. Cohen confessed that he had a lot of “respect” for Beauvais being so candid with him.

“It was one of the most real conversations that ended where it ended,” he recalled. “But I would say it ended with her saying, ‘I've got to choose kind of my life.'”

Cohen revealed that while Beauvais has said goodbye for now, the door will always be open for her if she wants to return.

“I was like, ‘Look, call us in a year, by the way, if you feel like it. See where you're at,'” he said.

On Tuesday, March 25, Beauvais announced that she was leaving RHOBH after five years.

“Hey, guys, so I have some news. I've decided to leave Beverly Hills,” she said in a video posted via Instagram. “It's been a wild ride. I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless.”

In her video, Beauvais shared that her family played a role in her decision.

“Their last year of high school is next year, and I want to be a part of that, and Jaid is starting a new career, and I want to be a part of that too,” she continued. “Secondly, I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing and acting in. I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon.”

Beauvais thanked Cohen and Bravo for their support on her decision. She also teased that she “might pop in some time” since Cohen told her she can “come back any time, the door will always be open.”

Getting close to Kailyn Lowry may require some light paperwork.

“I just feel like you don't know until s— hits the fan,” Lowry, 33, said on the Wednesday, March 26, episode of PodcastOne's “Cate & Ty: Break It Down” podcast when explaining why she wants her friends to agree to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). “I'm not saying that I'm innocent. I've definitely had a hand in whatever the fallout was but to go publicly is next level because truly, my personal life is my business, unfortunately.”

According to Lowry, former friends have taken advantage of her fame and have chosen to speak out, threatening the former Teen Mom 2 star's livelihood.

“If you f— with my business, my life, my personal life,” she told cohosts Tyler Baltierra and Catelynn Lowell, “you're actually affecting the way I'm able to provide for my children.”



Baltierra, 33, expressed his shock over the concept, saying he would never make his friends sign an official document that protects confidential information.



A post shared by Cate & Ty: Break It Down (@cateandtybreakitdown)



“If I need an NDA, I don't want you around me,” he said with a laugh. “If the s— hits the fan, we're going to do this all publicly bitch. We'll go all out.”

All jokes aside, Lowry said she does regret that some of her past friendships were so involved in the TV world, thanks in no small part to her years starring in the Teen Mom franchise.

Without naming names, Lawry said fame and money had an impact on the way some of her former friends operated on- and off-camera.

“I do think that it changed the dynamic and the intentions of the people that I was talking to,” the former 16 and Pregnant star shared. “It either didn't start off authentic and genuine or it turned into something where they wanted to have a following. They wanted to get paid.”

In May 2022, Lowry announced she was leaving the Teen Mom franchise after documenting her life for nearly 11 years. She has since launched the KILLR Podcast Network and the Chapter 7 book club.

While she remains grateful to MTV for allowing her to film with her friends when family wasn't always available, Lowry said she learned the hard way that not everyone has good intentions.

“Having my friendships so public has been really rough,” she reflected. “Anyone that has publicly said something about me, you are dead to me and I will never look back.”

Jonah Platt is speaking out in defense of his father!

The 38-year-old actor, older brother to Ben Platt and son of producer Marc Platt, recently reacted to the latest news of his dad flying to New York to talk to Snow White star Rachel Zegler about her social media comment, ""and always remember, free palestine.”

In a reported since deleted comment that is going viral on X/Twitter, Jonah defended his father, saying what he did is ""called adult responsibility and accountability,"" and blasted Rachel's actions, calling her a narcissist. 

Keep reading to find out more...

In a screenshot making its rounds on social media, under a post on Instagram, someone commented to Jonah, saying, ""Your dad flew to NYC to reprimand a young actress? Any words on this? Cuz that's creepy as hell and uncalled for. People have the right to free speech, no? Shame on your father""

Jonah responded, ""You really want to do this? Yeah, my dad, the producer of enormous piece of Disney IP with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, had to leave his family to to fly across the country to reprimand his 20 year old employee for dragging her personal politics into the middle of promoting the movie for which she signed a multi-million dollar contract to get paid and do publicity for.""

""This is called adult responsibility and accountability. And her actions clearly hurt the film's box office,"" he continued. ""Free speech does not mean you're allowed to say whatever you want in your private employment without repercussions. Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation for her own immature desires at the risk of all the colleagues and crew and blue collar workers who depend on that movie to be successful. Narcissism is not something to be coddled or encouraged.""

A recently published article said that Rachel's free Palestine tweet under a post about Snow White ""shocked"" Disney execs, with the company reportedly having to pay for extra security for her co-star Gal Gadot, who has been outspoken in support of Israel, her home country amid the Israel-Palestine conflict. 

The story says Marc flew to NYC to confront Rachel and get her to take down the post, but she refused and the post remains up on her X/Twitter account to this day. 

Earlier this year, Rachel and Marc's son Ben Platt both performed as part of Trisha Payta's Big Broadway Dream show. 

Last year, Rachel joined Ben for a duet during his Palace Theatre concert residency on Broadway.

“We did have a conversation after the podcast and, again, I think if he ever wants to share his side of it and his story then he's more than able to, of course. I think that hearing certain things come from him helped me a lot. I think that, you know, not only did he apologize for things, but he took a lot of things back,"" she said on ""The Squeeze"" podcast.

“Of course, that was really hard to hear and it was really sad and it hurts — I don't know. Sometimes I tell myself it was so nice to hear the things I had been wanting to hear for weeks and I finally got that apology and that closure and that honesty that I needed from him. But it still didn't change anything for me. It still happened. He still did what he did and we still had to navigate everything after that,"" she added.

If you didn't see the news, the Trump administration allegedly included a journalist, The Atlantic‘s editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg, in a group chat regarding the United States' plans to bomb Houthi targets across Yemen on March 15. 

Initially, Jeffrey released a handful of alleged texts that did not include any of the ""attack plans."" Now, they have released the alleged texts that seem to include minute by minute plans of what was reportedly to come.

Keep reading to find out more...

Newest Released Texts From March 15 (the day of the attack), per The Atlantic. These are all alleged: 

United States Secretary of Defense/former Fox News Host Pete Hegseth: “TEAM UPDATE: TIME NOW (1144et): Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch.” The Atlantic notes that ""CENTCOM"" stands for ""Central Command,"" which is ""the military's combatant command for the Middle East.""

Hegseth's texts continued: “1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)"" and ""1345: ‘Trigger Based' F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME – also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s),” “1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package),” “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based' targets),” “1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts – also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched,"" “MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)”

And he allegedly also said, “We are currently clean on OPSEC [operational security]” and ""Godspeed to our Warriors.”

Vice President J. D. Vance allegedly responded, “I will say a prayer for victory.”

National Security Adviser Michael Waltz shared that they'd done an ""amazing job,"" which led to a flurry of alleged responses.

John Ratcliffe: ""A good start.""

Waltz: [These are all emojis] fist emoji, American flag emoji and fire emoji.

MAR: ""Good Job Pete and your team!!""

Susie Wiles: ""Kudos to all – most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.""

Steve Witkoff: Posted two hands praying, one flexed bicep and two American flag emojis.

TG: ""Great work and effects!""

Previously released alleged texts, per The Atlantic: 

Friday, March 14

Michael Waltz: ""Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.

""State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS [chief of staff], OVP [office of vice president] and POTUS [president of the United States]are briefed.""

JD Vance: ""Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.

""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.""

Joe Kent: ""There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We'll have the exact same options in a month.

Pete Hegseth: ""VP: I understand your concerns – and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what – nobody knows who the Houthis are – which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.

""Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first – or Gaza cease fire falls apart – and we don't get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC [operations security]. I welcome other thoughts.""

Michael Waltz: ""Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president's request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.""

JD Vance: ""If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.

""Let's just make sure our messaging is tight here. And if there are things we can do upfront to minimize risk to Saudi oil facilities we should do it.

Hegseth: ""VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.""

SM [Stephen Miller]: ""As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn't remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.""

Pete Hegseth: ""Agree.""
