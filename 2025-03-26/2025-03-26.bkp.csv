White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is answering questions about the Signal group chat leak at the daily briefing, which you can watch live at the top of this page

Leavitt slams Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg who was apparently inadvertently added to the chat as an ""anti-Trump hater"" 

She also repeats there was no classified information in the leaked Signal group chat messages 

Messages from the group chat newly published by the Atlantic appear to show Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing information about US air strikes on Yemen earlier this month

One message from Hegseth says, in part, ""Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch"" and ""14:15: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP""

Earlier, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told a House committee that adding a journalist to a high-level chat about air strike plans was ""a mistake""

As expected, Leavitt is being pressed by reporters about the White House's description of the Signal group chat conversation. 

One reporter notes that the text messaging thread detailed the exact time of the planned attacks before they occurred as well as some of the military assets that were to be used. 

He asks Leavitt, what would you call this discussion if not war plans? 

Leavitt responds that the texts contained ""sensitive policy discussions"", but she adds, that the conversation should reassure the American people of Trump's ""dynamic"" military and intelligence team. 

Leavitt again states that ""no war plans"" were discussed, and that ""no classified materials"" were sent in the group chat.

Leavitt has finished her opening remarks and is now taking questions from reporters, including one who asks how ""comfortable"" President Trump was with the conversations shared on the Signal messaging thread by some of his top officials.

Leavitt says Trump's response to the situation has remained the same. She says he himself has wanted to address the scandal. 

Leavitt says Trump told her he will ""tackle this story"". 

Leavitt also says that Signal is an ""approved app"" that the Department of Defense and CIA have loaded onto government phones because it is ""secure"". 

After a lengthy criticism of the journalist who was inadvertently invited to a group chat with top US officials on Signal, Leavitt then pivots to attacking former President Joe Biden.

She claims the reason why Trump approved attacks on Houthis in Yemen in the first place was ""because of Joe Biden's incompetence and pathetic weakness on the world stage"".  

Leavitt says the Houthis grew emboldened ""immediately"" after Biden took office in 2021. 

""President Trump's strength and resolve eliminated those terrorists,"" Leavitt says.

In keeping with what has become standard practice, today's briefing begins with Karoline Leavitt touting what the administration sees as its most notable achievements of the last several days. 

She then quickly pivots to attacking the media for coverage of ""Signalgate"". 

""There were certainly no war plans discussed,"" Leavitt says, echoing a talking point she shared on social media earlier. 

She directly attacks The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg as an ""anti-Trump hater"" and registered Democrat. She also criticises his career as a reporter, including during the Iraq War and the 2016 electoral campaign. 

""The real story here is the overwhelming success of decisive military action against Houthi terrorists,"" Leavitt continues.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has a briefing planned to begin shortly.

Reporters are filing into the room. 

Those without assigned seats are crowding the aisles, jostling for spaces they believe will give them a higher chance of being called on. 

Briefings are relatively infrequent in Trump's administration so far, with only one or two happening each week. 

They are often crowded - but today promises to be particularly well-attended by the US and global media that covers Washington as the Signal group chat story continues to develop. 

Without even the slightest exaggeration, I've not heard anything else being discussed among reporters since I arrived here several hours ago. 

You can watch the briefing by clicking ""watch live"" at the top of this window.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

I've been exchanging messages with Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East and a retired CIA paramilitary officer, who since yesterday has been expressing concern with how the information in the Signal chat was being handled.

Of particular concern, Mulroy tells me, are the messages which depict a ""real time order of battle sequence of an ongoing operation"". 

""It is highly classified and protected,"" he says. ""Disclosure would compromise the operation and put lives at risk. Next to nuclear and covert operations, this information is the most protected."" 

Mulroy also pushed back on the assertion, from White House officials, that the contents of the group chat do not constitute ""war plans"". 

The primary difference between ""war"" and ""attack"" plans - which are both sensitive and classified - is one of scale. 

""War plans are generally the plan to conduct an entire conflict,"" he adds. ""Attack plans stem from that and go down to the individual unit level and are very detailed."" 

""One could actually make the argument that attack plans are more sensitive, because they are more detailed and specific on time, place and manner.""

In one part of the newly published Signal chat, CIA Director John Ratcliffe notes that the US is ""mobilising assets"" to help a strike, but that a delay would ""not negatively impact"" the agency's work in Yemen.

Ratcliffe has said there was no classified information discussed in the chat. 

The House Intelligence Committee has just wrapped up the public part of its session - it's now moving to closed questioning of the intelligence chiefs to talk about more secretive information that won't be broadcast. Here's what we learned:

Whether or not the information US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared is classified is at the core of Signal-gate. 

Here are some of the details of the mission he wrote to officials - and a reporter who was inadvertently added to the Signal group chat, according to Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg: 

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has hit back after the Atlantic, external published new details from the Signal group chat on a Yemen attack that its editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to, doubling down that there was ""no classified information"" in the message thread.

""The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods,"" he said in a post on X.

""This only proves one thing: Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an 'attack plan' (as he now calls it). Not even close.

""We will continue to do our job, while the media does what it does best: peddle hoaxes,"" he adds.

Hegseth's posts in the chat as released by the Atlantic include details about how the attacks would be carried out, their timing and military hardware that would be used. 

There's a heated exchange between Democrat Jimmy Gomez and CIA Director John Ratcliffe over the disclosures by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Signal thread, which included military plans. 

Gomez asks both Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard: ""Do you know whether Pete Hegesth had been drinking before he leaked classified information?""

Media reports about Hegseth's alcohol use dogged his confirmation hearings before he was eventually approved to his post. 

Gabbard says she has no knowledge of Hegseth's ""personal habits"", while Ratcliffe takes issue with the question, calling it an ""offensive line of questioning"".

Both Gomez and Ratcliffe talk over one another, with Gomez defending himself and Ratcliffe saying the lawmaker doesn't want to ""focus on the good work that the CIA is doing"".

Gomez say he has a ""huge respect"" for the CIA, but Americans need to know whether the defence secretary's ""performance is compromised"".

Back on Capitol Hill as the House hearing continues with intelligence officials, Democrat Chrissy Houlahan says she finds it ""offensive for [CIA Director John Ratcliffe] to accuse me as a Democrat of not caring about national threats"".

Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, says she ""had wanted to talk about those"" global threats - which was the topic that brought these officials to the hearing - but now ""I don't have time to ask those questions because the threat is in the House"".

""When I served in the military.... if this happened to me I would have walked my resignation"" in straight away, Houlahan says of the leaked military plans. 

She presses Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, on whether she would investigate the leaked military plans. 

""This was a chat among a great variety of people,"" Houlahan argued, saying Gabbard had an ""obligation"" to probe any significant leak. ""Do you not think it's important to do such a thing?"" 

Gabbard pointed to the Defense Department having authority over the classification of the information discussed in the Signal chat and said the National Security Council, not her agency, was examining the leak. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

As the morning in Washington grinds on, the White House's strategy for dealing with the fall-out of what has now been dubbed ""Signal-gate"" is becoming more clear. 

In the hours since the Atlantic published the contents of the messages, various White House officials - including Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Communications Director Steven Cheung and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - have contested that the shared messages constituted a ""war plan"". 

""The Atlantic has conceded: these were not ""war plans"","" Leavitt wrote earlier. ""This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin."" 

The semantics argument is unlikely to hold much weight with national security professionals, who have noted that the messages included specific attack plans and timetables that could have allowed the Houthis to prepare, if the messages had fallen into the wrong hands. 

There is about an hour until today's news briefing is due to begin at the White House, and, for now, it appears as if this argument is likely to form a key part of Leavitt's answers to questions from the news media. 

A lot has happened with this story today, so let's take a look at how we got here. 

We started our coverage this morning US time after the Atlantic, external journalist who was added to a Signal group chat with top US security officials released new details from that message thread on Wednesday.

Some of the new details include specific timings of the airstrikes and, hours before the attack, confirmation from Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth saying: ""We are a GO for mission launch"".

Some of those who were on the Signal message thread are continuing to testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. 

The CIA Director testified the reports from the Atlantic were ""misleading"" and he never transmitted classified information"". Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers there would be an ""in-depth review"" by the National Security Council about the mishap and also denied there was any classified information discussed. 

Democratic lawmakers like Senator Mike Warner have called for the resignation of Hegseth and others involved in the chat. Warner also said that the new information was ""obviously classified"", posing legal risks.

The White House on Wednesday dismissed the Atlantic story as ""another hoax"" and said the details of the chat were not war plans, though Trump did say in an interview today that someone on his team may have ""screwed up"". 

Vice-President JD Vance says that Atlantic journalist ""oversold what he had"".

Soon, we're expecting to hear more from the White House in a news briefing where Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is set to take questions from reporters. 

Ruth ComerfordLive reporter

One of the big questions
in this latest leak of messages from the Atlantic is whether they are classified and whether they ever were.

The White House and members of the group chat, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who laid out the military plans over Signal, have denied the messages are classified. 

But former senior military intelligence expert Philip Ingram said these messages are likely very classified. He says the most recent leak posted by the Atlantic ""falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret"".

There is a huge amount of detail about what is being launched and when, he says. ""You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from.""

""There are likely to be other messages before and after this, and anyone with a bit of military knowledge - well this is plain speak to them.""

Here's what some of the military jargon means.

A ""package"" refers to a set of aircraft that will be carrying different weapon systems and intelligence gathering devices.

A ""trigger"" means the set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before an airstrike or missile is deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up.

We've been talking a lot about Signal, the app that was used to discuss war plans.

It's a free, open-source encrypted messaging app that was launched in 2014.

Conversations within the app are end-to-end encrypted - meaning they can only be read or heard by the recipients.

It is often used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and the ability to send disappearing messages.

Here's more about the app, how it was used here and a look at how secure it truly is. 

Democrat Jason Crow

At the hearing, Democrat Jason Crow is focusing on the security of the Signal app itself.

He asks National Security Agency (NSA) Director Timothy Haugh if the agency has recently warned its employees not to use the app, which has been reported in the media. 

Haugh says they have put out advisories related to how the use Signal and other encrypted applications.

Crow asks if that was because there are risks to using the app. ""There are,"" Haugh replies.

Crow also asks Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jeffrey Kruse whether the Department of Defense has also recently issued a warning about the vulnerability of the app.

""That's correct,"" Kruse says.

A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement the additional messages released by the Atlantic on Wednesday contained ""no classified materials or war plans"". 

""The Secretary was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway and had already been briefed through official channels,"" spokesmen Sean Parnell said of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 

""The American people see through the Atlantic's pathetic attempts to distract from President Trump's national security agenda.""

New details from the Signal chat show specific times for airstrikes in Yemen and the types of weapons used. 

Rep Krishnamoorthi had a large poster with the Signal messages displayed at today's hearing

Senior Democrats have been highly critical of the way messages about attacks on the Houthis were shared on Signal and that a journalist was added to the group. 

Some have now gone further, calling for Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation on the grounds that he texted sensitive and classified information on the chat.

At the ongoing House Intelligence Committee hearing, where several members of the Signal group are testifying before lawmakers, Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi says Hegseth ""needs to resign immediately"".

He displayed large print-out screenshots of the messages during the hearing, which he says should have been classified.

Others have piled on with similar thoughts. Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego, who is a former US Marine, said on X that ""the incompetence and cover-up is embarrassing"".

""This could have gotten our men and women killed!"" he wrote. ""Strike times, when planes are taking off, what weapons are being used all shared in unsafe manner.@SecDef, external needs to resign."" 

""I cannot believe Hegseth would recklessly text info that could put a target on our pilots and service members,"" wrote New Jersey Senator Andy Kim on X. ""He needs to resign.""

Arizona's Mark Kelly, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, agreed: “This is what happens when you put unqualified people in important jobs where lives are on the line.”

And Michael Bennet, Colorado senator and another committee member, said National Security Adviser Mike Waltz should also go, adding that their continued denial of wrongdoing was making things worse.

President Donald Trump is so far today continuing his claims that nothing in the encrypted chat that was leaked could have ""compromised"" the attack plans in Yemen, though he did say that a member of his team may have ""screwed up"". 

Speaking over the phone on the conservative Vince Show, Trump said: “There weren't details, and there was nothing in there that compromised and it had no impact on the attack, which was very successful.""

But, he added: “Somebody in my group either screwed up, or it's a bad signal,” he said.

Trump has so far stood by his officials and has claimed the incident has been blown out of proportion.

Watch: What to know about the Spring Statement...in 58 seconds

Edited by Andrew Humphrey and Owen Amos

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has finished a news conference explaining her Spring Statement on the government's plans for the UK economy.

In case you missed it, read a breakdown of the main takeaways from her appearance in Parliament earlier.

Afterwards, she took questions from reporters at Downing Street. Here are the main points:

Fiscal rules are non-negotiable, Chancellor Rachel Reeves says, as she addresses reporters at the news conference in Downing Street.

""People should have no doubt about my commitment and how seriously I take the fiscal rules, as I said today they are non-negotiable,"" the chancellor says.

As a reminder, some people - including some MPs in her own party - say Reeves should loosen her self-imposed rules, in order to give herself room to avoid spending cuts.

Before ending the news conference, Reeves is asked about taxes. The chancellor says she had to ask businesses to pay more in tax back in October, during the Budget, which was necessary to repair public services.

The chancellor goes on to say the previous government did not respect taxpayers' money. She says for ""too long"" people's money that's paid into taxes has not been respected.

The Financial Times now asks Reeves about the possibility of US tariffs and how ""damaging"" a ""full scale global trade war"" would be for the UK. 

The chancellor says the OBR today set out some different scenarios - adding that everyone was ""very pleased"" when the prime minister went to Washington recently for initial meetings. 

Referring to Trump's previous term, Reeves says trade and investment flows between the UK and the US ""increased"". 

""We'll continue to make the case for free and open trade.""

Rachel Reeves is then asked by Bloomberg about IFS comments that the government's headroom is limited, meaning taxes may need to be increased in future - as our business reporter explains. 

Reeves responds that she inherited the lowest headroom a chancellor has ever been faced with. 

She says that she managed to increase this headroom by around 50% in Autumn last year. 

Since then, higher government borrowing costs have eroded much of that progress. But Reeves adds that today she has restored this headroom in full.

The chancellor says this proves people should have no doubt about her commitment to the fiscal rules and the need for stability.

Reeves is asked by a journalist from The Sun if the National Insurance increase (she announced in October) is actually a tax on working people. 

Reeves replies that wages are rising at twice the rate of inflation. The national living wage is going up and inflation is coming down, Reeves says. People are starting to see extra money in their pay packets and living standards are going up, she claims. 

The next question is from the ITV, who asks the chancellor whether her fiscal plans and self-imposed rules are punishing the most vulnerable.

In response, the chancellor says there is ""nothing progressive and nothing Labour"" about losing control of the public finances - which she says is what the previous Tory government did.

Markets impose discipline, Reeves adds, saying it's important to provide an anchor.

Reeves says today the government is spending £105bn per year on debt interest costs - which is more than the government spends on defence, the ministry of justice and the home office combined. 

""This government wants to reduce debt, and reduce the deficit,"" she adds.

The BBC's Economics editor Faisal Islam about the OBR's assessment that many will be pushed into poverty as a result of the welfare cuts. 

Reeves responds that the OBR set out that they haven't accounted for those who currently receive benefits but who will go into work. 

Faisal then asks second question on speculation that the Digital Services Tax could be abolished and could she justify a ""tax giveaway"" for the biggest tech multinationals. 

The chancellor says the Digital Service Tax was supposed to be temporary until there was a global agreement. 

She underlines that the government believes companies should pay tax in the countries they operate - and the views on that ""have not changed"".

Rachel Reeves begins by setting out the government's mission and touts some of its achievements, including increasing breakfast club numbers and raising the minimum wage.

She observes, though, that global instability is hampering growth across the world, and admits that the cost of living crisis is ""still very real"" in the UK. 

In this climate, Reeves notes that the country needs to spend more on defence, and repeats her refrain that Labour is ""going further and faster"" on this. 

The chancellor's statement is only brief, as she reiterates some of the figures behind the government's new measures - such as plans to build 1.5 million new homes - which she set out earlier on today.

We'll bring you key lines from the chancellor's news conference very shortly - stay tuned.

You can follow along by clicking watch live at the top of the page.

Dearbail JordanBusiness reporter

One of the most important points in today's Spring Statement is that the chancellor has restored the government's £9.9bn headroom.

This is basically spare cash the government is forecast to have in its annual budget in five years' time, taking into account its tax and spending plans.

It might sound like a lot but, as the OBR points out, that £9.9bn buffer is actually ""a very small margin"", especially considering that the official forecaster expects tax revenues and spending to reach £1.5 trillion each over the period to 2029-30. 

The OBR reckons that Reeves has just over a 50% chance of meeting her own borrowing and debt rules by the end of the decade.

Compared to other chancellors since 2010, especially the likes of George Osborne, Reeves' room for manoeuvre is miniscule. 

Just the merest puff of a headwind - such as Donald Trump's tariffs sparking a global trade war or higher borrowing costs - could knock the government's finances off course.

It means attention will now turn to the Budget and whether tax rises are on the horizon.

Kevin PeacheyCost of living correspondent

It appears the chancellor's news conference is slightly delayed - we'll update you as soon as we have a clearer idea on timings.

While we wait, here's a look at how the Spring Statement could affect you:

1. Benefit changes

If you are on benefits, you could be directly affected.

The sweeping changes to the benefits system, first announced a week ago, will see some people lose support from late 2026, although universal credit payments are set to rise.

2. Living standards and household bills

No major government statements come in isolation and increases in water bills, energy prices, council tax and more will kick in on 1 April.

However, overall living standards, measured by real household disposable income, are expected to improve.

Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.

3. Jobs and services cut or created

Jobs could be affected and, for example, any cuts to local government funding could have a direct impact on services. Theoretically, that could lead, for example, to councils considering what to charge for local services.

On the flipside, investment by the government - such as with defence projects - could create new jobs.

We're about to hear from Rachel Reeves for the second time today. 

She's due to address a news conference in Downing Street after her Spring Statement earlier.

When she speaks, we'll bring you all the key lines right here. You can follow along yourself by clicking watch live at the top of the page.

Earlier the chancellor and OBR confirmed the government is on course to have around £10bn worth of headroom - in short, leeway to spend more or cut taxes - by the end of the decade.

Rachel Reeves billed that as a successful outcome of her policies. But Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) - an economics think tank - said it is a ""tiny, tiny"" amount of wiggle room.

He tells the BBC that any small negative change in the economic outlook could ""require some action"" and politicians and analysts alike may ""spend the next six months speculating about tax rises"".

Johnson says there is ""an incredible degree of fiscal fine-tuning going on"" in the chancellor's plans.

He says the government has ""ended up with precisely the same numbers for headroom and borrowing for 2029/30 as they had at the beginning"".

Changes to the economic picture, especially the rising cost of borrowing money, led to the Treasury being forecast to have £14bn less than they had previously expected to have by the general election.

Johnson says the chancellor ""made up every penny to the one decimal place"" in this Spring Statement. 

Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice has been speaking to BBC Radio 5Live outside the Palace of Westminster.

He is strongly critical of the independent OBR, describing their forecast as ""delusional"".

""We can't keep spending more than we're earning,"" he tells Matt Chorley. ""I'm afraid we're heading to a very difficult place, led by the R-word – recession.""

Tice says voters didn't elect the OBR and that Labour shouldn't be relying so much on their advice.

Reacting to the Spring Statement, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch accuses the government of creating economic ""chaos"".

Badenoch says the statement ""was all smoke and mirrors"", and again calls it ""an emergency budget"".

The Tory leader says Reeves needed to deliver it ""because of mess she made at the last budget"", which took place last Autumn.

We can now bring you some reaction from the Liberal Democrats to the chancellor's Spring Statement.

""The slashing of growth is a hammer blow to the Chancellor's economic credibility,"" Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper says.

She adds that the Labour government is ""simply fiddling while Rome burns instead of fixing our trading relationship with Europe"".

Cooper says Reeves must ""immediately launch negotiations for a new UK-EU customs union,"" which she says will ""kickstart growth, boost small businesses, and secure the vital revenue that our public services desperately need"".

We've encountered a whirlwind of figures - and a variety of opinions on those figures - during and after Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement today. 

So here's our political correspondent Henry Zeffman with a tight summary of what it all means:

This video can not be played

Spring Statement: Henry Zeffman explains what Rachel Reeves's statement means

Back at the OBR news conference, committee member Prof David Miles addresses a question about whether tax rises for employers announced by Labour in October - which are due to come into effect on 1 April - have impacted its growth forecast. 

He says the impact of those taxes was taken into account when the OBR produced its last set of forecasts in October. The tax changes are not ""the main factor behind a pretty big downgrade for growth"" this year, he adds.

Miles suggests interest rates in the UK and around the world, coupled with weakening consumer and business confidence, were the driving factors in the more pessimistic outlook for the year ahead.

With that, we're going to turn our attention away from the OBR briefing and return to bringing you more analysis and reaction to the day's events from elsewhere. 

We're peeling away from the OBR news conference now to take a closer look at a bit more from its latest fiscal outlook, which was published as Rachel Reeves finished her Spring Statement in the Commons.

It's given the government a dressing-down for not providing details about plans to cut working-age welfare benefits until ""very late in the process"".

The forecaster also told the government off for ""late notice of changes and incomplete analysis"", which it said ""hampered our ability to reflect these measures
in our forecasts"".

Labour announced last week that it wanted to reduce welfare spending by £5bn. 

However, when the OBR subsequently checked the data behind the planned cuts, it found it fell £1.6bn short of the government's target. Cue much scrabbling around to find additional savings.

The government found them. The OBR now says welfare benefits will be cut by £4.8bn.

Dearbail JordanBusiness reporter

While the OBR no longer expects the economy to grow as quickly this year as they previously thought, things look relatively rosy after that. 

In 2026, the OBR now reckons the economy will expand by 1.9% against its last forecast in October of 1.8%.

For 2027, the OBR forecasts 1.8% growth up from 1.5%, and the following year, it is expected to hit 1.7%, again up from October's outlook of 1.5%.

Those numbers look less optimistic when you consider the historical context: before the global financial crisis in 2008, the average annual growth
rate was 2.7% according to the
IFS.

Over at the OBR press conference, its experts have been reminding the room that the UK economy's ""cruising speed"" used to be around 2.5%. That feels like a long time ago now.

The development of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) in Russia's Arctic territory will be at the center of discussions on Wednesday at the International Arctic Forum. The two-day event is taking place in Murmansk – the world's largest city north of the Arctic Circle and home to a strategic Russian port.

The forum, organized by the Russian government and national nuclear energy giant Rosatom, is a major platform for discussing the development of the Arctic. The region has drawn increasing global attention due to its vast untapped energy and mineral resources, as well as its strategic trade routes. 

Russia has been developing the NSR, a transport corridor that runs through its Arctic and Far East regions and serves as the shortest shipping link between Europe and the Asia-Pacific. The NSR is expected to become a major trade route for goods shipped between the continents and could drastically reduce transportation times compared to traditional pathways through the Suez or Panama canals.

Forum participants will examine plans to modernize and expand the NSR, with a focus on boosting its efficiency and strengthening partnerships between Russia and countries in Southeast Asia and the Persian Gulf. The discussion will also seek ways to keep the route operational year-round, improve logistics along the corridor, and enhance Arctic infrastructure.

The NSR in Russia's exclusive economic zone within Arctic waters has been experiencing an unprecedented surge in development over the past decade. Moscow has extensively modernized the route, with significant investment from India and China, which hold stakes in several Arctic energy projects.

Russian President Vladimir Putin last year outlined the development of the NSR as a strategic priority for the country, pledging to ensure all-year navigation on the Arctic route. He has also invited foreign partners to use the shipping artery.

Freight traffic via the route has been growing steadily. Russian authorities expect annual maritime cargo flows along the NSR to reach 200 million tons by 2030. They plan to boost cargo throughput at northern seaports and to increase the country's Arctic fleet.

The West is continuing to “cause damage to humanity” through neocolonial practices, including looting resources from African countries, Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) Director Sergey Naryshkin has said. He cited France as an example, accusing Paris of importing uranium from its former colony, Niger, at extremely low prices for six decades. 

Naryshkin made the remarks during a roundtable discussion on the history of the fight against colonialism, organized by the Russian Historical Society (RHS) in Moscow on Tuesday.

“It is enough to recall, for example, how France purchased uranium from Niger for 60 years at a humiliatingly low price – 80 cents per kilogram,” he said.

“But as soon as the French military contingent was withdrawn from this country last year, the price of uranium was raised by the new government to the market price – more than 200 times,” Naryshkin, who is also the chairman of the RHS, added.

Niger's new leadership, which took power following a coup in July 2023, has taken several measures to cut ties with France. Last year, the military government revoked a license that had allowed French state-owned company Orano to operate one of the world's largest uranium mines in the West African country – the world's seventh-largest uranium producer. The miner had been operating in Niger since 1971.

Niamey also followed in the footsteps of allies in neighboring Burkina Faso and Mali by expelling French military forces, accusing Paris of aggression and meddling in the affairs of their nations. France's military presence in Africa has been controversial for decades, with critics arguing that it perpetuates neocolonial dynamics. Leaders in countries that have severed defense ties with Paris insist that the presence of French forces has been ineffective, prompting them to seek alternative alliances, including with Moscow.

Russian officials have been vocal about condemning neocolonialism. In a speech at a G20 meeting in South Africa last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western powers of exploiting natural resources from developing countries at low costs, imposing “pseudo-ecological taxes” on their products, and attempting to block cooperation between Africa, Asia, and Latin America with Russia and China.

On Tuesday, Naryshkin condemned European powers such as Britain, Belgium, and France for their “cruelty and unrestrained exploitation of the population in Africa, India, and Southeast Asia” during the colonial era.

“It is necessary to put up a reliable legal barrier to new attempts to revive the system of colonialism, and ideally, even to seek fair compensation for damages,” the SVR director said, adding that Russia is “at the forefront of the struggle for a more just world order.”

He is a postgraduate of the University of Delhi and the Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University), Russian Federation. He is currently pursuing PhD; his area of expertise is the Russian-Ukrainian Conflict and the Multipolar World Order.

At a time when global governance is fraying and multilateralism teeters on the edge, the 2024 Raisina Dialogue, India's flagship geopolitical platform, offered a rare window into the world's evolving geopolitical imagination – connecting North and South, West and East, somewhat unimaginable these days.

Speaking to a packed hall, Samir Saran, President of the Observer Research Foundation which annually hosts the Raisina Dialogue, set the tone with a sharp observation: “The creators of multilateralism have given up on multilateralism.” 

Co-hosted by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the Dialogue showcased India's balancing act – between East and West, power and principle – while reflecting deep anxieties over global disorder. The invitees to the conference represent a good litmus test of the health of India's bilateral engagements with the world.  

Americans were represented by a large delegation of foreign policy pundits and business leaders, with Tulsi Gabbard, US director of National Intelligence, providing a keynote address. 

A separate QUAD panel was hosted too, signifying Indian appetite towards the multilateral concept in the face of disruptive Indo-Pacific geopolitics. There were no representatives from the Mohammad Yunis-led Bangladesh, interestingly, while a Chinese professor from Fudan University was invited, signifying the thawing of Indo-Chinese relations for the time being.

The invitation to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrey Sibiga was artfully balanced by an invitation to Vyacheslav Nikonov, a prominent member of Russia's State Duma and the grandson of Vyacheslav Molotov, among other Russian experts.

Other prominent mentions include Slovenia, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Latvia, Moldova, Georgia, Sweden, Slovak Republic, Bhutan, Maldives, Norway, Thailand, Antigua and Barbuda, Peru, Ghana, Hungary, Mauritius and Philippines. The sessions represented a marked diversity, with due considerations given to the Global South throughout.

It wasn't unusual to witness panelists hailing from three or more different continents in each session, replicating the multilateral cross-cultural deliberations even as the latter disappear from fracturing global institutional frameworks.

During the course of the forum, the United Kingdom wielded a noticeably softer stance on the Ukraine conflict, with National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell obliquely referencing it without explicitly naming Russia. Contrastingly, the 2024 edition of the Raisina Dialogue saw the former European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson give a strongly worded speech criticizing Russia and its ‘colonial war' against Ukraine.

Whether the change in stance is due to Europe's new-found crisis of security or a realisation of the limits of Western power is far from certain. 

The UK NSA mentioned with satisfaction that Britian has been invited back into European security discussions almost a decade after Brexit, symbolising the return of “British relevance” to European geopolitics. Other commentators may argue that increasing British relevance at a time of growing European irrelevance and crisis of confidence doesn't make a robust case for Britain's rise. In fact, as the Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Tanja Fajon opined, even smaller states like Slovenia are pivoting towards strengthening relations with Eastern and South East Asian states since the contemporary disorder is governed by “not power of the rules but the rules of the power.” 

Pre-pandemic notions of reducing supplier base through outsourcing have being replaced by a diversification of supplier chains, if not by indigenisation. Such a move has placed increased stress on the robustness of multilateral cooperative mechanisms such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty, which has, despite some exceptions, successfully prevented global nuclear proliferation.

Consequently, some scholars like Dr. Happymon Jacob argue that a facade of rules-based order is better than no order. Despite rampant hypocrisy amongst rule-makers, it provides relative benchmarks and course-corrective measurements, which are absent when the world is adrift on an unordered international system. 

As Fajon commented, there is a need to develop trust within an increasingly sceptical and suspicious international system. A similar concern was raised by Russian President Vladimir Putin at a plenary session hosted by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs where he remarked that trust is difficult to foster in an environment of contradictions and violations to the rules-based order.

The accelerating drift towards regional orders amidst a global power vacuum complicates concerted state efforts to predict shifting global trends. Disparate and contradictory mega-trends are increasingly shaped by pivotal spaces where geopolitics converge. 

The point was driven home by an Arab state facilitating peace negotiations between two European powers, an event unimaginable three decades ago. Ashok Malik summed up the global drift by stating, “In 2023 Europeans were berating the Global South for not upholding European values in Ukraine. In 2024 the Global South was berating Europe for not upholding European values in Gaza. In 2025 the US Vice President was berating Europe for not upholding European values in Europe.”

Today we witness a recalcitrant America courting transactionalism, a recessionist Europe feigning to be a great power, a resurgent Russia balancing unchecked Western expansionism, a revisionist China vying for its ‘place in the sun' and a rising India which comprehends “all three sides of a bipolar debate.”

The “weaponisation of everything” as pointed out by Jaishankar, is a trend which will not subside in the near future. Pierroberto Folgiero, CEO of Italian shipbuilding giant Fincantieri subsequently argued how the geopolitics of shipbuilding is emerging as a key strategic pillar of the maritime economy.

Today, shipbuilding in terms of tonnage is largely concentrated between South Korea and China, since the West abandoned it two decades ago. Beijing crystallizes shipbuilding expertise, logistics handling and owning port infrastructure as key focal points within its long-term strategic maritime economy. Despite current trends, an Emirati panellist sensibly argued that pursuing sovereignty shouldn't be outright viewed as declaring isolationism, threading a fine line within a saturated global dichotomous discourse of globalisation versus nationalism. 

Moving Forward, inter- and intra-state conflicts are likely to increase in face of global institutional paralysis and American recessionary motives. In this context, diplomacy takes on a renewed urgency – even as it risks becoming a rarity in conflict-ridden international arenas.

As states find themselves in a post-truth and post-rules world, governments are facing the dangerous triad of AI weaponisation, nuclear proliferation and ultranationalism. In such a volatile environment, it is imperative to establish guardrails that can prevent unnecessary escalations. Without them, we risk repeating the mistakes of a previous generation – one that too hastily declared ‘peace for our time.'

With Taiwan's South African office having been recently downgraded from Taipei Liaison Office (TLO) to Taipei Commercial Office (TCO), the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has revealed that while the impending relocation of the Taiwan office has been set in stone, Taipei has indicated that this might take longer than expected due to budgetary constraints.

The South African government had initially ordered Taiwan to move its Pretoria office to Johannesburg in October 2024, but talks between the countries resulted in a new date of end of March being set.

However, with just under a week to go before the deadline, this might not happen as Taiwan and the South African government are still engaged in a possible change of date due to financial implications associated with this relocation.

DIRCO spokesperson Chrispin Phiri has indicated that due to the shift in relations between the two countries since the advent of democracy, this name change reflects the current government's position on its relations with Taiwan.

”The name change is the accurate representation of the status of their office... The apartheid government maintained close ties with Taiwan, this relationship shifted after the country's democratic transition in 1994. Since joining the UN in 1994, South Africa has aligned with international consensus and adhered to UN Resolutions, including Resolution 2758 (1971), which recognises the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legitimate representative of China.

“In 1997, South Africa severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan and maintained a non-political, non-diplomatic engagement. In 1998, South Africa formalised its diplomatic relations with the PRC and committed to the One China Policy, which asserts that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China,” Phiri stated.

It has been reported that as the deadline looms large over this relocation, Taiwan has formally requested talks to decide on the relocation site, personnel arrangements, and agreement signing details.

”The location of the Taiwan Liaison Office (TLO) is simply a matter of geography and poses no threat to the Republic of South Africa. Our relationship with Taiwan revolves around trade, rather than political or diplomatic concerns. The Taiwanese Authorities have indicated that they cannot adhere to the relocation deadline for various reasons, including budgetary concerns. The discussions are ongoing, and in the interim, South Africa is following domestic processes to undertake administrative adjustments that appropriately reflect the status of Taiwanese representation in South Africa,” Phiri further stated.

DIRCO renamed the “Taipei Liaison Office” to the “Taipei Commercial Office” on its website earlier this month, saying the relocation will not hinder but enhance economic ties between the two nations.

”The relocation of the TLO presents a unique opportunity that promises to enhance economic and trade relations. Johannesburg, a thriving commercial and financial hub, is ideally positioned to foster productive economic collaborations.

”South Africa is committed to strengthening its non-diplomatic ties with the island, focusing on lucrative areas such as trade, investment, and education. This strategic approach will be facilitated through a non-binding Memorandum of Arrangement with the Taipei Authorities,” Phiri added.

The US is considering lifting certain sanctions against Russia in order to advance the Black Sea Grain Initiative, seen as a step towards settling the Ukraine conflict, President Donald Trump has said.

Both the Kremlin and the White House stated on Tuesday that, as part of the agreement, the US “will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”

Moscow's statement further noted that the deal envisages a lifting of restrictions on Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial institutions involved in the international sale of food and fertilizers, as well as a removal of sanctions on its vessels, port services, and ability to purchase agricultural machinery and related goods.

The White House did not provide details, but President Donald Trump confirmed that his administration is indeed considering lifting some of the sanctions against Moscow.

“They will be looking at them, and we're thinking about all of them right now. There are about five or six conditions. We're looking at all of them,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.

Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky lashed out at Washington later in the day, accusing the US of discussing the issue of sanctions with the Russian delegation without properly briefing Kiev on the matter.

“We did not agree to this so that it would be in a joint document. We believe that this is a weakening of positions and a weakening of sanctions,” he claimed.

The US and Russia agreed to revive the defunct Black Sea Grain Initiative following 12 hours of talks focused on the Ukraine conflict which were held on Monday in Saudi Arabia by expert groups from both countries. The agreement, originally brokered in July 2022 by the UN and Türkiye, envisioned the safe passage of Ukrainian agricultural products in exchange for the West lifting sanctions on Russian grain and fertilizer exports.

Moscow eventually refused to extend the deal, citing the West's failure to uphold its obligations. Now, Russia needs ironclad guarantees from the US, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said, arguing that only a “direct order” from Washington could compel Kiev to observe any agreement.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Wednesday that four U.S. soldiers who went missing while training in Lithuania have been killed, but that he did not yet know the details. 

A U.S. official would say only that the four soldiers were involved in a training accident. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not comment on the status of the soldiers. 

Rutte said, during a trip to Warsaw, that his thoughts were with their families and with the United States. 

“The news came out about four American soldiers who were killed in an incident in Lithuania. This is still early news so we do not know the details. This is really terrible news and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones,” Rutte told reporters in Warsaw. 

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Four U.S. Army soldiers have gone missing at a training area outside of Lithuania's capital, and a search is underway, the U.S. military said Wednesday.

A statement from U.S. Army Europe and Africa public affairs in Wiesbaden, Germany said the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time.

It said further information will be provided as new information becomes available.

Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported that four U.S. soldiers and vehicle were reported missing Tuesday afternoon during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Belarus. 




The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all NATO members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. 

Relations soured further over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Ukraine in its fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte appealed for unity on Wednesday as European nations scale up their armed forces and defense industries after the United States warned that Europe must take care of its own security in future.

Trust between the 32 member countries is at a new low. NATO was formed 76 years ago to provide stability in Europe; a guarantee underwritten by the United States. But the Trump administration says America's security priorities now lie in Asia and on its own borders.

“Let me be absolutely clear, this is not the time to go it alone. Not for Europe or North America,” Rutte said in a speech in Warsaw. “The global security challenges are too great for any of us to face on our own.”

Rutte said that “there is no alternative to NATO” even as some allies worry about the U.S. commitment to the organization's central principle that an attack on one ally must be considered an attack on them all, while Washington demands that European countries stop free-riding on its massive military budget.

His warning comes as Europe tries to wean itself off its security dependence on the United States, just as it reduced its reliance on Russian energy after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine three years ago, amid a drive to buy more European military equipment.

“Yes, Europe needs to know that Uncle Sam still has our back, but America also needs to know that its NATO allies will step up and play their full part, without restrictions and without capability gaps,” Rutte said. “It's only fair. Reassurance is a two-way street.”




His comments come on the eve of a visit to Greenland by U.S. Vice President JD Vance. President Donald Trump has not ruled out the use of military force to seize control of Greenland, an autonomous territory belonging to NATO and European Union member Denmark and this has deeply unsettled many allies. 

Still, Rutte said he is “absolutely confident” about the U.S. commitment to NATO's Article 5 security guarantee. He added that “nothing can replace America's nuclear umbrella, the ultimate guarantor of our security.” Britain and France are also nuclear powers but their arsenals are tiny by comparison.

Asked on March 13 whether U.S. forces would defend an ally which came under attack from Russia, Trump said: “We'll make sure it doesn't happen.” Trump also said that “you have to keep NATO strong. You have to keep it relevant.”

Rutte said he believes that when Trump and his NATO counterparts meet for a summit in the Netherlands in June, “we will begin a new chapter for our transatlantic alliance where we build a stronger, fairer and more lethal NATO to face a more dangerous world.”

He said that ambitious new spending targets would be set. Twenty-three NATO member countries are estimated to be meeting the current guideline of more than 2% of their gross domestic product on national defense budgets. Rutte has said that the new target would be “well north of 3%.”

Earlier on Wednesday, at talks with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Rutte warned Russia that the alliance would always stand by Poland or any other member and that its reaction to an attack would be “devastating.”

Tusk said it was important to be prepared for any outcome of talks between Russia and the United States aimed at ending t he 3-year-old war in Ukraine.

NATO members along its eastern flank, particularly Poland and the Baltic states, are extremely worried that the talks could end with a settlement that is favorable to Russia. They fear such an outcome would allow Putin to rebuild his country's forces and threaten other countries in the region in the coming years.

Rutte said that neither Putin nor anyone else should assume they could get away with something like that.

“If anyone were to miscalculate and think they can get away with an attack on Poland or on any other ally, they will be met with the full force of this fierce alliance. Our reaction will be devastating. This has to be very clear to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin and anyone else who wants to attack us,” Rutte said.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved early Wednesday by the news that U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland Friday, reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration's attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

The couple will now visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance's previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.

President Donald Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.

Trump, in an interview Wednesday on “The Vince Show,” repeated his desire for U.S. control of Greenland. Asked if the people there are “eager” to become U.S. citizens, Trump said he didn't know “but I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.”

The vice president's decision to visit a U.S. military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. Yet Vance has also criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S.

During his first term, Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world's largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn't for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump's plans.

Anne Merrild, a Greenlander and an expert on Arctic politics and development, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders. 

Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table.

“It's a signal to the whole world, it's a strong signal to Denmark, it's a signal to Greenland,” she said. “And of course it's also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we're pursuing.” 

Vance is allowed to visit the base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the U.S. regarding the defense of Greenland.

Jacobsen said the timing is controversial, particularly because coalition negotiations are ongoing to form a government after the election earlier this month.

Ahead of the vice president's announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday night that it had “not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.”

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday that the visit was “unacceptable pressure.” 

Peter Viggo Jakobsen, associate professor at the Danish Defense Academy, said the trip's flip-flop continues to cause major confusion on the island. The U.S. has not articulated specific demands from Greenland or Denmark at this point.

 “We have no idea what the end game is,” Jakobsen said.

In Greenland, the political group the most sympathetic to the U.S. president, the Naleraq party that advocates a swift path toward independence, has now been excluded from coalition talks to form the next government. The Trump administration's aspirations for Greenland could backfire and push the more mild parties closer to Denmark.

“But now Trump has scared most Greenlanders away from this idea about a close relationship to the United States because they don't trust him,” Jakobsen added.

One of the biggest remaining hurdles to Greenland's independence is diversifying the economy, where fishing accounts for 90% of exports. In the meantime, Greenland receives an annual block grant from Denmark of around 3.5 billion kronen ($506 million), which is more than half the public budget, to cover the island's Nordic-style social programs, including free health care.

It's therefore better for Greenland, strategically, to threaten Denmark with independence and a referendum than actually do it, Jakobsen said. As long as the threat is there, Greenland can push for more concessions and more money from Denmark. 

If the island pins all its hopes on the U.S., Greenlanders have no guarantee they will be better off or have any power in a future relationship with America, he said.

“In that sense, Trump is the Danish realm's best friend at the moment,” Jakobsen added.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a tentative U.S-brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges to negotiating a broader peace in the war in Ukraine. 

Russia's Defense Ministry alleged that Ukrainian drone attacks hit an electric facility in the Bryansk region early Wednesday and a power grid facility in the Kursk region on Tuesday, leading to a power cut affecting thousands of people.

“The Kyiv regime is doing everything to derail the Russian-U.S. agreements on the gradual settlement of the Ukrainian conflict,” the ministry said Wednesday.

Ukraine's General Staff denied the allegations, saying in a statement Wednesday that Russia's claims were part of a broader disinformation campaign aimed at justifying continued hostilities.

The accusations came hours after Washington announced Tuesday that it had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine and Russia to implement a pause on attacks on energy sites as well as taking steps to ensure safe navigation for ships in the Black Sea. The deal followed three days of separate U.S-Ukrainian and U.S.-Russian talks in the Saudi capital. 

Those talks were part of efforts by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to implement a limited, 30-day ceasefire that Moscow and Kyiv agreed to in principle last week. That has thus far failed to materialize as both sides continue to launch drone and rocket attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday Ukraine had agreed with U.S. negotiators in Riyadh “that a ceasefire for energy infrastructure can start today,” and expressed his country's willingness to comply with the agreement while warning Russia would face “strong retaliation” if it attacked Ukrainian energy facilities. 




Ukrainian officials have contested claims by the Kremlin that Russian forces have not attacked energy sites in Ukraine since March 18. In a post on X on Tuesday, Zelenskyy's communications adviser Dmytro Lytvyn said Moscow was “lying” about observing a ceasefire on energy infrastructure.

“They've been hitting our energy sites with bombs, attack drones, and FPV drones. We're not going into all the details, but there have already been eight confirmed hits on energy facilities,” Lytvyn wrote. “Every night our air defense forces shoot down nearly a hundred attack drones – and many of those drones were likely targeting other energy facilities.” 

On Tuesday, the White House said in separate statements that the sides had “agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”

Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey but halted by Russia the next year.

After the White House issued its statement Tuesday, the Kremlin warned that a potential Black Sea deal could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial organizations involved in food and fertilizer trade are lifted and their access to the SWIFT system of international payments is ensured.

Zelenskyy described the demands as an example of Moscow “manipulating, twisting agreements, and lying” about the terms of the agreement. 

“There are absolutely clear statements that have been published by the White House, everyone can see what is stated there,” Zelenskyy said. “And there is something that the Kremlin is lying about again: that supposedly the (ceasefire) in the Black Sea depends on the issue of sanctions.”

In an apparent reference to Moscow's demands, the White House said Tuesday the U.S. “will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”

When asked about when Washington might help Moscow achieve those ambitions, Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Wednesday that contacts between Russia and the U.S. “continue quite intensively,” and that authorities are “satisfied with how pragmatic, constructive and productive our dialogue is.”

Peskov said the 2022 Black Sea Grain initiative could be revived if Russia's demands regarding agricultural and fertilizer exports are met. He said that those are the same demands that Russia initially put forward in the grain deal and that weren't being fulfilled.

Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy's hometown, came under the “most massive kamikaze drone attack since the beginning of the war” on Tuesday night, the city administration head, Oleksandr Vilkul, wrote on Telegram.

Although no one was killed or injured, civilian infrastructure including warehouses, an administration building and a fire station was widely targeted, Vikul said. Multiple fires were sparked across the city, he said. 

“Everyone is alive, thank God. It's truly a miracle. The destruction is significant,” Vilkul said. 

Civilian infrastructure also came under strike in the Sumy, Cherkasy, and Kirovohrad regions, local authorities said. There were no immediate reports on any injuries.

Overall, Russian forces launched 117 Shahed and decoy drones overnight, Ukraine's air force said Wednesday morning, adding that 56 drones were destroyed and 48 more jammed by the defense forces.

Palestinians chanted against Hamas during an anti-war protest in northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday, videos showed. Wednesday's protest comes after similar ones the day before, marking a rare show of public anger against the militant group that has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory 17 months into the war with Israel.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said Wednesday the bodies of 39 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 124 wounded, the ministry said in its daily report.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that if Hamas doesn't release the hostages held in Gaza, pressure will increase, and may include “seizing territory,” on the Strip.

CAIRO (AP) — Thousands of Palestinians marched between the wreckage of a heavily destroyed town in northern Gaza on Wednesday in the second day of anti-war protests, with many chanting against Hamas in a rare display of public anger against the militant group.

The protests, which centered mainly on Gaza's north, appeared to be aimed generally against the war, with protesters calling for an end to 17 months of deadly fighting with Israel that has made life in Gaza insufferable. 

But the public calls against Hamas, which has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory months into the war with Israel, were rare.

In the town of Beit Lahiya, where a similar protest took place Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated, with many chanting “the people want the fall of Hamas.” In the hard-hit Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted “Out, out out! Hamas get out!” 

“Our children have been killed. Our houses have been destroyed,” said Abed Radwan, who said he joined the protest in Beit Lahiya “against the war, against Hamas, and the (Palestinian political) factions, against Israel and against the world's silence.”

Ammar Hassan, who took part in a protest Tuesday, said it started as an anti-war protest with a few dozen people but swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.

“It's the only party we can affect,” he said by phone. “Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but it can affect Hamas.”




The militant group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed its war against it.

Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim, in a post on Facebook, wrote that people had the right to protest but that their focus should be on the “criminal aggressor,” Israel.

Family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's renewed offensive and its tightened blockade on all supplies into Gaza. Their statement said the community fully supports armed resistance against Israel.

“The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,” said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father of three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined a demonstration Tuesday.

“We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,” he said.

A similar protest occurred in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to witnesses.

One protester in Jabaliya, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they joined the demonstration because “everyone failed us.”

They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the Western-backed Palestinian Authority and Arab mediators. They said there were no Hamas security forces at the protest but scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the group.

Later, they said they regretted participating because of Israeli media coverage, which emphasized the opposition to Hamas. 

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz urged Palestinians to join the protests.

“You too should demand the removal of Hamas from Gaza and the immediate release of all Israeli hostages. That is the only way to stop the war,” he said.

A 19-year-old Palestinian, who also spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said he planned to join demonstrations on Wednesday. His mother has cancer and his 10-year-old brother is hospitalized with cerebral palsy, and he said the family has been displaced multiple times since their home was destroyed.

“People are angry at the whole world,” including the United States, Israel and Hamas, he said. “We want Hamas to resolve this situation, return the hostages and end this whole thing.”

The protests erupted a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.

Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

The war was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have caused vast destruction and at their height displaced some 90% of Gaza's population.

Hamas won a landslide victory in the last Palestinian elections, held in 2006. It seized power in Gaza from the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, dominated by the secular Fatah movement, the following year after months of factional unrest and a week of heavy street battles.

Rights groups say both the Palestinian Authority and Hamas violently suppress dissent, quashing protests in the areas they control and jailing and torturing critics.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Under pressure from Israel's top court to improve conditions at a facility notorious for mistreating Palestinians seized in Gaza, the military transferred hundreds of detainees to newly opened camps.



But abuses at these camps were just as bad, according to Israeli human rights organizations that interviewed dozens of current and former detainees and are now asking the same court to force the military to fix the problem once and for all.



What the detainees' testimonies show, rights groups say, is that instead of correcting alleged abuses against Palestinians held without charge or trial — including beatings, excessive handcuffing, and poor diet and health care -- Israel's military just shifted where they take place.

“What we've seen is the erosion of the basic standards for humane detention,” said Jessica Montell, the director of Hamoked, one of the rights groups petitioning the Israeli government.



Asked for a response, the military said it complies with international law and “completely rejects allegations regarding the systematic abuse of detainees.”



The sprawling Ofer Camp and the smaller Anatot Camp, both built in the West Bank, were supposed to resolve problems rights groups documented at a detention center in the Negev desert called Sde Teiman. That site was intended to temporarily hold and treat militants captured during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. But it morphed into a long-term detention center infamous for brutalizing Palestinians rounded up in Gaza, often without being charged. 



Detainees transferred to Ofer and Anatot say conditions there were no better, according to more than 30 who were interviewed by lawyers for Hamoked and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel. The Associated Press is the first international news organization to report on the affidavits from PHRI.






“They would punish you for anything” said Khaled Alserr, 32, a surgeon from Gaza who spent months at Ofer Camp and agreed to speak about his experiences. He was released after six months without charge. 



Alserr said he lost count of the beatings he endured from soldiers after being rounded up in March of last year during a raid at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. “You'd be punished for making eye contact, for asking for medicine, for looking up towards the sky,” said Alserr.

Other detainees' accounts to the rights groups remain anonymous. Their accounts could not be independently confirmed, but their testimonies – given separately – were similar.



The Supreme Court has given the military until the end of March to respond to the alleged abuses at Ofer.







Since the war began, Israel has seized thousands in Gaza that it suspects of links to Hamas. Thousands have also been released, often after months of detention. 



Hundreds of detainees were freed during the ceasefire that began in January. But with ground operations recently restarted in Gaza, arrests continue. The military won't say how many detainees it holds.



After Israel's Supreme Court ordered better treatment at Sde Teiman, the military said in June it was transferring hundreds of detainees, including 500 sent to Ofer.



Ofer was built on an empty lot next to a civilian prison of the same name. Satellite photos from January show a paved, walled compound, with 24 mobile homes that serve as cells.

Anatot, built on a military base in a Jewish settlement, has two barracks, each with room for about 50 people, according to Hamoked.



Under wartime Israeli law, the military can hold Palestinians from Gaza for 45 days without access to the outside world. In practice, many go far longer.



Whenever detainees met with Hamoked lawyers, they were “dragged violently” into a cell — sometimes barefoot and often blindfolded, and their hands and feet remained shackled throughout the meetings, the rights group said in a letter to the military's advocate general.



“I don't know where I am,” one detainee told a lawyer.



Newly freed Israeli hostages have spoken out about their own harsh conditions in Gaza. Eli Sharabi, who emerged gaunt after 15 months of captivity, told Israel's Channel 12 news that his captors said hostages' conditions were influenced by Israel's treatment of Palestinian prisoners. 











Alserr said he was kept with 21 others from Gaza in a 40-square-meter cell with eight bunk beds. Some slept on the floor on camping mattresses soldiers had punctured so they couldn't inflate, he said. Scabies and lice were rampant. He said he was only allowed outside his cell once a week.



Detainees from Ofer and Anatot said they were regularly beaten with fists and batons. Some said they were kept in handcuffs for months, including while they slept and ate — and unshackled only when allowed to shower once a week. 



Three prisoners held in Anatot told the lawyers that they were blindfolded constantly. One Anatot detainee said that soldiers woke them every hour during the night and made them stand for a half-hour.



The military told AP it was unaware of claims that soldiers woke detainees up. It said detainees have regular shower access and are allowed daily yard time. It said occasional overcrowding meant some detainees were forced to sleep on “mattresses on the floor.”



The military said it closed Anatot in early February because it was no longer needed for “short-term incarceration” when other facilities were full. Sde Teiman, which has been upgraded, is still in use.

Alserr said the worst thing about Ofer was medical care. He said guards refused to give him antacids for a chronic ulcer. After 40 days, he felt a rupture. In the truck heading to the hospital, soldiers tied a bag around his head.



“They beat me all the way to the hospital,” he said. “At the hospital they refused to remove the bag, even when they were treating me.”



The military said all detainees are checked and receive proper medical care. It said “prolonged restraint during detention” was only used in exceptional cases and taking into account the condition of each detainee. 



Many detainees complained of hunger. They said they received three meals a day of a few slices of white bread with a cucumber or tomato, and sometimes some chocolate or custard.



That amounts to about 1,000 calories a day, or half what is necessary, said Lihi Joffe, an Israeli pediatric dietician who read some of the Ofer testimonies and reviewed them for PHRI and called the diet “not humane.” 



After rights groups complained in November, Joffe said she saw new menus at Ofer with greater variety, including potatoes and falafel — an improvement, she said, but still not enough.



The military said a nutritionist approves detainees' meals, and that they always have access to water.







Two months into his detention, Alserr had a 5-minute videoconference with a judge, who said he would stay in prison for the foreseeable future.



Such hearings are “systematically” brief, according to Nadia Daqqa, a Hamoked attorney. No lawyers are present and detainees are not allowed to talk, she said.



Several months later, Alserr was allowed to meet with a lawyer. But he said he was forced to kneel in the sun for hours beforehand.



Another detainee told the lawyer from Physicians for Human Rights that he underwent the same punishment. ”All the time, he has been threatening to take his own life,” the lawyer wrote in notes affixed to the affidavit. 



Since his release in September, Alserr has returned to work at the hospital in Gaza.



The memories are still painful, but caring for patients again helps, he said. “I'm starting to forget ... to feel myself again as a human being.”

Serbia's populist government is facing increased public scrutiny over reports that it used a sonic weapon against a peaceful crowd during a massive anti-corruption rally in the capital, Belgrade, on March 15.

BELGRADE, Serbia (AP) — Ivana Ilic Sunderic had never heard anything quite so alarming and disturbing at a protest as the sound that broke a commemorative silence during a huge anti-government rally in Serbia's capital, Belgrade.

“It was quiet and peaceful and then we heard something we could not see … like a sound rolling toward us, a whiz,” Ilic Sunderic said about the March 15 incident. “People started rushing for safety toward the pavement, feeling that something was moving toward us down the street.”

It was “a subdued sound lasting only 2-3 seconds but very unusual and very frightening, like a sound from hell,” she said.

Ilic Sunderic was not alone in describing the panic. Hundreds of others have offered similar accounts, triggering accusations that the police, military or security services under the tight control of authoritarian Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic used an acoustic crowd control weapon to target peaceful protesters.

The weapons, which are illegal in Serbia, emit sound waves which can trigger sharp ear pain, disorientation, eardrum ruptures or even irreversible hearing damage. 

The incident piled more pressure on Vucic, who has been rattled by nearly five months of anti-corruption protests over the collapse in November of a concrete canopy at a railway station in the northern town of Novi Sad that killed 16 people.

Serbia's officials have issued often contradictory denials that an acoustic weapon was directed at the demonstrators. Calls have been mounting for answers as to what caused the sudden commotion, if not a sonic device. 




An Associated Press video shows thousands of protesters holding up their lit mobile phones in silence when they suddenly start running away in panic. A swooshing sound can then be heard.

“I have been going to protests for 30 years but I've never heard anything like this,” Ilic Sunderic said.

A defiant Vucic has rejected what he called “lies and fabrications” that the security services targeted the demonstrators with a sonic device. He said that such accusations are part of an alleged Western-orchestrated ploy to topple him.

“If there was a single piece of evidence that a sound cannon was used against demonstrators, then I would no longer be president,” he said.

Serbia's police, army and the state security agency, BIA, initially all denied possessing the U.S.-made Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), which is illegal in Serbia and some other countries. When presented with photos of the device mounted on an off-road vehicle and deployed at the rally of hundreds of thousands of protesters, officials admitted possessing a sonic weapon, but insisted it was not used against the protesters.

The photos showed nothing more than “loudspeakers” that also are available on eBay, Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said. The rectangular devices, purchased from a U.S. supplier in 2021, serve to emit warnings to the crowds in case of major trouble, he said.

“Serbian police have never, including March 15, used any illegal or unallowed device that is not envisaged by the law, including the device known as a sound cannon,” Dacic said. “Police only use sound devices for warnings.”

Sonic weapons use sound waves to incapacitate, disorient or harm individuals by harnessing acoustic energy, causing both physical and psychological effects, such as dizziness, disorientation or severe headaches. 

Although often described as non-lethal, their use in military, law enforcement and covert operations has raised serious ethical concerns.

More recently, sonic devices have been used against Somali pirates as well as migrants in Greece and reportedly in Serbia. 

Images from the Belgrade protest show what appears to be an LRAD 450XL.

The California-based manufacturer, Genasys, said on X that “the video and audio evidence we have seen and heard thus far does not support the use of an LRAD during the March 15th incident in Belgrade, Serbia.”

Many who were in the crowd later complained of headaches, confusion, ear pressure or nausea. 

Sasa Cvrkovic, a 23-year-old political science student from Belgrade, described the sound as a “jet that flew past like some kind of wind.” He said that it created panic and a brief stampede: “One young man next to me broke his leg.”

Cvrkovic said he felt nauseous all through the day after the demonstration. Ilic Sunderic said she felt pressure in her head and ears.

Reports also have emerged of pressure on doctors at Serbia's emergency clinics to withhold records of hundreds of people who sought medical help and advice after the rally.

Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare, radar and military communications at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said he reviewed some of the videos from the Belgrade stampede. 

“Extraordinary film of people gathering, protesting in the streets peacefully, the demonstration,” he said in an interview. “And suddenly, an almost kind of biblical passing of a huge number of people in a very panicked rush, very sudden and very panicked movement, and the likes of which I must confess I've never seen before.”

He said it was clear that something caused several hundred people to suddenly panic and move in a very specific way, rushing for cover to the pavement and abandoning the middle of the street. 

“So certainly, the behavior that you see on the film does appear to be consistent with people reacting en masse to something that is making them feel deeply unsettled or deeply uncomfortable,” he said.

Predrag Petrovic, a research manager at the Belgrade Center for Security Policy, a think tank, said, “We can claim with huge probability that some unconventional weapon, some version of a sonic cannon, was used.”

“I have a lot of experience in participating and monitoring street protests and I have never seen a stampede happen in a second and along an almost straight line,” Petrovic said.

In an online petition signed by over half a million people, the Serbian opposition Move-Change movement asked the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for an independent investigation.

Several Serbian rights groups announced Tuesday they have taken the issue to the European Court of Human Rights, saying that they collected more than 4,000 testimonies from people who complained of various physical and psychological problems after the incident on March 15. The court in Strasbourg has given Serbia until the end of the month to respond, the groups said in a joint statement.

Vucic's pro-Russia government, however, invited the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, to investigate. There has been no immediate answer from the American and Russian security agencies.

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's truth commission concluded the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children's backgrounds and origins.

The landmark report released Wednesday followed a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the United States, and Australia, representing the most comprehensive examination yet of South Korea's foreign adoptions, which peaked under a succession of military governments in the 1970s and '80s.

The government-appointed Truth and Reconciliation Commission said it confirmed human rights violations in 56 of the complaints and aims to review the remaining cases before its mandate expires in late May.

However, some adoptees and even a commission investigator criticized the cautiously written report, acknowledging that investigative limitations prevented the commission from more strongly establishing the government's complicity.

That investigator, Sang Hoon Lee, also lamented that the panel on Tuesday deferred assessments of 42 other adoptees' cases, citing a lack of documentation to sufficiently prove their adoptions were problematic. Lee and the commission chairperson, Sun Young Park, did not specify which types of documents were central to the discussions.

However, Lee implied that some members of the commission's decision-making committee were reluctant to recognize cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified — either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them.




Most Korean adoptees were registered by agencies as abandoned orphans, although they frequently had relatives who could be easily identified or found, a practice that often makes their roots difficult or impossible to trace. Government data obtained by The Associated Press shows less than a fifth of 15,000 adoptees who have asked South Korea for help with family searches since 2012 have managed to reunite with relatives.

Lee said the committee's stance reflects a lack of understanding of the systemic problems in adoptions and risks excluding many remaining cases.

“Personally, I find yesterday's decision very regrettable and consider it a half-baked decision,” Lee said. 

After reviewing government and adoption records and interviewing adoptees, birth families, public officials and adoption workers, the commission assessed that South Korean officials saw foreign adoptions as a cheaper alternative to building a social welfare system for needy children.

Through policies and laws that promoted adoption, South Korea's military governments permitted private adoption agencies to exercise extensive guardianship rights over children in their custody and swiftly transfer custody to foreign adopters, resulting in “large-scale overseas placements of children in need of protection,” the commission said.

Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. These practices included bypassing proper consent from biological parents, falsely documenting children with known parents as abandoned orphans, and switching children's identities, according to the commission's report. It cited that the government failed to ensure that agencies properly screened adoptive parents or prevent them from excessively charging foreign adopters, who were often asked to make additional donations beyond the standard fees.

The commission's findings broadly aligned with previous reporting by The AP. The AP investigations, which were also documented by Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea's government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means.

The military governments implemented special laws aimed at promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and granting vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment practices while shipping thousands of children to the West every year. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies.

“The commission determined that the state violated the human rights of adoptees protected under the constitution and international agreements, by neglecting its duty to ensure basic human rights, including inadequate legislation, poor management and oversight, and failures in implementing proper administrative procedures while sending large numbers of children abroad,” the commission said in a statement. It said the government “actively utilized” foreign adoptions, which “required no budget allocation,” rather than strengthening a social safety net for needy children. 

When asked why the commission's report focused on the government's negligence and monitoring failures, rather than highlighting its more direct responsibility for creating a system that put children at risk, Lee acknowledged a need for a deeper investigation into the government's role, citing limitations in the commission's reach. 

A more extensive review of the systemic problems would require a closer look at adoptions to the United States, which by far was the largest recipient of Korean children, Lee said. U.S. adoptees accounted for a smaller number of complaints received by the commission, most of which were filed by adoptees in Europe. 

“Rather than producing a final conclusion, we focused on pointing out the problems the best we could,” Lee said.

The commission recommended the government issue an official apology over the problems it identified and develop plans to address the grievances of adoptees who discovered that the biological origins in their adoption papers were falsified. It also urged the government to investigate citizenship gaps among adoptees sent to the United States and to implement measures to assist those without citizenship, who may number in the thousands.

South Korea's government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues surrounding past adoptions. The Ministry of Health and Welfare, the government department that handles adoption issues, and adoption agencies didn't immediately comment on the commission's report.

During the news conference, Yooree Kim, who was sent at age 11 by an adoption agency to a couple in France without her biological parents' consent, pleaded for the commission to strengthen its recommendations.

She said the government should encourage broader DNA testing for biological families to increase the chances of reunions with adoptees and officially declare an end to foreign adoptions. She said adoptees who fell victim to illicit practices should be entitled to “compensation from the Korean government and adoption agencies, without going through lawsuits.” 

South Korea's practices in the past seven decades formed what's believed to be the world's largest diaspora of adoptees. Recent reforms, including a 2011 law that required foreign adoptions go through family courts, have led to a significant decline, with only 79 cases of South Korean children placed abroad in 2023.

Palestinians chanted against Hamas during an anti-war protest in northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday, videos showed. Wednesday's protest comes after similar ones the day before, marking a rare show of public anger against the militant group that has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory 17 months into the war with Israel.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said Wednesday the bodies of 39 people killed by Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals over the past 24 hours. Hospitals also received 124 wounded, the ministry said in its daily report.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that if Hamas doesn't release the hostages held in Gaza, pressure will increase, and may include “seizing territory,” on the Strip.

The Israeli military on Wednesday ordered the evacuation of parts of Gaza City as it steps up its renewed offensive against Hamas after breaking the ceasefire last week. Israel's bombardments and ground operations have caused vast destruction and at their height displaced some 90% of Gaza's population.

Thousands of Palestinians marched in heavily destroyed northern Gaza on Wednesday in the second day of anti-war protests. It's a rare display of public anger against Hamas, although the protests appeared generally aimed against the war in Gaza and their insufferable living conditions. 

Israel has cut off all food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to war-torn Gaza's roughly 2 million people since the beginning of the month — a strategy that rights groups say is a war crime.

Israel has vowed to increase military pressure until Hamas returns the remaining 59 hostages — 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel also demands Hamas disarm and send its leaders into exile. Hamas says it won't release the remaining hostages without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. 

Here's the latest: 




At least nine Palestinians were killed Wednesday in two separate Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza, medics said.

One strike hit a group of Palestinians gathered outside a charity providing hot meals in the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least five people, including a woman and her adult daughter, were killed in the strike, according to the Awda hospital, which received the casualties.

A separate strike on a tent killed a father, mother and their daughter in the town of Zwaeida, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah. The hospital said the explosion tore the man's body in half.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment.

In the town of Beit Lahiya, where a similar protest took place Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated Wednesday, with many chanting “the people want the fall of Hamas.” In the hard-hit Shijaiyah neighborhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted “Out, out out! Hamas get out!”

“Our children have been killed. Our houses have been destroyed,” said Abed Radwan, who said he joined the protest in Beit Lahiya “against the war, against Hamas, and the (Palestinian political) factions, against Israel and against the world's silence.”

“You too should demand the removal of Hamas from Gaza and the immediate release of all Israeli hostages. That is the only way to stop the war,” Defense Minister Israel Katz said Wednesday.

One Palestinian who protested on Tuesday told The Associated Press they regretted participating because of Israeli media coverage, which emphasized the opposition to Hamas. 

The protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they joined the demonstration in the heavily destroyed northern town of Jabaliya because “everyone failed us.”

They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the Western-backed Palestinian Authority and Arab mediators. They said there were no Hamas security forces at the protest but scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the group.

Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim, in a post on Facebook, wrote that people had the right to protest but that their focus should be on the “criminal aggressor,” Israel.

“The exploitation of these tragic human conditions is rejected and denounced, either to pass on dubious political agendas or to drop responsibility for the criminal aggressor, which is the occupation and its army,” he wrote.

The militant group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed the war.

The United Nations Population Fund said Israel's ongoing aid blockade into Gaza is creating a critical shortage of maternal health supplies. They include much needed drugs for pregnancy and to prevent deaths and complications during childbirth.

Since the beginning of the month, Israel has cut off the entry of all food and other goods into Gaza, and last week resumed bombardment as it tries to pressure Hamas to accept its demands to extend the January ceasefire. 

UNFPA said its supplies are languishing at the border, including more than 50 ultrasounds to monitor fetal health, nine incubators and 350 midwifery kits to help during deliveries, impacting more than 15,000 women.

The group said pregnant women and newborns in Gaza are facing higher than normal rates of complications, driven by widespread malnutrition, which is being compounded by the aid blockade. Since the blockade around 520 babies — one in five —have required advanced medical care that is increasingly scarce, it said.

Lawyers representing a Gaza hospital director detained in an Israeli raid late last year say an Israeli court has extended his detention for another six months.

Israeli troops detained Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya when they raided Kamal Adwan Hospital in December. He was held without access to a lawyer for 47 days and has not been charged, according to Al Mezan, a human rights group representing him in court.

Al Mezan said the Beersheba District Court issued the order extending his detention on Tuesday. It said prosecutors submitted secret evidence alleging he is a threat to Israeli security, allegations he denies. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.

Israel has raided hospitals in Gaza on several occasions during the 17-month war with Hamas, accusing the militant group of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and accuse Israel of recklessly endangering civilians.

An Israeli co-director of an Oscar-winning film about settler violence said the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences refused to publicly condemn the beating and detention of the Palestinian co-director by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the occupied West Bank.

Writing on X, Yuval Abraham, co-director of “No Other Land,” wrote that several members of the academy, which awards the Oscars, advocated in vain for the group to make a statement denouncing the attack on Hamdan Ballal. He said he was told that the academy would not denounce the attack because it involved other Palestinians.

“In other words, while Hamdan was clearly targeted for making No Other Land … he was also targeted for being Palestinian — like countless others every day who are disregarded. This, it seems, gave the Academy an excuse to remain silent when a filmmaker they honored, living under Israeli occupation, needed them the most,” wrote Abraham.

He noted that the European Academy had voiced solidarity with Ballal following the attack and said it was not too late for the American Academy to do the same. The military has denied that Ballal was beaten.

Palestinians chanted against Hamas during an anti-war protest in the Gaza Strip, according to videos circulating online. It was a rare show of public anger against the militant group, which has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory 17 months into the war with Israel.

The videos, which appeared to be authentic, showed hundreds of people taking part in an anti-war protest in the heavily destroyed northern town of Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. People held signs saying “Stop the war,” “We refuse to die,” and “The blood of our children is not cheap.” 

Some could be heard chanting: “Hamas out!” Other videos appeared to show Hamas supporters dispersing the crowds.

A similar protest occurred in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to witnesses.

The Israeli military has ordered the evacuation of parts of Gaza City as it steps up its renewed offensive against Hamas.

The latest orders issued Wednesday apply to Zeitoun, Tel al-Hawa and other neighborhoods where Israeli forces have carried out previous operations during the 17-month war. The military said it will soon respond to rocket fire from the area and ordered residents to move south.

Israel broke its ceasefire with Hamas last week when it launched a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of Palestinians.

It has vowed to increase military pressure until Hamas returns the remaining 59 hostages it holds – 24 of whom are believed to be alive. Israel has also demanded that Hamas disarm and send its leaders into exile.

Hamas has said it will not release the remaining hostages without a lasting ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

The war was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Israel's retaliatory war has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says women and children make up over half the dead.

SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) — The U.S. government used an 18th-century wartime law to deport more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants earlier this month to El Salvador, where they were immediately transferred to the country's maximum-security gang prison.

And while a federal judge in Washington tries to determine whether the U.S. government defied his order to return the migrants while they were in the air and insists that they must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged members of a notorious gang, there has been no word from El Salvador's president or judiciary about what the prisoners' legal status is in that country.

That may change soon. On Monday, lawyers hired by the Venezuelan government took legal action on behalf of the Venezuelan prisoners seeking their release from the prison, which U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is scheduled to visit Wednesday.

The U.S. says the Venezuelans deported on March 15 were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, a criminal organization that U.S. President Donald Trump declared an invading force, but has provided no evidence of their alleged membership. The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.

El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have any consular support from their government either.

Even Salvadoran citizens have been living under a state of emergency that has suspended fundamental rights since 2022 and the country's judiciary is not considered independent. All of which raises questions about the prisoners' legal future in El Salvador.




Very little.

President Nayib Bukele announced the day after their arrival that the United States had sent what he called “238 members of the Venezuelan criminal organization Tren de Aragua” to El Salvador and they were immediately sent to its maximum security gang prison. The U.S. government would pay an annual fee for their incarceration, Bukele wrote in a post on X.

El Salvador's Attorney General's Office and Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights and Freedom of Expression did not respond to requests for comment about the legal status of the Venezuelan prisoners.

Lawyer David Morales, legal director for the nongovernmental organization Cristosal, said there was no legal basis for the Venezuelans' imprisonment in El Salvador. He said he knew of no Salvadoran law or international treaty that would support their imprisonment.

“They are illegal detentions because they haven't been submitted to the jurisdiction of a Salvadoran judge, nor have they been prosecuted or convicted in El Salvador,” he said. As such, their imprisonment here is “arbitrary.”

He said El Salvador's prosecutor's office for human rights would have the authority to intervene, because it has a broad mandate when it comes to prisoners, “but we already know that it's not playing its role because it is dominated, subjected to political power.”

Lawyers hired by the Venezuelan government filed a legal action Monday in El Salvador aimed at freeing the 238 Venezuelans deported by the United States.

Jaime Ortega, who says he represents 30 of the imprisoned Venezuelans, said his firm filed the habeas corpus petition with the Supreme Court's Constitutional Chamber. He said that by extension they requested that it be applied to all Venezuelans detained in El Salvador.

Before it was filed, constitutional lawyer Enrique Anaya had suggested human rights organizations and the prisoners' families should file habeas corpus petitions, essentially compelling the government to prove someone's detention was justified “as a mechanism to denounce (the situation) as well as to pressure” the government.

Still, Anaya said the lack of judicial independence in El Salvador made success unlikely. Bukele's party removed the justices of the Supreme Court's Constitutional chamber in 2021 and replaced them with judges seen as more amenable to the administration.

“Who is going to decide these people's freedom, U.S. judges, Salvadoran judges?” Anaya asked. The habeas corpus petitions could at least “show the illegitimacy of this vacuum.”

El Salvador has lived under a state of emergency since March 2022, when Congress granted Bukele extraordinary powers to fight the country's powerful street gangs.

Since then, some 84,000 people have been arrested, accused of gang ties. The state of emergency has allowed authorities to act without basic protections like access to a lawyer or telling detainees why they're being arrested. They can be held for 15 days without seeing a judge.

Homicides have plummeted in El Salvador and the improved security has fueled Bukele's popularity.

But while Bukele has said some 8,000 of those arrested have been freed for lack of evidence, many more have found no way out.

Last year, the Due Process Foundation published a report showing that the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court had “systematically” rejected more than 6,000 habeas corpus petitions made by families of people arrested under the state of emergency.

HEBRON, West Bank (AP) — Only a few weeks ago, Hamdan Ballal stood on a stage in Los Angeles accepting an Oscar for the film “No Other Land,” a documentary depicting his West Bank village's struggle against Israel's occupation.



On Tuesday, Ballal – his face bruised and clothes still spotted with blood – recounted to The Associated Press how he was heavily beaten by an Israeli settler and soldiers the night before. The settler, he said, kicked his head “like a football” during a settler attack on his village.



The soldiers then detained him and two other Palestinians. Ballal said he was kept blindfolded for more than 20 hours, sitting on the floor under a blasting air conditioner. The soldiers kicked, punched or hit him with a stick whenever they came on their guard shifts, he said. Ballal doesn't speak Hebrew, but he said he heard them saying his name and the word “Oscar.”

“I realized they were attacking me specifically,” he said in an interview at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. “When they say ‘Oscar', you understand. When they say your name, you understand.”



The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the claims that Ballal was beaten by soldiers. The settler whom Ballal identified as his attacker, Shem Tov Luski — who has threatened Ballal in the past — denied he or the soldiers beat him and told the AP that he and other Palestinians in the village had thrown stones at his car. He said he didn't know Ballal was an Oscar winner.



The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks as well as one Israeli civilian, who was soon released. Ballal denied throwing stones.

The attack took place Monday night in the southern West Bank village of Susiya. It's part of the Masafer Yatta region featured in “No Other Land,” which depicts the Palestinian residents' attempts to fend off settler attacks and the military's plans to demolish their homes.



At around sunset, as residents were ending their daylong Ramadan fast, roughly two dozen Jewish settlers along with police entered the village, throwing stones at houses and breaking property, witnesses say. Around 30 soldiers arrived soon after. Jewish Israelis in an activist group supporting the villagers showed video of themselves also being attacked, with settlers hitting their car with sticks and stones.

Ballal said he filmed some of the damage caused by the settlers. Then he went to his own home and locked it, with his wife and three young children inside.



“I told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,” he said.



Ballal said Luski approached with two soldiers. He said Luski hit him on the head, knocked him to the ground and kept kicking and punching him in the head. At the same time, one soldier hit him on the legs with his gun butt, while the other pointed his weapon at him, he said.



Lamia Ballal, the director's wife, said she was huddling inside with their children and heard him screaming, “I'm dying!”

Luski told the AP that he and other settlers had come to the village to help a fellow settler who said he was being attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers. He said dozens of masked Palestinians attacked his car with stones, including Ballal. “He broke my window, threw a stone at my chest,” he said.



He said when soldiers arrived, he led them to Ballal's house to identify him as one of the attackers but denied that he hit him or that settlers attacked any property in the village. Luski said he had footage of the night's events but when asked to show it to the AP, he responded with a string of expletives.



On Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside Ballal's home, and the family car's windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.







Lea Tsemel, the attorney representing Ballal and the two other Palestinians detained with him, said they were taken to an army base, where they only received minimal care for their injuries from the attack. She said they had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.

Ballal said he had no idea where he was being held, could see nothing and was “freezing” from the hours spent blindfolded under the air conditioner.



The three were transferred to an Israeli police station at the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and were released Tuesday afternoon.



“All my body is pain,” he told the AP immediately after his release as he walked, limping, toward a hospital in the nearby Palestinian city of Hebron. 



Doctors at the hospital said Ballal had bruises and scratches all over his body, abrasions under his eye and a cut on his chin but no internal injuries. The two other detained Palestinians also had minor injuries.











In a widely circulated video from August, Luski and several other masked settlers are seen arguing with Ballal. Luski shouts profanity at him and tries to provoke him into a fight. 



“This is my land, I was given it by God,” Luski says. “Next time it won't be nice.” He taunts Ballal with the prospect of being sent to Sde Teiman, a notorious military prison holding Palestinians detained from Gaza, where five soldiers have been charged with raping a detainee with a knife. 



“Rape for a higher cause,” he says in Hebrew, then blows Ballal a kiss.



The film “No Other Land,” a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.

Settlers have also set up outposts around the area and at times destroy Palestinian property. Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces usually turn a blind eye or intervene on behalf of the settlers.



The film has drawn ire in Israel and abroad, as when Miami Beach proposed ending the lease of a movie theater that screened it.



Basel Adra, another of the film's co-directors and a prominent Palestinian activist in the area, said there's been a massive upswing in attacks by settlers and Israeli forces since the Oscar win.

“We're living in dark days here, in Gaza, and all of the West Bank,” he said. “Nobody's stopping this.”



Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state.



Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal.



The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. 



The war in Gaza has sparked a surge of violence in the West Bank, with the Israeli military carrying out widescale military operations that have killed hundreds of Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands. There has been a rise in settler violence as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

A spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin told reporters on Tuesday that the outcome of his country's talks with the U.S. in Riyadh “has been reported in the capitals” and is currently being “analyzed” by Moscow and Washington. Dmitry Peskov also said the Kremlin has no plans to release any details of what was discussed to the public.

Russia carried out overnight drone strikes in several regions of Ukraine, local authorities said Tuesday. The Kyiv region was targeted in the early hours of the day, with firefighters battling to put out a fire at a warehouse, the State Emergency Service said. No casualties were reported. In the eastern Kharkiv and Sumy regions, Russian strikes destroyed several buildings and vehicles, according to the State Emergency Service.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — The United States said Tuesday that it had reached a tentative agreement for Ukraine and Russia to stop fighting and ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea in separate talks with both sides, but many details were unresolved, and the Kremlin made the deal conditional on lifting some Western sanctions.



The announcement was made as the U.S. wrapped up three days of talks with Ukrainian and Russian delegations in Saudi Arabia on prospective steps toward a limited ceasefire.



While a comprehensive peace deal still looked distant, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the talks as the early “right steps” toward a peaceful settlement of the 3-year-old war.

“These are the first steps — not the very first but initial ones — with this presidential administration toward completely ending the war and the possibility of a full ceasefire, as well as steps toward a sustainable and fair peace agreement,” he said at a news conference.



U.S. experts met separately with Ukrainian and Russian representatives in the Saudi capital of Riyadh, and the White House said in separate statements after the talks that the sides “agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea.”



Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey but halted by Russia the next year.






“We are making a lot of progress,” U.S. President Donald Trump said Tuesday at the White House. “So that's all I can report.”



When Moscow withdrew from the shipping deal in 2023, it complained that a parallel agreement promising to remove obstacles to Russian exports of food and fertilizer had not been honored. It said restrictions on shipping and insurance hampered its agricultural trade. Kyiv accused Moscow of violating the deal by delaying the vessels' inspections.



After Russia suspended its part of the deal, it regularly attacked Ukraine's southern ports and grain storage sites.



Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in televised comments Tuesday that Moscow is now open to the revival of the Black Sea shipping deal but warned that Russian interests must be protected.



In an apparent reference to Moscow's demands, the White House said the U.S. “will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.”

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Ukraine regions have again come under overnight Russian attack.

Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's envoy for investment and economic cooperation, hailed the results of the talks as a “major shift toward peace, enhanced global food security and essential grain supplies for over 100 million additional people.”



Trump “is making another global breakthrough by effective dialogue and problem-solving,” he said on X.



But the Kremlin warned in a statement that the Black Sea deal could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial organizations involved in food and fertilizer trade are lifted and their access to the SWIFT system of international payments is ensured.

The agreement is also conditional on lifting sanctions against Russian food and fertilizer exporters and ships carrying Russian food exports, and removing restrictions on exports of agricultural equipment to Russia, the Kremlin said.



The deal emphasized that inspections of commercial ships would be necessary to ensure they aren't used for military purposes.



Zelenskyy bristled at Russia's demand for lifting sanctions, saying that doing so “would weaken our position.”



Still, Trump indicated that the U.S. was considering the Kremlin's conditions: “We're thinking about all of them right now.”



In an interview Tuesday with Newsmax, Trump considered the possibility that Putin could be stalling on ending the war.



“I think that Russia wants to see an end to it, but it could be they're dragging their feet,” said Trump, comparing the negotiation to his own experience in real estate. “I've done it over the years. I don't want to sign a contract. I want to sort of stay in the game, but maybe I don't want to do it.”



A senior official in the Ukrainian government, who is directly familiar with the talks and spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment publicly, said the Kyiv delegation does not agree to lifting sanctions as a condition for a maritime ceasefire and that Russia has done nothing to have sanctions rolled back. The official also said European countries are not involved in the sanctions discussions, despite sanctions being within the European Union's responsibility.



Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov warned that Kyiv would see the deployment of Russian warships in the western Black Sea as a “violation of the commitment to ensure safe navigation” there and “a threat to the national security of Ukraine.”



“In this case, Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defense,” he said.











The White House also said the parties agreed to develop measures for implementing an agreement reached in Trump's calls with Zelenskyy and Putin to ban strikes against energy facilities in Russia and Ukraine.



The talks in Riyadh, which did not include direct Russian-Ukrainian contacts, were part of an attempt to work out details on a partial pause in the fighting in Ukraine, which began with Moscow's invasion in 2022. It has been a struggle to reach even a limited, 30-day ceasefire, which both sides agreed to in principle last week, even while continuing to attack each other with drones and missiles.



After the Trump-Putin call last week, the White House said the partial ceasefire would include ending attacks on “energy and infrastructure,” while the Kremlin emphasized that the agreement referred more narrowly to “energy infrastructure.” Tuesday's White House statement reverted to the wording used by Russia.



The Kremlin, which has accused Ukraine of breaching the agreement to stop strikes on energy infrastructure, on Tuesday published a list of energy facilities subject to a 30-day halt on strikes that began on March 18. It warned that each party was free to opt out of the deal in case of violations by the other side.



Zelenskyy noted that significant uncertainties remain.



“I think there will be a million questions and details,” he said, adding that the responsibility for potential violations also remains unclear.

He emphasized that Ukraine is open to a full, 30-day ceasefire that Trump has proposed, reaffirming that Kyiv is “ready to quickly move toward an unconditional ceasefire.”



Putin has made a complete ceasefire conditional on a halt of arms supplies to Kyiv and a suspension of Ukraine's military mobilization — demands rejected by Ukraine and its Western allies.



The U.S. noted its commitment to helping achieve the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of civilian detainees and the return of forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.



In other developments, the Russian Foreign Ministry warned in a statement that Moscow would not agree to surrender control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, that Russia captured in the opening days of the invasion.



Trump suggested that Zelenskyy consider transferring ownership of Ukraine's power plants to the U.S. for long-term security, while the Ukrainian leader said they specifically talked about the Zaporizhzhia plant in last week's call.







The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine had “continued deliberate drone strikes against Russia's civilian energy facilities.”



One Ukrainian drone attack on Monday knocked down a high-voltage power line linking the Rostov nuclear power plant with the city of Tikhoretsk in the southern Krasnodar region, the ministry said, adding that another drone strike had occurred on the Svatovo gas distribution station in the Russia-occupied Ukrainian region of Luhansk.



Russian state media said six people, including three Russian journalists, died Monday after a Ukrainian missile strike in the Luhansk region.



In Ukraine, the number of people injured Monday in a Russian missile strike in the city of Sumy rose to 101, including 23 children, according to the Sumy regional administration.



The strike on Sumy, across the border from Russia's Kursk region that has been partially occupied by Ukraine since August, hit residential buildings and a school, which had to be evacuated.



Meanwhile, Russia launched a missile and 139 long-range drones into Ukraine overnight, according to the Ukrainian air force. Those attacks affected seven regions of Ukraine and injured multiple people.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli authorities released a Palestinian director of the Oscar-winning documentary “ No Other Land,” a day after he was beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by soldiers. Hamdan Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny.

Palestinians and rights groups say Israeli forces in the West Bank usually turn a blind eye to settler attacks or intervene on the settlers' behalf. 

Israel's parliament passed a crucial state budget on Tuesday, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.

Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday, Palestinian medics said, including three children and their parents who were killed in their tent.

Hospitals have been flooded with at least 792 dead — including over 300 children — and 1,663 wounded in the week since Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed heavy bombardments of Gaza. The Health Ministry's count does not distinguish between civilians and militants. 

Here's the latest:




Japan's Defense Minister Gen Nakatani says his country will provide medical treatment for two Palestinian women for injuries and illnesses from the conflict in Gaza, and one of them has arrived in Tokyo.

Nakatani said Wednesday that one patient is being treated at the Self Defense Forces Central Hospital. Another patient is to arrive within days, he said. Both women were previously being treated in Egypt. Nakatani did not give further details about the patients, their conditions or their expected length of stay in Japan.

The treatments, Nakatani said, are part of Japan's efforts to address the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and followed a request from the World Health Organization.

“(The women) are supposed to return to their original places after treatment, and their visit is not meant for settling in Japan,” Nakatani said.

Geir Pedersen said Syria can return to violence and monopolies of power — or launch an inclusive transition, overcome conflict and realize the aspirations of its people.

He told the U.N. Security Council it “must not come to pass” that Syria backslides into conflict, fragmentation, and having its sovereignty routinely violated by external powers.

Pedersen said the other road, restoring sovereignty and regional security, “requires the right Syrian decisions,” but the country's interim Islamist-led authorities can't do it alone and need increased and continuing international support.

The U.N. special envoy, who will be returning to Damascus shortly, highlighted several priority areas for action and attention.

He asked whether the soon-to-be announced transitional government and transitional legislative council reflect Syria's diversity, and include both men and women?

Pedersen said developments on a new constitution, accountability for crimes committed over decades, security, foreign fighters and the economy must also be addressed.

The fresh Israeli evacuation orders affect as many as 120,000 people living in heavily damaged northern Gaza, and cover two hospitals and a one primary health care center, the United Nations humanitarian agency said Tuesday.

That's in addition to 120,000 people already displaced in the week since Israel restarted the war in Gaza, according to U.N. estimates.

Israel says it ordered civilians to evacuate late Monday because its forces need to advance into two areas where Palestinian militants recently fired rockets.

As stone-throwing Israeli settlers and armed soldiers approached his home, Hamdan Ballal could only think about his wife and three young kids inside.

“I told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday following a night in military detention.

Three weeks after winning the Oscar for best documentary, the Palestinian director was again pointing his camera at settlers who were attacking his village in the West Bank on Monday night. Soldiers aimed their guns at him and other residents.

“I can't do anything when someone is threatening your life with their gun. I just keep filming them and that's it,” he said, describing how one settler walked toward his front door flanked by armed Israelis in uniform.

The settler hit Ballal in the head, knocking him to the ground, and began kicking his head like “it was a football.” One of the soldiers used the butt of his gun to hit Ballal's leg, he alleges.

Bloodied and blindfolded, witnesses filmed Ballal being detained by soldiers and driven away in a military vehicle amid the gathering dusk. He says he was kept handcuffed and blindfolded underneath an air conditioner overnight, and soldiers would periodically hit, kick and beat him with sticks. He has no idea where he was held.

Asked if he felt specifically targeted, he said: “When they say ‘Oscar,' you understand. When they say your name, you understand.”

Mike Huckabee, facing a U.S. Senate hearing for his confirmation as President Donald Trump's ambassador to Israel, is facing close questioning from Democrats on his views on the potential for Israeli annexation of the West Bank, but he avoided giving direct answers.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, asked Huckabee whether he thought it would be wrong for a Jewish settler to push a Palestinian family off land they own in the West Bank.

Huckabee, a well-known evangelical Christian, stood by past statements that Israel has a “Biblical mandate” to the land. He also responded by saying he believed in the “law being followed” and “clarity,” but also that “purchasing the land” would be a “legitimate transaction.”

Huckabee also said that any Palestinians living in an annexed West Bank would have “security” and “opportunity,” but wouldn't answer Van Hollen's questions about whether they would have the same legal and political rights as Jewish people.

Four pro-Palestinian demonstrators interrupted the hearing in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday to decry Huckabee's ardent support for Israel. 

One blew a shofar, a ram's horn used for Jewish religious purposes, and another shouted, “I am a proud American Jew!” then “Let Palestinians live!”

Police quickly grabbed the protesters, but their shouts could still be momentarily heard in the Senate hallway.

Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas and one-time Republican presidential hopeful, has taken stances on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that sharply contradict longstanding U.S. policy in the region.

He has spoken favorably in the past about Israel's right to annex the occupied West Bank and has long been opposed to the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian people. 

In an interview last year, he went even further, saying that he doesn't even believe in referring to the Arab descendants of people who lived in British-controlled Palestine as “Palestinians.”

An Oscar-winning Palestinian director and two others have been released by Israeli authorities, a day after he says he was badly beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank.

Associated Press journalists on Tuesday spoke with Hamdan Ballal after he left the police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba where he was being held. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes.

Ballal and other witnesses say he was attacked by Jewish settlers before being detained by the Israeli army Monday evening. The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a what it described as a violent confrontation.

Ballal is one of the other directors of “No Other Land,” which won the Oscar this year for best documentary. The film chronicles the struggle by residents of the Masafer Yatta area to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages.

An Israeli strike Tuesday in southwestern Syria killed at least four people as Israeli troops occupying the area clashed with local residents, Syrian state media and a war monitor reported. 

Israeli military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said troops fired back at gunmen who attacked them, before launching a drone attack. 

Syrian state-run news agency SANA said several people were wounded, including a woman. The report said Israeli tanks in the southwestern village of Koayiah also fired several rounds. 

Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at seven. The observatory and a town resident told The Associated Press that clashes had erupted between Israeli troops and residents when the Israeli troops fired. 

Israel seized a U.N.-patrolled buffer zone inside Syria after Islamist insurgents toppled President Bashar Assad and seized power in December, with Israeli officials saying they will thwart any threats.

The lawyer for an Oscar-winning Palestinian director who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces says he will be released. 

Lea Tsemel, the attorney for Hamdan Ballal, said Tuesday that he and two other Palestinians spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could feel free to move toward a lasting ceasefire with Hamas since his political allies, who oppose ending the war, have little incentive to trigger new elections while their polling numbers are down, said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

But the vote doesn't mean Netanyahu will move in the direction to end the war, she said. She expected him to further his ultranationalist partners' agenda to keep them as loyal allies and galvanize the nationalist right ahead of any future vote.

“Netanyahu is always thinking about the next elections,” Talshir said. “His goal is to make sure the extreme right will be in his government now and in the future.”

Israel's parliament on Tuesday passed a state budget, a move that shores up Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's governing coalition and grants the embattled leader the chance at months of political stability even as public pressure mounts over the war in Gaza.

The budget vote was seen as a key test for Netanyahu's coalition, which is made up of ultranationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties who had demanded and largely received hefty sums for their constituents in exchange for support for the funding package. By law, the government would fall and elections triggered if a budget weren't passed by March 31. 

With its passing, Netanyahu buys himself what's likely to be more than a year of political quiet that could see his government coast through to the end of its term in late 2026, a rare occurrence in Israel's fractious politics. It's a political win for Netanyahu, who faces mass protests over his decision to resume the war in Gaza while hostages still remain in Hamas' hands, and over his government's recent moves to fire top legal and security chiefs. 

Palestinian first responders say a nine-member ambulance crew is still missing days after being surrounded and targeted by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.

The Palestinian Red Crescent said the team was responding to airstrikes in the Tel al-Sultan neighborhood of the southern city of Rafah when Israeli forces encircled the area early Sunday. It said Israel has refused access to the area since then. 

The military said troops had fired on ambulances and fire trucks that it said had raised suspicion by moving without prior coordination and without headlights or emergency signals. It said those inside were militants, without providing evidence.

The Israeli military says a well-known Palestinian journalist killed in a strike on the Gaza Strip was also a Hamas sniper. 

It shared what it said were internal Hamas documents purportedly showing that Hossam Shabat was a sniper in a Hamas battalion in northern Gaza and had received military training in 2019. The military said he had carried out attacks during the war, without providing evidence. 

Qatar-based Al Jazeera said Shabat, a freelance reporter, was covering the war for the satellite news network when he was killed in an Israeli strike on Monday. It said he had been wounded in an Israeli strike in November. 

Shabat, in his early 20s, was prolific on social media, sharing videos and other reports with more than 170,000 followers on the X platform.

Israel has banned Al Jazeera and accused several of its journalists in Gaza of being Palestinian militants. A number of them have been killed or wounded in Israeli strikes. The channel denies the accusations and says Israel is trying to silence journalists covering the war.

One of the Palestinian co-directors of the Oscar-winning documentary “ No Other Land ” was still missing on Tuesday after being beaten by Jewish settlers and detained by the Israeli military.

Attorney Lea Tsemel told The Associated Press she had no information on filmmaker Hamdan Ballal's whereabouts early Tuesday, around 12 hours after witnesses said he was attacked and detained in the occupied West Bank.

Ballal was one of three Palestinians detained in the village of Susiya late Monday, according to Tsemel, who is representing them. Police told her they're being held at a military base for medical treatment, and she said she hasn't been able to speak with them.

Basel Adra, another co-director, witnessed the detention and said around two dozen settlers — some masked, some carrying guns, some in Israeli uniform — attacked the village. Soldiers who arrived pointed their guns at the Palestinians, while settlers continued throwing stones.

The Israeli military said it detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks at forces and one Israeli civilian involved in a “violent confrontation” between Israelis and Palestinians — a claim witnesses interviewed by the AP disputed.

The military said it had transferred them to Israeli police for questioning and had evacuated an Israeli citizen from the area to receive medical treatment.

Palestinian medics say Israeli strikes killed at least 23 people in the Gaza Strip overnight into Tuesday.

Nasser Hospital said it received four additional bodies from two other strikes in addition to the family of five.

In central Gaza, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital said it received the bodies of six people who were killed in three separate strikes. Three others were killed in a strike on a house in the built-up Nuseirat refugee camp, according to Al-Awda Hospital.

In Gaza City, an Israeli strike on a residential building killed 5 people, according to the Health Ministry's emergency service. Another 12 people were wounded, it said.

ISTANBUL (AP) — The head of Turkey's main opposition party visited jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on Tuesday after six nights of massive protests calling for his release.

Imamoglu, arrested on March 19 on corruption charges, is seen as the main challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 22-year rule. His arrest has been widely viewed as politically motivated and sparked demonstrations, some turning violent, across the country. The government insists Turkey's judiciary is independent and free of political influence.

Ozgur Ozel, the leader of Imamoglu's Republican People's Party, or CHP, held a two-hour meeting with Imamoglu at Silivri prison, west of Istanbul. Ozel told reporters that he was “ashamed on behalf of those who govern Turkey of the atmosphere I am in and the situation that Turkey is being put through.”

He described Imamoglu and two jailed CHP district mayors he also met as “three lions inside, standing tall, with their heads held high … proud of themselves, their families, their colleagues, not afraid.”

Ozel later spoke at what he said would be the last rally in front of Istanbul's City Hall, saying the party would appoint an acting mayor in Imamoglu's place in hopes of staving off a state-appointed replacement.

Ozel announced plans for a demonstration on Saturday at another location in Istanbul and warned the governor, a government appointee in charge of police, not to allow any violence at the final City Hall gathering.

“If you provoke this square tonight, if you use tear gas or attack, I will change our plan for the coming days. I will make a call for 500,000 people to (come to) the place that will disturb you the most,” he said.

Students across Turkey protested and occupied campuses on Tuesday after declaring a boycott of classes. In Istanbul, thousands gathered in a park before marching to Sisli district, where the elected mayor has been jailed and replaced with a government appointee.

Meanwhile, Turkish authorities have been cracking down on journalists as protests have grown.

The Media and Law Studies Association, a civil society group, said 11 journalists who were detained for covering banned protests in Istanbul were brought to the city's Caglayan Courthouse to answer charges of violating the law on meetings and demonstrations.

The journalists were among more than 200 people prosecutors have recommended for imprisonment pending trial, including left-wing activists rounded up at their homes in raids early Monday. By late Tuesday, 172 people, including seven journalists, had been jailed ahead of trial.

Among those sent to pretrial detention was 22-year-old student Berkay Gezgin, who as a boy coined the phrase “Everything will be great” when he met Imamoglu on the campaign trail in 2019. The slogan has endured as a central part of the mayor's political identity since.

Turkish media reported that U.S. citizen Michael Anthony Ganoe was deported for “inciting the public to hatred” during the protests.

The head of the CHP's Istanbul branch, Ozgur Celik, shared a letter he received from the prosecutor's office ordering the removal of Imamoglu's posters. He said he would not comply.

“You will see more of Mayor Ekrem on the balconies of houses, in squares, on the streets and on the walls,” Celik posted on X.

Demonstrations in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, as well as smaller cities and towns across Turkey, have been largely peaceful with protesters demanding Imamoglu's release and an end to democratic backsliding. Some turned violent, with officers deploying water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray and firing plastic pellets at protesters, some of whom have hurled stones, fireworks and other objects at riot police.

The governors of Ankara and Izmir on Tuesday extended bans on demonstrations to April 1 and March 29, respectively. The ban in Istanbul currently ends on Thursday. 

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said early Tuesday that police had detained 43 “provocateurs” over what he said were “vile insults” hurled at Erdogan and his family at protests. Later he posted that 1,418 people had been detained since Wednesday last week, and 979 suspects were currently in custody. “No concessions will be made to those who attempt to terrorize the streets,” he wrote on X.

Ozel and Imamoglu's social media accounts posted condemnations of insults hurled at Erdogan's mother.

Addressing a Ramadan fast-breaking meal in Ankara, Erdogan called on people to “know their limits, maintain moderation and not to cross the line between seeking rights and insult and vandalism.”

He added: “Those who spread terror in the streets and want to turn this country into a fire have no destination. The path they take is a dead end.”

Imamoglu has been jailed on suspicion of running a criminal organization, accepting bribes, extortion, illegally recording personal data and bid-rigging — accusations he has denied. He also faces prosecution on terror-related charges and has been suspended from duty as a “temporary measure.”

Alongside Imamoglu, 47 other people have been jailed pending trial, including a key aide and two district mayors from Istanbul. A further 44 suspects in the case alleging widespread graft at Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality were released under judicial control.

The U.N. Human Rights Office condemned “widespread detentions” in Turkey. “All those detained for the legitimate exercise of their rights must be released immediately and unconditionally,” spokesperson Liz Throssell said in a statement.

Although Turkey is not due for another election until 2028, there is a reasonable possibility that Erdogan will call for an early vote in order to run for another term.

Imamoglu has been confirmed as the candidate for the CHP and has performed well in recent polls against Erdogan. He was elected mayor of Turkey's largest city in March 2019, in a major blow to Erdogan and his Justice and Development Party, which had controlled Istanbul alongside its predecessors for a quarter-century.

Security forces used a more subdued approach Tuesday to disperse anti-government protesters compared to earlier days.

Ozel, the leader of CHP, spoke at length near the Istanbul City Hall after threatening a larger demonstration if authorities used excessive force again.

Following his speech, officers said the road under the historic aqueduct where police and protesters held a standoff since the second day of the protests would reopen. Officers repeatedly asked protesters to leave.

Police advanced slowly on the group until it dispersed, with some physical altercations. A small crowd briefly sought refuge outside the City Hall.

Protesters chanted anti-government slogans, demanded Erdogan's resignation and staged a sit-in near the historic aqueduct.

One demonstrator, who declined to give his name due to fear of reprisals and detention by security forces, said protesters who threw stones at police did not belong there. He also called on Erdogan to resign.

Another protester, an 18-year-old who also withheld his name, said he was detained and then released after the Monday protests, “Even though we did not scuffle with the police, they came and sprayed us with pepper gas,” he said.

Footage of clashes on Monday circulated widely on social media, including of an officer spraying and yelling at fleeing demonstrators.

Protesters on Tuesday sought to remain peaceful, singling out and removing those who threw objects or shouted insults.

Small fights between protesters broke out after groups accused each other of needlessly provoking the police. One man was struck in the head by a group of protesters after being accused of throwing objects at police.

        The US vice-president will accompany his wife on a visit to the Arctic island, a trip Denmark's prime minister has previously said is not what 'Greenland wants or needs.'
    

US Vice President JD Vance announced on Tuesday he would join his wife, Usha, on an unsolicited trip to Greenland, but scaled back the visit amid criticism of the original trip. 

A delegation from Washington including JD and Usha Vance, National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright were set to visit semi-autonomous Danish territory from Thursday until Sunday.

Usha Vance's office originally said she and one of her three children had planned to visit Greenland's historical sites and take part in a dog-sled race, but her husband suggested the trip would now be centred on a visit to the US Pituffik Space base on the northwest coast of the island. 

Waltz's name has since been omitted from the list of visitors after JD Vance announced he was attending. 

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Danish media it was ""positive that the Americans cancelled their visit to the Greenlandic society.”

“Instead, they will visit their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that,” he said.

The acting government of Greenland noted ""that the previously announced US delegation visit to Nuuk and Sisimiut has been cancelled by the US government.”

JD Vance framed the visit to the space base as necessary to check on the island's security. 

The vice-president said, ""a lot of other countries have threatened Greenland, have threatened to use its territories and its waterways to threaten the United States, to threaten Canada, and of course, to threaten the people of Greenland.""

“Speaking for President (Donald) Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world,” Vance concluded in an online video. 

The previously planned trip involving Usha Vance, Waltz and Wright, had been slammed by both Greenlandic and Danish politicians. 

On Tuesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said the US was putting ""unacceptable pressure"" on the island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

""You cannot make a private visit with official representatives from another country,"" Frederiksen told Danish media. 

“It is clearly not a visit that is about what Greenland needs, or what Greenland wants,"" Frederikson concluded. 

Greenland's Prime Minister Múte B Egede, who will remain in his post until a new government is formed following fresh elections, called the visit ""highly aggressive"" earlier on Monday.  

Discontent around the visit grew sharper on Monday evening, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook that it had “not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official.”

Both Egede and Frederikson have rejected Trump's repeated advances that the US could take control of the island. Copenhagen, which controls Greenland's foreign and defence policy, has recognised the island's right to independence at a time of its choosing.

Trump on Monday reiterated his desire to take over Greenland, using national security as a justification. He argued that the visit was about ""friendliness, not provocation"".

        Two UK brothers and a co-conspirator attempted to kill a convicted armed robber just weeks after stealing Ming Dynasty artefacts worth millions of Euros.
    

Three men in the UK have been found guilty of conspiracy to murder in the case of a cage fighter and career criminal who narrowly escaped death after being shot and injured in his own home in 2019.

The three men, Daniel Kelly and brothers Louis and Stewart Ahearne, were convicted at the Old Bailey in London two days ago after a trial that drew on evidence from the SIM card of an iPad recovered from the river Thames.

The three men had just weeks before staged a major art heist, looting several 14th-century Chinese artefacts worth more than €3m from the Museum of Far Eastern Art in Geneva using an angle grinder, a sledgehammer and a crowbar.

The prosecution's case said that they carefully planned their attempt on the life of convicted armed robber Paul Allen a month later, monitoring him for weeks and attaching a tracking device to his car to follow his movements. He was eventually shot through a window at his home and seriously injured, but medics were able to save his life with emergency surgery. 

Allen had previously served time in jail for taking part in the most lucrative armed robbery in British history, a 2006 attack on a security facility in Kent that saw a manager and his family abducted and £54m (€64.5m) stolen by robbers wielding AK-47s.

The case against the three men for their attack on Allen drew on witness testimony, DNA left at the scene, and CCTV and car numberplate recognition data — as well as call data recovered from an iPad that had been thrown into the Thames just downstream of London's O2 arena.

After carefully retrieving the device's SIM card, police were able to establish that it had been connected to GPS devices found in the men's car. Investigators were also able to access an email account containing details of multiple Amazon purchases made in advance of the murder attempt, including the burner phones the men used to communicate.

Metropolitan Police Detective Superintendent Matt Webb, the lead officer in the investigation, said the men were likely to face lengthy custodial sentences.

“The court heard how the defendants, hardened organised criminals, acted together in a well-planned and orchestrated manner to shoot their victim. It is only for the intervention of police first responders and medical professionals that the victim wasn't killed,"" Webb said.

""This attack may look like the plot to a Hollywood blockbuster but the reality is something quite different. This was horrific criminality."" 

""The court heard how this was a clear and defined attempt to take a man's life with those responsible making significant efforts to ensure this was successful,"" he concluded.

        Senior intelligence officials testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee, a day after an explosive report in The Atlantic, with the CIA director denying that 'a huge mistake' had been made.
    

US President Donald Trump's top intelligence officials have claimed, under oath, that no classified information was shared in a Signal group chat that accidentally included a journalist and concerned strikes against Yemen.

Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee a day after the stunning revelation in The Atlantic, senior officials attempted to downplay the significance of what has been roundly condemned as a historic security failure. 

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, on Monday reported that he was added to a text thread, which discussed imminent strikes on Houthi militias in Yemen, after Michael Waltz sent him a connection request. 

While Goldberg initially did not believe the Signal chat to be genuine, he was subsequently shocked to watch as Houthi targets were indeed struck at the time that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had announced they would be to the group. 

Goldberg wrote that the discussion in the Signal chat ""included precise information about weapons packages, targets and timing,"" though he did not release information that could jeopardise US national security. 

Goldberg reported, without revealing their identity, that Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe shared the name of an active CIA agent via Signal. 

The National Security Council later confirmed the chat's veracity. 

Despite the jaw-dropping development, which has made front pages globally, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard claimed that no classified information had been shared in the group chat. 

Asked during the hearing whether the timing and location of upcoming military strikes had been shared in the group she said: ""I can attest to the fact that there were not classified or intelligence equities that were included in that chat group at any time.""

Gabbard's response drew incredulity from members of the committee, with Independent Senator Angus King of Maine saying, ""It's hard for me to believe that targets and timing and weapons would not have been classified.""

Senator Mark Warner, of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee, also pushed back against Gabbard's claim, saying: ""If there was no classified material, share it with the committee. You can't have it both ways.""

Gabbard later refused to confirm whether she had accessed the Signal group chat from a personal or work phone.

Ratcliffe also attempted to downplay the significance of the mishap. While he acknowledged that he was in the chat, he described it as ""lawful,"" claiming that Signal was permitted as a workplace communication tool.

When pressed to admit that a ""huge mistake"" had been made, Ratcliffe denied it. Democrat Senator Jon Ossoff of Georgia asked, ""Director Ratcliffe, this was a huge mistake, correct?"" Ratcliffe responded, ""No.""

Ossoff subsequently launched into a full-throated criticism, calling the incident ""an embarrassment … utterly unprofessional"" and stressing that there's been ""no apology"" or ""recognition of the gravity of this error."" 

""By the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain – and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content,"" he added.

        Rights groups accuse Hamas of violently suppressing dissent, quashing protests in the areas they control, while also jailing and torturing their critics.
    

Palestinians in Gaza have staged a rare public protest against Hamas, calling for the militant group to end the war and leave the Strip. 

Videos circulating online show hundreds of people marching in an anti-war protest in partially destroyed northern town of Beit Lahiya on Tuesday. 

While the protests began in northern Gaza, according to online users they sprang up elsewhere in Gaza as the day progressed, with demonstrations reportedly taking place as far south as Khan Younis by the evening.

In some videos, Hamas supporters can be seen attempting to break up the crowds. 

While some protesters called more generally for an end to the war with Israel, others openly blamed Hamas for starting the conflict and demanded the group leave Gaza. 

While Hamas won the most seats in the 2006 legislative election, it didn't win an outright majority of votes. Hamas was also opposed to a power-sharing agreement with Fatah, the political group which previously controlled Gaza, and seized power in 2007. 

Rights groups accuse Hamas of violently suppressing dissent, quashing protests in the areas it controls and jailing and torturing critics.

In Beit Lahiya, people held signs saying ""Stop the war"" and ""We refuse to die"" while others openly chanted ""Hamas out"".

""We are sick of the bombing, killing and displacement,"" said Ammar Hassan, who took part in the protest.

According to Hassan, the demonstration started as an anti-war rally with just a few dozen people but then swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.

""It's the only party we can affect,"" he said over the phone. ""Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but they can affect Hamas,"" he said.

""The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,"" said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father of three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined the demonstration.

""We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,"" he said.

A statement released by the Elders and Mukhtars of Beit Lahiya group expressed support for the protests against Israel's offensive and its blockade, but backed armed resistance. 

Local leaders said they rejected ""any attempt to exploit legitimate popular demands by a fifth column,"" in an apparent reference to opponents of Hamas.

The protests erupted a week after Israel ended the ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes, which killed hundreds of people. 

Earlier this month, Israel also halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's population of roughly two million people.

Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds, 24 of whom are believed to still be alive. 

Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile. 

Hamas' conditions for releasing the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners are a lasting ceasefire and a full Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza.

The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw Palestinian militants kill some 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and take 251 people hostage.  

Hamas claims only a handful of its top commanders knew about the attack before it happened.

Israel's bombardment and ground operations in its war on Hamas have caused vast destruction across Gaza and displaced around 90% of the Strip's population.

        More than 200 police officers searched 19 properties in a large-scale operation, with a related raid also conducted in Denmark. No arrests have been made so far.
    

German authorities carried out raids across six states on Wednesday targeting individuals suspected of involvement in Brigade N'Hamedu, a group accused of attempting to overthrow the government of Eritrea.

According to a statement from the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, the group is considered a “domestic terrorist organisation” under German law, with 17 identified suspects believed to hold senior roles in its German branch, which has been active since at least 2022.

The prosecutor's office said the group is part of “an internationally-connected network that intends to topple the Eritrean government”. 

Brigade N'Hamedu has allegedly orchestrated violent clashes at Eritrean events in Germany, including Eritrea Festivals in Giessen on 20 August 2022 and 7–8 August 2023, as well as a seminar in Stuttgart in September 2023.

According to the statement, the suspects regard violence against German state institutions and police officers as “legitimate means”, particularly at gatherings supported by the Eritrean government. In these incidents, numerous officers were injured.

In total, 19 properties were searched across Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Rhineland-Palatinate. A parallel search was also conducted in Denmark. 

More than 200 officers from federal and state law enforcement were involved in the operation. No arrests have been reported yet.

The prosecutor's office also revealed that another alleged senior figure in Brigade N'Hamedu, active in both the Netherlands and Germany, was recently sentenced to several years in prison by a Dutch court for his role in clashes in The Hague on 17 February 2024.

Eritrea is widely regarded as one of the world's most repressive regimes. In recent years, people who fled the country have disrupted festivals organised by the Eritrean diaspora in Europe and North America. 

Some say these protests are aimed at the Eritrean government, while others claim the events may instead raise money to support it.

        Trump told local media that the lapse “turned out not to be a serious one,” and expressed his continued support for national security adviser Mike Waltz.
    

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday downplayed the texting of sensitive plans for a military strike against Yemen's Houthis this month to a group chat that included a journalist, calling it “the only glitch in two months” of his administration.

Trump's reaction to the development, which seemed to have caught him by surprise when a reporter first asked him on Monday, comes as Democratic lawmakers heaped criticism on his administration for handling highly sensitive information carelessly.

Trump told local media that the lapse “turned out not to be a serious one,” and expressed his continued support for national security adviser Mike Waltz.

“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,” he said. He also appeared to place blame on an unnamed Waltz aide for Goldberg being added to the chain. “It was one of Michael's people on the phone. A staffer had his number on there.”

According to a story published online by The Atlantic on Monday, Waltz seemed to have unintentionally included Jeffrey Goldberg, the magazine's editor-in-chief, in a chat that involved eighteen high administration officials talking about strike preparations against Houthi rebels.

The use of the messaging app Signal to discuss a sensitive operation has opened the administration to blistering criticism from Democratic lawmakers who expressed outrage at the White House's and senior administration officials' insistence that no classified information was shared. 

Senior US administration officials have struggled to explain why the publicly available app was used to discuss such a delicate matter.

Earlier on Tuesday, Waltz said he was not sure how Goldberg ended up on the chat. “This one in particular, I've never met, don't know, never communicated with,” Waltz said.

Later, in an interview with FOX News, the national security adviser admitted the mistake and took responsibility.

“We made a mistake. We're moving forward,” said Waltz, who added that he took “full responsibility” for the episode.

Before defeating Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, Trump called for the former secretary of state to be charged with a crime for discussing confidential material with her advisers using a private email server she set up. 

The matter was investigated, but the FBI ultimately recommended against charges. None were brought.

On Monday, Clinton was among Democrats this week to criticise Trump's administration officials' use of Signal.

“You have got to be kidding me,” she wrote in a post on X that spotlighted The Atlantic article, making sure to include a rolling eyes emoji.

A report at Al-Ain media in the UAE says that recent US strikes in Yemen have caused heavy losses among the Iranian-backed Houthis. The report says that “the US military has intensified its airstrikes on Houthi militia bases, facilities, and command centers in their main stronghold in Saada Governorate, northern Yemen.”Saada governorate is one of the largest governorates in Yemen and includes an area in northwest Yemen along the border with Saudi Arabia. The capital of the region is Saada city.

The prospects of a peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan could unite some countries that are not usually on the same side of issues. This is because it appears that the US, Iran, Russia, Turkey, and basically everyone in the region would like to see a deal between Yerevan and Baku.Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran welcomed the conclusion of a draft agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), Iran's official news agency, reported Wednesday.Two weeks ago, the US State Department said: “The United States commends Armenia and Azerbaijan for concluding negotiations on a historic peace treaty. This is an opportunity for both countries to turn the page on a decades-old conflict in line with President [Donald] Trump's vision for a more peaceful world. Now is the time to commit to peace, sign and ratify the treaty, and usher in a new era of prosperity for the people of the South Caucasus.”  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Tuesday in Washington. Rubio requested “support for peace in Ukraine and the South Caucasus,” his office said.Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), Turkey's national public broadcaster, reported: “US Secretary of State Marco Rubio welcomed the agreement on a peace treaty between Armenia and Azerbaijan, underscoring the importance of lasting security and prosperity in the region, according to the State Department.” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signs the guestbook during his visit to the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum in Jerusalem February 16, 2025. (credit: Jack Guez/Pool via Reuters)“The secretary welcomed the agreement on a peace treaty with Azerbaijan and underlined the importance of a lasting peace to break the cycle of regional conflict and bring security and prosperity to the South Caucasus,” TRT quoted State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce as saying after a phone call between Rubio and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan on Tuesday.Fidan had held talks in Washington about the peace deal, media outlets in Azerbaijan reported. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan had informed Russian President Vladimir Putin about the completion of talks on a peace treaty with Azerbaijan, Russian state media reported earlier this month.Pope Francis also welcomed the chance for peace between the countries, according to other reports.As Fidan was in Washington, Araghchi met with Pashinyan in Yerevan on Tuesday.

He said ties were now moving toward increased consolidation.”Iranian support for ArmeniaMeanwhile, Araghchi also discussed the importance of peace in the South Caucasus region and discussed Iran's role in the region.“Foreign Minister Araghchi said... the growing Iran-Armenia relationship had mutual benefits for both countries and guaranteed peace and stability in the region,” IRNA reported. “He emphasized that Iran and Armenia should, by taking advantage of their civilizational, cultural, and historical ties, as well as people-to-people relations, strive to promote relations and cooperation in all fields, especially in the economy, trade, tourism, transit, transportation, and energy fields. Araghchi also said that security and stability in the South Caucasus was of strategic value to Iran.” Araghchi also held a meeting with his Armenian counterpart, Ararat Mirzoyan.Iran has welcomed the potential deal with Baku.

He said ties were now moving toward increased consolidation.”Iranian support for ArmeniaMeanwhile, Araghchi also discussed the importance of peace in the South Caucasus region and discussed Iran's role in the region.“Foreign Minister Araghchi said... the growing Iran-Armenia relationship had mutual benefits for both countries and guaranteed peace and stability in the region,” IRNA reported. “He emphasized that Iran and Armenia should, by taking advantage of their civilizational, cultural, and historical ties, as well as people-to-people relations, strive to promote relations and cooperation in all fields, especially in the economy, trade, tourism, transit, transportation, and energy fields.

This could build confidence toward a larger ceasefire.

Israel stands on the precipice of a decisive victory over its adversaries. As the military campaign in Gaza resumes, Hamas finds itself with almost no options and even fewer allies. Its infrastructure is decimated and its argument that the war with Israel was over has been unraveled.Meanwhile, the Houthis are preoccupied with their own battles against US forces. Hezbollah finds itself deeply wounded and withdrawn from southern Lebanon and Syria and unable to help Hamas. Similarly, Iran is in no position to help or support Hamas at this time.Israel, undeterred, continues its operations in Gaza, while Hamas struggles to assert any meaningful control. This decisive shift is further reinforced by a looming geopolitical earthquake: the Saudi-Israel-US normalization deal.The Arab world is realigning, and Hamas – along with Iran and its proxies – can see the writing on the wall. Adding to this, in a stunning reversal, Cairo has agreed to allow up to half a million Palestinians to “temporarily” resettle in the Sinai.  This is more than just a policy shift. It is an admission that Gaza, as it once was, is no longer viable. This is no small concession.At the core of this shift is the simple fact that as long as Hamas refuses to surrender hostages and relinquish control, no meaningful reconstruction in Gaza can take place. Israel has shown no indication that it will cease military operations while Hamas has shown no willingness to de-arm, evacuate, or return all the hostages.Palestinian Hamas terrorists take part in an anti-Israel rally in Gaza City May 22, 2021 (credit: REUTERS/MOHAMMED SALEM)Meanwhile, reports indicate that Somaliland has agreed to take in Palestinian refugees, further eliminating the argument that Gaza cannot be emptied of its terrorist rulers. Slowly but surely, the pieces are falling into place for a long-term solution that neutralizes Hamas once and for all.With the newly appointed IDF chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, Israel is poised to complete its mission. Total victory is within reachParadoxically, the primary opposition to Israel's march toward victory comes from within the country itself. Elements of the Israeli Left, segments of the retired military establishment, and certain political factions continue to resist the full realization of this military and strategic objective.However, the return of 198 out of 250 hostages is a testament to the effectiveness of Israel's operations and its willingness to engage in “deals” with its barbaric enemies to secure its people.It is important for the whole society to recognize that the status quo of partial victories where reservists are required to return to the same positions every four to six years is untenable and is not fair to them or to Israeli society at large.   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  The broader strategic landscape only reinforces this total victory. The Trump administration's unflinching support for Israel – its direct action against the Houthis in Yemen, its maximum pressure campaign on Iran, and its willingness to “open the gates of hell” on Hamas – has provided Israel with a perfect window to complete what it started.It is no coincidence that Defense Minister Israel Katz has recently reiterated the message: If Hamas does not return every last hostage: “The gates of hell will open.”It is now clearer than ever that Hamas's October 7 attack was not just an act of terror – it was an act of desperation. Hamas saw normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia coming and recognized it as the final nail in the coffin of the so-called “Arab-Israeli conflict.” They understood what that meant for their prospects of realizing their dreams of destroying Israel; their brutal assault was a last-ditch effort akin to a Hail Mary pass in American football to stop it.As events continue to unfold, Israel's position continues to reveal itself. The world is witnessing the final unraveling of Hamas, the crumbling of Iran's regional proxies, and the emergence of a new Middle East order. Israel is winning decisively.The question that remains is whether Israeli society can realize this or will it allow for internal discord to squander what could be a defining victory. Israel is on the last leg of a long marathon and it needs to be patient to realize that the finish line is right around the corner.The writer is co-chair of a new organization leading the effort to combat antisemitism on social media. drosen@emissary4all.org

The Atlantic released screenshots of the private Signal chat in which top Trump administration officials shared plans to strike the Houthis in Yemen.In a Wednesday article published shortly before Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliff started their testimony before the House Intelligence Committee, the Atlantic posted screenshots of US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth providing extremely detailed updates for strikes on Houthi terrorists.   In the messages, Hegseth provided detailed information about when US forces would strike Houthi targets, as well as what planes and drones would be used.

I don't text him, he wasn't on my phone,"" he said in a Tuesday Fox News interview. Goldberg noted in a Wednesday article with Atlantic reporter Shane Harris that the messages occured ""31 minutes before the first US warplanes launched, and two hours and one minute before the beginning of a period in which a primary target, the Houthi 'Target Terrorist,' was expected to be killed by these American aircraft.""If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests — or someone merely indiscreet and with access to social media — the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds.

However, in light of Gabbard, Waltz, and Ratcliff's statements, the editorial board decided ""that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions.""Goldberg said in an interview with MSNBC that his publication did redact sensitive pieces of information in the follow-up article. “We did redact one piece of information because we felt, on our own, that we felt it was best to do.

The pressure the IDF will exert will be “more and more powerful,” and will include “seizing territory” and “doing other things” in Gaza if Hamas does not return Israeli hostages, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in the Knesset plenum on Wednesday. The prime minister did not elaborate further.Netanyahu's comments came during a debate known as the “40 Signatures Debate,” which is the Israeli version of the British “Prime Minister's Questions”. The debate included a series of short speeches in the prime minister's presence, after which the prime minister and opposition leader gave concluding speeches.In his speech, Netanyahu repeated conspiracy theories about a “deep state.”  ""Democracy is not in danger; the bureaucracy is in danger, the deep state is in danger,” the prime minister said. “When I say 'bureaucracy,' I mean a small group of officials struggling to maintain the levers of power in the country.”“Democracy is, first and foremost, the rule of the people. It is not the rule of officials, not the rule of former leaders, and not the rule of media outlets. In a democracy, the people are sovereign, and they demand that their vote in the ballot box be reflected in policy. This does not mean the government has unlimited power. We do not have a tyrannical rule, but it is impossible to expect the government to have negligible power,” Netanyahu said. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is seen in the Knesset plenum, in Jerusalem, March 25, 2025 (credit: DANNY SHEMTOV/KNESSET SPOKESPERSON'S OFFICE)Opposition leader MK Yair Lapid dedicated his speech to attacking the 2025 national budget, which passed into law on Tuesday. Lapid said to Netanyahu, ""You carried out yesterday the greatest theft in the history of the country. You exploit the Israeli middle class, squeeze it, all for one purpose: to survive politically.""High levels of crime in the Arab sectorThe official topic of Wednesday's debate was the high levels of crime in the Arab sector, and opposition MKs blasted the prime minister for the high crime levels. Hadash-Ta'al chairman MK Ayman Odeh opened the discussion by presenting a series of statistics. Odeh, quoting the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in Israel, said that since Netanyahu took office, there were 14 times more homicides in the Arab sector than the Jewish state.Until 2008, the ratio was 3:1. Just 14.8% of homicides in the Arab sector have been solved, compared to approximately 70% in the Jewish sector, and even those were “usually when the perpetrator turned himself in,” Odeh said.Odeh noted that the annual number of homicides had risen by 230% in five years, and 58 people have been killed since the beginning of 2025.  Arab citizens were 18% of the population but suffered 80% of violent crime.   Stay updated with the latest news!

Abbas did not provide proof of this claim. During the debate, families of hostages and victims of the October 7 held up signs saying, “If we have returned to October 6, return my child.”

For years, Viktor Frankl's books occupied a cherished spot on my shelf. I would often recommend Man's Search for Meaning to friends over coffee, explaining logotherapy's principles with the confidence of someone who understood suffering—at least intellectually. That illusion shattered on October 7, 2023.That morning, as sirens wailed across Israel, my 21-year-old son—a tank sergeant with an infectious laugh and dreams for the future, like so many young Israelis—was killed defending our southern border. In an instant, all my academic knowledge about grief crumbled. The theories I had taught in lecture halls suddenly felt hollow, written in a language I no longer recognized.“How could a concentration camp survivor speak about meaning?” I found myself wondering in the small hours, staring at photos of my smiling son, forever frozen at 21. “How can I, having buried my child, possibly find meaning in this unjust world?” These questions echoed not just in my home, but in hundreds of Israeli living rooms left with similar gaping wounds.  Returning to Frankl's work with new eyesAs we approach March 2025—marking 120 years since Frankl's birth—I find myself returning to his work with new eyes. The psychiatrist who survived Auschwitz after losing his parents, brother, and wife developed a therapeutic approach centered on finding meaning even in the most unbearable suffering. Today, his ideas pulse with renewed urgency through our wounded nation. Viktor Frankl 1972 (credit: PICRYL)Frankl's “tragic triad”—pain, guilt, and death—has shifted from academic concept to daily reality. The searing pain of absence. The whispered guilt: “Why him?” The disorienting presence of death that changes how others see you, speak to you—or avoid you altogether.A week after the funeral, I forced myself back to work. Through a chance encounter with Professor Tami Ronen in a university corridor, I found myself joining a logotherapy study group led by Professor Pninit Russo-Netzer. The synchronicity felt like my son's gentle nudge from somewhere beyond.Among Frankl's many insights from the camps, one feels especially prophetic now: prisoners who maintained a purpose—reuniting with loved ones, completing unfinished work—had markedly better chances of survival. The human spirit, he taught, can withstand almost anything if anchored to meaning.

That morning, as sirens wailed across Israel, my 21-year-old son—a tank sergeant with an infectious laugh and dreams for the future, like so many young Israelis—was killed defending our southern border. In an instant, all my academic knowledge about grief crumbled. The theories I had taught in lecture halls suddenly felt hollow, written in a language I no longer recognized.“How could a concentration camp survivor speak about meaning?” I found myself wondering in the small hours, staring at photos of my smiling son, forever frozen at 21. “How can I, having buried my child, possibly find meaning in this unjust world?” These questions echoed not just in my home, but in hundreds of Israeli living rooms left with similar gaping wounds.  Returning to Frankl's work with new eyesAs we approach March 2025—marking 120 years since Frankl's birth—I find myself returning to his work with new eyes. The psychiatrist who survived Auschwitz after losing his parents, brother, and wife developed a therapeutic approach centered on finding meaning even in the most unbearable suffering. Today, his ideas pulse with renewed urgency through our wounded nation. Viktor Frankl 1972 (credit: PICRYL)Frankl's “tragic triad”—pain, guilt, and death—has shifted from academic concept to daily reality. The searing pain of absence. The whispered guilt: “Why him?” The disorienting presence of death that changes how others see you, speak to you—or avoid you altogether.A week after the funeral, I forced myself back to work. Through a chance encounter with Professor Tami Ronen in a university corridor, I found myself joining a logotherapy study group led by Professor Pninit Russo-Netzer. The synchronicity felt like my son's gentle nudge from somewhere beyond.Among Frankl's many insights from the camps, one feels especially prophetic now: prisoners who maintained a purpose—reuniting with loved ones, completing unfinished work—had markedly better chances of survival.

The centerpiece exhibit at the Eretz Israel Museum (MUZA) is not by an Israeli or even a Jew. However, the art collection by Greek artist Vagelis Kyris blends contemporary photography, traditional embroidery, and MUZA's Jewish and local costumes to create the collection Thread and Light. The costumes in the collection fuse Jews in the Diaspora, Bedouin, Muslims, and Christians. Kyris's unique perspective shows the origins of the costumes and the identities of the people who once wore them, creating a united collection. This was methodically chosen during a time that marks the struggle over individual identity and the lack of social consensus over shared values. “[It's] a message to the people for peace, for love. That's why we don't only have Jewish costumes; we have some local costumes from Bedouin, from [Palestinians], and from everybody. People can live together in peace and love,” Kyris told The Jerusalem Post. The exhibit, in the museum's Jewish Culture and Folklore Pavilion, features costumes that date back to the 18th century and centers on Jewish culture around the world, such as Morocco, Iran, or the Netherlands. With 80 models of men and women, the photos match his iconic style of Renaissance and Baroque-inspired photography.Kyris is bold and dramatic throughout all of his pieces; within the artwork and outside in his photography, he uses the chiaroscuro technique that balances lights and darks.

The dark room is illuminated only by the small lights dangling over the heads of each model in the art piece, highlighting the texture of the embroidery. Eleftheria Deko, an Emmy winner in lighting and design, carefully selects the lights. The music is also carefully selected by Greek composer Dimitris Maronidis, who composed individual pieces for each concept. The tone set by the two is dark and dramatic, complementing and capturing the tone of the photography. Even with the support of Kyris's large team, it still took up to six months to complete a piece. The research aspect was only one part of the embroidery process, necessary to truly capture the traditional style of craft; the other was the time-consuming process to actually execute the embroidery. The support of other artists was needed to complete a piece.Embroidery to Kyris also represents the nature of a person as well as a garment's history, indicating the success of a country, its time, and the symbolic nature of the art. Kyris uses Greece under Ottoman rule as an example: though little art was made, garments that the average person made showed symbols and messages – an inconspicuous art.“It's not enough to be a good embroiderer. To do this work, it's not only the technique of embroidery. You have to understand and feel the pose, because we embroider on a pixel with highlights, with shadow, with everything,” said Kyris.“If someone is [embroidering] without the talent, to see where the right place to [embroider] is – it's a disaster.” Though Kyris is not Jewish, he developed a connection to Israel through friends who exposed him to conversations about Jewish life, culture, and religion. Coupled alongside this “treasure,” he calls MUZA's costume collection and the proximity of Greece and Israel his inspiration, which came naturally to him.“I feel that there is a connection between the Jewish people and Greek people because we have the same sea, the Mediterranean.” The exhibit opens on Friday, March 28. eretzmuseum.org.il


Kyris's unique perspective shows the origins of the costumes and the identities of the people who once wore them, creating a united collection. This was methodically chosen during a time that marks the struggle over individual identity and the lack of social consensus over shared values. “[It's] a message to the people for peace, for love. That's why we don't only have Jewish costumes; we have some local costumes from Bedouin, from [Palestinians], and from everybody. People can live together in peace and love,” Kyris told The Jerusalem Post. The exhibit, in the museum's Jewish Culture and Folklore Pavilion, features costumes that date back to the 18th century and centers on Jewish culture around the world, such as Morocco, Iran, or the Netherlands. With 80 models of men and women, the photos match his iconic style of Renaissance and Baroque-inspired photography.Kyris is bold and dramatic throughout all of his pieces; within the artwork and outside in his photography, he uses the chiaroscuro technique that balances lights and darks.

The United States has named China and India as the primary sources for “illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment”.

According to the Annual Threat Assessment report of the US Intelligence Community, fentanyl and other synthetic opioids are the most lethal drugs trafficked into the United States, causing more than 52,000 U.S. deaths in 12 months ending in October 2024. 

“This represents a nearly 33 percent decrease in synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths compared to the same reporting time frame the previous year, according to CDC provisional data, and may be because of the availability and accessibility of naloxone,” the report released by the Office of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard stated.

“Nonstate groups are often enabled, both directly and indirectly, by state actors, such as China and India as sources of precursors and equipment for drug traffickers,” the report stated in its foreword.

On March 21, an India-based chemical manufacturing company and three of its high-level employees were charged in a federal court in Washington DC in a case related to illegally importing precursor chemicals used to make illicit fentanyl.

According to a PTI report, federal agents also arrested two of the top-ranking employees of Hyderabad-based Vasudha Pharma Chem Limited (VPC) in New York City.

Fentanyl is a potent opioid drug that is blamed for widespread drug addiction in the US. 

The Trump administration has initiated a crackdown on the illegal import of fentanyl and also linked it with tariff adjustments in the case of some countries.

According to an AP report, in his executive order on the first 10% tariff, Trump had accused China of subsidizing chemical companies to export fentanyl and related “precursor chemicals” and of providing a safe haven for Chinese criminal organisations that launder the revenues from the opioid trade.

The amount of fentanyl seized at the US-Mexico border fell dramatically since January to its lowest level since December 2021, Bloomberg quoted the new US Customs and Border Protection data.

Some 590 pounds of the deadly synthetic opioid were intercepted in February, down 40% on January's 990 pounds.

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order introducing stricter election rules in the United States, including requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration and ensuring all ballots are received by Election Day.

The order mentions that the US has failed “to enforce basic and necessary election protections” and, directs states to work with federal agencies to share voter lists and prosecute election crimes.

It also warns that states failing to comply could face cuts to federal funding.

The order is expected to face legal challenges, as states have broad authority over election rules. It aligns with Trump's longstanding criticism of election processes, as he has frequently claimed rigging even before results are announced, news agency Associated Press reported.

Since the 2020 election, Trump has repeatedly challenged certain voting methods and claimed widespread fraud was to blame for his loss to Democrat Joe Biden.

Trump has repeatedly targeted mail voting, alleging it is insecure and prone to fraud, even as he has adjusted his stance due to its popularity among voters, including Republicans.

By requiring documentary proof of citizenship, the order signals that the president is not waiting for congressional Republicans to pass the long-anticipated Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which aims to introduce the same requirement.

Republicans argue the measure is necessary to restore public confidence in elections. Voting in federal elections by noncitizens is already illegal and can lead to felony charges and deportation.

Voting rights groups have raised concerns that the requirement could disenfranchise voters. A 2023 report by the Brennan Center for Justice and other organisations estimated that 9 percent of voting-age US citizens—about 21.3 million people—lack readily available proof of citizenship.

There are also worries that married women who have changed their names may face difficulties registering, as their birth certificates list their maiden names. Similar issues arose in recent town elections in New Hampshire, where a new state law requires proof of citizenship for voter registration.

Trump's order directs federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration, and the State Department, to share federal data with election officials to help identify noncitizens on voter rolls.

It also instructs the attorney general to “prioritize enforcement of federal election integrity laws” in states that do not share information on suspected election crimes with the federal government.

The order seeks to ensure that votes are “cast and received” by Election Day and ties federal funding to state compliance. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico allow mailed ballots received after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Trump's directive is expected to face legal challenges, as the Constitution grants states authority over elections. While Congress has the power to regulate voting, such as through the Voting Rights Act, the Constitution gives states primary control over setting election “times, places, and manner.”

President Donald Trump, citing practices in countries like India and Brazil, where voter identification is linked to biometric databases, signed an executive order on Tuesday to overhaul the US election system.

The executive order states that despite pioneering self-government, the United States now “fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections” used by both developed and developing nations.

“India and Brazil, for example, are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the United States largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship,” the order reads.

The US President called for free and fair elections, emphasising the need to ensure votes are accurately counted and protected from fraud or illegal interference.

“Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic. The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,” the US President stated in the executive order.

Trump said that under the Constitution, state governments must safeguard American elections in compliance with federal laws that protect voting rights and guard against illegal voting, discrimination, fraud, and other forms of malfeasance.

He added that the United States has not adequately enforced federal election requirements, such as prohibiting states from counting ballots received after Election Day or allowing non-citizens to register to vote.

Voter citizenship verification: The order mandates that US citizens provide documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration. It also requires the recording of details such as the document type, issue date, and expiration when verifying citizenship.

State and federal coordination: States will now have access to federal databases to verify voter citizenship. The Department of Justice will assist in reviewing voter registration lists to ensure compliance with federal citizenship requirements.

Enforcement of non-citizen voting laws: The order stresses the need for strict enforcement of laws prohibiting non-citizens from registering or voting in federal elections. It calls for collaboration with state attorneys general to address unlawful voting by non-citizens.

Voter registration list maintenance: States are required to maintain accurate and up-to-date voter registration lists, in line with the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.

Support for state eligibility verification: States will gain access to federal databases, such as the Social Security Number Verification and Death Master File, to verify voter eligibility. The secretary of defence will also update the Federal Post Card Application to include proof of citizenship and state voting eligibility.

Election Assistance Commission reforms: States that fail to comply with federal election laws, including those requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, will lose federal funding. The order also mandates updates to the voluntary voting system guidelines to prevent fraud and mistakes in the voting process.

Prosecution of election crimes: The attorney general will prioritise action against election-related crimes such as fraudulent registration and voter fraud. States are encouraged to share information on suspected violations to aid enforcement.

Voting system security: The order prohibits non-citizens from participating in the administration of federal elections, including handling election equipment or ballots. It also calls for a review of the security of electronic voting systems, especially those connected to the internet, to prevent unauthorised access or malicious interference.

Election Day compliance: States must adhere to the federal Election Day deadline, preventing the counting of ballots received after this date. Compliance with this deadline will be a condition for receiving federal funding.

Preventing foreign interference: The order prioritises efforts to prevent foreign interference in US elections, including prohibiting foreign nationals from influencing elections through financial contributions or other means. The attorney general will take steps to enforce laws that restrict foreign influence.

An astrological event of substantial significance is taking place on the night of 29 March 2025, when Saturn enters the zodiac sign of Pisces. Saturn will stay in Pisces until June 3, 2027, after which it will temporarily move to Aries but return to Pisces on October 20, 2027. It will eventually leave Pisces on February 23, 2028. This two-and-a-half-year period holds utmost importance because it is a unique combination of trials and opportunities for growth and development.

In astrology, Saturn is the taskmaster among the planets, and very often, this planet teaches us the lessons of discipline, responsibility, and maturity. This planet's transit is about 29.5 years, impacting a single zodiac sign for around two and a half years on average. It acts as an instrument of transition, making us face reality, hammering out the foundations, and growing through the experiences it brings in.

As per Vedic astrology, Saturn's transition is considered to be one of the most intense phases of an individual's astrological experience, bringing along life-altering changes. This is the time when debts incurred over multiple lifetimes are redeemed, and learnings come through difficult life lessons. Saturn makes one introspective and analyses aspects of life. It asks the native to correct or set right what needs to be put in order and mature up where he or she may not have bothered initially.

The transit of Saturn in Pisces is a meaningful time, bringing an exciting combination of energies that could radically change our lives. Pisces is the ocean of intuition, dreams, and emotions running deep, and amalgamating this ethereal sign with that of Saturn, a planet typifying constraints, obligations, and harsh truths, makes for a truly profound transformation. The alignment happens every 29.5 years, thus promising to be a significant period of transformation, particularly intensifying with regard to how one manages one's innermost hopes and fears.

Saturn plays the role of a hard-tasking teacher under this transit, bringing down the often nebulous and idealistic world of Pisces to a reality check. Our dreams and ideals are tested against the harshest truths of reality. A fantasy meets the cold, hard ground, and we part ways, demanding to see some of our dreams transformed into practical realities and some determined unpractical fantasies. This reality check is important because it keeps our focus on realistic goals, thus encouraging a more practical approach to achieving dreams.

Saturn in Pisces also has an important spiritual lesson on discipline. However, there would be much more to integrating priors such as structured spiritual practices like meditation or yoga into everyday lives, thus, in effect, stabilising the internal world for resilience against the mounting chaos of external life. These might help us provide balance against the extremely variable Pisces with the thrown Saturn energy.

Another crucial lesson that this transit teaches is boundary setting in all spheres, as well as personal and emotional boundaries. Those ceaseless extremes of Pisces's energies often lead to an individual bearing more emotional burdens than he should willingly carry, both from love relationships and the compassion that continues to thrive in other people's experiences. With Saturn, we learn the necessity of creating boundaries to affirm one's energy and emotional safety. It teaches us that saying no or stepping back is not just fair but quite essential for health and sanity maintenance.

Saturn's transit through Pisces in 2025 will mark an extremely significant time for different zodiac signs, each one experiencing its own changes and challenges. This interstellar shift will cause deep changes in these signs, thus segregating them into those experiencing a time of transformation and change and those who are opening their lives to welcome new energy.

Aquarius: The concluding stage of Sadhe-Sati symbolises an important moment for those born under the Aquarius sign. The last phase, worthy of relief and achievement, comes to an end because the lingering energy has already tried the very existence and patience of an Aquarian. What was learned as a lesson during this trying period will now begin to be acknowledged as wisdom. This acquired wisdom will help Aquarians to use their resilient selves for better opportunities in the coming phases.

Pisces: Here in Sadhe, Sati reaches its peak for all born with their Moon in Pisces. Saturn, from this position, represents the deep waters of Sadhe Sati for these souls. A critical opportunity for introspection and personal development, the Pisceans are meant to consciously deal with their reality and reassess their ambitions by letting go of anything that stands in the way of their greater purposes. Thus, this phase will bring with it the challenge of emotional depths, therefore testing their abilities to rebound and reinforce their emotional boundaries.

Aries: The commencement of Sadhe-Sati for Aries sets the focus on long-range planning and reassessing life objectives. During this phase, Aries people will start pondering deeper questions relating to life, career paths, relationships, and personal projections. This phase of existence will weigh heavily on their generally free spirit as Saturn announces the need for structure and foresight, creating the stage for outstanding personal evolution.

Sagittarius: Saturn will be coming in the fourth house for Sagittarians, which will bring changes in the areas relating to home or safety. Such movements could inspire them to create a more stable emotional environment and rethink what security means to them. Now is the time to fortify foundations literally and figuratively, including moving or redesigning their living spaces.

Leo: This year, Leos celebrate the beginning of Ashtam Shani. It will concentrate on the professional and the health sectors. Their leadership skills and endurance against career challenges will be tested during this time. Illness may open the opportunity to be reminded of how to balance ambition with the needs of the body. Adjustments in work or in one's behaviour will have to be made.

Capricorn: With the completion of Sadhe Sati, Capricorns would enjoy great relief in burdens. A time that is fresh with opportunities to achieve and progress marks the end of hard lessons and tough trials. Freed from the constraining energy of Saturn, Capricorns have now advanced with more wisdom and understanding in preparation to tackle new challenges with renewed vigour.

Scorpios: Just when their Saturn dhaiya comes to an end in life, for Scorpios, it marks the end of an intense trial of their strength and patience. This marks the beginning of a new phase with increased freedom of emotion and profession. Scorpios broaden their horizons, shrugging off the heavy Saturn burdens over their shoulders and feeling less suffocated from then on.

Cancer: For Cancerians, the phase of Ashtam Shani will be over. This phase has perhaps lent some emotional and professional pressures in their lives. The draining energies toward the end of this period signal freedom from such severe pressures and open options for new roads to travel. Cancerians will have a time for recovery and a time for rebuilding since they can now strengthen their careers and personal lives.

Different signs will view all these transits from different angles, but it will be significant for everyone involved as they will mark some changes to be borne in the future. The transformations and new beginnings heralded by Saturn's passage into Pisces promise growth, learning, and, ultimately, a deeper understanding of themselves and the world in which they live.

A new U.S. missile system deployed in the Philippines puts key Chinese military and commercial hubs within striking distance and hands President Trump an early test of his commitment to deterring Chinese aggression against American allies in Asia.

 Last year, the U.S. Army moved the Typhon Missile System, which can fire missiles as far as 1,200 miles, to a base on Luzon Island in the northern Philippines. It is the first time since the Cold War that the U.S. military has deployed a land-based launching system with such a long range outside its borders.  The Typhon, military experts say, is part of a broader strategic repositioning by the American military as it seeks to counter Beijing's huge buildup of intermediate- and long-range missiles in the Pacific. In the event of a conflict with China, land-based missile systems such as the Typhon could be central to defending key U.S. allies such as the Philippines, which has clashed with China over Beijing's claims to nearly all of the South China Sea, and Taiwan, which Beijing has threatened to take, by force if necessary. The Chinese government has responded to the Typhon's deployment with alarm, rebuking the U.S. and the Philippines for fueling what it called an arms race. Now, the Typhon, which was moved to the Philippines during the Biden administration, has emerged as an important litmus test amid concerns among American allies over the Trump administration's willingness to come to their defense in a conflict with China. A visit to the Philippines and Japan by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth this week could provide more clarity on the administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. The Typhon can fire two types of missiles. Tomahawk missiles bearing conventional warheads have a range of around 1,200 miles, putting into reach much of southeastern China along with the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. In the case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, such missiles could target air-defense and radar systems on the Chinese coast as well as the Chinese military's control-and-command centers in Guangzhou and Nanjing. The shorter-range Standard Missile 6, or SM-6, could target Chinese or other enemy ships and aircraft, and intercept cruise missiles and ballistic missiles fired at U.S. interests. Army officials have said that it is the only missile in the U.S. arsenal capable of intercepting, at least in late flight, the hypersonic missiles that both China and Russia have been testing. Flashpoint with ChinaThe U.S. Army first moved two Typhon launchers, an operations center and support vehicles to Luzon Island for joint military exercises between the two countries a year ago. The Army, which first took delivery of the system in late 2022, said it wanted to test it in the hot and humid climate of the Indo-Pacific region. The Army later agreed to extend the deployment indefinitely. Since then, Philippine commanders have said they would like to buy the Typhon for their own military and the country's troops are now being trained on using the system. Despite the limited immediate military value of the deployment—a full Typhon battery has four launchers and it didn't come with any missiles—Beijing's reaction was forceful. An image provided by the U.S. Army shows a Typhon launcher firing an SM-6 missile in an exercise in New Mexico.China's Foreign Ministry demanded the Typhon's removal and threatened retaliatory action. “China will not sit idly by when its security interests are harmed or threatened,” the ministry said in February. Russia, a close ally of China, also denounced the move. Russian President Vladimir Putin likened the deployment to that of Pershing II missile launchers in West Germany in 1983, a step that Soviet leaders at the time interpreted as a preparation for a pre-emptive strike on the Soviet Union by the West. The Pershing II deployment prompted large protests in Europe and the U.S. and eventually led to the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with the Soviet Union. That treaty banned the possession, production and flight testing of ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 300 miles and 3,400 miles. But the INF treaty didn't include China, allowing Beijing to assemble an enormous arsenal of such missiles. In 2019, during Trump's first term, the U.S. pulled out of the treaty and the Army began preparations for a new intermediate-range missile system. Mounted in trailers on the back of trucks, the Typhon is relatively easy to move, including on military transport planes. Compared with ship-based missile launchers, land-based missile systems are harder to spot and take out early on in a conflict. In the future, the U.S. could deploy the Typhon in locations across the Indo-Pacific region or sell it to allies there. That would leave adversaries guessing from where they could be hit. “The U.S. is shifting away from a reliance on big centralized bases, towards a more dispersed resilient force posture,” said Shawn Rostker, a research analyst with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. A potential bargaining chipThe Typhon's deployment in the Philippines was a recognition of the increasingly strategic importance of the Philippines under the Biden administration. The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has expanded access to military bases for U.S. forces, and Philippine vessels and airplanes have pushed back against Chinese forces in the South China Sea, a thoroughfare for nearly one-third of global maritime trade. Other American allies in Asia, including Japan, have so far balked at hosting U.S. missiles capable of striking China, but are developing their own comparable capabilities. There have been some signs that the Trump administration also sees the Typhon as key to its strategy in the Indo-Pacific. “We proved the MRC's deterrent effect via a dynamic deployment in the Philippines and look forward to all future power projection opportunities!” Dan Driscoll, the new Army secretary, said in a post on X earlier this month, using the abbreviation for the army's technical name for the Typhon, Mid-Range Capability. Others, however, have warned that moving such powerful U.S. missile systems close to China risks a spiral of escalation and, perhaps by accident, a war between two nuclear superpowers. An image provided by the U.S. Army shows American and Philippine soldiers working on Typhon equipment in Luzon Island in the northern Philippines.“Just the presence of the system causes those escalation risks, and that's before you even consider what happens if you use the system in a conflict,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a libertarian-leaning Washington-based think tank that backs a more restrained U.S. foreign policy. Similar views have been espoused by some senior Trump appointees, including Andrew Byers, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, who has favored a less contentious relationship with Beijing. Before taking office, Byers suggested pulling U.S. assets out of the Philippines in return for China's coast guard running fewer patrols in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Marcos himself has said he would remove the Typhon system if China ceased its aggressions in the South China Sea. But in the wake of Trump's talks with Putin over Ukraine, there are also concerns in the Philippines that Typhon could become part of a deal between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Such a deal might sacrifice the interests of the smaller American ally, said Richard Heydarian, a lecturer in international studies at the University of the Philippines's Asian Center. “What the Philippines does with [the Typhon] and what the Trump administration will do about it,” he said, “determines how the game of deterrence will play out in the coming months and years.” Write to Gabriele Steinhauser at Gabriele.Steinhauser@wsj.com

“The U.S. is shifting away from a reliance on big centralized bases, towards a more dispersed resilient force posture,” said Shawn Rostker, a research analyst with the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

The Typhon's deployment in the Philippines was a recognition of the increasingly strategic importance of the Philippines under the Biden administration. The country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., has expanded access to military bases for U.S. forces, and Philippine vessels and airplanes have pushed back against Chinese forces in the South China Sea, a thoroughfare for nearly one-third of global maritime trade.

Other American allies in Asia, including Japan, have so far balked at hosting U.S. missiles capable of striking China, but are developing their own comparable capabilities.

There have been some signs that the Trump administration also sees the Typhon as key to its strategy in the Indo-Pacific.

“We proved the MRC's deterrent effect via a dynamic deployment in the Philippines and look forward to all future power projection opportunities!” Dan Driscoll, the new Army secretary, said in a post on X earlier this month, using the abbreviation for the army's technical name for the Typhon, Mid-Range Capability.

Others, however, have warned that moving such powerful U.S. missile systems close to China risks a spiral of escalation and, perhaps by accident, a war between two nuclear superpowers.

“Just the presence of the system causes those escalation risks, and that's before you even consider what happens if you use the system in a conflict,” said Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a libertarian-leaning Washington-based think tank that backs a more restrained U.S. foreign policy.

Similar views have been espoused by some senior Trump appointees, including Andrew Byers, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, who has favored a less contentious relationship with Beijing. Before taking office, Byers suggested pulling U.S. assets out of the Philippines in return for China's coast guard running fewer patrols in disputed areas of the South China Sea.

Marcos himself has said he would remove the Typhon system if China ceased its aggressions in the South China Sea.

But in the wake of Trump's talks with Putin over Ukraine, there are also concerns in the Philippines that Typhon could become part of a deal between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Such a deal might sacrifice the interests of the smaller American ally, said Richard Heydarian, a lecturer in international studies at the University of the Philippines's Asian Center.

“What the Philippines does with [the Typhon] and what the Trump administration will do about it,” he said, “determines how the game of deterrence will play out in the coming months and years.”

For 12 freezing hours, a pilot and two children clung to the wing of their crashed plane, half submerged in an icy Alaska lake, their survival uncertain until a good samaritan spotted the wreckage and set a rescue in motion.

While scrolling through Facebook on Sunday night, Terry Godes saw a post seeking help to find a missing plane. By Monday morning, he was at Tustumena Lake near the edge of a glacier when he spotted what he thought was wreckage.

“It kind of broke my heart to see that, but as I got closer down and lower, I could see that there are three people on top of the wing,” he told The Associated Press on Tuesday.

He said a little prayer, then continued to approach and witnessed a miracle.

“They were alive and responsive and moving around,"" he said, adding they waved at him as he approached.

The Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser, carrying a pilot and two juvenile family members, went missing on Sunday while on a recreational sightseeing tour from Soldotna to Skilak Lake.

The Alaska National Guard rescued the three from the eastern edge of Tustumena Lake on Monday after Godes informed other pilots searching for the plane that he had located it.

Another pilot, Dale Eicher, heard Godes' radio call and, being closer to Skilak Lake with better cell reception, notified troopers and gave them the plane's coordinates.

“I wasn't sure if we would find them, especially because there was a cloud layer over quite a bit of the mountains so they could have very easily been in those clouds that we couldn't get to,” Eicher said.

But he said that finding them within an hour of starting the search and finding them alive “was very good news.”

The three were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, Alaska State Troopers said.

“They spent a long, cold, dark, and wet night out on top of a wing of an airplane that they weren't planning on,” Godes said.

He mentioned that many miracles were involved, from the plane not sinking to the survivors staying on the wing, and the fact that they survived the night in temperatures dropping into the 20s (subzero Celsius).

The plane was mostly submerged in the lake, with only the wing and the top of the rudder visible above the ice and water.

Located about 130 km southwest of Anchorage, the 24,200-hectare Tustumena Lake is known for its sudden, dangerous winds, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.

Donald Trump brutally shut down CNN's Kaitlan Collins during a press briefing on Tuesday, March 25, when she attempted to question him about the “Signal” messaging incident that involved various top administration officials. Collins tried to pepper the president with a question during a meeting with ambassadors at the White House.

“Mr. President, you said that your national security learned a lesson after a reporter …,” Collins began.

However, before Collins could even finish her sentence, Trump replied sharply, “Excuse me, I didn't pick you.”

Trump then went on to point at a different reporter in the gallery, and said, “Go ahead.”

The Signal controversy surfaced after The Atlantic revealed that Jeffrey Goldberg, its editor-in-chief, added to a secret group chat by mistake where high-ranking Trump administration members had been discussing an upcoming military strike against Yemen's Houthi rebels. As the administration's handling of classified conversations was questioned following Goldberg's inclusion, Trump initially said he did not know about the incident. However, he later defended National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who was allegedly responsible for Goldberg's unexpected inclusion. Trump labelled the mistake as a “glitch.”

Collins, a frequent Trump nemesis, had clashed with the president just last month. During a press conference at the Oval Office in February, Collins asked Trump, “Do you trust President Putin?”

“I believe that — yeah,” Trump replied, adding, “I believe that he would like to see something happen. I trust him on the subject. I think he would like to see something happen. I think it could have happened a long time ago.”

Trump then called out Joe Biden, saying, “I think Biden — number one, it shouldn't have started, but it did, and now all those cities are knocked down, like demolition sites.”

“This should've been done by Biden years ago. This should've never been allowed to happen,” Trump added, referring to the Russia-Ukraine war. Taking a swipe at Collins, he then said, “I know he [Biden] is a friend of yours,” making the other reporters laugh.

Trump also criticised Collins' network, saying Biden is a “friend of CNN.” “That's why nobody watches CNN anymore. Because they have no credibility,” he added.

With the Donald Trump administration's heightened immigration policies, several Indian individuals on H-1B visas and Green Cards have quite surprisingly been deported or forced to go through detention procedures.

Now, a fresh wave of anxiety has swept through the Indian immigrant community in the US following Vice President JD Vance's comment: “A green card does not give an individual an indefinite right to stay in the United States.”

Immigration attorneys are now advising caution, especially for those planning to travel abroad. “The administration is taking the law in their own hands with blatant disregard to the judiciary of the nation,” New York City attorney Naresh Gehi told Newsweek.

However, the question is now: Can Trump's $5 million “gold card” be a breath of fresh air for Indians amid this green card and H-1B row? With over a million Indians stuck in employment-based green card backlogs—some waiting for over 50 years—this could be the key to the American dream.

Trump has proposed a new “gold card” that would replace the EB-5 investor program and offers green card privileges and a path to US citizenship for a $5 million fee.

Unlike the existing EB-5 investor visa, which requires a $800,000-$1.05 million investment in a business that creates at least 10 jobs, the gold card has no such requirements. It is essentially a golden ticket to residency.

Trump himself dismissed EB-5, calling it “full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud.”

For Indians who have spent decades waiting for a green card through employment-based categories, the gold card could be a faster option for them.

Now, with Trump's “gold card” affluent Indian business tycoons, startup founders, and tech executives could bypass traditional green card queues.

However, on the other font skilled workers on H-1B and EB-2/EB-3 visas who lack the financial means to pay $5 million will continue facing green card delays.

ALSO READ| Why are some Indian H-1B visa and Green Card holders being deported?

Yes—if they can afford the $5 million price tag. Trump lamented the gold card as a “road to citizenship for people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.”

“We'll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards,” the POTUS claimed, even floating the idea of issuing 10 million gold cards to help reduce the US deficit. Unlike EB-5, which had an annual cap, the gold card appears to have no actual limit.

That being said, the green card backlog is so vast that the vast majority of Indian professionals are stuck in it; there's nothing to make it easier.

Former Fox News primetime star Megyn Kelly is launching her own podcast network, MK Media. It is “a podcast network for video and audio shows from creators in the news and entertainment space,” according to megynkelly.com. The first few shows will be hosted by independent journalist Mark Halperin, columnist Maureen Callahan, and influencer and political commentator Link Lauren, and more are expected to follow.

“I'm thrilled to launch MK Media and to use our platform to help sane, reasonable, good-humored people build their own followings in this new media space,” Megyn Kelly said in a statement, according to the website. “I am a huge fan of Mark's, Maureen's and Link's and I know our audience will be as excited as I am to hear more from them.”

“We'll have additional announcements soon, as we expand beyond news and entertainment,"" Kelly further said.

Halperin, a veteran of ABC News and Bloomberg, is set to host Next Up, a news show. “America is filled with quality sandboxes; I can say without fear of contradiction that the Megyn Kelly sandbox is as good as it gets these days,” Halperin said in a statement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “I'd point out that I'm thrilled to play Dr. Phil to Megyn's Oprah, but that metaphor might be lost on some.”

Callahan, who previously wrote for Vanity Fair and the New York Post, will be hosting the entertainment and culture-focused show – The Nerve. “What an unexpected joy getting to know (and love) Megyn Kelly. But for her to give me my own show, on her new network, is beyond anything I could have anticipated,” Callahan said. “I can't wait to get going over on The Nerve, digging into pop culture, celebrity scandals, and all the stories that captivate, aggravate and fascinate.”

Lauren, who previously worked as a communications adviser to the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will be hosting the news-focused show – Spot On. “Megyn is a powerhouse whose work ethic and journalism inspire me,” Lauren added. “This venture is a win not only for me, but for my existing audience and those who've been dismissed by the mainstream media. My goal is to always deliver the news in a way that's fact-based and entertaining — that's what you'll get from Spot On and I can't wait to hit the ground running to make this show a success.”

Steve Krakauer, executive producer of The Megyn Kelly Show and AM Update, will be responsible for overseeing the MK Media shows.

President Donald Trump appeared to forget Usha Vance's name while talking about her controversial trip to Greenland. The upcoming trip will see Usha and US national security adviser, Mike Waltz, visit the territory on March 27. The decision has made Greenlanders angry, with many calling it a “demonstration of power.”

Speaking to the press at the White House, Trump praised Usha, Vice President JD Vance's wife, but seemed to forget the second lady's name. The President paused for a second and then referred to Usha as ""the wife of our great Vice President."" Before appearing to forget Usha's name, Trump claimed he has ""great respect for her.”

Trump then went on to talk about the work Usha has been doing since Vance was sworn in as the Vice President of the US. Trump called her a ""very brilliant woman"" and a ""very nice woman,” adding that ""she loves the concept of Greenland.""

“I thought it would be a great… I have great respect for, er, the wife of our first… of our great Vice President. I think she's doing a… she's a brilliant woman. She's, er, a very nice woman and she loves the concept of Greenland,” Trump said.

Were Usha Vance and Mike Waltz ‘invited' to Greenland?Trump told reporters that Usha and Mike have been “invited” to the country. However, Greenland's government strongly dismissed the claim in a social media post. “Just for the record, Naalakkersuisut, the government of Greenland, has not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official,” the government said. Usha's tour comes after Trump's repeated comments about the US wanting to take ownership of Greenland, which is an autonomous territory in the Kingdom of Denmark. Although Trump claimed Usha and Mike's trip is one of “friendship”, Greenland's Prime Minister did not agree. “So they're going there and that's purely friendship … People from Greenland are asking us to go. We have many, many requests from many, many people – some officials, too,” Trump reportedly said. However, Greenland's PM Múte B. Egede told local media, “We are now at a level where it can in no way be characterised as a harmless visit from a politician's wife. What is the national security adviser doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us.”

Veteran quarterback Russell Wilson has officially joined the New York Giants, and that in essence, rules out the possibility of Aaron Rodgers joining the club. The Giants now have Wilson, Jameis Winston and Tommy DeVito leading the quarterback group, the Giants appear to be set at the position.

Since the Minnesota Vikings also did not try to lure Rodgers, the Pittsburgh Steelers are the last chance for the 41-year-old quarterback.

Pittsburgh's current starter, Mason Rudolph, has yet to solidify himself as a franchise quarterback, making Rodgers a highly intriguing option for the team looking to strengthen its offence.

With that, the Steelers have a prime position to sign the 41-year-old veteran who'd make for a sound addition to an offence that this offseason traded D.K. Metcalf for.

The AFC North is shaping up to be one of the most competitive divisions in the league. The Baltimore Ravens remain a strong force with Lamar Jackson at the helm, while the Cincinnati Bengals have successfully retained their core players. 

That said, the players the Cleveland Browns would select with their second overall pick in the upcoming NFL Draft are also up for debate, with rumours circulating that the team will select Shedeur Sanders with the pick.

It makes Rodgers joining the division power fold interesting in itself, though, because any one of the teams has a puncher's chance of making the playoffs if things go right, except maybe the Browns.

That would be the final piece the Steelers would need to make a serious playoff push, and securing Rodgers would be like opening a treasure chest of cash. Not only does a Rodgers-caliber quarterback already enhance the team's formidable defence, but he could well propel the team to new heights for their offence.

However, there is a downside because the longer Rodgers waits before making a decision, the more leverage he possesses. Having appeared desperate, Pittsburgh might be at a disadvantage should they drag a deal out.

The Trump administration has reportedly paused some green card applications. A US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official told Newsweek that the pause on some so-called adjustment of status applications was made because of two executive orders signed by Donald Trump.

""This sweeping and indefinite stop on green card processing is yet another attempt for this administration to baselessly paint all immigrants as a national security risk,"" National Immigrant Justice Center Director of Policy Azadeh Erfani told the outlet.

The pause could leave thousands of applicants with a longer wait time for permanent residency. The president has vowed to deport millions of illegal immigrants while he is in office. In fact, some advocates are afraid that individuals who do not have criminal records might also be included to boost numbers.

The possibilities have been worrying several people, including Indian immigrants. India happens to be the source of the largest number of migrants globally. Over 2.9 million Indian immigrants lived in the United States as of 2023, migrationpolicy.org. In the US, the Indian population has continuously and substantially grown since 1960. The greatest number of arrivals happened between 2000 and 2023, according to the website.

It is unclear which applications were affected, and how long the pause would last. However, it would be a vetting on top of a process for refugees and those who were granted asylum in the US.

“There's a certain amount of documentation you have to provide as a refugee as well as an asylee,” Laura Collins, director of the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute, told NBC News. “All of these people who are approved for resettlement or to remain in the United States, that's because the United States government already approved them to be here.”

Collins recalled that in the first Trump administration, USCIS ensured every blank on a form was correctly filled out. “So if you didn't have a middle name ... they would send your application back and say, ‘Well, you didn't fill in your middle name portion,'” Collins said, adding that USCIS might even check social media, “things they probably already vet, but asking for another set of eyes or a slightly longer look at it.”

At least 67,800 green card applications were filed by asylum seekers between October 2023 and September 2024. Almost 40,000 were submitted by refugees, who are permitted to apply after arriving in the country at least a year earlier. The average wait times for those applications to be decided on by the US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) were approximately 10 and 8 months respectively. However, decisions could be delayed even more because of the pause.

According to DHS, the action was a result of two of Trump's executive orders: ‘Protecting The United States From Foreign Terrorists And Other National Security And Public Safety Threats' and ‘Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists.' The first one instructed DHS and other agencies to increase vetting and screening of people seeking legal status in the US, including people trying to get into the country and individuals already admitted from countries considered to be ""security risks.""

David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, slammed the pause in an X post. He wrote, “DHS is suspending green card applications for people who are already living in the US with asylee or refugee status! These applications have insane wait times already, and Trump is freezing them solely to make it easier to deny the applications and deport them.”

The pause has also been criticised by National Immigrant Justice Center Director of Policy Azadeh Erfani as a “discriminatory animus against people who seek refuge.” Erfani told Newsweek, “USCIS already conducts extensive vetting of all individuals who apply for permanent resident status. Already, our clients wait over a year for USCIS to process their applications. This stop in processing will unfairly block people who have full eligibility to gain permanent status in the United States.""

The H-1B visa registration for Fiscal Year 2026 ended on March 24, 2025. If more are registered than the annual cap, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) releases a lottery and usually announces the results by early April.

The 90-day submission window for announcing full H-1B petitions beginning April 1, 2025, is available to selected applicants' employers who can file the petitions. Approved applicants can begin employment on or after October 1, 2025.

While accuracy and preparation aren't the first two words people think of when they hear the words ‘Form I-129 (Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker), they are true.

ALSO READ| H-1B petition filing starts: When is the deadline? Here's a quick rundown

1. Go through the most recent Form I-129 requirements: USCIS policies and forms are subject to change, so always check the latest edition on the USCIS website. Using an outdated version can result in delays or rejections. 

Carefully review the eligibility criteria, required documents, and any recent updates specific to the H-1B category.

2. Labor Condition Application (LCA): For H-1B petitions, employers must secure a certified LCA from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) before filing Form I-129. 

The LCA ensures that hiring a foreign worker won't negatively impact U.S. workers' wages and conditions. It must include job details such as salary, duties, and work location and be filed electronically via the DOL's iCERT system.

3. Employer and employee information: Employers should collect all necessary details about their company and the foreign national employee. This includes the employer's business details, contact information, and proof of ability to pay the required wages. The employee's qualifications, work experience, and immigration history should also be compiled to ensure accurate filing.

4. File the Form I-129 VERY precisely: Minor errors in Form I-129 can lead to unnecessary processing delays or denials. Ensure all sections are correctly filled, including employer details, beneficiary information, job title, job duties, and salary. 

Double-check all entries before submission.

5. Prepare filing fees and correctly file the petition: USCIS requires multiple fees, including the I-129 filing fee, fraud prevention fee, and (for H-1B) the ACWIA fee. Employers can also opt for premium processing by paying an additional fee. Ensure all checks or money orders are payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and correctly included in the petition package.

Tiger Woods initially hoped to keep his relationship with Vanessa Trump private, but once news broke, he had no choice but to go public. Now, insiders close to the couple reveal exactly why he did so.

“He knew it would be a huge story when it came out,” an insider told Daily Mail. “And he didn't exactly love it. But obviously, Tiger dating a Trump is always going to make headlines, which is exactly what he wanted to avoid.”

The golf legend and President Donald Trump's former daughter-in-law kept their romance discreet for months—avoiding public places and keeping it a secret even from close friends. 

“He has never been one to really share things until he absolutely had to,” a former Woods employee told Daily Mail. “But once things are found out, he doesn't really have a choice.”

Earlier this month, Daily Mail reported the pair “have been seeing each other since just before Thanksgiving.” Woods and Vanessa's relationship became an open secret at the prestigious Benjamin School in Palm Beach, where both have children enrolled.

“Benjamin is like a small community,” the insider added. “And there's nothing that rich people like to do more than gossip about each other. Frankly, I'm surprised that it was secret for so long.”

Their romance was confirmed when Woods posted photos with Vanessa on his Instagram handle. “Love is in the air, and life is better with you by my side!” Woods wrote in the caption. “We look forward to our journey through life together. At this time, we would appreciate privacy for all those close to our hearts.”

Vanessa's former sister-in-law, Ivanka Trump, chimed in commenting, “So happy for you both,” alongside heart emojis. Vanessa's eldest daughter, Kai Trump, also liked the post, and touted about the golfer in a later YouTube video.

Vanessa, who divorced Donald Trump Jr. in 2018 after 13 years of marriage, has not had a relationship until now. Unlike previous controversies in Woods' personal life, this time, the news revolves around a fresh start rather than scandal.

“I know that Tiger didn't want to share the news,” the former employee concluded, “but now that he has, there has to be some relief. Now he can just go and live his life.”

President Donald Trump has signed a memorandum directing the declassification of FBI files connected to the investigation into his 2016 campaign's potential ties to Russia. According to White House staff secretary Will Scharf, the memorandum calls for the declassification of “all files related to Crossfire Hurricane investigation,” The Hill reported.

“We believe that it's long past time for the American people to have a full and complete understanding of what exactly is in those files,” Scharf said.

Meanwhile, Trump said while signing the memo, “This was total weaponization. It's a disgrace…but now you'll be able to see for yourselves.”

Back in July 2016, the FBI opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation into whether members of Trump's campaign were coordinating with Russian officials. The probe eventually preceded the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.

For years, Trump and his allies have expressed their doubt on the legitimacy of the FBI's investigation into his campaign. They have argued that it was a politically motivated probe.

Ultimately, Mueller did not establish that Trump or his campaign members coordinated or conspired with Moscow in an attempt to affect the 2016 presidential election. However, he and his team did not reach a conclusion on whether the president obstructed justice.

Trump has now said in a statement released by the White House, “I have determined that all of the materials referenced in the Presidential Memorandum of January 19, 2021 (Declassification of Certain Materials Related to the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane Investigation), are no longer classified.”

He added, “My decision to declassify the materials described above does not extend to materials that must be protected from disclosure pursuant to orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and does not require the disclosure of certain personally identifiable information or any other materials that must be protected from disclosure under applicable law.”

President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order seeking broad changes to elections in the US, including mandating voters to show proof that they are American citizens, counting only mail or absentee ballots received by Election Day and prohibiting non-US citizens from being able to donate in certain elections.

Citing India and some other countries as examples, Trump said the US now fails to enforce ""basic and necessary election protections"" employed by modern, developed and developing nations.

""India and Brazil are tying voter identification to a biometric database, while the United States largely relies on self-attestation for citizenship,"" he said.

""Germany and Canada require paper ballots when tabulating votes, while the United States has a patchwork of methods that often lack basic chain-of-custody protections,"" he added.

Trump's order also stated that while countries like Denmark and Sweden ""sensibly"" limit mail-in voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count late-arriving votes regardless of the date of postmark, many American elections now feature mass voting by mail, with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after Election Day.

President Trump, who returned to power in January after defeating Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, said that ""free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic"".

""The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,"" he said.

President Trump, who has repeatedly questioned certain voting methods since he lost the 2020 US Presidential election to Democrat Joe Biden, said the polls ""must be honest and worthy of the public trust"".

US citizenship proof

Donald Trump's order called for the federal voter registration form to be amended so that prospective voters must provide documentary proof of citizenship, such as a US passport or a birth certificate.

It also said states should turn over their voter lists and records of voter list maintenance to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Government Efficiency for review. It directed federal agencies to share data with states to help them identify noncitizens on their rolls.

The order said if states refuse to collaborate with federal law enforcement to prosecute election crimes, they could potentially lose out on federal grants.

Mail ballots by Election Day

The executive order required votes to be ""cast and received"" by Election Day and said federal funding should be conditional on state compliance with that deadline.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 18 US states along with Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, DC, will count ballots that are postmarked on or before Election Day, regardless of when they arrive.

Ballots can't rely on QR codes

The order instructed the Election Assistance Commission to amend its guidelines for voting systems to ""protect election integrity"". That would include guidance that voting systems should not rely on ballots that use barcodes or QR codes in the vote-counting process.

Trump instructed the commission to “take appropriate action to review and, if appropriate, re-certify voting systems” under those new standards within six months of the order.

Foreigners barred from making donations

Donald Trump's order also barred foreign nationals from contributing or donating in US elections.

""Foreign nationals and non-governmental organizations have taken advantage of loopholes in the law's interpretation, spending millions of dollars through conduit contributions and ballot-initiative-related expenditures. This type of foreign interference in our election process undermines the franchise and the right of American citizens to govern their Republic,"" he said.

Hundreds of Palestinians took to the streets in northern Gaza to take part in the largest anti-Hamas protest since the war with Israel began, calling for an end to the ongoing conflict and demanding that the group step down from power. The demonstrations took place in Beit Lahia in the northern part of the Gaza Strip, where the crowd had gathered a week after the Israeli army resumed its intense bombing of Gaza after nearly two months of a truce.

Videos and photos shared on social media late on Tuesday showed hundreds of protestors, mostly male, chanted ""out, out, out, Hamas out"" and ""Hamas terrorists"" as they carried banners emblazoned with slogans including ""Stop the war"" and ""We want to live in peace"".

Media reports said that masked and armed Hamas militants, some carrying guns and others batons, forcibly dispersed the protesters, assaulting several of them in the process.

Protestors said they were mobilised after appeals to join the protest were circulated on the social media network Telegram.

""I don't know who organised the protest,"" a man named Mohammed told Agence France-Press. The demonstrator declined to give his last name for fear of reprisals.

 ""I took part to send a message on behalf of the people: Enough with the war,"" he said, adding that he had seen ""members of the Hamas security forces in civilian clothing breaking up the protest"".

Majdi, another protester who did not wish to give his full name, said the ""people are tired"".

""If Hamas leaving power in Gaza is the solution, why doesn't Hamas give up power to protect the people?"" he told AFP.

Separate footage from Jabalia refugee camps, in the western part of Gaza City, showed dozens of protestors burning tyres and calling for the war to end.

""We want to eat,"" they chanted.

As of Tuesday evening, Telegram messages from unknown sources were calling on people to reprise the demonstration in various parts of Gaza on Wednesday.

Hamas has been ruling Gaza since 2007, after it won the Palestinian elections a year prior and then violently ousted rivals. The group is yet to comment on the matter, but pro-Hamas supporters defended the group by downplaying the significance of the movement and accusing protestors of being traitors.

Criticism of the group has grown in Gaza since the war with Israel began, though Hamas still has fiercely loyal supporters in the territory, and the levels of discontent towards the group are difficult to gauge.

The last available survey was conducted in September by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR).

It estimated that 35 percent of Palestinians in Gaza said they supported Hamas, and 26 percent said they supported its rival Fatah, the party of Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas.

Israel regularly calls for Gazans to mobilise against the Islamist movement that has been in power in the territory since 2007.

Hamas rival Fatah's spokesman in Gaza, Monther al-Hayek, called on Hamas Saturday to ""step aside from governing"" to safeguard the ""existence"" of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Strip has been devastated by more than 17 months of war between Israel and Hamas, with the humanitarian situation again deteriorating after Israel blocked the passage of aid into the territory on March 2 in an attempt to force the militants to release Israeli hostages.

Since Israel resumed its military operations in Gaza, at least 792 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory.

The war was sparked by the group's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.

Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 50,021 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

In a strongly-worded rebuttal, India said today that it is the US religious freedom body USCIRF that should be designated internationally as an ""entity of concern"" for its repeated ""pattern of biased and politically motivated assessments"" and ""misrepresentation"" of facts. 

New Delhi's statement came hours after the US body's annual religious freedom report claimed that minorities in India continue to face deteriorating treatment. The panel's report also called for imposing sanctions on India's external intelligence agency R&AW over its alleged involvement in the ""assassination"" plots against 'Khalistani' separatists and extremists overseas.

""We have seen the recently released 2025 Annual Report of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which once again continues its pattern of issuing biased and politically motivated assessments,"" India's Ministry of External Affairs said, raising concerns on the authenticity of the body over such ""agenda-based"" claims.

Indirectly calling the panel's report fake, India questioned if at all the USCIRF is even genuine in its work and concerns on religious freedom.

""The USCIRF's persistent attempts to misrepresent isolated incidents and cast aspersions on India's vibrant multicultural society reflect a deliberate agenda rather than a genuine concern for religious freedom,"" the foreign ministry said.

Saying that the US religious freedom body is far from reality, New Delhi said it does not even expect the panel to engage with the truth. ""India is home to 1.4 billion people who are adherents to all religions known to mankind. However, we have no expectation that the USCIRF will engage with the reality of India's pluralistic framework or acknowledge the harmonious coexistence of its diverse communities,"" noted the foreign ministry.



Labeling the US religious freedom body as ""an entity of concern"", India said, ""Such efforts to undermine India's standing as a beacon of democracy and tolerance will not succeed. In fact, it is the USCIRF that should be designated as an entity of concern.""

Despite the US panel's recommendation, It is unlikely that the US government will sanction India's external intelligence agency R&AW or Research & Analysis Wing for its alleged involvement in plotting the killings of extremists and terrorists overseas. This is because the panel's views and recommendations are not binding on the government.

In its current report, the US panel has recommended that India be designated as a ""country of particular concern"" over alleged violations of religious freedom and ""impose targetted sanctions"" against R&AW. It also alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling BJP ""propagated hateful rhetoric and disinformation against Muslims and other religious minorities"".

Melania Trump's custom wedding gown, designed by John Galliano for Christian Dior, is reportedly up for auction at a fraction of its original price. The dress, which the First Lady wore to marry Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida, 20 years ago, originally cost $100,000 and weighed 60 pounds, according to Page Six.

Now, an eBay seller named Svjabc1 has listed the gown with a starting bid of $45,000, claiming she purchased it for $70,000 to wear at her wedding in 2010.

The listing describes the dress as a ""Christian Dior wedding dress specifically designed by John Galliano for Melania Trump's wedding to Donald Trump. United States PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP.""



A post shared by President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump)





Photos shared by the seller include an image of Melania walking down the aisle with Trump in the original strapless ivory duchesse satin gown, which was famously featured on the February 2005 cover of Vogue, shot by Mario Testino. The dress was adorned with Swarovski crystals and took over 500 hours to complete, boasting a dramatic 13-foot train.

However, the gown up for sale looks noticeably different. The listing images reveal that the once-strapless bodice now features intricate foliage-inspired beading, added shoulder straps, and a satin waist sash.

The seller explained that alterations were made to accommodate her size. ""Because Melania Trump was a size 0-2, I had to have this dress made a little bigger as I was a size 4-6,"" she wrote. Additional satin layers, embroidery, and fabric were incorporated into the bodice and back of the dress to fit her proportions. However, she noted that the gown can be resized to its original fit by removing these alterations.

According to the listing, the gown has only been worn twice-once by Melania and once by the seller. It is described as being in ""good"" condition, though no certificate of authenticity is included.

As of now, the listing has attracted significant attention, with over 3,500 views in the last 24 hours on eBay.

After stirring the hornet's nest in Greenland, Donald Trump has now had to take a step back in US' approach to the semi-autonomous Danish territory. Amid widespread outrage over Washington's plan to ""buy"" the country, a high-level delegation led by Second Lady Usha Vance was to arrive in Greenland's capital Nuuk this week - that will now not happen.

Greenlanders have outrightly rejected Donald Trump's offer to ""buy"" their country. They have said they will ""never"" become a part of the United States. So outraged are they, that citizens of Greenland recently staged anti-American protests - the largest ever demonstrations in Greenland's history.

Similar protests were planned for the day Usha Vance was scheduled to arrive in the country.

Keeping the optics of the high-level visit and the anti-America sentiment in mind, the White House has completely changed the plan. It announced that instead of Second Lady Usha Vance, the delegation would now be headed by Vice President JD Vance himself, but the visit would be restricted only to the US Space and Military Base at Pituffik in northern Greenland.

The original plan was that Usha Vance would visit Greenland's capital Nuuk, before heading for the dog-sled race, a big annual sporting and cultural event. She would be accompanied by US National Security Adviser Mike Walts and US Energy Secretary Chris Wright - who would also visit the US military base besides these events. This plan now stands cancelled amid reports that Greenland was planning an unsavoury welcome for the US Second Lady.

Greenland's acting head of government, Mute Egede, had labelled Usha Vance's visit as a ""provocation"" by the United States. ""Until recently, we could trust the Americans, who were our allies and friends, and with whom we enjoyed working very closely, but that time is over,"" Greenland's prime minister said.

Even Denmark's prime minister had called the visit an ""unacceptable pressure"" being put by Washington. This was hours before the White House announced revised plans. The spat between Copenhagen and Washington was on public display amid Trump's plan to takeover the arctic region island - for which he has not ruled out the use of force.

Denmark has now welcomed Washington's decision to revise the plan. ""I think it's very positive that the Americans cancelled their visit to the Greenlandic society. Instead, they will visit their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that,"" Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told local broadcaster DR.

However, not everyone agrees. There are still many who feel that this was done because Washington saw the writing on the wall - that they are not welcome in Greenland. Karsten Honge, a member of the Danish parliament in Copenhagen, said the U.S. decision not to visit the dog-sled race in the town of Sisimiut, as well as a trip to the capital Nuuk, appeared to have been made out of necessity.

""They are doing this for the obvious reason that if they had shown up in Nuuk or Sisimiut, they would probably have been met by demonstrations with banners and people yelling 'Yankees go home',"" Honge told Danish broadcaster TV2.

The visit of the US delegation will remain the same - from Thursday, March 27 to Saturday, March 29, 2025. ","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The United States has named India, along with China, a ""state actor"" in enabling direct and indirect supply of precursor chemicals for illicit fentanyl drug production by criminal organisations. The use of fentanyl, among other synthetic opioids, is the most lethal drug trafficked into the United States, and has claimed the lives of more than 52,000 Americans in 12 months ending in October 2024, according to the Annual Threat Assessment (ATA) of the US intelligence community released on Tuesday.

""These groups [transnational criminal organisations or TCOs] are often enabled, both directly and indirectly, by state actors, such as China and India, as sources of precursors and equipment for drug traffickers,"" the report published by the office of Tulsi Gabbard, US Director of National Intelligence (DNI), said. 

""China remains the primary source country for illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment, followed by India,"" it added. 

Notably, it is the first time the US has placed India on the same level as China in connection with the supply of precursor chemicals used by drug cartels to manufacture opioids like fentanyl. Last year's report mentioned India as just one of several countries from where the Mexican groups were sourcing chemicals to a ""lesser extent"". It had identified China as the primary supplier.

The report comes at a time when US President Donald Trump has made combating opioids a political priority, shaping his foreign policy decisions. Earlier this month, Trump said his administration would not rest until ""we have ended the fentanyl epidemic in America once and for all.""

On February 1, the American commander-in-chief imposed an additional 10 per cent tariff on China for failing to take sufficient action against fentanyl trafficking. He also levied 25 per cent duties on Canada and Mexico for allegedly lacking adequate border enforcement.

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose reciprocal duties on several countries as part of his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs set to take effect on April 2. However, India is in talks with America to expedite a free trade deal that could help it avoid some of these taxes.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday said Bangladesh was witnessing a ""festival of rumours"" against his administration, blaming it on ""the defeated force"" -- an apparent reference to deposed premier Sheikh Hasina's regime.

""The rumours are big instruments of the defeated forces against the July-August (2024) Uprising,"" he said in a nationwide televised address on the eve of Bangladesh's 53rd Independence Day on March 26 when the country in 1971 declared independence from the then Pakistan followed by a nine-month Liberation War.

Unlike in past years, there would be no National Day military parade in the capital. District-level parades will take place as usual. Home Ministry Senior Secretary Nasimul Ghani recently said that the country is in a wartime mode.

In his address, Yunus called upon the countrymen to resist the rumour through awareness and greater unity.

He said that as the upcoming election, the date of which is yet to be decided, would come near, the rumours would take more dangerous shape. ""You all know, who are behind the phenomenon and why they are spearheading these (rumours),"" he said.

Yunus asked the people to look for the source of the rumour whenever they hear any such misleading gossip instead of ignoring them ""as many experienced war experts are working round the clock spending unlimited money behind these rumours"" with their ""main objective to thwart the July Uprising"".

""Our overall unity is severely irritating them. They want to break the unity. You will not even realise their innovative techniques. You do not even understand when you became a pawn of their game,"" he said.

Yunus added: ""Always keep in mind we are in a war situation."" The interim government chief did not cite any specific example of such rumours but several of his advisers in the cabinet have said conspiracies were underway at home and abroad particularly using social media platforms to destabilise the government.

Yunus, however, said his administration sought United Nations cooperation to prevent the spread of rumours and disinformation and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who recently visited Bangladesh, ""assured us of extending the cooperation"".

Deposed premier Hasina's regime was ousted in a student-led mass protest spearheaded by now-defunct Students against Discrimination on August 5, 2024.

Yunus, who was in France at that time, flew home and assumed the role of the Chief Adviser of the interim government three days later.

Yunus, whose experiment of poor men's banking earned him the Nobel Peace Prize, was in a protracted row of the past regime for obscure reasons.

Several political parties and analysts said during Yunus' past seven-month rule ultraright and Islamist elements created a space in the political arena and they were spearheading a campaign to sideline the forces in favour of the 1971 Liberation War.

Most leaders of the Awami League, which led the Liberation War in 1971, were arrested or on the run at home or abroad to evade trial on charges like mass murders and crimes against humanity in Bangladesh's domestic International Crimes Tribunal.

""Some people, some parties, some groups are trying to make it seem as if 10971 never happened... trying to erase it from memory,"" Secretary-General of ex-premier Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party Mirza Faklhrul Islam Alamgir told a party rally on Tuesday.

""Those who once collaborated in the (Pakistani troops') massacre - those very people - are now speaking louder than ever,"" he said.

Two months ago, he said in an interview that ""I can somehow smell, some quarters are trying to belittle the 1971 (liberation War)"" while several of his party leaders have spoken in near identical tones in recent months.

Yunus, however, at the onset of his speech, recalled those who sacrificed their lives during the Liberation War, saying March 25 is a day of massacre that remains stigmatised in the history of human civilisation.

""On this night in 1971, the Pakistani occupation forces brutally opened fire on innocent, unarmed and sleeping Bangalees and killed thousands of people. Since March 25, the people of this country had raised armed resistance. Bangladesh became independent through a nine-month war,"" he said.

A military correspondent from Russia's main state TV channel, Channel One, was killed by a mine on the border with Ukraine earlier, her employer said Wednesday.

The incident took place on the Russian side of the border, in the Belgorod region, the channel said.

""Channel One war correspondent Anna Prokofieva died while performing her professional duty,"" the TV channel wrote in a statement. ""Channel One's film crew struck an enemy mine.""

The mine also wounded her colleague, cameraman Dmitry Volkov, it said.

It said Prokofieva was 35 years old and had been covering the Ukraine conflict with the channel since 2023.

Her last post on Telegram was dated Tuesday and appeared to show her in a forest, sitting on a chair in military fatigues and wearing a head-mounted camera.

The post, in which she is smiling, was captioned: ""Somewhere on the border with country 404"" -- a derogatory reference to the ""404 file not found"" internet error that pro-Kremlin military bloggers use to refer to Ukraine.

Several Russian journalists have been killed in the three-year conflict, including on Monday when a war correspondent for Russia's main pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia died in Ukraine's Kharkiv region.

At least 21 journalists have died in total since the beginning of Moscow's offensive in February 2022, according to the International Federation of Journalists.

Tulsi Gabbard, United States Director of National Intelligence (DNI), on Tuesday said that the American intelligence community have assessed that Iran is not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon at the moment, but discussion of nuclearization has increased inside the regime in Tehran. 

""The IC continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Khamanei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,"" she said during the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.

Gabbard, however, added that in the past years, it was seen that there has been ""an erosion of a decades-long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.""

""Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons,"" she added.

The DNI Director, meanwhile, added that the entire impact of renewed sanctions on Iran is still not in effect, but that the ""message"" has been ""certainly heard"" by Tehran. 

Earlier in October 2024 also, the United States said it believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel.

The DNI also released the intelligence community's annual threat assessment in conjunction with the hearing. The report predicted that Iran will try to leverage its robust missile capability and expanded nuclear program, and its diplomatic outreach to regional states and US rivals to bolster its regional influence and ensure regime survival. 

However, regional and domestic challenges, most immediately tensions with Israel, are seriously testing Iran's ambitions and capabilities, it added,

""The IC assesses Iran's prospects for reconstituting force losses and posing a credible deterrent, particularly to Israeli actions, are dim in the near-term,"" the report continues.

It suggested that Tehran will continue its efforts to counter Israel and press the United States to leave the region by aiding and arming its loose consortium of like-minded terrorists, known as the ""Axis of Resistance."" 

The report also noted that Iranian investment in its military has been a key plank of its efforts to confront diverse threats and try to deter and defend against an attack by the United States or Israel. Iran will also continue to directly threaten US persons globally and remains committed to its decade-long effort to develop surrogate networks inside the United States, it added.

The report also mentioned that Tehran intends for its expanding relationships with other key US adversaries and the Global South to mitigate America's efforts to isolate the regime and blunt the impact of Western sanctions. ""Tehran's diplomatic efforts-including at times outreach to Europe-are likely to continue with varying degrees of success,"" it said. 

It, however, added that Iranian political and economic struggles could be fodder for renewed domestic political unrest and protest inside Iran, unless Iran is granted sanctions relief.

The report also found that Russia is developing a new satellite meant to carry a nuclear weapon, which could have ""devastating consequences"" for the US and the world.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Billionaire Elon Musk has trained his guns on The Atlantic magazine after the publication reported that its editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, was inadvertently added to a classified group chat discussing US military operations. The chat, which included senior national security officials, covered planned strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

The Tesla CEO mocked the publication, writing, ""Best place to hide a dead body is page 2 of The Atlantic magazine because no one ever goes there.""

He also reposted a satirical piece from The Babylon Bee titled, ""4D Chess: Genius Trump Leaks War Plans To 'The Atlantic' Where No One Will Ever See Them.""

Best place to hide a dead body is page 2 of The Atlantic magazine, because no one ever goes there https://t.co/10A01hObHO

President Donald Trump, when asked about the situation during a White House briefing, distanced himself from the slip-up but was critical of the magazine.

""I don't know anything about it,"" Trump told reporters. ""I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic. To me, it's a magazine that's going out of business. I think it's not much of a magazine, but I know nothing about it.""

Pressed further on the nature of the leaks, Trump appeared uninterested, responding, ""Having to do with what? What were they talking about?""

Mr Goldberg's report for The Atlantic revealed that a leaked group chat contained details of planned US strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, including targets, weapons, and attack sequencing.

The leak happened when National Security Advisor Mike Waltz mistakenly invited Mr Goldberg to a high-level Signal chat. The group included Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. The conversation took place just two days before the planned strikes.

Mr Goldberg said senior officials continued discussing sensitive military details in the chat. Despite the security lapse, the White House and the National Security Council did not deny the report's authenticity.

On Monday, addressing the reporters, Pete Hegseth didn't take any responsibility for the security breach and instead attacked Mr Goldberg, insisting ""nobody was texting war plans.""

The White House said President Trump ""continues to have the utmost confidence in his national security team.""","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

The US Senate on Tuesday (local time) confirmed the appointment of Indian-origin Jay Bhattacharya, a professor at Stanford School of Medicine, as Director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

According to the official website of the US Senate, Mr Bhattacharya won the vote 53-47 during the first session of the roll call vote in the 119th Congress.

According to an earlier nomination statement from US President Donald Trump, Mr Bhattacharya is a professor of health policy at Stanford University, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Stanford Freeman Spogli Institute, and the Hoover Institution.

He also directs Stanford's Centre for Demography and Economics of Health and Ageing, and his research emphasises the role of government programs, biomedical innovation, and economics.

Jay is a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an alternative to lockdowns proposed in October 2020. His peer-reviewed research has been published in economics, statistics, legal, medical, public health, and health policy journals.

The statement further added that Mr Bhattacharya and newly appointed US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr will be working together to restore the NIH to a ""Gold Standard of Medical Research.""

Following his confirmation as the head of the NIH, US Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell congratulated Mr Bhattacharya, stating that he would provide ""sound leadership"" to the institution.

""Voted today to confirm Dr Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health. With an extensive background in medical research, I expect Dr J Bhattacharya to provide sound leadership at the NIH,"" Mr McConnell said, taking to X.

Earlier in February, the US Senate voted to confirm Robert F Kennedy Jr, an anti-vaccine activist, as US Health and Human Services Secretary. He was confirmed as US Health and Human Services Secretary with a vote of 52-48.

Multinational conglomerate Tata Group has reportedly become a global supplier of billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla. Several Tata firms, including Tata Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Tata AutoComp, and Tata Electronics, are now part of Tesla's supply chain, according to a report by The Economic Times (ET).

Per the report, these Tata companies have already signed global agreements with the automaker as essential partners and are providing crucial components and services to Tesla, which represents approximately half of the global automotive industry's market value. 

These firms contributed to the approximately $ 2 billion worth of Indian supplies-- including castings, forgings, electronics, and fabrication parts-- to the American automaker in FY24.  With the EV maker looking to diversify its supply chain, its sourcing from India is expected to increase.

The Tata group is now positioning itself for expanded opportunities and growing further, especially if Tesla sets up a manufacturing unit in India. Billionaire Musk's company has also initiated conversations with existing Indian suppliers about the possibility of establishing facilities near their manufacturing centres to enhance the supply ecosystem, the ET report said.

""Tesla is, in a way, readying the supplier base in India...We are very sure that once Tesla starts manufacturing here, Indian suppliers will benefit from sourcing opportunities,"" a top industry source told ET, requesting anonymity.

The report said that Tesla's Senior procurement executives have been meeting with numerous current suppliers about manufacturing specific components.

Currently, Tesla is evaluating manufacturing opportunities in India and is closely monitoring government incentives, tax benefits, and potential duty waivers before making a final decision. While the EV maker has not confirmed its manufacturing plans, reports indicate that it is in talks with several states, including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Telangana, to explore options for setting up a production facility. 

If Tesla moves ahead with its India plans, Tata's role in its supply chain could grow even further. The ET report said the American company has strict non-disclosure agreements with its suppliers, which prevent them from revealing details about their contributions.

However, the sources told ET that Tesla also intends to procure various components from suppliers outside China and Taiwan, including wiring harnesses, electric motors, gearboxes, forged components, castings, sheet metal, sophisticated electronics, suspension systems, electric powertrains, and ball and ceramic bearings. 

Tata AutoComp provides specialised EV engineering products.

Tata Technologies delivers comprehensive product lifecycle management services. 

TCS supplies circuit-board technologies.

Tata Electronics provides chips.

The financial daily reported that while these companies within the Tata ecosystem maintain their current global supply arrangements, their future strategic decisions may be influenced by Tesla's ultimate decision regarding local manufacturing or contract manufacturing for the Indian market.

The American EV maker has established partnerships with numerous Indian manufacturers, including prominent names such as Samvardhana Motherson, Suprajit Engineering, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Varroc Engineering, Bharat Forge, and Sandhar Technologies, for sourcing vital components, but it is likely to source essential vehicle control components from Tata Electronics, including printed circuit board assemblies for Tesla's battery management systems, motor controller units and door control mechanism, the report said.

A US doctor was taken into custody after he allegedly struck his wife in the head with a rock and tried to push her off a hiking route after she refused to take a picture with him, Hawaiian authorities said.

Gerhardt Konig, a 46-year-old Maui anaesthesiologist, has been charged with the attempted murder of his wife, Arielle Konig. The couple was on vacation in Oahu when Mr Konig allegedly pushed his 36-year-old wife down a hiking trail near the Pali Lookout.

According to reports, the Nuuanu Pali Lookout provides sweeping views of the Koolau cliffs and Windward Coast from its location more than a thousand feet above the Oahu coastline.

Law enforcement sources told Hawaii News Now that Mr Konig snapped because his wife refused to take a photo with him.



The doctor repeatedly hit his wife, struck her with a rock, and attempted to stab her with two syringes, though it did not specify if they carried drugs, The NY Post reported.

Mr Konig was taken into custody by Honolulu police following a brief foot pursuit near Pali Highway on Monday night. Police posted a billboard featuring his picture earlier in the day, stating he was sought for attempting to kill someone at Pali Lookout.

Following the alleged attack early Monday, the Honolulu Police Department reported that Arielle Konig was taken to a hospital in critical condition with several facial and head injuries.

Mr Konig has been a physician with the Anaesthesia Medical Group, CBS affiliate KGMB reported. He has already been suspended until an inquiry is conducted. He worked under an independent contract and supplied medical services to Maui facilities.

""Maui Health is committed to patient safety and upholding the highest standards of care,"" Maui Health stated.

The physician previously served as an Assistant Professor of anesthesiology and bioengineering at the University of Pittsburgh and an anaesthesiologist at UPMC. According to the company, Mr Konig has not worked for UPMC for more than two years.

An on-duty Uber Eats driver has been fired for allegedly urinating in an apartment lift in Australia's Sydney. The incident at Northview Apartments in Artarmon occurred on March 10 afternoon and was caught on camera.

A video of him peeing in the lift has now gone viral on X.

The clip begins with the delivery agent entering the lift and pressing the button for level 10 to reach the customer's floor.

With his back facing the camera, the driver, holding a parcel in his right hand, appears to unzip his pants with the left and moves to the front corner of the lift.

He then allegedly pees on the front doors of the lift, leaving a wet patch near the entrance when he walks out.

An Uber Eats spokesperson said they ""strongly condemned this kind of behaviour, which has no place on the Uber platform.""

Residents said they were disgusted by the incident and had the lift sanitised, but a smell remained there.

A resident told a media channel that despite a deep clean, the elevator still smelt and required thousands of dollars in repairs.

It is a major breach of food handling requirements, he said.

Another resident described the incident as ""disgusting and completely unacceptable"".

The driver's account has been deactivated and he will no longer be able to work with Uber Eats, according to latest reports.

NSW Police confirmed that an investigation had been launched and urged anyone with information to contact Crime Stoppers.

Luigi Mangione, jailed for allegedly murdering a health insurance CEO, has requested a laptop. Mangione, 26, is accused of fatally shooting Brian Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel in December.

Mr Thompson, a father of two high school-aged children, had worked for decades at UnitedHealthcare and its parent company.

The Independent reported that in a court filing made public late Monday, Mangione's lawyers requested that he be provided with a laptop for legal purposes. 

They stated that the device would allow him to review more than 15,000 pages of documents, videos, and other materials related to his case. The laptop would be restricted, preventing internet access, communication with others, and the use of video games or entertainment content.

Mangione can only access case materials during meetings with his attorneys, but his defense team argues that available visiting hours are insufficient for proper case preparation.

Similar accommodations have been granted to other defendants at the facility where Mangione is being held.

The Manhattan district attorney's office, prosecuting Mangione under a rare New York state charge of murder as an act of terrorism, has not yet responded to a request for comment.

According to Mangione's attorneys, prosecutors oppose the laptop request, citing concerns about witness threats.

Defence lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo countered in the filing that there is ""no connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats.""

Mangione, an Ivy League-educated computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the state charges.

He also faces a parallel federal case that could result in the death penalty but has not yet entered a plea to those charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.","{'href': 'https://www.ndtv.com', 'title': 'NDTV'}"

Mr Kanal, a prominent youth leader, led the attack late Sunday night, allegedly in response to Kamra's parody song mocking the Deputy Chief Minister.

Senior GOP figures warn of potential ‘significant political problem' for Trump administration in rare sign of unrest

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly.

“This is what happens when you don't really have your act together,” the Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski told the Hill.

The Trump administration has been facing criticism from Democrats – and now Republicans – after Monday's embarrassing revelation that a team of senior national security officials accidentally added a journalist to a private group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app. The group, which included Vice-President JD Vance, the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and others, discussed sensitive plans to engage in military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

On Wednesday morning the Atlantic posted another tranche of messages that contained details of the attack on Yemen, including descriptions of targets, launch times and even the details of weather during the assault.

Senior national security officials testified before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday, where the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA director, John Ratcliffe, were grilled by lawmakers over the scandal. The national security officials said “no classified material” was shared in the chat. Republicans are now calling for investigations, as well.

According to reporting from the Hill, top Republican senators are calling for various committees to investigate the leak, including the Senate armed services committee and the Senate intelligence committee. The Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the armed services committee, told the Hill he would be asking the defense department's inspector general to investigate the scandal.

The national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who reportedly added Goldberg to the group chat, took “full responsibility” for the leak on a Tuesday night Fox News appearance. However, he did not describe how the leak happened and trashed Goldberg, calling him “the bottom-scum of journalists”. During his television appearance, Waltz said he started the Signal group chat but unknowingly added a contact that happened to have Goldberg's number.

“Of course I didn't see this loser in the group, it looked like someone else,” he said, and denied that a staffer was responsible.

Tensions are rising among Republicans, with the two wings of the party divided on what should happen with Waltz, according to reporting from Politico.

On the one hand, traditional, hawkish Republicans see Waltz as a strong vehicle to push Trump officials towards a more aggressive foreign policy, and advocate for him to stay in the administration. On the other hand, Trumpian Republicans like Vance, oppose the hawkish approach to foreign policy. Waltz's position, for now, seems to be safe, with Donald Trump calling Waltz a “very good man”.

Despite the prospect of congressional investigations, there are still significant questions left unanswered about the leak, with Waltz and Trump contradicting each other in separate interviews. Waltz on Tuesday said that a staffer was not responsible for the leak.

“Look, I take full responsibility, I built the group,” Waltz said. But Trump suggested the opposite during an interview.

“What it was, we believe, is somebody that was on the line with permission, somebody that worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level, had Goldberg's number or call through the app, and somehow this guy ended up on the call,” Trump said. His statements were unclear, since the Atlantic journalist was added to a text chat, not a phone call.

The use of Signal for internal government discussions has also been called into question. A non-profit organization, American Oversight, sued members of the Trump administration on Tuesday afternoon, saying the app's use violated the Federal Records Act. The organization is requesting that a federal court order the officials to preserve the messages “to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Search plane spotted family sheltering overnight on wing of small aircraft that crashed and partly sunk into frigid lake

A pilot and his two young daughters survived on the wing of a plane for about 12 hours after it crashed and was partly submerged in an icy Alaska lake, then were rescued after being spotted by a good Samaritan.

Terry Godes said he saw a Facebook post on Sunday night calling for people to help search for the missing plane, which did not have a locator beacon. On Monday morning about a dozen pilots including Godes headed out to scour the rugged terrain. Godes headed toward Tustumena Lake near the toe of a glacier and spotted what he thought was wreckage.

“It kind of broke my heart to see that, but as I got closer down and lower, I could see that there's three people on top of the wing,” he told the Associated Press on Tuesday.

After saying a prayer, he continued to approach and saw a miracle.

“They were alive and responsive and moving around,” Godes said, adding that they waved at him.

The missing Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser, piloted by a man with two juvenile immediate family members aboard, was on a sightseeing tour from Soldotna to Skilak Lake on the Kenai Peninsula. It was not immediately clear how old the juveniles were.

In a social media post early on Monday, John Morris implored people to help search for his son and granddaughters, saying they were late returning from a Sunday – afternoon flight.

“There are friends ready to search at daylight. But this is my plea for any and all help to locate my family,” he wrote.

The three were rescued on the eastern edge of Tustumena Lake on Monday by the Alaska army national guard after Godes alerted other searching pilots that he had found them. Another pilot, Dale Eicher, heard Godes's radio call and related it to troopers since he was closer to Skilak Lake and figured he had better cell reception. He was also able to provide the plane's coordinates to authorities.

“I wasn't sure if we would find them, especially because there was a cloud layer over quite a bit of the mountains, so they could have very easily been in those clouds that we couldn't get to,” Eicher said. But finding the family alive within an hour of starting the search “was very good news”.

The three were taken to a hospital with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, Alaska state troopers said.

Godes said many miracles were at play, from the plane not sinking, to the survivors being able to stay atop the wing, to them surviving nighttime temperatures dipping below 30F (-1C).

“They spent a long, cold, dark, wet night out on top of a wing of an airplane that they weren't planning on,” Godes said.

Alaska has few roads, leaving many communities to rely on small airplanes to get around.

Last month 10 people died when a small commuter plane that was overweight by half a ton crashed on to sea ice in the Norton Sound, near Nome on the state's western coast.

And five years ago, a midair collision near the Soldotna airport claimed seven lives including that of a state lawmaker.

For this week's rescue, the national guard dispatched a helicopter from its base in Anchorage.

The initial plan of using a hoist to pluck the crash survivors from the wing proved too dangerous, as the the smallest girl was being buffeted and blown around by the wind created by the helicopter, said Lt Col Brendon Holbrook, commander of the 207th aviation regiment. So instead the aircraft hovered to the side and pulled them on board.

Personnel reported that the girls were surprisingly dry but the man had been in the water at some point, Holbrook said: “We don't know to what extent, but he was hypothermic.”

Holbrook said he was told they had basic clothing one would wear on small planes without very good heating systems, but nothing sufficient to keep warm outside in wintry temperatures with cold winds blowing on the lake.

“It was literally the best possible scenario and outcome,” Holbrook said. “Ultimately the crew of that airplane were lucky, because from what my guys told me, that plane was in the ice with the tail refrozen, and if that tail hadn't refrozen, it would have sunk.”

The 60,000-acre (24,200-hectare) Tustumena Lake, the largest freshwater body on the Kenai Peninsula, is about 80 miles (130km) south-west of Anchorage, with nearby mountains and a glacier.

It has been described by the Alaska department of fish and game as “notorious for its sudden, dangerous winds”, with conditions that can cause havoc for both boats and planes.

“The terrain helps turn the winds around, and occasionally they get a little squirrelly,” said Michael Kutz, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Anchorage.

Godes agreed that the area is always windy and the water can be whipped up into waves.

“Then just the way it's placed right there at the heel of that, or at the toe of that glacier where you've got mountains on both sides, you know, just a few miles to the west, you've got Cook Inlet running back and forth with huge temperature and tidal swings every day,” he said. “It's just a recipe for chaos and for turbulence.”

There was no indication yet why the plane crashed.

Mark Ward, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board's Alaska division, said the pilot had not yet reported the accident, nor had the agency been able to contact him. Efforts were to be made again on Wednesday to speak to him.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

James Malone triumphed in a district that voted for Trump over Harris by more than 15 points in last November

A Democrat won a state senate seat in a Pennsylvania district that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump, offering a ray of hope for the party as it continues to struggle nationally with its response to the Trump administration.

James Malone triumphed on Tuesday in the 36th senatorial district, which voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by more than 15 points in last November's presidential election, in a victory that Democratic party leadership said “should put Republicans on edge”.

It served as a major upset win for the party, which has seen recriminations spill out into the open after Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader, voted for Republicans' funding bill to avoid a government shutdown this month.

“I'm very excited and really, really happy that all the work we put in has paid off,” Malone, who won the district by 482 votes, told WGAL-TV.

“Everyday voters are not liking what they're seeing at the federal level, they don't like the chaos. We want to be sure that we, as Pennsylvania, are standing up for our neighbors and are standing up for our state.

“And, brotherly love is Pennsylvania, and that just proved out. Kindness over criticism, right? So that's what we're trying to do, and I think that that really is what we're looking at moving forward.”

Trump won Pennsylvania by less than 2% of the vote in 2024, after the state voted for Joe Biden four years earlier. The state has a Democratic governor, rising star Josh Shapiro, but is a persistent swing vote nationally, and is crucial to Democratic hopes of winning the White House in 2028.

Malone's win capped a second Pennsylvania victory for Democrats on Tuesday, with Dan Goughnour winning a house seat to maintain the party's slim control of the state house.

“It's only March, and Democrats have defied the odds again with another upset victory in Republican territory,” Heather Williams, president of the Democratic legislative campaign committee, said in a statement.

“Democrats are on a roll in state legislative races in 2025, from flipping red seats to defending one-seat majorities, which should put Republicans on edge. Both wins affirm Democratic leadership in a moment when GOP power is synonymous with chaos.”

Nationally Democrats have been struggling to present party unity, and Schumer has faced backlash from his colleagues over his funding bill vote. Several Democrats in the House of Representatives, including Glenn Ivey and Delia Ramirez, have suggested Schumer resign, Reuters reported, prompting Schumer to tell NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: “I'm not stepping down.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the popular congresswoman from New York who recently launched a “fighting oligarchy” tour with Bernie Sanders, has criticized what she called an “acquiesce” by Schumer to the Republicans.

“There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people,” she said. “Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think, is a huge slap in the face.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Approved refugees reportedly affected by freeze on processing after Trump demands more aggressive vetting

The Trump administration has paused the processing of certain green card applications as the US government continues to implement a hardline immigration agenda.

CBS News reported that approved refugees are part of the processing freeze, as the White House enacts an effort to more aggressively vet immigrants to the US.

The move is likely to leave some immigrants granted refuge in the US in limbo, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claiming the pause is necessary to carry out two executive actions on immigration signed by Donald Trump.

“USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services] is placing a temporary pause on finalizing certain Adjustment of Status applications pending the completion of additional screening and vetting to identify potential fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, in alignment” with Trump's orders, DHS told CBS News.

Adjustment of status is the process by which individuals can apply to become a lawful permanent resident, or green-card holder, in the US.

The DHS cited a presidential action issued by Trump in January, which ordered the federal government to ensure people seeking admission to the US “are vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible”.

It comes as a federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday blocked immigration officials from detaining Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student and legal permanent resident the Trump administration is trying to deport for taking part in Gaza solidarity protests.

Chung, 21, has lived in the US since she was seven years old. She filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Monday, arguing the government was “attempting to use immigration enforcement as a bludgeon to suppress speech that they dislike”.

Chung's case has echoes of the ongoing detention of Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist and green-card holder who took part in protests at Columbia, and experts told the Guardian that there was evidence that people of color are being targeted for deportation.

At least five students and academics of color who participated in protests in support of Palestine at US universities have been targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as a part of the Trump administration's ongoing crackdown on Palestinian support.

“What we're seeing is the use of immigration law to go after visa holders, permanent lawful residents, [over] their speech,” Samah Sisay, a staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights, told the Guardian this week. “[Trump is] trying to suppress political speech that goes against what the administration wants.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

Edward Coristine, who is 19, is among members of Doge effort that has been given access to official networks

The best-known member of Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.

Edward Coristine is among the most visible members of the Doge effort that has been given sweeping access to official networks as it attempts to radically downsize the US government. It is headed by Musk – the world's richest man – with a powerful mandate from Donald Trump.

Past reporting had focused on the staffer's youth – he is 19 – and his chosen nickname of “bigballs,” which became a pop culture punchline. Musk has championed the teen on his social media site X, telling his followers last month: “Big Balls is awesome.”

Beginning around 2022, while still in high school, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, according to corporate and digital records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with half a dozen former associates. Among its users was a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name “EGodly,” according to digital records preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools and the online cybersecurity tool Any.Run.

The details of Coristine's connection to EGodly have not been previously reported.

On 15 February 2023, EGodly thanked Coristine's company for its assistance in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

“We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website,” the message said.

The digital records reviewed by Reuters showed the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was tied to internet protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other Coristine-owned entities between October 2022 and June 2023, and that some users attempting to access the site around that time would hit a DiamondCDN “security check”.

Coristine did not return messages seeking comment. Musk's team, which is not an official government department, did not respond to emails about Coristine.

Coristine is listed as a “senior adviser” at the state department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to one official at each agency who told Reuters they had seen his name in their respective agencies' staff directory.

On LinkedIn, Coristine describes himself as a “Volunteer (Intern) Plumber” with the US government.

The state department did not return messages asking about Coristine. CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.

EGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for the past year; attempts to elicit comment from eight people who participated in or interacted with EGodly were unsuccessful.

DiamondCDN's website – CDN typically stands for “content delivery network” – was registered in mid-2022, according to records collected by DomainTools. It pitched itself as offering “excellent security tools” that would help “lower your infrastructure costs”, according to copies of the site maintained by the Internet Archive. The site said the company “has no business inspecting user content”.

In 2023, EGodly boasted on its Telegram channel of hijacking phone numbers, breaking into unspecified law enforcement email accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and cryptocurrency theft.

Early that year, the group distributed the personal details of an FBI agent who they said was investigating them, circulating his phone number, photographs of his house, and other private details on Telegram.

EGodly also posted an audio recording of an obscene prank call made to the agent's phone and a video, shot from the inside of a car, of an unknown party driving by the agent's house in Wilmington, Delaware, at night and screaming out the window: “EGodly says you're a bitch!“

Reuters could not independently verify EGodly's boasts of cybercriminal activity, including its claims to have hijacked phone numbers or infiltrated law enforcement emails. But it was able to authenticate the video by visiting the same Wilmington address and comparing the building to the one in the footage.

The FBI agent targeted by EGodly, who is now retired, told Reuters that the group had drawn law enforcement attention because of its connection to swatting, the dangerous practice of making hoax emergency calls to send armed officers swarming targeted addresses. The agent didn't go into detail. Reuters is not identifying him out of concern for further harassment.

“These are bad folks,” the former agent said. “They're not a pleasant group.”

He declined to comment further about the harassment or whether EGodly had been or still was the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI didn't return messages seeking comment on EGodly.

Reuters was not able to ascertain how long EGodly used DiamondCDN, or whether EGodly paid Coristine's company. Archived copies of DiamondCDN's website said the firm envisioned having both paying and nonpaying customers.

Another individual who has been subject to abuse from EGodly and a cybercrime researcher who has followed the group said it was composed of hardened fraudsters, citing the group's makeup and the credibility of its claims. Both asked not to be identified, citing fears of retaliation.

Even if the connection between Coristine and EGodly were fleeting, Nitin Natarajan, who served as the deputy director of CISA under Joe Biden, told Reuters it was worrying that someone who provided services to EGodly only two years ago was part of a group that has gained wide access to government networks.

“This stuff was not in the distant past,” he said. “The recency of the activity and the types of groups he was associated would definitely be concerning.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

That's incredibly dangerous","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/26/donald-trump-war-on-woke-science-diversity","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:05:00 GMT","

Contrary to claims by the US president, we have found that diversity initiatives result in better scientists and greater progress

Donald Trump's attacks on diversity, equality and inclusion (DEI) initiatives since his January inauguration have been intense, indiscriminate and escalating. A tragic plane crash was baselessly blamed on DEI. All DEI programmes within public bodies have been ended and private contractors face cancellation if they also don't comply. Webpages that defend religious diversity in the context of Holocaust remembrance have been taken down.

Science and academia have been particularly targeted. Universities are threatened with losing federal funding if they support DEI. Government reports and government-funded research are being held back if they include prohibited terms such as “gender”, “pregnant person”, “women”, “elderly”, or “disabled”. Grants funded by the National Institutes of Health are being cancelled if they address diversity, equality or inclusion in any form.

What is more, this total “war on woke” (more accurately: “fight against fairness”) is happening in the UK as well as the US. Already, British companies and British watchdogs are abandoning their diversity drives. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch has described diversity initiatives as a “poison”.

These attacks are rooted in wilful distortions of what DEI is all about. There are two big lies that need to be nailed. The first is that diversity and inclusion initiatives compromise the quality of employees by selecting incompetent candidates because of their minority group membership. The second is that DEI is a distraction that holds back success. Let's consider each in turn, using the field of science itself as an example.

The notion that DEI involves putting group membership before ability and leads to the appointment of incompetent candidates is a misrepresentation of what DEI initiatives are all about. Scientific ability is not restricted to one sex, ethnicity or religion, or to the able-bodied. Embracing diversity has the simple advantage of widening the pool of talent from which scientists are drawn. DEI initiatives are about ensuring that less competent members of the most privileged groups are not advantaged over more competent members of less privileged groups.

Bias starts at school, particularly in the physical sciences, where both girls and boys consider these “boy subjects” by the time they are teenagers. Even once you start your academic career, bias affects grant funding decisions and publication rates. Women and minorities face additional barriers to career progression: for instance, both female and ethnic minority scientists receive less credit for their work than male or white scientists respectively. Bias affects whether you feel at home in the scientific workplace. Institutions that tackle the many workplace barriers for women and ethnic minorities (child-unfriendly working hours, tolerance of harassment, culturally insensitive socialisation practices) have higher retention rates among women and minority researchers. Diverse workplaces attract more diverse staff to apply for jobs – creating a positive feedback loop. And we know that scientific research teams and institutions that prioritise diversity perform better.

As for the second myth that DEI is a barrier to success, diversity actually improves the quality of science. Evidence shows that scientific papers produced by ethnically diverse teams are more impactful than those written by homogeneous teams. Similarly, studies show that diverse teams consider more alternatives and make better decisions.

Scientists from diverse backgrounds raise new research questions and priorities – especially questions that affect minoritised communities. The lack of women in the higher echelons of biomedical science has led to a comparative lack of research into menstrual and reproductive health problems. The lack of black scientists has led to a neglect of conditions that affect black people such as sickle cell disease. And when it comes to the intersection of “race” and sex, things are even worse. It is only in the last few years that it even became known that black and Asian women are much more likely to die in pregnancy or childbirth than white women.

Medical sciences and social sciences have long suffered from a lack of diversity in research design, leading to worse medicine because findings do not apply to all populations. For example, clinical trials have tended to test treatments mainly on men and on white people, leading to poorer health outcomes for women or minorities. A diverse group of researchers makes members of minorities more willing to volunteer for trials and helps ensure diverse participant recruitment. This improves scientific validity. It also increases the trust of minorities in the outputs of research (say, the development of new vaccines) and hence the societal impact of the research (say, their willingness to get vaccinated).

All in all, ensuring diversity and equality and inclusion among scientists makes for better scientists and better science. While our examples are drawn from science, they are true much more broadly. DEI initiatives are about ensuring that we always select the best irrespective of group membership, not about selecting by group membership irrespective of who is best. Science is fundamentally about discovering truth through rigorous, unbiased, transparent inquiry and narrow pools of talent or perspectives make that much harder. Therefore, DEI initiatives are necessary to achieving the core mission of science, not a distraction from it.

Supreme court judges decide former president should face criminal prosecution alongside seven close allies

Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro will stand trial for allegedly orchestrating a violent plot to seize power through a military coup, after the country's supreme court decided he should face criminal prosecution.

The ruling leaves the far-right populist, who governed Brazil from 2019 until the end of 2022, facing political oblivion and a possible jail sentence of more than 40 years.

The supreme court decided that seven other close allies of the ex-president should also stand trial for crimes including involvement in an armed criminal organization, coup d'état and violently attempting to abolish Brazilian democracy.

They are: Bolsonaro's former defense ministers Gen Walter Braga Netto and Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira; his former navy commander, Adm Almir Garnier Santos; his former security minister, Anderson Torres; his former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem; his former minister for institutional security, Gen Augusto Heleno; and his former assistant, Lt Col Mauro Cid, who, if convicted, will receive a lighter sentence after he struck a plea deal with prosecutors.

The men are accused of forming the kernel of a sprawling conspiracy to keep Bolsonaro in power after he narrowly lost the 2022 presidential election to his leftwing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

On Wednesday five supreme court judges – Cristiano Zanin, Alexandre de Moraes, Luiz Fux, Flávio Dino and Cármen Lúcia – unanimously ruled that there was sufficient evidence for all of those men to face prosecution and officially declared them defendants.

The accusations relate to an alleged plan to stage a pro-Bolsonaro coup in the months between the October 2022 election and the far-right riots that broke out in Brasília on 8 January 2023 – one week after Lula's inauguration.

Those attacks – which many believe were inspired by the 6 January 2021 storming of the US Capitol – were allegedly incited as part of a last-ditch attempt to return Bolsonaro to the presidency, against the public will, by creating turmoil that would justify a military intervention.

“It was a veritable pitched battle … It was an extraordinarily violent attempted coup d'état,” the supreme court judge Alexandre de Moraes told the court as he showed video footage of Bolsonarista hooligans vandalizing the supreme court and attacking police in the capital.

“Untamed violence – utter insolence … These images leave no doubt as to the materiality and the gravity of the crimes committed,” Moraes added.

In the weeks and months before the rightwing rampage in Brasília, a series of other machinations were allegedly afoot in the hope of stopping Lula taking power – some of them deadly. Police claim one sub-plot – code-named “Green and Yellow Dagger” – included plans to cause social and political chaos by assassinating Lula with poison and shooting the supreme court judge Moraes dead.

Brazil's attorney general, Paulo Gonet, told the court police investigators had “uncovered a terrifying operation to carry out the coup, which even included killing the president and vice-president elect, as well as that of a supreme court minister”.

One assassination plot “envisaged using explosives, military ordnance and poison … [and] the operators only didn't follow through on what had been agreed because they didn't manage to … co-opt the commander of the army,” Gonet added, urging judges to put Bolsonaro and his alleged accomplices on trial.

Bolsonaro rejected the charges in a lengthy WhatsApp statement sent to allies as the hearing began on Tuesday, calling the case against him “an aberration, the like of which has never been seen before”. “They are accusing me of a crime I never committed – a supposed attempted coup,” Bolsonaro claimed, insisting he had never desired or suggested “a democratic rupture”.

However, the former president admitted having discussed what he called “political alternatives for the nation” with his aides.

In court, lawyers for the accused also denied their clients had broken the law, although many stopped short of denying a coup attempt had taken place.

Bolsonaro's lawyer, Celso Vilardi, denied the ex-president had been involved in the 8 January uprising or led a criminal organization that plotted to murder Lula and other top authorities.

José Luis Mendes de Oliveira Lima, a lawyer representing Braga Netto, called his client “a man of unblemished reputation” who was not guilty of “any kind of criminal act”.

Oliveira's lawyer, Andrew Fernandes Faris, called the former defense minister “a most honourable man”, and called for the charges against him to be thrown out.

The lawyer for Torres, Eumar Novacki, denied his client was part of the “macabre coup drama” and claimed the investigation was filled with “false conclusions”.

Demóstenes Torres, representing Santos, also denied his client was part of the plot and attacked the “federal police novelists” he claimed had concocted a fictional narrative about the supposed conspiracy.

Ramagem's lawyer, Paulo Renato Garcia Cintra Pinto, said it would have made no sense for his client to have tried to destroy Brazil's democracy since he had himself just been elected to congress in the 2022 election.

Bernardo Mello Franco, a political commentator for the newspaper O Globo, said he saw little chance of the ex-president avoiding jail. “Bolsonaro will probably be convicted, Bolsonaro will probably be arrested – or he'll go into exile, he'll flee the country … From a judicial standpoint Bolsonaro's cornered,” he said.

Bolsonaro's best chance of a “political resurrection” lay in helping elect a rightwing ally in next year's presidential election who would agree to pardoning him after taking power. His congressman son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, and wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, were possible candidates.

The far-right populist was also banking on support from his most important foreign ally, the US president, Donald Trump, in his quest to avoid jail and ensure his political survival.

“Bolsonaro is hoping Trump will be a kind of saviour for him, both politically and judicially. He believes Trump will somehow interfere in Brazilian politics to help him,” said Mello Franco, although he suspected Trump had bigger fish to fry.

“Right now, I think Trump seems to have greater priorities than Brazil … [and that] the Bolsonaros are paying more attention to Trump than Trump is paying to Bolsonaro.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Delegation originally meant to visit the capital will now have a trip only to the island's US military base

Denmark has welcomed the Trump administration's decision to scale back an unsolicited visit to Greenland as a sign the US is “de-escalating” after the planned trip sparked a diplomatic row with the Arctic island and Denmark.

The trip was originally to have involved a delegation led by the US second lady, Usha Vance, and including the White House national security adviser, Mike Waltz, visiting the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, and a dog sled race.

But after strong public statements opposing the visit from Greenland's prime minister, Múte B Egede, and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, it was announced that the trip would be more contained in scale and feature only a visit to the island's US military base, Pituffik.

The vice-president, JD Vance, said on Tuesday he would be joining his wife, a step that the Danish foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, appeared to allude to when he said the US was giving the impression of escalating the row “when they're actually de-escalating”.

The White House has not yet confirmed whether or not Waltz, who has since become embroiled in an embarrassing security leak, will still be travelling. His name was omitted from a list of those attending.

“I actually think it is very positive that the Americans are cancelling their visit to the Greenlandic community. Then they will instead make a visit to their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that,” Rasmussen told the Danish broadcaster DR.

Rasmussen was speaking on Wednesday, as US planes were preparing to take off from Nuuk airport after reportedly being loaded with bulletproof cars that had been delivered in preparation for the visit.

“The short of it is that the cars that were delivered a few days ago are now being brought back home, and there will be no visit from the US vice-president's wife and their security adviser to the Greenlandic community. It is being packed up, and that is positive,” Rasmussen said.

He added: “It's kind of a masterful spin in many ways, to make it look like they're escalating when they're actually de-escalating.”

The change of plans was claimed as a diplomatic victory by Copenhagen and Nuuk, which is now being led by a caretaker government while coalition talks continue after a general election earlier this month.

Greenland, a former Danish colony, is now a semi-autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark, but its foreign and security policies are run by Copenhagen.

On Tuesday, Frederiksen accused the US of putting “unacceptable pressure” on Greenland and Denmark – vowing: “It is pressure that we will resist.”

Donald Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to acquire the vast Arctic island for the US, had said that the American delegation was invited by Greenlandic “officials”. The Nuuk government responded by saying it had not issued any invitations for visits – “either official or private”. Egede had already accused Washington of “foreign interference.”

Pele Broberg, the leader of Naleraq, the most Trump and US-friendly Greenlandic party, which on Monday became the first party to leave coalition talks, accused the Danish media of prompting fears of “annexation”.

“We have more or less missed the chance to have a normal relationship with the US in the future, but I of course hope I am wrong,” he told Sermitsiaq.

Announcing that he would be joining his wife on the trip to Greenland, vice-president Vance said in a video on X: “Speaking for president Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world.”

Drew Horn, who worked in various roles in the first Trump administration and is now an investor in Greenlandic minerals, said the US government's intentions for the trip had been “manipulated and misrepresented”.

“The intent is to demonstrate friendliness and commitment to supporting security for Greenland. The intentions have been manipulated and misrepresented with a bunch of noise coming out of Denmark,” he said. “So the vice-president now is looking basically to do a troop visit and keep it very traditional.”

Horn, who is chief executive of Washington DC-based mineral investment company GreenMet, added: “It is not a threat, it is not a show of force, it is not meant to influence or interfere with the new government.”

Usha Vance, he said, had been invited to Greenland by the organisers of the dog sled race “as a show of friendship to learn more about the Greenlandic culture”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Politician says idea would be ‘compensation for centuries-old injustice' of children being assigned father's name

An Italian politician has proposed a law that would make it automatic for babies to be assigned their mother's surname at birth, a step that would mark a rupture with a centuries-old tradition and has sparked a fiery debate.

Dario Franceschini, a former culture minister from the centre-left Democratic party, argues that such legislation would “right a historic wrong”.

His proposal follows a 2022 ruling by the constitutional court which defined the practice of newborns automatically taking their father's surname as “discriminatory and harmful to the identity of the child”. The court said children should be given both parents' surnames in the order they decided, unless they agreed their children should take just one of them. If there was indecision or disagreement, it added, a judge would have the final say.

New legislation approved by parliament was required to implement the ruling, made six months before Giorgia Meloni's rightwing coalition came to power. The topic was buried in parliament before being revived by Franceschini, who argues that rather than creating “endless problems” with double-barrelled surnames, or choosing between the mother's or father's, a law should be established for only the maternal surname to be used.

“It is a simple thing and also compensation for a centuries-old injustice that has had not only a symbolic value, but has been a cultural and social source of gender inequality,” Franceschini added.

Like in many countries, children born in Italy are automatically registered with their father's surname, with the mother's surname usually permitted only if the father is absent from the child's life.

Franceschini said he would present the bill in the coming days, angering members of Meloni's coalition.

“Here are the great priorities of the Italian left,” Matteo Salvini, who leads the far-right League, wrote on X. “Of course, let's wipe these fathers off the face of the earth; that way we'll solve all the problems.”

Federico Mollicone, from Meloni's Brothers of Italy party, said Franceschini's vision would mark a shift “from patriarchy to matriarchy”. Mollicone was, however, open to the possibility of children assuming the surnames of both parents.

Pierantino Zanettin, from the Forza Italia party, said the move appeared to be “a provocation aimed, above all, at media attention”, while Giulia Bongiorno, from the League, called for “a point of balance that does not make any parent invisible”.

Franceschini was mostly applauded by other opposition members, apart from a sceptical Carlo Calenda, who leads the centrist Azione party. “Don't we have any other priorities? Boh,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

As White House takes aim at medical missions, SVG says it gave US proof that workers aren't human-trafficking victims

The prime minister of St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) said his government has provided evidence to the US that Cuban health workers in the country are not victims of human trafficking, as the Trump administration takes aim at the medical missions.

Speaking in advance of US secretary of state Marco Rubio's visit to the Caribbean on Wednesday, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said he was confident that the information he provided would settle US concerns about the deal under which Cuban medical professionals work in SVG.

Rubio, who is the child of Cuban immigrants, announced in February the expansion of an existing policy to target “forced labor” and “abusive and coercive labor practices”, which he claimed were part of Cuba's overseas medical missions.

But Caribbean leaders have consistently rejected the claims of human trafficking and stressed the important role the Cuban medical professionals play in saving lives in the region.

Gonsalves said he had provided US officials with evidence that there was “no human trafficking here, no forced labour, none of that”.

“We have modern labour laws, we follow all the international conventions when Cubans come here. They do excellent work, and they have their own bank accounts and are compensated comparably to nationals. They have a lot of benefits, including paid holidays. You can enter the program freely and leave the program,” he said.

Since its 1959 revolution, Cuba has been sending medics to both developed and developing countries around the world, including Italy, Brazil, and countries in the Caribbean and West Africa. Its doctors and nurses have been instrumental in tackling outbreaks such as Covid-19 and Ebola.

But under the expanded US policy, “current or former Cuban government officials, and other individuals, including foreign government officials, who are believed to be responsible for, or involved in, the Cuban labor export program” and their immediate family will be subjected to visa restrictions.

Cuba's ambassador to the SVG, Carlos Ernesto Rodríguez Etcheverry, earlier this month described the announcement as a “shameful decision”, saying that it has no legal basis and will deprive millions of people around the world of medical services.

“We really reject the idea … that Cuban doctors, Cuban nurses are slaves and that the Cuban government is involved in any trafficking issue with regard to our medical brigades. Because we respect our doctors, our nurses,” he told local media.

Describing the idea that Caribbean nations are involved in trafficking as “propaganda”, Gonsalves said that Cuban doctors operate private practices in SVG while they are employed by the government, and some apply for permanent residency in the country. “It's very clear that there isn't any sort of issue around trafficking as suggested,” he said.

Barbados's prime minister, Mia Mottley, currently chair of the Caricom group of Caribbean nations, told parliament that although Barbados does not currently have Cuban medical staff, “we could not get through the [Covid] pandemic without the Cuban nurses and the Cuban doctors”.

She added: “I will also be the first to tell you that we paid them the same thing that we pay Bajans, and that the notion, as was peddled not just by this government in the US, but the previous government, that we were involved in human trafficking by engaging with the Cuban nurses was fully repudiated and rejected by us.”

Mottley said that “like others in this region”, she is prepared to lose her US visa if “we cannot reach a sensible agreement on this matter”.

Caricom met on Friday, 21 March, to discuss Rubio's visit among other matters, Gonsalves said. During his visit to Jamaica, Rubio will hold bilateral meetings with officials from Jamaica, Trinidad and Barbados, before going to Guyana and Suriname. Gonsalves said that he was sure the issue of Cuban doctors would be raised by Caribbean governments.

A statement from Trinidad and Tobago announcing the meeting with Rubio said discussions would “focus on US foreign policy and the effect on Trinidad and Tobago and the wider region”, but did not specify whether the issue of Cuban doctors was on the agenda.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Donald Gorske, 71, has eaten two of the McDonald's offering every day since 1972, and holds the Guinness World Record

If chowing down on Big Mac hamburgers daily for more than 50 years had ever inflicted any harm on him, Donald Gorske would probably get himself evaluated for an obsessive disorder, he admitted.

But he has attained a measure of fame, having held since 1999 the Guinness World Record for most Big Macs eaten over a lifetime – while maintaining his cholesterol and blood sugar levels have always been normal.

And following through on a promise to never complain about her lack of cooking was all he needed to do to secure his wife's eternal support for his habit – despite experts' ubiquitous warnings that regular consumption of McDonald's and other fast food packed with calories, sodium, sugar and fat could contribute to weight gain, obesity and other health problems.

As Gorske put it: “There's nothing to make it be called a disorder.”

Gorske, 71, has been back in the news in some corners of the internet after extending his Guinness record to more than 35,000 in mid-March, documenting each dispatched burger with receipts and containers.

The Guardian used the occasion – achieved by eating Big Macs twice daily since 17 May 1972 – to ask him to detail precisely how deep was his devotion to McDonald's signature product, given the fascination it has caused among some in the public for years.

The devotion evidently is quite deep.

Among the most visible reminders of it is an electric stove that Gorske and his wife, Mary, bought before their wedding in 1975. It looks almost as new as the day they installed it in their kitchen because his unique diet does not require much cooking.

“It's more or less a decoration,” said the retired corrections officer from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. “We needed it to fill the space in between the cupboards.

“There's nothing to make me want to use a stove ever.”

Then there's the booth with his name on it at the McDonald's closest to his home. It is inside the second iteration of that McDonald's, which was opened in 2008 on the same property but on a spot just over from its torn-down predecessor.

Gorske says the booth marks the exact location where he proposed marriage to Mary, when that location was still a parking lot outside the original McDonald's there. And that booth is where he prefers to dine on the Big Macs he occasionally chooses to eat at the restaurant. Most Big Macs he brings home to refrigerate or freeze and then microwave to cut down on gasoline expenses – as well as to ensure he never loses access to his favorite burger in the event of, say, a blizzard.

“That's a special spot to me,” said Gorske, referring to his booth. He added that he appreciates how the owner of that McDonald's has also put up a picture of him on a wall there.

Gorske's gargantuan collection of Big Mac containers is another of the visuals created by his life's pursuit that he considers to be the most striking.

He stored the cartons in his attic until it ran out of capacity in 2006. Since then, Gorske has been keeping his containers in his basement – but they have stacked up so high that it tends to overwhelm visitors who get to see his collection.

“You can rub your hand over just hundreds and hundreds of cartons,” Gorske said. “And what I always tell people is that – how I look at it – is it's time. You know, every two cartons is a day of my life, and it's kind of a weird thing when you see something like that.”

Two cartons in particular which are neither in his basement nor attic – but permanently in his freezer – hold the last Big Macs he bought from the torn-down McDonald's outside of which he proposed to Mary, with whom he has a son. He regards them as a dear memento.

“The wife jokes that she probably will just throw them in the coffin with me because I'll never get around to eating those,” Gorske said.

Gorske said he channels much of the rest of his free time into participating in local senior bowling leagues four times weekly. He doesn't have a cell phone or a computer and therefore doesn't surf the internet, though he understands from loved ones that many are aware of his record-setting affinity for the item that most McDonald's eateries list as No 1 on their menu.

He reiterated advice he has given before for people who are potentially thinking about gunning for his Big Mac eating crown: don't.

“For somebody to want to do that, you're going to have to eat Big Macs for 50 years … and you're going to have to really like Big Macs,” Gorske said. “It's such an easy thing for me to do because I already do it every day.

“I'm just one of them people that can eat Big Macs constantly, and it's not going to affect my health at all.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Hamdan Ballal says Israeli soldiers beat him with their rifle butts and threatened to kill him

The Oscar-winning Palestinian film director Hamdan Ballal has said that Israeli settlers who attacked him were aided by two Israeli soldiers, who beat him with the butt of their rifles outside his home and threatened to kill him.

In an interview with the Guardian, Ballal, one of the four directors of the film No Other Land, which documents the destruction of villages in the West Bank and won best documentary at this year's Academy Awards, recounted how on Monday two Israeli soldiers first encircled him while a settler was assaulting him, before violently striking him on the head and threatening to shoot him.

“It all started around 6pm on Monday,” said Ballal, who was released on Tuesday after Israeli forces detained him in a police station in the West Bank. “We had finished our daily Ramadan fast in Susya in the Masafer Yatta area, south of Hebron, when someone called me to say that settlers had entered our village.”

Some of the settlers were armed with batons, others had knives and one was holding an M16 rifle, witnesses told the Guardian. Among them were a group of Israeli soldiers who escorted the settlers inside the village where Ballal lives.

“Because I work for a human rights organisation called Haqel: in Defense of Human Rights, and because I'm also a photographer, I went there to document what was happening,” he said. “I took three or four photos, and then I realised that the situation was deteriorating. There were dozens of settlers, and they were becoming increasingly aggressive.”

Masked settlers with sticks started attacking Palestinian residents, including a group of Jewish activists, smashing their car windows and slashing tyres, according to Josh Kimelman, an activist with the Center for Jewish Nonviolence (CJNV). Video provided by the group showed a masked settler shoving and swinging his fists at two activists in a dusty field at night.

“In that precise moment, I thought about my family, who were at home,” Ballal said. ‘‘I ran to them and told my wife, ‘Lock the house and keep the children inside.' They could have attacked me, but by doing so they wouldn't have harmed my family.”

One settler, escorted by two Israeli soldiers, walked straight over to Ballal's house. Soldiers started shooting in the air to prevent anyone from supporting Ballal, who was shouting for help.

“The soldiers pointed their rifles at me while the settler from behind began beating me,” Ballal said. “They threw me to the ground, and the settler started hitting me on the head. Then a soldier also began beating me; with the butt of his rifle, he struck me on the head. After that, he fired his weapon in the air. I don't understand Hebrew, but I gathered that he said the next rifle shot would hit me. In that moment, I thought I was going to die.”

Injured, handcuffed and blindfolded, Ballal and two other Palestinians were moved by the soldiers to a military vehicle and then to a police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where they spent the night on the floor and were forced to sleep under a freezing air conditioner.

Ballal said he was beaten by IDF soldiers while in detention. “It was a revenge for our movie,” he said. “I heard the voices of the soldiers, they were laughing about me … I heard [the word] ‘Oscar'.”

His lawyer, Lea Tsemel, said the three received only minimal care for their injuries from the attack and that she had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.

A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces denied Ballal was beaten in detention. They said: “The claims that the detainees were beaten during the night at an IDF detention facility were found to be entirely baseless.

“IDF forces facilitated medical treatment for the detainees after the initial transfer of the suspects to the Israel police, and throughout the night the detainees remained in a military detention facility while handcuffed in accordance with operational protocol.”

The spokesperson did not respond to Ballal's allegations that he was beaten by IDF soldiers in front of his house.

Born in 1989 in Susya, Hamdan Ballal Al-Huraini went on to become a film-maker, photographer and human rights activist. He won acclaim as co-director of No Other Land (2024), which exposes Israeli settler violence and the displacement of Palestinian communities in Masafer Yatta between 2019 and 2023.

Earlier this month, he and the film's other directors appeared on stage at the 97th Academy Awards in Los Angeles to accept the Oscar for best documentary.

The joint Israeli-Palestinian production has won a string of awards, starting at the Berlin international film festival in 2024. It has also drawn ire in Israel and abroad. The mayor Miami Beach in Florida proposed ending the lease of a theatre that screened it. Israel's culture minister, Miki Zohar, has called the Oscar win “a sad moment for the world of cinema”.

“We won the Oscar just three weeks ago, and the violence has escalated,” Ballal said. “Not only against me, not only against the activists and other crew members of the film, but against all the residents.”

The No Other Land co-director Yuval Abraham claimed on X that the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organises the Oscars, “sadly, declined to publicly support Hamdan Ballal while he was beaten and tortured by Israeli soldiers and settlers. Several US Academy members – especially in the documentary branch – pushed for a statement, but it was ultimately refused. We were told that because other Palestinians were beaten up in the settler attack, it could be considered unrelated to the film, so they felt no need to respond.

“In other words,” Abraham added, “while Hamdan was clearly targeted for making No Other Land, he was also targeted for being Palestinian – like countless others every day who are disregarded. This, it seems, gave the Academy an excuse to remain silent when a film-maker they honoured, living under Israeli occupation, needed them the most.”

The Academy has been contacted for comment.

The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta in the southern West Bank as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. About 1,000 people have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards, and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.

During the war in Gaza, Israel has killed hundreds of Palestinians in the West Bank during wide-scale military operations, and there has also been a rise in settler attacks on Palestinians.

CJNV shared details of at least 43 attacks in the village of Susya since the beginning of the year, perpetrated by violent settlers.

“They won't stop here,” Ballal said. “The settlers will continue to attack us. I'm more scared now than before.

“After what they did to me,” he added, “I fear it could now happen to others.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Günther Felßner says wife was ‘in fear of life and limb' after animal rights group climbed shed and set off flares

The conservative pick for German agriculture minister has withdrawn his candidacy after animal rights activists stormed his farm, prompting cross-party condemnation.

Günther Felßner, a farming lobbyist who had won the backing of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), said his wife was “in fear of life and limb” when activists climbed on to the cattle shed she was in to hang a banner and light smoke-emitting flares on Monday.

Felßner said he would withdraw his candidacy as a result of the protest, which politicians have criticised as antidemocratic. The Bavarian conservative leader Markus Söder called it an “attack on rural life” and demanded a special investigation.

Cem Özdemir, the acting agriculture minister in the caretaker government, from the Greens, posted on X: “Intimidation and threats have absolutely no place in our democracy. Not against Günther Felßner and his family, nor against anyone else.”

Referring to the farmer protests which took place in Germany last year, Özdemir said: “This applies to everyone, and it applies just as much to gallows, ferry blockades, and all other attacks.”

Radical protests have become a polarising force in Germany, with political tolerance for disruptive actions – such as climate activists gluing themselves to runways and farmers blocking streets with tractors – often dependent on the group carrying them out.

The outgoing coalition's cuts to tractor diesel subsidies caused furious protests in 2024 that included sightings of makeshift gallows.

In January 2024, a mob trapped the Green economy minister, Robert Habeck, on a ferry with his wife when they were coming home from holiday. Ricarda Lang, the party's co-leader at the time, was stopped from leaving a party meeting the following month by farmers who lit fires and blocked roads with tractors.

Joachim Rukwied, the president of the German farmer's association, who previously described the ferry blockade as a “no-go”, said on Wednesday he was astonished by the protest at Felßner's farm and deeply regretted the withdrawal of his candidacy.

“Such criminal actions are crimes and have nothing to do with freedom of expression or legitimate protest,” he said. “We must not allow these radical activists to further poison democratic discourse.”

He added that he thought activists should not be allowed to bring class action lawsuits either.

Middle Franconia police said they were investigating 13 people on suspicion of trespass, two who they understood to have climbed on to the roof and lit a flare.

Animal Rebellion, which hung the banner that read “No animal exploiter as agriculture minister”, defended its protest as peaceful and suggested Felßner was using it as an excuse to quit because his candidacy was unpopular. An online petition to stop him from becoming a minister gathered 400,000 signatures.

Felßner was fined by a court in 2018 for discharging waste on to his neighbour's property that polluted the water and soil.He has also alarmed experts by calling on the public to “eat meat for the climate”. Animal agriculture is responsible for 12-20% of the greenhouse gas pollutants worsening extreme weather, and climate scientists have found that eating less meat is a vital step to stop the planet from heating.

“An agricultural lobbyist, convicted environmental criminal and science denier is not a suitable candidate for the agriculture ministry,” an activist from Animal Rebellion said in a statement.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Mark Rutte says Nato needs to know US has its back but Europe must also do its fair share

Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte is speaking again, giving a lecture at the Warsaw School of Economics in which he strongly backs the role of the alliance and tells both Europe and the US that in the face of growing geopolitical challenges “this is not the time to go it alone.”

Here are the key passages so far:

I know there are questions about the strength of the transatlantic bond and the United States ‘ commitment to European security. There is tough rhetoric. There are difficult debates between Europe and America over trade and tariffs, and there are calls to revive ideas of European autonomy. 

Let me be absolutely clear: this is not the time to go it alone, not for Europe or North America. 

The global security challenges are too great for any of us to face on our own. 

When it comes to keeping Europe and North America safe, there is no alternative to Nato. Without the US, UK, Turkey, Canada, Norway and Iceland, it is impossible to imagine the defence of Europe, and nothing can replace America's nuclear umbrella, the ultimate guarantor of our security.

Rutte also added that he was “absolutely confident that United States remains committed to Nato and to Article Five,” adding:

“Don't just take my word for it. 

Listen to President Trump, who has repeatedly stated his commitment to a strong Nato. 

Listen to the strong bipartisan support in the US Congress, and listen to the American people, three quarters of whom support Nato, according to a recent poll.”

On earlier reports about four US troops and a vehicle missing in Lithuania (15:18), Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte told reporters that they were confirmed as dead.

Starting his news briefing after delivering a speech at the Warsaw School of Economics, he said:

Whilst I was speaking, the news came out about four American soldiers who were killed in an incident in Lithuania.

That's still early news, so we do not know the details, but obviously this is really terrible news, and our thoughts are with families and loved ones.

I sent a message to the American secretary of defence Pete Hegseth that, of course, our thoughts and prayers are with the families and with the United States.

Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT said the four servicemen “may have been killed,” but “this has not been officially confirmed,” while other Lithuanian outlets – TV3 and Lrytas – unofficially reported their deaths.

Lithuanian president Gitanas Nausėda was quoted by TV3 as saying that he was being kept up to date, but refusing to elaborate as “the circumstances are being clarified”.

LRT also reported that Lithuanian defence minister Dovilė Šakalienė was on the way to the training base.

A statement from the US army's Europe and Africa public affairs office in Wiesbaden, Germany, said earlier that the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time.

“A possible scene has now been identified, and a search and rescue operation is underway,” the Lithuanian military said in a statement.

In the meantime, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Paris, where he is due to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron this evening ahead of tomorrow's summit of the “coalition of the willing”.

He will also give a joint TV interview to France 2 and the European Broadcasting Union, which will be conducted by Caroline Roux (France 2), Jeremy Bowen (BBC), Jessy Wellmer (ARD), and Joakim Klementi (Estonian Public Broadcasting).

Rutte also gets asked about the suggestions that France could extend its nuclear deterrent programme to cover other countries.

Rutte says he “highly respects” both French and British nuclear deterrents, but insists that “there is no alternative to the nuclear umbrella the US is providing us.”

“When you look at an amount of nuclear warheads pointed at us from Russia, and increasingly, by the way, from China who will get to 1000 warheads by 2030, the only credible nuclear deterrence and ultimate guarantor of our freedom here is the United States of America. … 

There's no way the French and the Brits can replace this. 

And still, it is important that they have that nuclear deterrence, so I'm all for it, but it is not an alternative.”

He also once again seeks to reassure Europeans that the US remains committed to Article 5, pointing to Trump's comments in meetings with European leaders, and also because:

“The US realises that for their collective defence connected to the Euro-Atlantic Theater, including what they want to achieve in the Indo Pacific, being together as 32 allies … as one group, also projecting Nato/American power in the world, it is unbeatable.”

“We can worry about many things, but let's stop worrying about it,” he says.

And that's it for this event.

Discussing the question of security and defence funding, Rutte says that Donald Trump's inauguration in January radically changed the way the allies look at their budget planning.

He says:

Since then, look what happened. 

Belgium has been saying we want to get to 2% by the summer. Spain now is saying they want to get to 2% this summer. 

We know that Portugal, Italy, they all have these debates now.

And I tell them that, well, now I am calling you to ask you to deliver the 2% by the summer, so that collectively we can move considerably north of the 2% because we have to spend much, much more than 2% but now I am calling you, but you might get a very, erm, patient man from Washington on the line if you don't listen to me. 

And I would love to listen into those phone calls, but let's hope they are not necessary. 

At this moment, I must say that all these non two percenters are having genuine debates to move to the 2% before summer.

(Who am I to disagree, but since he mentioned it: Spain remains committed to meeting 2% only in… 2029 (11:05), although prime minister Sanchez has suggested he would try to do it sooner than that.)

Rutte is now taking questions.

Asked about the US-led peace talks with Russia and Ukraine, he says he is “glad that president Trump broke the deadlock,” and remains “positive” about the negotiations.

“It will be a step by step process. Nato gets regular updates. I know the Europeans are as much as possible involved. 

But in the end, of course, these are conducted by the Americans with the Ukrainians and the Russians.

He goes on:

We always have been very clear. We need to bring Ukraine to a durable, a lasting peace. Vladimir Vladimirovich should never try again to attack Ukraine.

He notes the Franco-British initiative to offer security guarantees for Ukraine, which will meet in Paris on Thursday, saying Macron and Starmer are “working hard to bring together European countries to potentially help maintaining peace in Ukraine.”

“The most important thing is that these discussions are now taking place, but obviously you first need a peace deal before you can keep a peace. 

You can only keep a peace if there is a peace to keep, and that is exactly the process we are now in.”

Rutte also clearly rejects Putin's demand to have a say in a broader security landscape in Europe.

“He has absolutely no say in how we organise ourselves within the 32 alliance. Absolutely no say at all. 

And I hate this whole idea of having a sort of two tier Nato that you have somehow the eight countries on the eastern flank, different from the other 24 allies … 

With the latest missile technology coming out of Russia, the difference between an attack on Warsaw or an attack in Madrid is 10 minutes. So we are all on the eastern flank. Amsterdam is at the eastern flank. London is at the eastern flank. Even Washington is at the eastern flank. …

It is important to realise this and Putin has to know that [if] he would try to get a square kilometre of Estonia or of Poland, or of Slovakia, or for of Spain or Portugal, for that matter, that our reaction will be devastating and that the full onslaught of Nato will be upon him.”

Attempting to explain some of Trump's frustration with burden sharing, Nato's Rutte wants to send a clear signal to European countries to step up their defence and spending responsibilities within the alliance, as he says:

Yes, Europe needs to know that Uncle Sam still has our back.

But America also needs to know that its Nato allies will step up.

Without restrictions and without capability gaps. It's only fair.

Reassurance is a two-way street.

The US commitment to Nato comes with a clear expectation that European allies and Canada take more responsibility for our shared security.

He adds that the alliance will look at this issue again during the upcoming summit in the Hague in June.

He says:

A fair Nato means all allies doing their fair share, and a more lethal Nato means that where we will always remain a defensive alliance, we will always be ready and able to do whatever it takes to stay safe.

He then also notes a “sea change” in spending over the last year alone, as he acknowledges Poland's position at the top Nato spender at 4.7% GDP, but also gives credit to other countries that have committed “to considerably ramp up spending.”

“This acceleration is absolutely necessary, and we have to keep our foot on the gas [pedal,]” he says.

Nato's secretary general Mark Rutte is speaking again, giving a lecture at the Warsaw School of Economics in which he strongly backs the role of the alliance and tells both Europe and the US that in the face of growing geopolitical challenges “this is not the time to go it alone.”

Here are the key passages so far:

Poland moves closer to implementing the controversial plans to temporarily suspend the right to claim asylum for irregular migrants coming from Belarus after the country's president, Andrzej Duda, signed the law reforming the existing rules.

The move came after repeated requests from prime minister Donald Tusk, who said earlier this week that an implementing act was waiting for the law to enter into force.

The government is planning an information campaign in foreign languages to target migrants in their countries of origin and discourage them from attempting to cross the border, he said.

Any suspension of the right to claim asylum would need to be territorially limited and time restricted to 60 days but could be then further extended by a vote in parliament.

Polish broadcaster TVN24 noted that the law includes an exemption for unaccompanied minors, pregnant women, and particularly vulnerable people, who will still be able to seek to claim asylum.

Last week, Tusk explained the reform was needed to counter “the pressure on our border with Belarus … which is growing” as he accused Alexander Lukashenko and Russia's Vladimir Putin of encouraging irregular migration to put pressure on the EU's external borders.

According to the Polish government, people trying to cross the border in 2024 came from 51 countries, with the greatest numbers coming from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Syria.

The European Commission responded to reports of Russia seeking sanctions relief as part of a maritime ceasefire in Ukraine, saying today that one of its main precondition would be to see “the unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces” from Ukraine.

In a stark response to Russian demands, EU spokesperson said in a statement, reported by Reuters:

The end of the Russian unprovoked and unjustified aggression in Ukraine and unconditional withdrawal of all Russian military forces from the entire territory of Ukraine would be one of the main preconditions to amend or lift sanctions.

The spokesperson added that “Russia must now demonstrate genuine political will to end its illegal and unprovoked war of aggression.”

She also pointedly noted that “experience has shown that Russia must be judged by its actions, not by its words.”

Four US army soldiers have gone missing in Lithuania during a scheduled tactical training, the US embassy in Vilnius said in a social media post.

US Army, Lithuanian Armed Forces and Lithuanian law enforcement agencies are conducting a search operation.

The four soldiers are all from 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, the statement said.

The V Corps commanding general Lt. Gen. Charles Costanza thanked the authorities for their help as the search continues.

Austria said it would pause family reunifications for those with asylum status from May, becoming the first in the European Union to do so.

Interior minister Gerhard Karner said in a government press release the move was necessary to counter the impact on “schools, health system and even security” in the country.

It said that in 2023 and 2024, over 17,000 came to Austria through the scheme, mostly underage school-age children from Syria.

After new security measures were implemented, including DNA testing and document verification, the number of successful applications has dropped to just 60 in February 2025, down from a thousand a year earlier.

“By May, so in just a few weeks, the stop is expected to become reality,” integration minister Claudia Plakolm told reporters, adding the country's “systems have reached their limits”.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen hinted that the EU could step in to support Radio Free Europe after recent US funding cuts by the Trump administration.

Responding to a push from a coalition of countries, led by the Czech Republic, von der Leyen said:

Radio Free Europe provides independent reporting to many countries where media freedom is threatened. We‘ll work with partners including [flags of the Czech Republic, Austria, Belgium, Lithuanian, Latvia, Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Slovenia] to support @RFERL‘s award winning journalism. The world needs media freedom.

The European Union has announced its EU Preparedness Union Strategy, outlining plans to prevent and respond to new crises and threats, such as floods, wildfires, or conflicts. The strategy includes stark advice to keep essential supplies to get through 72 hours of an emergency.

EU social rights and preparedness commissioner Roxana Mînzatu said the bloc wanted to “talk to our citizens, of all generations” to make sure they are “equipped, skilled, prepared” to react to power cuts, natural disasters, and other potential issues.

The underlying report said that the EU crisis management is “mostly reactive, rather than pro-active,” with insufficient tools for spotting risks early, and fragmented response mechanisms.

The strategy proposes 30 actions, including developing “minimum preparedness criteria” for essential services, enhancing the stockpiling of critical equipment and materials, and encouraging the public to adopt practical measures, such as “maintaining essential supplies for a minimum of 72 hours in emergencies.”

Senator Mark Warner, who questioned national intelligence director and CIA director on Tuesday says messages clearly classified as Gabbard doubles down on claims

Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who grilled top security officials during Tuesday's Senate intelligence committee briefing, appeared on Morning Joe this morning to discuss the recently released text messages published by the Atlantic on Wednesday.

“Well it sure answers that the two witnesses I believe lied when they said, ‘Oh, nothing to see here, nothing classified,'” he said.

“You would have to be an idiot not to understand that what Jeffrey [Goldberg] just laid out is at a huge classification level. That if it had fallen into enemy hands and the Houthis had been able to realign their offenses, American lives could be lost,” he added.

Warner and other senators questioned Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and CIA director John Ratcliffe about the group chat that discussed war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Gabbard said on Tuesday that “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.

Donald Trump will hold a press conference to announce tariffs on the auto industry today at 4pm, according to the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Wednesday's press conference will be in the Oval Office.

National security adviser Michael Waltz said on Fox News that a staffer wasn't responsible for adding the Atlantic's editor-in-chief to the group chat and that he “takes full responsibility” for building the group and maintaining coordination.

“Have you ever had somebody's contact that shows their name and then you have somebody else's number?,” Waltz said.

“You have somebody else's number on someone else's contact, so of course I didn't see this loser in the group,” he added, referring to the Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.

The Guardian's Peter Beaumont offers an analysis of what the latest Signal leak revelations expose:

The disclosure by the Atlantic of further devastating messages from the Signal chat group used by the Trump administration's most senior security officials has nailed the lie that nothing that threatened the safety of US servicemen and women was shared on the group.

After the vague and evasive assertions by Trump officials at Monday's Senate intelligence committee hearing, from the White House, and from the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that no war plans or classified material was shared, readers can make up their own minds.

Despite Hegseth's angry denial, the exchanges in the leaked group chat did contain details of war planning, shared recklessly by him in advance of the attack on 15 March, on a messaging system and perhaps devices which he and others in the chat could not have been certain were secure.

Most damning is the fact that Hegseth sent details in advance of the F-18s and other aircraft that would take part in the attack, including the timing of their arrival at targets, and other assets that would be deployed.

As Ryan Goodman, a law professor who formerly worked at the Pentagon, put it after the latest release: “The Atlantic has now published the Signal texts with attack plans in response to administration denials. I worked at the Pentagon. If information like this is not classified, nothing is. If Hegseth is claiming he declassified this information, he should be shown the door for having done so.”

In attempting to cover up and diminish their culpability for a shocking breach of operational security – including the fact that two participants in the chat were overseas (including one in Moscow at the time) – the Trump administration has made the scandal immeasurably more serious than it was already.

At the most simple level, the pilots who flew on those strikes should rightly be furious that the most senior civilian defence official placed them in harm's way.

Read the full analysis here:

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly.

“This is what happens when you don't really have your act together,” the Alaska Republican senator Lisa Murkowski told the Hill.

The Trump administration has been facing criticism from Democrats – and now Republicans – after Monday's embarrassing revelation that a team of senior national security officials accidentally added a journalist to a private group chat on Signal, an encrypted messaging app. The group, which included the vice-president, JD Vance; the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and others, discussed sensitive plans to engage in military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

On Wednesday morning the Atlantic posted another tranche of messages that contained details of the attack on Yemen, including descriptions of targets, launch times and even the details of weather during the assault.

Senior national security officials testified before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday, where the national intelligence director, Tulsi Gabbard, and CIA director, John Ratcliffe, were grilled by lawmakers over the scandal. The national security officials said “no classified material” was shared in the chat. Republicans are now calling for investigations as well.

Read the full story by José Olivares here:

National security officials have wrapped up their testimonies before the House intelligence committee on Wednesday.

A closed session will be held at 2pm ET today.

“Classified information is classified for a reason. Sec. Hegseth was openly sharing classified materials on an insecure channel that potentially endangered service members. And then he lied about it. He should resign,” Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois said on X, just moments after questioning intelligence officials at Wednesday's hearing.

“It is completely outrageous to me that administration officials come before us today with impunity, no acceptance of responsibility,” said Jason Crow of Colorado. He said the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, “must resign immediately. There can be no fixes, there can be no corrections until there is accountability.”
 Other Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee rejected assertions by Tulsi Gabbard and John Ratcliffe that no classified material was included in the chat. They pointed to chat messages released by the Atlantic on Wednesday as evidence the leak could have jeopardized the mission's success or endangered US service members' lives.

Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Alina Habba, downplayed the controversy over the group chat that mistakenly included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief.

“Look, it is what it is,” Habba told reporters. “At the end of the day, this is – in my opinion – something that they're making a big to do about nothing. A reporter that is trying to get clout.

“We stand by Mike Waltz; he's doing a tremendous job. I think this is a distraction.”

The Democratic representative Jimmy Gomez of California asked Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, and the CIA director, John Ratcliffe, whether the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, was drinking before the group chat discussions regarding war plans in Yemen were published.

“That's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is, no,” Ratcliffe said. “I just wish in an annual threats hearing, where the American people want to hear about threats, that that's what we would be talking about.”

Gabbard said: “Secretary Hegseth, in my experience, has continued to operate in the way that President Trump's confidence in him inspires, which is in the best interest of the American people and our war fighters and ensuring our national security, I think it's wrong to impugn him, especially at a point where he is not here to defend his own honor.”

The Republican senator Lindsey Graham defended Donald Trump and other members of his administration over their handling of the fiasco involving top national security officials discussing US military attack plans in Yemen in a group chat that inadvertently included the Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.

“President Trump and his team have admitted that having a journalist in the group text was wrong, will be reviewed and falls in the category of ‘lessons learned' so that it doesn't happen again,” Graham said in a statement. “I believe that all the participants in the chat were under the impression they were using an appropriate and secure form of communication. This will also fall into the category of ‘lessons learned'.

“However recent revelations about the content of the texts – while not discussing war plans per se – do in fact detail very sensitive information about a planned and ongoing military operation,” he added.

The US district court judge James Boasberg, whom the government has argued cannot be trusted with sensitive information in the Alien Enemies Act case, has been assigned to oversee a lawsuit alleging that government officials violated federal record-keeping laws when they used a group chat to discuss a planned military strike in Yemen, Politico reports.

“Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations,” the plaintiffs argue.

The Illinois Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi had an aide hold up Signal messages released by the Atlantic that showed the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, shared in the group exact details of the strikes against the Houthis.

“This is classified information. It's a weapon system as well as sequence of strikes, as well as details about the operations,” Krishnamoorthi said. “This text message is clearly classified information. Secretary Hegseth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information. He needs to resign immediately.”

Warner and other senators questioned Tulsi Gabbard, director of national intelligence, and CIA director John Ratcliffe about the group chat that discussed war plans for upcoming military strikes in Yemen. Gabbard said on Tuesday that “there was no classified material” in the Signal chat.

As he had done before the Senate the day before, CIA director John Ratcliffe insisted he broke no rules and did not share classified information.

“I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information. And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success is what everyone should be focused on here, because that's what did happen, not possibly could have happened,” Ratcliffe told the House intelligence committee.

The House intelligence committee's top Democrat Jim Himes asked Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, why she had told senators on Tuesday that no details of timing, targets or weapons were revealed in the Signal group chat.

The Atlantic this morning published the transcript of the chat, which showed that defense secretary Pete Hegseth shared such details with the chat's participants ahead of the US military's airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen.

“My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof, on the details that were posted there ... What was shared today reflects the fact that I was not directly involved with that part of the Signal chat and replied at the end, reflecting the effects, the very brief effects that the national security advisor had shared,” Gabbard replied.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian US'}"

This live blog is now closed, you can read more of our Middle East coverage here

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated threats on Wednesday to seize territory in the Gaza Strip if Hamas failed to release the remaining hostages it still holds.

“The more Hamas continues in its refusal to release our hostages, the more powerful the repression we exert will be,” Netanyahu told a hearing in parliament, which was occasionally interrupted by shouting from opposition members. “This includes seizing territory and it includes other things,” he said, according to Reuters.

It is approaching 5pm in Gaza City and Tel Aviv, and 6pm in Damascus. This blog will be closing shortly but you can find all of the Guardian's latest Middle East coverage here.

Here are the key developments from today's Middle East live blog:

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated threats on Wednesday to seize territory in the Gaza Strip if Hamas failed to release the remaining hostages it still holds. “The more Hamas continues in its refusal to release our hostages, the more powerful the repression we exert will be,” Netanyahu told a hearing in parliament. “This includes seizing territory and it includes other things,” he said.

Hamas warned on Wednesday that hostages may be killed if Israel attempts to retrieve them by force and airstrikes continue in the Gaza Strip. The group said in a statement that it was “doing everything possible to keep the occupation's captives alive, but the random Zionist (Israeli) bombardment is endangering their lives,” adding: “every time the occupation attempts to retrieve its captives by force, it ends up bringing them back in coffins”.

US vice-president JD Vance on Wednesday dismissed a magazine story on the Trump administration inadvertently sending plans for an imminent attack on Yemen to a journalist as “oversold,” after the publication released the transcript. Yesterday, the US president, Donald Trump, defended his embattled national security adviser, Michael Waltz, and said the leak of highly classified military plans was “the only glitch in two months”.

Hundreds of Palestinians have joined protests in northern Gaza, shouting anti-Hamas slogans and calling for an end to the war with Israel, in what has been described as the largest protest against the militant group inside the territory since the 7 October attacks. Videos and photos shared on social media late on Tuesday showed hundreds of people, mostly men, chanting “Hamas out” and “Hamas terrorists” in Beit Lahia, where the crowd had gathered a week after the Israeli army resumed its intense bombing of Gaza after nearly two months of a truce.

Netanyahu on Wednesday accused the opposition of fuelling “anarchy” in Israel, after mass anti-government protests in recent days. Addressing the opposition during a speech in parliament, Netanyahu said: “Perhaps you could stop putting spanners in the works of the government in the middle of a war? Perhaps you could stop fuelling the sedition, hatred and anarchy in the streets?”

Thousands of Israelis have taken part in several days of anti-government protests, accusing Netanyahu of undermining democracy and resuming strikes in Gaza without regard for hostages. The demonstrations which erupted last week have been organised by a broad coalition of anti-Netanyahu groups, who called to protest against the premier's move to oust Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security agency. After a rally in Tel Aviv, protesters are due to travel to Jerusalem for an anti-government demonstration outside parliament on Wednesday evening.

An Oscar-winning Palestinian director who was attacked by Jewish settlers and detained by Israeli forces has been released from detention. Hamdan Ballal and two other Palestinians left a police station in the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba, where they were being held on Tuesday. Ballal had bruises on his face and blood on his clothes. The three had spent the night on the floor of a military base while suffering from serious injuries sustained in the attack, according to Ballal's lawyer, Lea Tsemel.

The Gaza health ministry said on Wednesday that at least 830 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel resumed large-scale strikes on 18 March. According to the ministry's statement, the figure included 38 people killed in the past 24 hours. It also reported that the overall death toll had reached 50,183 since the war began on 7 October 2023.

Houthi media in Yemen reported on Wednesday at least 17 strikes in Saada and Amran, blaming the United States for the attacks. The rebels' Ansarollah website said US warplanes carried out “aggressive air raids … causing material damage to citizens' property”, but gave no details of casualties. Washington on 15 March announced a military offensive against the Houthis, promising to use overwhelming force until the group stopped firing on vessels in the key shipping routes of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.

Israel's military said two projectiles were fired from Gaza into Israeli territory on Wednesday, with one intercepted and the other falling in an area near the Gaza border.

Syria described Israeli attacks as a “flagrant violation” of its sovereignty after a deadly bombardment on Tuesday in the country's south, where Israel's military said it had responded to incoming fire. The violence near the UN-patrolled buffer zone on the Golan Heights followed Israeli airstrikes in central Syria.

Japan's defence minister Gen Nakatani says his country will provide medical treatment for two Palestinian women for injuries and illnesses from the conflict in Gaza. One of them has arrived in Tokyo, he added. “[The women] are supposed to return to their original places after treatment, and their visit is not meant for settling in Japan,” Nakatani said.

France is “deeply concerned” by the arrests of journalists in Turkey including Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer Yasin Akgul in the crackdown on protests after the jailing of the Istanbul mayor, a French diplomatic source told AFP on Wednesday. The source, asking not to be named, added that Akgul “was covering the protests professionally”.

Geir Pedersen, the UN special envoy for Syria, told the UN security council it “must not come to pass” that Syria backslides into conflict, fragmentation, and having its sovereignty routinely violated by external powers. Pedersen said the other road, restoring sovereignty and regional security, “requires the right Syrian decisions,” but the country's interim authorities cannot do it alone and need increased and continuing international support.

Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet in Jerusalem on Sunday, two Greek sources told Reuters on Wednesday. The agenda of the talks was expected to be extensive, one of the sources said. The two leaders last met in Israel in 2023.

Syria's authorities delayed a visit planned for Wednesday by the Lebanese defence minister that aimed to discuss tensions along the border, officials from the two countries told AFP. “We were informed on Tuesday by the Syrian party of the postponement of the visit” of Lebanese minister Michel Menassa, a Lebanese official told AFP on condition of anonymity. The delay was “in no way related to tensions or conflicts”, the official added, without specifying the date to which it had been postponed.

UN special envoy Geir Pedersen said Syria can return to violence and monopolies of power – or launch an inclusive transition, overcome conflict and realise the aspirations of its people, reports the Associated Press (AP).
 He told the UN security council it “must not come to pass” that Syria backslides into conflict, fragmentation, and having its sovereignty routinely violated by external powers. Pedersen said the other road, restoring sovereignty and regional security, “requires the right Syrian decisions,” but the country's interim authorities cannot do it alone and need increased and continuing international support.
 The UN special envoy, who will be returning to Damascus shortly, highlighted several priority areas for action and attention. He asked whether the soon-to-be announced transitional government and transitional legislative council reflect Syria's diversity, and include both men and women.
 Pedersen said developments on a new constitution, accountability for crimes committed over decades, security, foreign fighters and the economy must also be addressed, reports the AP.

Japan's defence minister Gen Nakatani says his country will provide medical treatment for two Palestinian women for injuries and illnesses from the conflict in Gaza. One of them has arrived in Tokyo, he added, according to the Associated Press (AP).
 Nakatani said on Wednesday that one patient is being treated at the Self-defence Forces Central hospital. Another patient is to arrive within days, he said. Both women were previously being treated in Egypt. Nakatani did not give further details about the patients, their conditions or their expected length of stay in Japan, reports the AP.
 The treatments, Nakatani said, are part of Japan's efforts to address the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza and followed a request from the World Health Organization.
 “[The women] are supposed to return to their original places after treatment, and their visit is not meant for settling in Japan,” Nakatani said.

US vice-president JD Vance on Wednesday dismissed a magazine story on the Trump administration inadvertently sending plans for an imminent attack on Yemen to a journalist as “oversold,” after the publication released the transcript, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“It's very clear [Jeffrey] Goldberg oversold what he had,” Vance posted on X, referring to the Atlantic editor-in-chief who was mistakenly included in the group chat of top Trump officials discussing military plans.

“No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS,” posted national security adviser Mike Waltz, who has admitted being responsible for Goldberg being added to the group on commercial chat app Signal.

Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday accused the opposition of fuelling “anarchy” in Israel, after mass anti-government protests in recent days, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

Addressing the opposition during a speech in parliament, Netanyahu said:

You recycle the same worn-out and ridiculous slogans about 'the end of democracy'. Well, once and for all: Democracy is not in danger, it is the power of the bureaucrats that is in danger”.

Perhaps you could stop putting spanners in the works of the government in the middle of a war? Perhaps you could stop fuelling the sedition, hatred and anarchy in the streets?”

Thousands of Israelis have taken part in several days of anti-government protests, accusing Netanyahu of undermining democracy and resuming strikes in Gaza without regard for hostages.

The demonstrations which erupted last week have been organised by a broad coalition of anti-Netanyahu groups, who called to protest against the premier's move to oust Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security agency.

Israel's opposition filed an appeal against the move to dismiss Bar, calling it “a decision based on flagrant conflict of interest”. Netanyahu has pressed ahead with proceedings to sack Bar, a move which the supreme court blocked on Friday.

The government has also begun proceedings to dismiss attorney general Gali Baharav-Miara, who has challenged the legality of some of Netanyahu's policies.

After a rally in the commercial hub of Tel Aviv, protesters are due to travel to Jerusalem for an anti-government demonstration outside parliament on Wednesday evening, reports AFP.

Here are some more images coming in via the newswires:

The Atlantic magazine on Wednesday published what it said was the full text of a chat group mistakenly shared with a journalist by top Trump administration officials laying out plans of an imminent attack on Yemen.

Details, including the times of strikes and types of planes being used, were all laid out in screenshots of the chat, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

The magazine said it was publishing after the Trump administration repeatedly denied that any classified information had been included in the unsecure chat.

As reported earlier, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened to seize parts of Gaza if Hamas does not release hostages.

Hamas said, in a statement, that hostages would return “in coffins” if Israel continues bombing the territory.

Netanyahu told parliament on Wednesday that “the more Hamas persists in its refusal to release our hostages, the stronger the pressure we will exert”.

“This includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here,” he added, days after his defence minister Israel Katz had warned: “The more Hamas refuses to free the hostages, the more territory it will lose, which will be annexed by Israel”.

“Every time the occupation attempts to retrieve its captives by force, it ends up bringing them back in coffins,” Hamas said in a statement on Wednesday.

The militant group said it was “doing everything possible to keep the (Israeli) occupation's captives alive, but the random Zionist bombardment is endangering their lives”.

Gal Gilboa-Dalal, an Israeli survivor of the 2023 attack whose brother was taken hostage, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) he can “constantly imagine our reunion. This moment felt closer than ever, and unfortunately, it's drifting away from me again,” he said of his brother Guy Gilboa-Dalal, taken from a music festival near the Gaza border and last seen in a video shared by Hamas last month.

“We are fighting here against a terrorist organisation that only understands force,” said Gal. “On the other hand, I am terrified that these bombings and this operation … will endanger the hostages there. There's no way to know what the terrorists might do to them or if a missile might accidentally hit them,” he added.

France is “deeply concerned” by the arrests of journalists in Turkey including Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer Yasin Akgul in the crackdown on protests after the jailing of the Istanbul mayor, a French diplomatic source told AFP on Wednesday.

“We are deeply concerned by reports of repression against protesters and journalists in Turkey,” said the source, asking not to be named, adding that Akgul “was covering the protests professionally”.

Palestinians involved in yesterday and today's anti-Hamas protests in Gaza have spoken about their motivations with local journalists. 
 “We are sick of the bombing, killing and displacement,” Ammar Hassan, a young man from Beit Lahiya who took part in the protest, told the Associated Press.
 Hassan said it started as an anti-war protest with just a few dozen people but then swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.
 “It's the only party we can affect,” he said over the phone to the AP. “Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but it can affect Hamas,” he said.
 “The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,” said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father-of-three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined the demonstration. “We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,” he said.
 A similar protest erupted in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya, according to witnesses.
 One of the protesters in Jabaliya, who requested anonymity, said they joined the demonstration because “everyone failed us.” They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the western-backed Palestinian Authority and even Arab mediators.

Syria's authorities delayed a visit planned for Wednesday by the Lebanese defence minister that aimed to discuss tensions along the border, officials from the two countries told Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“We were informed on Tuesday by the Syrian party of the postponement of the visit” of Lebanese minister Michel Menassa, a Lebanese official told AFP on condition of anonymity. The delay was “in no way related to tensions or conflicts”, the official added, without specifying the date to which it had been postponed.

A Syrian government source meanwhile told AFP that the delay was due to “preparations for the formation of a new government”.

Menassa had been set to meet his Syrian counterpart, Murhaf Abu Qasra, in the first visit by a Lebanese minister since the cabinet was formed in February.

Border tensions flared earlier in March after Syria's new authorities accused Lebanese armed group Hezbollah of kidnapping three soldiers into Lebanon and killing them. The Iran-backed group, which fought alongside the forces of toppled Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, denied involvement. But the ensuing cross-border clashes left seven Lebanese dead.

Israel's military said two projectiles were fired from Gaza into Israeli territory on Wednesday, with one intercepted and the other falling in an area near the Gaza border, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).

“Following the sirens that sounded at 12.03 (10.03 GMT) in the communities near the Gaza Strip, two projectiles were identified crossing into Israeli territory from central Gaza Strip,” the military said in a statement.

It added:

One projectile was successfully intercepted by the IAF (air force) and a fallen projectile was identified in the area of Zimrat”.

As we reported earlier, hundreds of Palestinians joined protests in northern Gaza, shouting anti-Hamas slogans and calling for an end to the war with Israel, in what has been described as the largest protest against the militant group inside the territory since the 7 October attacks.

Here is a video report on the story:

Agence France-Presse (AFP) has a little bit more detail on Netanyahu's comments today (see 10.43am GMT). The news agency reports the Israeli prime minister as saying:

The more Hamas persists in its refusal to release our hostages, the stronger the pressure we will exert.

I say this to my colleagues in the Knesset, and I say it to Hamas as well: This includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here.”

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeated threats on Wednesday to seize territory in the Gaza Strip if Hamas failed to release the remaining hostages it still holds.

“The more Hamas continues in its refusal to release our hostages, the more powerful the repression we exert will be,” Netanyahu told a hearing in parliament, which was occasionally interrupted by shouting from opposition members. “This includes seizing territory and it includes other things,” he said, according to Reuters.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Fintech firm, operating CashApp, Square and Tidal, to close nearly 800 open jobs in second such move in just over a year

Block, Jack Dorsey's financial technology company, plans to let go almost 1,000 current employees, while making other changes to its operations in its second such move in just over a year.

Dorsey, who co-founded and previously ran Twitter before co-founding Block in 2009, informed employees of the impending cuts on Tuesday in an email, viewed by the Guardian, titled “smaller block”. The layoffs will impact more than 930 employees, with another nearly 200 managers being moved into non-management roles, and another nearly 800 open jobs will be closed, according to the email.

Block now operates payment platforms Square and Afterpay, the money transfer app CashApp, and the music streaming service Tidal.

Dorsey wrote in the email that the layoffs and other changes to staffing and organization are not being implemented with the intention of hitting “a specific financial target, replacing folks with AI, or changing our headcount cap”. As part of an earlier reorganization that began in early 2024 and also saw roughly 1,000 Block employees lose their jobs, Dorsey implemented a headcount maximum of 12,000 employees.

Instead, Dorsey wrote that this additional reorganization is about “raising the bar and acting faster on performance, and flattening our org so we can move fast and with less abstraction”, according to the email. Last year Dorsey struck a similar tone in notifying staffers of layoffs, saying the company needed to “build like a startup again”.

In Tuesday's email, Dorsey added that he was enacting cuts to staff and management levels and closing open jobs all at once, instead of over time, because “we're behind in our actions, and that's not fair to the individual or the company.”

Block's stock is down 29% this year so far. Its revenue and profits have grown less over the last year, creating shareholder concern, even as Dorsey has taken back more operating control during that time. Dorsey noted in his email that part of his job is to increase the company's stock value and that this reorganization “will help us focus and execute better to do just that”.

“When we know, we should move, and there hasn't been enough movement,” the CEO wrote. “And we need to move faster to stay ahead of the transformational moment our industry is in, so we're able to continue increasing access, openness and automation.”

A spokesperson for Block did not respond to calls and email seeking comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

BBC's international editor says lack of access is ‘because there's stuff they don't want us to see'

Jeremy Bowen, the BBC's international editor, has accused the Israeli government of blocking journalists from Gaza because of scenes “they don't want us to see”.

Bowen said that in the last 18 months, he had been granted only half a day with the Israeli army within Gaza. He said that the lack of access was part of an attempt to “obfuscate what's going on, and to inject this notion of doubt into information that comes out”.

Speaking after he accepted a special fellowship award for the Society of Editors conference, he said that while Palestinian journalists were doing “fantastic work”, he and other international media colleagues wanted to contribute to reporting on the ground in Gaza.

“Why don't they let us in,” he said. “Because there's stuff there they don't want us to see. Beginning after those Hamas attacks on 7 October, they took us into the border communities. I was in Kfar Aza when there was still fighting going on inside it. They had only just started taking out the bodies of the dead Israelis. Why did they let us in there? Because they wanted us to see it.

“Why don't they let us in to Gaza? Because they don't want us to see it. I think it's really as simple as that. Israel took a bit of flak for that to start with, but none now, certainly not with [President] Trump. So I don't see that changing anytime soon.”

The Israeli government has been approached for comment. However, Israel's military has previously said that it has escorted journalists to Gaza to allow them to report safely. According to the Foreign Press Association, Israel's defence authorities have said that journalists in Gaza could be at risk in wartime and could endanger soldiers by reporting on troop positions. Scores of journalists have been killed since the war started.

Asked about whether international media should trust Gaza casualty figures released by the territory's health ministry, which is led by Hamas, Bowen said the numbers were currently “the best measure that we have” because of the inability of reporters and other bodies to verify them. The ministry says more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war.

“I think without question, it's the bloodiest war that they've had since the foundation of the Israeli state of 1948,” Bowen said. “If the place could open up, people could go through, look at the records, count the graves, exhume the skeletons from under the rubble and then they'd get a better idea. But when the doors shut, these things become very, very difficult.”

Last year, Bowen was among 50 journalists, including the BBC's Lyse Doucet and its former presenter Mishal Husain, calling on Israel and Egypt to provide “free and unfettered access to Gaza for all foreign media”.

Bowen's intervention comes with the BBC still investigating the making of the documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone, which was pulled from iPlayer after it emerged that the 13-year-old who narrated the film, Abdullah al-Yazouri, was the son of the deputy minister of agriculture in the Hamas government.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Award-winning film set in fictional town has already made its debut at Cannes but censors have refused to approve it for domestic release

Indian film censors have blocked the release of critically acclaimed film Santosh over concerns about its portrayal of misogyny, Islamophobia and violence in the Indian police force.

Santosh, written and directed by British-Indian filmmaker Sandhya Suri, is set in north India and has won international plaudits for its portrayal of a young widow who joins the police force and investigates the murder of a young Dalit girl.

The film is an unflinching fictional portrayal of the murkier elements of the Indian police force, depicting deep-rooted misogyny, discrimination against Dalits – the lowest caste in India previously known as untouchables – and the normalisation of mistreatment and torture by police officers. The film also grapples with the issue of sexual violence in India, particularly against lower caste women, and the rising tide of anti-Muslim prejudice in the country.

Santosh made its debut at Cannes film festival to widespread acclaim. It was the UK's official entry for the Oscars' international feature category and went on to be nominated for a Bafta for best debut feature this year, as well as receiving glowing reviews, including five stars in the Observer, which called it a “phenomenal achievement”. Its lead actor, Shahana Goswami, recently won best actress at the Asian film awards.

The film was made in India, has an entirely Indian cast and is all in Hindi, the dominant language of north India. The filmmakers had previously submitted the script in order to film in India and had faced no issues. India's largest cinema chain was also on board to distribute the film in January.

However, Indian audiences are unlikely to ever be able to see it in cinemas after censors on the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), a government body which approves all cinematic releases, refused to do so for Santosh over concerns about its negative portrayal of the police.

Suri, the film's writer and director, described the decision by the censors as “disappointing and heartbreaking”.

“It was surprising for all of us because I didn't feel that these issues were particularly new to Indian cinema or hadn't been raised before by other films,” she said.

Suri said the censors had demanded a list radical cuts so lengthy and wide-ranging that they would be “impossible” to implement. Legal restrictions prevented her sharing exact details of the censor's demands, but she said that the list of cuts was so long it had gone on for several pages, and included concerns about themes relating to police conduct and wider societal problems which are deeply baked into the film.

“It was very important to me that the film is released in India so I did try to figure out if there was a way to make it work,” said Suri. “But in the end it was just too difficult to make those cuts and have a film that still made sense, let alone stayed true to its vision.”

Suri emphasised that while the film offered an uncompromising depiction of the police, “I don't feel my film glorifies violence in a way that many other films focusing on the police have done. There's nothing sensationalist about it.”

The decision by the censorship board comes at a time when India's cultural sphere is seen to be more heavily policed than ever, with films and TV series dealing with politically sensitive themes often targeted with hate campaigns and police cases, or dropped by streaming platforms before they are released.

Suri admitted she had been “nervous” about releasing the film in India in the current climate but insisted it was “vitally important” for her that the very people affected by the issues in the film were able to see it. It was the incident in 2012 of a women raped on a bus in Delhi, commonly known as the Nirbhaya case, that had initially inspired her to make the film and she had collaborated with Indian non-government organisations when building up the story.

Police violence and torture is a well-documented issue in India. According to a 2020 Human Rights Watch report, police in India routinely use torture and flout arrest procedures with little or no accountability.

Depictions of police violence have also previously appeared in Indian cinema but Suri questioned whether the highly realistic depictions in Santosh – as opposed to the often stylised format of Bollywood and other Indian film industries – had caused discomfort among the censors.

“Maybe there's something about this film which is troubling in that everybody is morally compromised and there is no single hero,” she said. “I think that's what might set it apart from other stories in Indian cinema which often show a maverick cop in a rotten system.”

No Indian police figures have responded to coverage of the film, which is set in a fictional north Indian town. The CBFC have been contacted for comment.

There is no appeals process or negotiation allowed with the CBFC once their report is submitted and the matter can be contested only in court. However, Suri said she would still keep fighting to have the film available to Indian audiences.

“All my work has been about India; one film was deeply nostalgic, another was super beautiful and sensual,” she said, “Yes this one shows another face of the country. But there's humanity in everybody in this film.”

Film assistant says actor groped her several times in three incidents while filming Les Volets Verts

The French actor Gérard Depardieu sexually assaulted an assistant director on three occasions while she was working with him on a film shoot, placing his hands on her buttocks and breasts, leaving her feeling “petrified”, the woman told Paris's criminal court on Wednesday.

Depardieu – the biggest French cinema star to face trial for sexual assault since the #MeToo movement – is charged with sexually assaulting the assistant director three times during the shooting of the feature film Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters) in Paris in 2021.

He is also on trial for the sexual assault of a set decorator on the same film, who alleged he gripped her hard between his legs while grabbing her body. He faces up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 (£63,000) if convicted of the offences.

Depardieu denies any wrongdoing, telling the court this week: “I deny all of it.”

The woman employed as third assistant film director has not been named in the media. She was tasked with accompanying Depardieu from his dressing room on to the set during the filming.

She told the court a first sexual assault happened during a night shoot in Paris, when she found herself alone with Depardieu at the end of a short road where his dressing room was located as they walked towards an outdoor set.

She said she felt his hand on her buttock. “It happened by surprise; I was shocked. I didn't know how to react … I carried on as if nothing had happened, kept walking to the set. I had a knot in my stomach.”

She said the second assault happened at a later date on a set inside a Paris apartment, where Depardieu blocked her against a door and put his two hands on her breasts. She told the court: “I said no. I was scared.” She said that on a third occasion Depardieu put his hand on her buttocks and she again said: “No.”

The assistant director told the court that before this, Depardieu “talked about sex all day on set, constantly talking of ‘pussy' to everyone”. She said: “He listens a lot, observes everyone, listens to everything and uses it later to humiliate everyone. At the time, I was having a difficult separation. I'd spoken to someone about it, so he mocked me for it. There were lewd comments, humiliations; it was an unhealthy environment.”

She said she felt ashamed of what Depardieu had done and did not want to speak out because she wanted to continue working on the film and handle the situation herself. But when her direct superior asked how she was getting on with Depardieu, she told her all that had happened.

The assistant director said that, after this, Depardieu shouted at her that she was a “snitch” and he was “odious” to her on set, calling her “crazy”.

She said Depardieu later said “sorry” to her in an angry way in front of other crew members. She said Depardieu said he did not want her coming to collect him from his dressing room any longer.

She said: “On the set I felt huge anxiety, stress, shame, guilt; it was very difficult.”

Asked by the head judge what she wanted from the trial, the assistant director said: “I want us to hear the truth and stop minimising what happened.”

Depardieu denied sexual assault. “I did not touch her buttocks, I did not touch her breasts, I did none of that,” he said.

He told the court: “I'm not like that. I can't be like that … I've never of my own will touched a buttock like that, even furtively. It wouldn't cross my mind.”

Asked by the complainant's lawyer about the allegations of touching the woman's buttocks he said: “I didn't sexually assault. A sexual assault is more serious than that I think.”

Asked to clarify, he said he didn't know what sexual assault was.

He said that at the time, he couldn't walk 150 metres in the street on his own because of his health, weight and joint troubles. He said he was almost always accompanied by a bodyguard or aides on the film set, and was never alone with an assistant director.

Depardieu said of the assistant director: “I think that maybe, I don't know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,” Depardieu said. “But I'm not only that. I still respect people.”

He said he was not someone “who touches people”.

He said that he had later asked the production to make sure it was a man who collected him from his dressing room instead of a woman because he always made lewd comments in his dressing room and didn't want women to be shocked if they overheard them.

He said: “I'm crude and vulgar. I say things that can shock young people.” He told the court that on a previous film he'd said: “Bring me a man who's not shocked by my language,” and: “Stop putting in girls who are shocked by what I say.”

He denied shouting at the assistant director.

The French actor Fanny Ardant, a close friend of Depardieu, testified in his support. She said she had never witnessed any inappropriate gestures by him in a long career working together.

She appeared in Les Volets Verts but was not on set at the time of the alleged sexual assaults.

She called Depardieu an incredible actor and a “genius”, saying “all forms of genius carries within it something extravagant, unsubmissive”.

Ardant said: “Yes, he takes up space on set; yes, he has a big mouth, says crude things, likes to play the idiot on a set because people will then be less afraid of his personality ... I know Gérard Depardieu, I've heard his shouting, his cries of anger, his provocations ... but I have never witnessed a gesture I found shocking.”

Leaving the stand, she approached Depardieu, embraced him and kissed him on the cheek.

News of protests has been preserve of a few newspapers and channels outside well funded pro-government networks

At the same time as the sound of clanging pots and pans rang out through the streets of opposition strongholds in Istanbul on a recent evening, marking another mass anti-government demonstration, a different reality was being broadcast to viewers of Turkish pro-government channels.

Public television showed the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, speaking to a gilded conference room after an iftar dinner. He boasted of his government's achievements, of hiring new teachers and attracting youth to an aerospace and technology conference.

The pro-government cable channel NTV carried news of the efforts of the finance minister, Mehmet Şimşek, to stabilise the economy. Neither channel broadcast footage from the protests, which were sparked by the arrest of the Istanbul mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. Neither did they interview protesters. Though NTV was running a headline that said hundreds of people had been arrested, mirroring statements made by the interior minister.

Substantive coverage of the protests has instead been the preserve of the small slice of newspapers and cable channels that exist outside the well funded and slick pro-government broadcasting networks. The opposition-aligned newspaper Cumhuriyet, for instance, has carried news of the conditions inside a maximum-security facility where İmamoğlu has been held, and speeches by another opposition leader to rapturous crowds of thousands.

“This is the negative outcome of what Erdoğan has built for two decades, which is a highly polarised, toxic media environment,” said Erol Önderoğlu of Reporters Without Borders, pointing to the spread of cable channels and media companies with longstanding financial ties to the government.

“Erdoğan now controls about 85% of national and corporate media in Turkey, so we're not talking about a fair media environment where pluralism truly flourishes,” he said.

This imbalance is laid bare in the coverage of the protests. Murat Somer, a political science professor who studies polarisation at Istanbul's Özyeğin University, said when pro-government channels do cover the opposition or demonstrators, they portray them as a threat.

“If you listen to the pro-government media, you are hearing that the protesters are a bunch of vandals who are insulting Erdoğan,” he said. Demonstrators are described as “aggressive and hostile, but also weak and unable to accept that Imamoğlu has committed crimes”.

Turkey's government media watchdog (RTÜK) has banned the broadcasting of live footage of the protests, although this sparked a row within the body, whose membership is designed to reflect the makeup of the Turkish parliament.

İlhan Taşcı, an RTÜK official from the opposition, posted on X that bureaucrats called the managers of major television networks “and issued threats that they stop live broadcasts or their licenses would be revoked”. The RTÜK president, Ebubekir Şahin, responded, telling Taşcı “there is no need for disinformation. The state and its institutions will do what is necessary.”

Live footage of the protests would dispel much of what the pro-government channels have said about them, said Somer. “If there was live coverage, it would show a well-attended peaceful event – yesterday there were thousands of people singing and it almost looked like a concert,” he said. “But they can't show this. It's disinformation, it's as simple as that.”

This skewed coverage prompted opposition leader Özgür Özel and other members of his Republican People's party (CHP) to call for a boycott, targeting businesses that they claim have deep financial ties to the government or fund its media apparatus. The boycott list includes a popular coffee chain, Turkey's widely loved chocolate producer Ülker and media organisations including the state broadcaster. Özel has also called on the government to allow İmamoğlu's trial to be broadcast live.

Ten photojournalists were detained in dawn raids this week, with several charged by prosecutors the following day and facing jail time.

“As we know, images are powerful, and with these latest protests we've seen so many remarkable ones in the international media, showing that Turkey's democracy is resisting with so many people in the streets again,” said media expert Emre Kızılkaya, of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.

“Some of the photos we've seen are documenting police brutality with remarkable visuals, and this may have alarmed the Turkish authorities.”

Most Turkish people get their news from television, but overwhelming government control means the few channels critical of the government or loyal to the opposition are constantly weathering heavy fines from the regulators. This pressure has only increased since the protests began, including the live broadcast ban, further fines, and arrests targeting employees of opposition channels.

Kızılkaya pointed to the crackdown on live broadcast and detentions of journalists who reported from the protests as preventing news that helps to “capture the essence of these protests”.

Opposition-aligned channels, he added, were unable to reflect the mood by interviewing demonstrators on the street or showing clashes with the police.

“Media organisations that are critical of the government see themselves as playing their last game,” he said. “They see these protests as vital for the future of the right to properly inform the country … the future of journalism is on the line now.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

A 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple is among buildings destroyed after dry and windy weather saw mostly contained blazes spread again

Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever are ravaging southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said on Wednesday.

Han Duck-soo, South Korea's prime minister and acting president, said five days of fires had caused “unprecedented damage” and asked agencies tackling the disaster to “assume the worst-case scenario and respond accordingly”, according to Yonhap news agency.

A helicopter crashed during efforts to contain wildfires in the south-eastern town of Uiseong, killing the pilot and forcing the Korea Forest Service to suspend helicopter operations across the country.

Officials in Andong city and other south-eastern cities and towns ordered residents to evacuate on Tuesday as firefighters struggled to contain multiple blazes fuelled by dry winds, which burned more than 17,400 hectares (43,000 acres) of land and destroyed hundreds of structures, including a 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple.

More than 5,500 people were forced to evacuate from their homes in Andong, the neighbouring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan, where the fires were the largest, according to South Korea's ministry of the interior and safety.

South Korean officials earlier on Tuesday had said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but the ongoing dry and windy weather caused setbacks and allowed the blazes to spread again.

The Uiseong fire, only 68% contained and exacerbated by strong winds, shows “unimaginable” scale and speed, said Lee Byung-doo, a forest disaster expert at the National Institute of Forest Science.

Climate change is projected to make wildfires more frequent, Lee said. “We have to admit large-scale wildfires are going to increase and prepare more resources and manpower,” he told a local television station.

Nearly 9,000 firefighters, along with more than 130 helicopters and hundreds of vehicles, were deployed to battle the fires, but efforts were partially suspended overnight as the winds strengthened.

Officials in Andong and Uiseong county ordered residents in several villages and those near Andong University to evacuate to safe locations or temporary shelters – including schools and indoor gyms – as a fire that started in Uiseong continued to spread.

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed Gounsa, a Buddhist temple built in the seventh century, according to officials from the Korea Heritage Service. There were no immediate reports of injuries, and some of the temple's national treasures, including a stone Buddha statue, were evacuated before the fire reached the wooden buildings.

The fire also spread to the nearby coastal town of Yeongdeok, where officials shut down roads and ordered residents of at least four villages to evacuate. The justice ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, also near Uiseong.

Human-caused climate breakdown is responsible for a higher likelihood of fire and bigger burned areas in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the US and Australia, with some scientific evidence of increases in southern China.

Climate breakdown has increased the wildfire season by about two weeks on average across the globe.

Caitlin Cassidy translates the prime minister's use of gen Z phrases for Catie McLeod

The prime minister is using phrases I don't understand in parliament. On Wednesday, he said the Coalition were “delulu with no solulu”. What is going on?

Catie, I am rapidly aging out of being cool and don't understand the inner workings of the teenage mind. But I do know young people love TikTok, and politicians love rhymes.

These two great loves combined on Wednesday as Anthony Albanese went gen Z, telling the speaker the Coalition were “delulu with no solulu”.

He was addressing his rivals' energy and economic plan, which he said would require unnamed cuts to public services.

A basic translation of the phrase is “delusional with no solution”.

Yikes. I wonder who came up with that zinger. Anyway, tell me more. Why are people saying “delulu”?

Thank you so much for asking. The origin of “delulu” dates back to K-pop fan communities in the early 2010s.

Originally, the internet slang term referred to super-fans who were in a parasocial, obsessive relationship with celebrities and believed they would one day meet them.

It was taken up by TikTok and Instagram users through viral trends like the catchphrase “delulu is the solulu” – stay with me here – which denoted a positive message to stay optimistic and keep an imaginative mindset even when the going gets tough. One I'm sure many politicians could use.

Now, in the Year of Our Lord 2025, the hashtag #delulu has racked up more than 5bn views, and influencers have adopted the term.

“Delulu” no longer means you're delusional, but committing an act of radical self-love, of manifesting to make your dreams come true, even if you look a bit mad. It's the Brené Brown of internet terms.

Of course, in Albanese's context, the self-confidence of the Coalition is not the “solulu” but rather a lack of concrete costings for nuclear energy policies.

I see. Have any other politicians attempted to, as they say, “appeal to the youth”?

Unfortunately yes, and it is nearly always cringe. In his final address to parliament last year, the former prime minister Scott Morrison almost sent me into cardiac arrest by taking up a suggestion from his daughters to work Taylor Swift song titles into his valedictory speech.

“I'm actually a true new romantic after all,” he told a room of bemused baby boomers. “I can assure you there is no bad blood.”

He has bad blood with me, personally, after that speech.

Some, though, have pulled it off better than others. Independent Senator Fatima Payman gave a shout-out to the kids in a speech she delivered opposing the age ban on social media, littered with phrases my nephew uses that I do not understand such as “sigma”, “capping” and “skibidi”.

“Though some of you cannot yet vote, I hope when you do, it'll be in a more GOAT'ed Australia for a government with more aura,” she said, which had a certain authenticity for the fact she was directly addressing gen Z and gen Alpha to make politics more accessible for young people, rather than coming off like an old white man in a suit channelling Steve Buschemi (“how do you do, fellow kids?”).

Sounds “delulu” to me. Do you think we'll see more of this during the election campaign?

I would rather gouge my eyes out than see more of this, but this coming election will be the first where gen Z and millennials outnumber baby boomers. If their official social media accounts littered with heinous memes are anything to judge by, both sides of politics are lobbying hard to swing votes from younger generations.

In the words of the internet, “delulu is trululu” (may all their delusions come true).","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

People living near Kasungu national park say they are living in fear after translocation of 263 elephants by International Fund for Animal Welfare 

People living on the edge of a protected area in Malawi are taking legal action against an NGO that moved more than 250 elephants into the area, which they say have killed at least 10 people.

Villagers near Kasungu national park, which is Malawi's second largest and crosses the Zambian border, say they are living in fear for their livelihoods and safety after 263 elephants were introduced in July 2022, causing a sharp spike in human-wildlife conflict. Ten people claiming to be affected by the translocation from Liwonde national park have begun legal action against the International Fund for Animal Welfare (Ifaw), demanding that the conservation NGO construct adequate fencing to protect the 167 villages around the park and compensate local people for the damage caused by the elephants.

More than 50 children were orphaned between July 2022 and November 2024 as a result of the translocated elephants, according to local communities. Among the 10 people killed were John Kayedzeka, 31, who was trampled by a herd while working in a field in September 2022 and Masiye Phiri, 31, who died after she was charged by a bull elephant while in the garden with her two-year-old child a year later.

One farmer from Zambia said he was walking across his farm when he came across two elephants and a calf, which charged. “I couldn't run away in time. They stepped on me and then broke off branches and covered me in them,” he said.

“I was in Lumezi hospital for four months while my wounds healed … Since that incident, my stomach is swollen on one side. I don't know what is wrong. I can't straighten my arm, so I can't farm. I depend on the well wishes of others to survive,” the 53-year-old said. “I am very afraid to move around on my own, so I tend to stay at home alone. I am in pain all of the time.”

Two deaths do not directly involve elephants but have been blamed on the translocation: one person was killed by a hippo displaced by elephants and another by hyenas believed to be trailing the mammals out of the park. Local people say that elephants are also routinely raiding their crops and trampling fields, threatening their livelihoods.

The UK law firm Leigh Day has been instructed to act on behalf of the 10 people against Ifaw in the UK, Zambia and Malawi, potentially bringing the case to the high court in England. Claimants have not been named so far to protect their identities. While elephants have long been in the park, with populations falling due to poaching, local people said the spike in human-wildlife conflict started after the translocation.

“My farmland has been destroyed five times. Three times in April 2024. Twice in May 2024. I was growing maize, sugarcane, rice and beans. Everything was destroyed,” said one 73-year-old farmer. “Before the relocation, sometimes I could harvest 35 bags of rice. This year, I have nothing.”

Another farmer who lives on the Zambian side of the park, whose father-in-law was killed by the animals, is also part of the case.

“My father-in-law was old and he didn't manage to run away and they trampled him, and he was killed. The news spread across the community and the community members went to help but he had already died,” she said.

In a statement, Ifaw said it had received notice of legal action in December and rejected allegations of wrongdoing.

“Ifaw is deeply saddened by all cases of human-wildlife conflict in and around Kasungu, where it has been working to support government and communities develop sustainable solutions for reducing human-wildlife conflict and promote coexistence,” a spokesperson said, highlighting that Malawi's government had overall responsibility for its national parks. Ifaw provided technical and financial support, following international best practice while moving the elephants, they said.

The elephant translocation was among the largest of its kind and images of the operation were used for fundraising, with pictures of the mammals being lifted by crane described as “scenes reminiscent of the Disney classic Dumbo”. It was a three-way operation between Malawi's national park service and two NGOs: Ifaw and African Parks.

Another claimant in the case said they hoped to live in peace with the elephants and wanted the NGO to take steps to protect them.

“We need the owners of the elephants to compensate us, they need to barrier the park, if they don't barrier the park, they should find another way to protect us and our crops. We want to claim the damage and barrier the park. If it is like this next year how are we going to live? We can't be removed from this place. These are our ancestral places, inherited. If we moved it would take a very long time to settle and start over,” they said.

“We can't do anything as we are just human beings – we know the law, we can't attack the elephants. We want to ensure there is protection. We are peace-loving people, we don't want to have a war between us and the elephants. We just want peace.”

Public accounts committee also flags ‘persistent digital skills shortages' and uncompetitive civil service pay rates

The government's ambition to boost efficiency by embedding AI in all aspects of its work risks being undermined by out-of-date technology, poor quality data and a lack of skilled staff, an influential Commons committee has warned.

The report by the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) found that more than 20 government IT systems identified as “legacy”, meaning out of date and unsupported, have yet to be given funding to improve them.

Government research cited by the PAC in the report found that almost a third of central government IT systems met this definition in 2024.

Keir Starmer's government has repeatedly stressed its desire to increase economic growth through the mass take-up of AI systems, including in the public sector.

An official plan for the technology published in January called for the government to “rapidly pilot” AI-powered services, saying this would both increase productivity and improve people's experience of dealing with officialdom.

In a speech earlier this month, Starmer said AI should replace the work of government officials where it can be done to the same standard, with 2,000 new tech apprentices to be recruited to the civil service.

However, the PAC report also warned about “persistent digital skills shortages in the public sector”, in part because of civil service pay levels “that are uncompetitive with the private sector”.

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSI), which is spearheading AI roll-outs in government, says it has previously recognised many of the same worries in two reports published in January, the State of Digital Government and Blueprint for a Modern Digital Government.

However, the PAC report makes a series of new recommendations, including setting a six-month deadline for the department to specifically set out how it will fund replacements for the highest-risk legacy technology, and to also assess the costs of failing to take action.

It also calls for action to improve public confidence in the transparency and standards for how AI is used in government, saying that as of January this year, just 33 official records had been published setting out algorithm-assisted decisions and how they are made. The report recommends this be sped up.

The report also identifies a lack of coherent systems to learn from the mass of different AI pilots taking place across government, calling for action to address this.

Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Conservative MP who chairs the PAC, said: “The government has said it wants to mainline AI into the veins of the nation, but our report raises questions over whether the public sector is ready for such a procedure.

“A transformation of thinking in government at senior levels is required, and the best way for this to happen is for digital professionals to be brought round the top table in management and governing boards of every department and their agencies. I have serious concerns that DSIT does not have the authority over the rest of government to bring about the scale and pace of change that's needed.”

A government spokesperson said: “These findings reflect much of what we already know, which is why we set out a bold plan to overhaul the use of tech and AI across the public sector – from doubling the number of tech experts across Whitehall, to making reforms to replace legacy IT systems more quickly and building new tools to transform how people interact with the state.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Opposition says Labor's national vehicle emission standard is ‘poorly designed', despite data showing uptick in green vehicle sales

Australia's love-hate relationship with fuel-guzzling utes and SUVs is now a looming election issue, after the Coalition indicated it may rethink Labor's vehicle emission standard.

On Tuesday the shadow transport minister, Bridget McKenzie, called Labor's vehicle emission standard “poorly designed” and said the Coalition will have “more to say” about it when the opposition releases its own transport policy before the election.

Labor's new vehicle efficiency standard (NVES), which became law on 1 January, enforces an emissions maximum for each car manufacturer, with a penaltyfor every gram of emissions over the target.

The standard was designed to encourage carmakers to release more green vehicles on to Australia's market, with more competition to drive down the price for consumers. And the Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) says the standard is already working.

More than 120 electric vehicles are now available in Australia as the new laws upend the nation's status as a “dumping ground” for big, polluting cars. Prior to January Australia was the only OECD country without a vehicle emission standard.

The obsession with big cars is not only fuelling the climate crisis, it is making roads deadlier and adding to traffic congestion. And there are other costs – Australians spend on average almost $100 a week on fuel.  

But the Coalition is set to make the standard an election issue.

On Tuesday McKenzie said the Coalition opposed the NVES when it was introduced “because it will punish Australian families and tradies simply because of the cars they love and need to drive”.

She claimed the NVES was “poorly designed, pulls the wrong lever in a cost-of-living crisis and discriminates unfairly against everyday Australians”, and criticised the government for keeping the modelling on which it was based a secret.

“We will have more to say on the NVES when the Coalition's low-emissions transport policy is released before the election,” she said.

McKenzie, the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, and the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, have referred to the NVES as a “tax”, but the government described it as a “regulatory obligation to incentivise the supply of a greater number of fuel-efficient, low- and zero-emission vehicles to Australia”.

The Electric Vehicle Council says the standard is already having an effect on which cars international manufacturers choose to send to Australia.

The EVC's head of legal policy and advocacy, Aman Gaur, said the NVES is “definitely working”, even though the next part of the standard – the penalty and credit system – does not start rolling out until 1 July. (If carmakers beat the emission target they receive credits, which they can use to offset the emissions on other, dirtier cars, or trade with other manufacturers.)

The penalties are $100 per gram of CO2 per kilometre above the CO2 limit, per vehicle sold, Gaur said, though the regulator can only issue fines that are 50% of the maximum penalty and the first penalties are not payable until March 2028.

The council's statistics show electric vehicle sales – including hybrids – made up 11.3% of total car sales in February this year, compared with 9.3% last year.

“As the standards operate, they encourage manufacturers to bring in more efficient petrol cars, but also electric cars,” Gaur said.

He said there are now cheaper EVs available in more categories – including utes – and they can save people about $3,000 a year on fuel and maintenance.

Prior to the NVES, Gaur said, Australia had “the worst standards, right next to Russia” but now companies are flocking to sell EVs here.

At the Everything Electric show in Sydney earlier this month, Gaur said, there were 36 brands on offer, while “three years ago, there were three”.

The Coalition opposed the bill even after the government watered it down, reducing the targets and carving out popular SUVs, including the Toyota LandCruiser and the Nissan Patrol.

Australian cars are, according to the government's analysis in the lead-up to the creation of the standard, inefficient compared with other countries and responsible for megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, making up 11.4% of Australia's total emissions.

That analysis found “manufacturers supply cars to the Australian market that aren't as fuel efficient as the cars they supply to other markets”. It found manufacturers do not offer the same range of electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric (PHEVs), hybrid electric (HEVs) and electric, because of the lack of a mandatory standard.

A 2024 study from the University of Technology Sydney found Australian passenger vehicles are emitting 50% more carbon dioxide than the average in major markets, including the US, EU, China and Japan, because those markets were “aggressively” adopting standards to prompt a transition to lower emissions.

The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries says, contrary to the EVC's position, that the standard is not working. According to its latest data, “pure” electric vehicle sales (excluding hybrids) were just 5.9% in February, down from 9.6% last year, while the preference for bigger cars continued.

The FCAI chief executive, Tony Weber, said while it is true there are more EVs available now, “consumers just aren't buying them” and “without a high penetration of EVs, we're just not going to meet the lofty ambitions of the government”.

“Penalties will be paid … or people will keep their existing cars longer and we'll have an older, dirtier and unsafer fleet.”

He said the government did not release its modelling on supply and demand, and called for it to sit down with industry to “work out a pathway forward”.

Guardian Australia has asked the government for a response.

Weber also said the idea of Australia as a “dumping ground” was “completely irrational” because it is a relatively small market.

The Climate Council fellow John Stone, a recently retired University of Melbourne transport planner, painted a bigger picture.

“If we're going to get to our climate targets and our health and wellbeing targets, we have to be using cars less,” he said.

Stone said that means giving people a way to leave their cars at home, including investing in pathways and bike paths to encourage other forms of transportation.

“Build it and they'll come,” he said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

How Queensland's 2032 Games planning descended into farce","https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/mar/26/the-hot-mess-olympics-how-queenslands-2032-games-planning-descended-into-farce","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 04:55:00 GMT","

The LNP's vision is for an Olympics held in venues rather than a city – and guarantees controversy across Brisbane and beyond

Few people in Queensland disagreed with the former state premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, when she described plans for the 2032 Olympic Games in Brisbane as a “hot mess”.

Tuesday's announcement by the new LNP government was framed as an end to the sort of disarray that has plagued Olympic planning during the past four years.

But the city's third venues plan – its third proposed Olympic stadium – might be the most problematic.

It will now almost certainly ensure protests and opposition north and south of the Brisbane River, with the new Victoria Park stadium and the demolition of the Gabba controversial choices for locals. There may also be opposition from the middle of the Fitzroy River, where the local freshwater crocodiles might not be too pleased about the idea of Olympic rowing at Rockhampton.

The premier, David Crisafulli, began with an apology of sorts for breaking an election promise. He had campaigned in October last year by saying there would be “no new stadiums”.

“I have to own that, and I will, and I am sorry, and it's my decision, and I accept that decision,” Crisafulli said.

The premier's attempt to justify the broken promise went like this: he had to choose between pushing ahead with the plan to host athletics at the 1980s-era Queensland Sports and Athletics Centre (an option derided as embarrassing), or building a new venue at Victoria Park.

“And I know which one would have been politically easier for me to make, but I've made the right choice,” he said.

That choice seemed plain well before the election. It was repeatedly pointed out that his position – “no new stadiums” but definitely not Qsac – was untenable.

Victoria Park has been pushed for more than a year in certain quarters of the city. The idea that the plan is simply an organic recommendation of a 100-day venues review seems unlikely.

As does the argument that, finally, the needs of the Olympics have been put ahead of local politics.

Crisafulli's “no new stadiums” promise was largely pitched at voters in Queensland's regional cities, which were critical to the LNP's election win. Spending big money on big things in Brisbane is a move that brings up grievances in Townsville.

And so the LNP will send several sports – archery, sailing, football and rowing – up north, over the reported objections of those sports' governing bodies and against the recommendations of the venues review.

The government also rejected the advice of the panel and will build a swimming centre of excellence at the site of the Centenary pool, on the outskirts of Victoria Park.

There are some decent arguments for doing so. Hosting swimming events at an arena with a temporary pool doesn't create much of a legacy for the sport. The new venue would create a permanent world-class facility for swimmers.

It is exactly the same principle behind the last government's idea of using Qsac for athletics events. Athletics would get a permanent, top-level home.

Broken promises are dime a dozen in politics. There are those who will be sceptical that this plan is above politics, when it appears so clearly designed to appease regional voters and other interest groups.

The original plan to redevelop the ageing Gabba stadium fell by the wayside a year ago. Then the Australian Olympics supremo, John Coates, said the Olympic movement was “on the nose” in Brisbane because the plan was not popular. People were upset about the mooted cost, and the impact on the local area.

Building a new (and more expensive) stadium at Victoria Park shifts that flashpoint north of the river.

But turning the Gabba area into a privately funded entertainment precinct, as outlined on Tuesday, will ensure that protests continue on the south side, too.

When Victoria Park was first mooted, the idea of building over the city's largest green space – a 64-hectare parkland which, though close to the city, is woefully underused– was pushed as a sort of trade-off.

“Brisbane city council has a policy of no net loss of green space in the city,” said Graham Quirk, the former mayor who has championed Victoria Park.

“Our proposal, as inferred in the report, was that you could potentially turn the Gabba, an area which is in drastic need of additional green space, into green space over there.

“There would be a loss in one location but a gain in another area”.

No one mentioned green space at the big launch on Tuesday.

It seems as if the big vision of the new government – complete with a slick presentation and uplifting backing music – is for an Olympics held in venues, but not a city.

For all the urgency and “the time has come to just get on with it” talk on Tuesday, it remains to be seen whether the people of Brisbane are willing to support it.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Bloc's first preparedness strategy urges people to prepare for floods, fires, pandemics or military strikes

People in the EU are being advised to stockpile enough food, water and essentials for 72 hours as part of a European strategy that aims to increase readiness for catastrophic floods and fires, pandemics and military attacks.

Outlining its first preparedness strategy, the European Commission said it wanted to encourage citizens to take “proactive measures to prepare for crises, such as developing household emergency plans and stockpiling essential supplies”.

The strategy was partly inspired by plans in Germany and the Nordic countries, which have distributed public information pamphlets and devised apps advising people what to do in the event of a military attack or other national crisis.

“We are saying to member states: 72 hours of self-sufficiency is what we recommend,” Hadja Lahbib, the European commissioner for preparedness and crisis management, told reporters. Asked about what citizens should stockpile, she referred to a video on her social media, in which she presents an emergency bag.

Today, the EU launches its new #Preparedness Strategy. “Ready for anything” — this must be our new European way of life. Our motto and #hashtag. pic.twitter.com/fA1z8ZvMDA

To a soundtrack of off-key jazz piano, Lahbib is shown on the video discussing her emergency stockpile in a tongue-in-cheek way, including ID documents in waterproof casing, canned food, bottled water, matches, a Swiss army knife, cash, playing cards, medicines and a small radio.

The strategy was devised to ensure better EU coordination and public awareness in response to a range of potential risks, such as extreme weather exacerbated by the climate crisis, pandemics, cyber-attacks and military invasions. “We must prepare for large-scale, cross-sectoral incidents and crises, including the possibility of armed aggression, affecting one or more member states,” the document states.

The commission is also calling for a Europe-wide preparedness day to raise awareness; for the topic to be put on school curriculums; and for an EU “stockpiling strategy” to ensure adequate supplies of raw materials, shelters, generators, and “potentially” food and water.

While the EU has no powers over civilian or military uniformed services, it has carved out a bigger role in crisis response since the Covid pandemic led to the unprecedented common purchases of vaccines and medical equipment. Now it wants to go further after a report from the former Finnish president Sauli Niinistö last year found there was no “clear plan” on what the EU would do “in the event of armed aggression against a member state”. Nïïnistö, a special adviser to the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said the EU was better prepared to deal with crises and disasters than five years ago, but needed a change of mindset and more planning to anticipate crises.

The plans are likely to provoke a mixed response from EU member states, who perceive threats in different ways. Last week, the European Commission rebranded its military spending plans “Readiness 2030”, instead of Rearm Europe, after complaints from the leaders of Italy and Spain, who argued the language risked alienating people.

In contrast, northern European countries have led the way in emergency planning. Swedish authorities recommend keeping at home a good supply of water, energy-rich food, blankets and alternative heating, as well as investing in a battery-powered radio. Norway advises people to stock up on non-essential medicines, including iodine tablets in the case of a nuclear incident. German households have been urged to adapt their own cellars, garages or store rooms for use as bunkers, while housebuilders will be legally obliged to include safe shelters in new homes – as Poland has already done.

Roxana Mînzatu, a commission vice-president, responded to accusations of scaremongering, likening preparedness to taking out accident insurance: “It doesn't mean much more than the fact that you want to be prepared and you want to minimise the damage, the costs, the suffering that you might go through.”

Mînzatu, who admitted she did not have a three-day stockpile, citing her mobile lifestyle as the reason, said the dividend of peace had given people a sense “it's not going to happen to us” despite seeing disastrous wildfires in Greece or floods in Spain. “I'm a good example of what we need to do,” she said.

Lahbib, who said she did have her 72-hour supplies, including ingredients for pasta alla puttanesca, said it was up to member states to define what was needed “on the basis of the geopolitical and geostrategic position they're in”.

The Belgian commissioner noted that in Finland young people were taught how to handle a weapon, “but I don't think that's the kind of thing you'd have here in Belgium or France, not immediately, at any rate. It differs from one country to another, but we can learn from each other.”

The strategy was published the day after Denmark's defence ministry announced it was bringing forward plans to introduce military service for women by two years.

Women who turn 18 after 1 July 2025 could be required to take part in an annual ballot from next year to determine if they must perform mandatory military service, something which is already required of men.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

Brazil were humiliated 4-1 by bitter rivals Argentina in South American World Cup qualifiers as the pressure mounted on manager Dorival Júnior after his side were comprehensively outplayed and fortunate not to lose by more.

After edging Colombia 2-1 at home on Thursday, Brazil came crashing back to earth against the world champions, who started the rout with a close-range strike by Julián Alvarez four minutes after kick-off.

Alvarez took a through pass from Thiago Almada in his stride and evaded two defenders before beating the advancing goalkeeper Bento with a gentle touch to his right.

“We humbly did our job and played a great game. We gave them a show,” Alvarez said.

“It was a historic result, winning by 4-1, and that makes us really proud, I'm so happy for the fans, for helping the team and to see how we played an impressive game at home. It's great to know that we are qualified for the World Cup.”

A 0-0 draw between Uruguay and Bolivia earlier on Tuesday had sealed Argentina's spot at the 2026 World Cup as they became the first South American team to qualify for the tournament in North America.

Even without the injured Lionel Messi and Lautaro Martínez, Argentina were streets ahead of their rivals and they did not have to wait long to extend their lead.

Enzo Fernández made it 2-0 with a strike from inside the box in the 12th minute but Brazil pulled one back when a mistake by Argentina defender Cristian Romero gifted Matheus Cunha a goal in the 26th minute.

But Argentina restored their two-goal lead through Alexis Mac Allister in the 37th minute, firing home from a Fernández cross.

Argentina, who have not lost to Brazil in six years, wasted several chances to extend their lead before substitute Giuliano Simeone wrapped up the scoring in the 71st minute, handing Brazil their heaviest defeat in a World Cup qualifier.

Brazil captain Marquinhos apologised to the fans and urged his teammates to turn things around as quickly as possible.

“What we did here today can't happen again,” he told Brazilian TV Globo. “It's hard to talk about it in the heat of the moment... It's embarrassing. We started the game very badly, far below what we could do and they're on a great run of confidence. They knew how to play smart ... I'm sorry for our fans.”

Dorival Júnior has failed to earn the trust of Brazil's demanding fans after winning just seven of his 16 games in charge since taking over in early 2024.

“It's not just the coach's fault... It's the players' fault too,” Marquinhos said. “There's no secret formula in football where you make a choice and it works out. We can all do better. We have to share the blame. It's about understanding the moment and being humble.”

Argentina top the South American standings with 31 points from 14 matches, 16 points clear of seventh-placed Venezuela, who currently hold the spot for the international playoffs following their 1-0 win over Peru. Brazil are fourth on 21 points.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}"

The youthful energy of street protest is breathing life back into failing progressive parties – and it's a model that could be applied everywhere

After 22 years of power grabs, the seizure of all state institutions and severe oppression aimed at reshaping Turkish citizens into Islamofascist minions, Turkey is striking back against President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's authoritarianism. In cities across the country, including the regime's strongholds, protests have been ongoing for the past week.

Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu's detention on bogus corruption charges this week galvanised the people; within days, the protests evolved into something bigger – a national riot demanding democracy, dignity and freedom. The protests reminded many of the Gezi uprising of 2013, yet this time the young people who we thought had lost all hope for the future under Erdoğan and during the severe economic crisis took to the streets, risking limitless police violence by attending public gatherings which are now banned.

One of the slogans adorning placards encapsulated the sentiment perfectly: “If we burn, you'll burn with us.” While the protests were rife with political humour, everyone knows that what is happening is no joke: the country stands at a political point of no return. The die is cast. Either Erdoğan will retreat, or else. What that “else” could possibly be is a daunting prospect. Yet the people's determination to break the wall of fear is unprecedented, and this time, unlike during the Gezi uprising, the main opposition party is “hosting” the political action – or at least trying to.

İmamoğlu is not only the mayor of the largest city in Turkey but also, with his widespread popularity, Erdoğan's only credible political rival. Right before his detention on dubious claims made by the regime – financial corruption, being a leader of a criminal organisation and collaborating with terrorist organisations – İmamoğlu was about to announce his candidacy for the next presidential elections.

Several opinion polls indicated his support would probably surpass Erdoğan's in that election, due to be held in 2028. According to sources close to Erdoğan, the plan was to arrest and discredit İmamoğlu and to appoint a government trustee to the main opposition party. This has been Erdoğan's modus operandi for years. Several mayors from opposition parties – both social democrats and the Kurdish party – have been taken into custody, and İmamoğlu's arrest was anticipated. In his last video before his detention, while getting dressed, İmamoğlu calmly said that he would “stand resolute” for the people of Turkey.

Taking his words as a call to action, hundreds of thousands have filled the city's squares since the first night. The main opposition party, on witnessing the scale of the protests, transformed its primaries for presidential candidacy into a mass political action, inviting all citizens to cast their votes in support of İmamoğlu to demonstrate to the regime that support for him extends far beyond party politics. Close to 15 million people voted for İmamoğlu, securing his position as the official opposition candidate.

The particularities of this story may be confusing. The boundlessness of the lies and tricks employed by an authoritarian leader can be hard to follow. But what is happening in Turkey has important lessons for democracies around the world.

Over the last decade, as we have seen in several European countries and the US, holding the line by lining up with centrist political parties has not been effective, and Occupy-style street politics, inspiring though they may be, do not adequately counter the rising tide of fascism. “Try again, fail again” strategies have been exhausted in recent years, the most recent example being the US. Clearly, the conventional political parties – the Democrats in the US and social democrats in Europe – have failed to harness the political and moral outrage of the masses, which leaders like Erdoğan or Donald Trump induce. The political energy flowing from street politics is too unpredictable to be embraced by conventional political parties – and the masses, with their youthful enthusiasm, are hesitant to align themselves with worn-out political institutions. So what is the solution?

The old-school progressive opposition parties resemble shipwrecks – they are decaying structures. They have lost all that was vital in them over the last five decades after aligning with the neoliberal hegemony, which severed its organic ties to the progressive sectors of society. They are highly bureaucratised and, as a result, paralysed giants unable to keep up with the agility of the new far right. What is occurring in Turkey right now is youthful energy schooling and shoaling around this shipwreck, breathing life into it by transforming the wreck into a reef. For days now, youth leaders have been delivering speeches at significant party meetings, continually negotiating the guidelines for collaborative action. Whenever possible, they ensure that their outrage extends beyond İmamoğlu's arrest. Their presence irrevocably alters the spirit of the political movement and drives the social democratic party forward towards life. Throughout this process, the young learn to navigate the slow-moving giant while the giant adapts to become nimble and brave enough to counter the ruthless tactics of the regime.

Not only for Turkey but also soon for Europe and beyond, the central question of saving democracy from the rise of authoritarianism will be this: will the youthful energy of the masses be allowed into the wreckage to transform it into a living organism? One that is robust enough to challenge the historical tide bending towards authoritarianism? Turkey, in the days to come, will be answering this question.

Australia's fate remains in their own hands and will be decided in June's international window against runaway leaders Japan and Saudi Arabia

Nothing lasts forever, especially in the capricious world of football. And after having results go their way so often during World Cup qualification, it felt inevitable that the whims of the footballing gods would at some point turn away from Australia.

While Tony Popovic's side did pretty much everything they could over the last week, smashing Indonesia 5-1 in Sydney before dispatching China 2-0 in Hangzhou, Japan did everything but score against Saudi Arabia in Saitama on Tuesday. That result ensures the Socceroos' hopes of automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup will go down to the wire in June.

Given that much of Australia's fortune during the third phase of Asian qualifying has centred around them dropping points, perhaps Saudi Arabia would have seen their trip to Saitama as something of a karmic swing. There, they ground out a goalless draw six months after their Australian rivals had done the same to supplant them in one of the group's two automatic qualification slots. Daizen Maeda rattled the woodwork early on and Hajime Moriyasu's side ended the contest with 78% of the ball, but domination of possession could not be turned into clear-cut chances, let alone goals – and Saudi Arabia kept alive their hopes of seizing second place in three months.

With eight of 10 games in this phase of qualification complete, the Socceroos sit second in Group C with 13 points, three points clear of Saudi on 1o. After their narrow 1-0 win over Bahrain, Indonesia sit in fourth on nine points, while Bahrain and China occupy fifth and sixth on six points. A small mercy for the Socceroos is that regardless of what happens in June they cannot fall into one of those bottom two slots – and be eliminated from qualifying. Their worst-case scenario now is to be forced into further rounds of qualification.

Japan, who have an unassailable lead atop the group, will head to Perth for the first game of that window, while Saudi Arabia will travel to Bahrain. Both the Socceroos and Green Falcons will then likely head to Riyadh for a game that if the scriptwriters get their way, could mean everything. In a slightly less dramatic reality, given Australia's goal difference now stands at plus-seven compared to their rivals' minus-two, a draw in that contest would almost certainly be enough for the Australians to punch their tickets to North America, as would a win over Japan in the preceding game. Given the challenges that Bahrain have given Saudi Arabia in recent months – beating them in both the Gulf Cup and World Cup qualifying – it is not inconceivable that Dragan Talajić's side could render things almost moot by getting the job done in Riffa.

For the Socceroos, however, the belief within the group will be that they can win both their upcoming games, allowing the nerds to put away their calculators. Australia are still undefeated since the arrival of Popovic, and the win over China was another example of his side doing exactly what they needed to get a result in Asia; taking an early first-half-lead before shutting the door through disciplined and well-organised defending in the second. It's not always pretty but it's an approach that helped the coach once grind out an Asian Champions League crown and one which could now send him to a World Cup.

That's not to say Australia are the finished article. They're crying out for a difference-maker in attack who can receive and operate with the ball in packed opposition penalty areas. And there's still no clear answer in the No 9 position. But there were building blocks over this window. Jackson Irvine is in career-best form and Nishan Velupillay can't stop scoring. Despite a raft of injuries, the side conceded just one goal in 180 minutes and, entrusted with a debut in Hangzhou, Ryan Teague looked like he'd been playing for years in the Socceroos midfield.

“One of the common themes we have is to be hard to beat,” skipper Maty Ryan said. “We've given testament to that so far. Our definition of it isn't just to sit behind the ball and defend deep. It's picking and managing moments; when to press, when to go forward with the ball – making good decisions.

“The stakes every time you get to pull on the national team shirt are of the highest order. Our nation deserves our utmost attention, commitment, sacrifice and energy.

The agreement comes after separate U.S.-sponsored talks with Ukraine and Russia in Riyadh and includes facilitating Russia's access to world food markets for its exports.

KYIV — Russia and Ukraine agreed Tuesday to expand their initial limited ceasefire on energy infrastructure to include the Black Sea after U.S.-sponsored indirect talks in Saudi Arabia.

In separate joint statements from the White House — one between the United States and Russia, another between the U.S. and Ukraine — the two countries agreed to “ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes” in the Black Sea, as well as to develop measures to implement and monitor the partial ceasefire. The statements did not specify when the limited ceasefire would go into effect.

The statements — which came after this week's technical talks in Riyadh, the Saudi capital — differed in two key ways. The U.S. separately agreed to help Russia gain access to world markets to export fertilizer and other agricultural products. For Ukraine, Washington reiterated its commitment to help facilitate the exchange of prisoners of war, civilian detainees and kidnapped children.

In a news briefing Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he was grateful to the U.S. side for the outcome and said it was his understanding “that once the American side officially issues a statement, the implementation of the decisions outlined in this document could begin.”

A statement on the Russian presidency's website said that the agreement includes lifting sanctions on Russia's agricultural bank and some other institutions, and that the partial ceasefire would not go into effect until that happened. Russia has a long-standing demand to have access restored to the international SWIFT system for transferring money.

The White House did not respond to questions about whether and which sanctions it was prepared to lift.

Russia and Ukraine appeared to have different understandings of when the truce began and how any violations would be managed. The Kremlin wrote in a statement that the truce applied to five categories of energy infrastructure, including oil refineries, oil and gas pipelines, storage facilities, power plants and substations, and hydroelectric dams. It also said the moratorium was valid from March 18 and that if one side were to violate it, “the other party shall be entitled to consider itself free from the obligation to comply with it.”

Zelensky, meanwhile, told journalists that the way violations would be managed was not included in the statements because “the American side was very eager not to let this fall apart.”

He added that Ukraine's follow-up conversation with American officials determined that if Kyiv identifies a violation of the deal, it “must reach out through all our available channels to the American side, presenting the facts and evidence that the Russian side has breached it.”

An official familiar with negotiations, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss them freely, said Russia is using the results to now demand that President Donald Trump lift sanctions, “and in doing so, they're even trying to steal from him the sense of success in his diplomacy.”

“It's a humiliation,” the official said.

Russia's backdating of the truce was “manipulating to shorten the term” of the deal, the official added. Ukraine's position, the official said, “is that it should be effective from today; besides, a control mechanism still needs to be developed.”

Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser to the head of Zelensky's office, said claims circulating among Russian lawmakers that Ukraine is to blame for the lack of a joint statement are “as false as the narratives that Ukraine killed civilians in Bucha or attacked the train station in Kramatorsk,” referring to Russian attacks in Ukraine in 2022.

“Ukraine did not participate in any negotiations with Russia in Saudi Arabia and had no influence over the outcome documents. This is a classic case of blaming the victim. It is Russia that refuses to recover from its imperial pathology and continues to poison the lives of people across the world,” he said.

Andriy Klymenko, head of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies, said Russia's and Ukraine's positions remain “irreconcilable” and that the new agreements appear to amount only to “rhetorical acrobatics.”

“These statements, the news items on the White House website, the commentary from Kyiv and Moscow — it all points to one thing: Nothing has been agreed. The war at sea will continue,” he said.

“It turns out that after everyone made their comments, the United States believes it has reached a major new agreement. … In their view, the parties have agreed — meaning, the U.S. believes the parties agreed to ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea,” he added. “Meanwhile, the Russians believe they've secured a massive rollback of sanctions — which isn't mentioned anywhere.”

Zelensky, who said he wasn't sure how the agreement would be implemented, said that while a ban on attacks against civilian infrastructure was not included in the statement, the issue was discussed with the Americans and therefore implied in the agreement.

“The American side believes that calm skies, as related to the energy sector, also applies to other civilian infrastructure,” he said in the briefing.

Later, in his daily evening address to the nation, Zelensky thanked Washington for its contributions and said Russia's behavior this week “will reveal a lot — if not everything.”

“If we see renewed air raid alerts, renewed military activity in the Black Sea, renewed Russian manipulation and threats, then new measures will have to be taken — specifically against Moscow,” he said. “What's needed now is a result from Russia. We do not trust them. In truth, the world does not trust Russia. And they must prove that they are ready to end the war, ready to stop lying to the world, to Trump, to America.”

The partial ceasefire would prevent Ukraine from striking Russian oil production and exports, which Kyiv had found to be effective at bringing the war home to the Kremlin. Ukrainian sea drones have also been effective in attacking the Russian Black Sea fleet.

Most Ukrainians — as many as 85 percent — view a partial ceasefire positively, according to a poll from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology, conducted from March 12 to 22, before the ban on attacks was updated to include the Black Sea.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday that the resumption of the Black Sea initiative was “agreeable” but that “we cannot take this man's word for it,” referring to Zelensky.

Lavrov said Moscow wants “the grain market, the fertilizer market to be predictable,” so that no one tries to remove Russia from those markets.

The 2022 Black Sea Grain Initiative, also known as the “grain deal,” envisaged the export of Ukrainian grain from Black Sea ports and the normalization of Russian exports, such as agricultural products and fertilizers, to world markets after the war caused food prices to soar.

When Russia abandoned the deal in 2023, John Kirby, then the spokesperson for the U.S. National Security Council, said the U.S. and allies were working to ensure that both Russian and Ukrainian grain reached global markets, adding that “contrary to Russian propaganda, [sanctions] do not target Russian food or fertilizer.”

Russian food exports have continued to rise during the war. In 2023, United Nations Secretary General António Guterres said the Russian grain trade was nearing full recovery, with high grain export volumes and stabilizing fertilizer markets, quoting the Russian Union of Grain Exporters and the Russian Fertilizer Producers Association.

This live coverage has ended.

The Israeli military issued evacuation orders for several areas of northern Gaza late Monday, forcing another round of displacements for Palestinians who were able to return to their homes in the devastated north in late January for the first time since the early days of the war. The military described it as a final warning before the areas would come under attack.

Nearly 125,000 people have been displaced in recent days as they fled Israeli bombardment and ground operations, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Monday, before the latest evacuation orders. The United Nations estimates that over the past week, Israel has issued evacuation notices for more than 14 percent of the enclave, along with “vast ‘no go' areas along the border,” spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said Monday.

It was past 10 p.m. in Gaza when the evacuation order for Jabalya came in, leaving families with few options other than fleeing on foot, in the dark, in search of relative safety. Two hours before, similar warnings were issued for the areas of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun.

“People left under the cover of darkness,” Razan Faisal, a resident of Jabalya who opted to stay behind, said in an interview Tuesday. “We have many elderly people and children, and evacuations involve walking for long hours, which is extremely difficult,” she said, adding that the situation in Jabalya is dire. “There is no aid, and only a few supplies are available in the market at extremely high prices.”

Since March 18, the day Israel broke the fragile truce and resumed bombing Gaza, Israeli attacks have killed more than 792 people, Gaza's Health Ministry said Tuesday. More than 60 percent of them are women and children, according to the ministry.

JERUSALEM — Hamdan Ballal, a Palestinian co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” was released from custody Tuesday, following his arrest by the Israeli army Monday. He was detained after a group of settlers in the West Bank attacked him, according to activists and a neighbor who spoke to The Washington Post.

Ballal went to a hospital after being freed, and was in “moderate” condition on Tuesday, according to the activists.

The Palestinian director was in his home village of Susya, part of the cluster of rural Palestinian communities known as Masafer Yatta, when settlers approached the village and tried to graze their sheep on private Palestinian land just before iftar, the sundown meal at which Muslims break their daily fast during Ramadan, according to Nasser Nawajah, who lives in the small village and reports on settler violence for the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. He spoke with Ballal's wife, who described the attack.

A video taken by Khamudi Mahmoud, a resident of the village, shows a tall man wearing a T-shirt and baseball cap aggressively approaching Ballal in a rocky clearing as Ballal backs away and a crowd of villagers shout behind him.

Dozens of masked settlers wielding batons, knives and a rifle then attacked property and residents, activists who document settler attacks in the area said in a statement afterward.

“Hamdan tried to retreat, and he brought his kids and wife inside the house and stood at the door to protect them,” Nawajah said. Four settlers began to hit the door of Ballal's house, injuring Ballal's head, according to Nawajah, recounting what Ballal's wife told him.

The settlers fired bullets next to the house and then dragged Ballal away while he was injured, Nawajah said.

The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement posted to X that a “violent clash” broke out between Palestinians and Israelis and that it involved “mutual stone-throwing.”

The United Nations said it is making the “difficult decision” to scale back its presence in the Gaza Strip following the collapse of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. About one-third of the roughly 100 international staff members in Gaza will be temporarily relocated, the agency said in a statement.

“We are not abandoning Gaza,” U.N. spokeswoman Alessandra Vellucci said in a news briefing Tuesday, adding that the decision to reduce international staff numbers was because the U.N. was unable to guarantee the safety of its employees.

On Monday, the United Nations said a strike that hit a U.N. guesthouse in central Gaza, killing a Bulgarian employee and injuring five other international staff members, came from Israeli tankfire — something the Israel Defense Forces has denied. The U.N. has called for an investigation, with spokesman Stéphane Dujarric saying Monday, “The Israelis knew exactly where this U.N. facility was, and it was hit by a shell from one of their tanks.”

Also Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its offices in Rafah was “damaged by an explosive projectile despite being clearly marked and notified to all parties. Fortunately, no staff were injured in this incident, but this has a direct impact on the ICRC's ability to operate.”

The IDF said in a statement that its forces had “fired at a building after identifying suspects inside and feeling threatened. … Upon review, it was found that the identification was mistaken, and the building belongs to the Red Cross.” It added that the incident would be investigated.

Aid groups have warned about deteriorating conditions in Gaza. The U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said Monday that nearly 125,000 people in the enclave have been displaced in recent days as they flee Israeli bombardment,

“This is a human catastrophe,” UNRWA said Monday, emphasizing that Israel's siege and blockade of all aid into Gaza has caused food shortages and sent prices soaring.

Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.”

CPJ, a nonprofit organization that tracks repression worldwide, has said Israel has “repeatedly made similar unproven statements” against journalists. In a statement Monday, CPJ denounced Shabat's killing and that of Mohammad Mansour, a journalist who worked for Palestine Today, who was killed the same day in southern Gaza. Shabat's last post on Instagram, hours before he was killed, was a post mourning Mansour.

Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called Shabat's “assassination” and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.”

In a statement Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said it had “eliminated” Shabat, calling him “a sniper terrorist” who was affiliated with Hamas's military wing. It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim.

Shabat denied the claims of militant links when Israel first made the accusations in October, calling them part of a “systematic propaganda campaign to justify the unjustifiable.”

A statement posted on the 23-year-old Shabat's social media accounts and shared by supporters after his death read: “If you're reading this, it means I have been killed — most likely targeted — by the Israeli occupation forces. When this all began, I was only 21 years old — a college student with dreams like anyone else.”

This is an excerpt from a full story.

Top officials in the Trump administration discussed highly sensitive military planning using an unclassified chat application that mistakenly included a journalist, the White House acknowledged Monday, a development that swiftly drew criticism from Democrats and Washington's national security establishment.

Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the message thread revealed in an extraordinary report by the Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, “appears to be authentic,” and that administration officials were “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

The “inadvertent number” belonged to Goldberg, whose article details a robust policy discussion that occurred in the lead-up to a March 15 military operation targeting Yemen's Houthi militants. Goldberg reported being added to the group chat, which occurred on the encrypted messaging platform Signal, by President Donald Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz. Other participants appeared to include Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and several other senior aides, the Atlantic article says.

Hughes, the National Security Council spokesman, characterized the discussion as “a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials” executing Trump's national security strategy. But the disclosure immediately raised questions about how the administration has discussed classified national security matters and whether anyone will be disciplined.

Senior Trump administration officials have warned in recent days that they will investigate unauthorized leaks to journalists, citing reporting in a number of publications. Several of them also for years criticized the handling of classified information by Democrats in other cases.

Israel's military launched a large-scale bombing campaign on the Gaza Strip on 18 March, breaking the fragile ceasefire with Hamas that had been in place since late January. Follow live updates on the ceasefire and the hostages remaining in Gaza.

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader.

The migrants, accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang, are being held at CECOT without access to either the Salvadoran or American justice systems.

Kristi L. Noem, the U.S. secretary of homeland security, plans to travel Wednesday to a notorious maximum security prison in El Salvador that has become a legal black hole for Venezuelan migrants spirited out of the United States with no judicial hearing.

The Trump administration is locked in a court battle over whether it acted improperly in expelling the Venezuelans, who are accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. A U.S. judge had ordered the government to recall the planes carrying the detainees to El Salvador on March 15. But it didn't do so.

While the arguments in Washington have centered on the migrants' removal from the U.S., another legal issue has emerged: What happens to the Venezuelans now?

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele offered last month to take in dangerous criminals held in U.S. detention facilities. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who had previously complained about Venezuela's refusal to accept deported migrants, said the deal would “save our taxpayer dollars.” The U.S. agreed to pay $6 million a year to keep them at the Salvadoran jail known as the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

Now the prisoners are stuck — with no clear access to either the Salvadoran or U.S. justice systems. “They are in a legal limbo,” said Enrique Anaya, a Salvadoran constitutional lawyer.

Several of their families have said they are not gang members at all, just migrants who had tattoos, such as “Strong like Mom.” The U.S. government has acknowledged that many did not have criminal records in the U.S.

In El Salvador, “they aren't sentenced, they didn't commit crimes, they weren't tourists. What is the migration status of these people?” asked Napoleón Campos, a Salvadoran attorney specializing in international law. “How can you enter El Salvador overnight and go straight to jail, without committing a crime, and without being sought in extradition?”

On Monday, lawyers hired by the Venezuelan government, who said they represented 30 of the detainees, submitted a habeas corpus petition for all the jailed Venezuelans.

“There is no legal basis for their detentions,” the lawyers argued in their submission to the Constitutional Chamber of El Salvador's Supreme Court. They noted that the men had not violated Salvadoran law, and they asked for their release.

Legal experts said that request was unlikely to be granted. The chamber's judges were installed after Bukele's party won a congressional majority in 2021. They have consistently backed the president.

The 238 Venezuelans arrived in San Salvador on three U.S. planes, along with 23 Salvadorans accused of belonging to the ruthless MS-13 gang. The Trump administration used an 18th-century law, the Alien Enemies Act, to expel 137 of the Venezuelans — essentially arguing they belonged to an invading force linked to the Venezuelan government. The act allows expedited deportation of noncitizens. The other 101 Venezuelans were removed under traditional immigration law. Bukele described all of them as members of Tren de Aragua, which was designated a terrorist group last month by the U.S. government.

The Trump administration has removed other undocumented migrants to third-party countries — deporting more than 400 people from countries such as China and Iran to Panama and Costa Rica last month.

The difference this time is that the migrants were jailed like criminals. The three planes were met by heavily armed Salvadoran security forces, who bused the detainees to CECOT, where their heads were forcibly shaved. The prison, built for 40,000, is known for its harsh conditions. Up to 70 men share a single cell, and they sleep on metal bunks with no mattresses, according to journalists who have been to the prison. The inmates are not allowed visits by their relatives or lawyers.

It wasn't clear when — or if — the Venezuelans would ever be tried or freed.

Noah Bullock, executive director of the human rights group Cristosal, said that President Donald Trump and Bukele had usurped from the courts the power to determine who was a criminal and who should have legal rights.

“Nobody here is waving the flag of Tren de Aragua,” he said. “But do you want the president to have the right to determine who is a terrorist and who has rights — and who doesn't?”

Rubio has likened the removal of the Venezuelans to a counterterrorism operation. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the legal basis for sending the Venezuelans to a Central American prison.

Asked for comment, the Justice Department responded with Noem's statement after U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg's initial order blocking the removal of the Venezuelans. Noem said that the ruling “disregards well-established authority regarding President Trump's power.”

Salvadoran attorneys said that, in order for the U.S. government to outsource prisoners to El Salvador, the countries would have to sign a treaty or convention, and get the approval of their legislatures. In such a treaty, “you'd have to spell out who would have legal jurisdiction over these people — the United States or El Salvador,” Anaya said.

“At least the U.S. is citing a law, albeit one that's raising a lot of questions in the federal courts,” he said, referring to the Alien Enemies Act. “In El Salvador, there is no law.”

The Salvadoran presidential commissioner for human rights, Andrés Guzmán, did not respond to a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=%22world%20news%22%20site%3Awashingtonpost.com","This Chinese city grew its birthrate. It won't be easy to copy.","https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/03/26/china-birth-rate-grows-with-support/","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 08:01:04 GMT","

With a plummeting birth rate and a rapidly aging population, China faces a demographic crisis. The city of Tianmen is an outlier — at least temporarily.

TIANMEN, China — There is a lot riding on the shoulders of toddlers being wheeled around the lakeside parks and fluorescent-lit shopping malls of this city in the plains of central China.

Tianmen, population 1 million, is being held up as proof that this country of 1.4 billion — and falling — can spend its way out of a looming demographic crisis. The city's birth rate suddenly grew by 17 percent last year, the first rise in eight years and well above a national increase of 5.8 percent.

State media has praised Tianmen's turnaround and noted its generous subsidies, among the highest in the country, for couples who have second or third children: Parents can in theory receive up to $39,616 for a second child and $49,107 for a third — though most get far less.

“Tianmen's policy is great. It has solved my housing problem because I have many children,” said Xie Fei, who gave birth to her third child in her hometown of Tianmen in September, even though she lives and works in Wuhan, a two-hour drive away.

The 37-year-old, who works at a state-owned chemical engineering firm, will receive a total of $5,600 before her son turns 3. She has already used a $25,000 housing coupon to cover more than one-third of the cost of a Tianmen apartment.

More than 100 officials from across the country have visited Tianmen in recent months to learn its “fertility secret,” state-run Xinhua News Agency said this month, as the Chinese leadership tries to replicate its success nationwide and reverse a stubbornly shrinking population.

China's fertility rate has been less than half of the replacement rate of 2.1 for three years, despite the government having now spent a decade trying to persuade people to have more babies.

The government ended its one-child policy in 2016, but instead of spurring a baby boom, there was a slump in births at a pace rarely seen in peacetime. For Beijing, an irreversible decline could grow into an economic disaster.

Many young people, weary from the rat race at work and concerned about the soaring costs of raising children, prefer to have only one child — if they want any at all.

Boosting fertility was a top priority at China's big political meetings in Beijing this month. The government noted — for the first time — the need for “child-rearing subsidies,” among various efforts to hit an ambitious economic growth target of “around 5 percent.”

It also announced a gradual shift toward free preschool education, expanded state health-care coverage for childbirth and improved pediatric services — many of which Tianmen introduced in 2023.

According to state media, Tianmen's formula for motivating young couples to reproduce is simple: subsidies, subsidies, subsidies — and a heavy dose of birth-positive propaganda from local officials.

The support starts with coverage for prenatal tests. A one-time payout of $275 for a second child or $314 for a third child follows at birth, then monthly payments of $110 or $137 until the child is 3. Some get additional support for maternity leave.

Perhaps most significantly, the policy includes generous housing coupons. The parents of a third child can claim $16,500 off a new home — a substantial amount in Tianmen's struggling property market.

It's unclear how Tianmen, which was $1.9 billion in debt as of 2023, can afford such a high level of expenditure.

Despite its apparent success, the Tianmen city government declined multiple requests to speak with The Washington Post about its policies to encourage childbirth.

Kids really are everywhere on Tianmen's streets. But their parents — and demographers — doubt the recent uptick will continue.

Many residents said Tianmen happened to introduce the policy as a wave of young couples moved back to the city. After the coronavirus pandemic forced migrant workers to return home from east coast factory towns, many stayed to work in a local textile industry that has thrived in the age of online shopping.

Almost every new parent whom The Post spoke to during a visit this month said they planned to have a second or third child regardless of subsidies. State support, while welcomed, was not the deciding factor.

“I chose to have a second child because I grew up in a house with two kids and thought it was great,” said a 29-year-old woman surnamed Dong, who only found out about the subsidies after becoming pregnant.

“Those who want to have children will not care about the subsidies and will naturally have children anyway,” she added, speaking on the condition that her full name not be used to avoid reprisals from officials.

The city's impressive performance was also helped by expectant mothers from Tianmen, like Xie, who were living in other cities and came back to take advantage of low-cost health care and steep discounts on housing. Three parents who spoke to The Post returned only temporarily to give birth.

If the 2024 rise turns out to be short-lived, that would be bad news for Tianmen — the city plans to renovate 30 kindergartens and open 100 after-school programs this year.

Tianmen's ability to quickly boost fertility shows the importance of comprehensive support for families, but it may be difficult to sustain or replicate elsewhere, said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, who focuses on China's demography.

As a relatively small city where living costs and work pressures are low — the average monthly disposable income was $440 in 2023 — Tianmen has the budget to afford large payouts relative to local salaries.

That makes the city a potential outlier. Elsewhere in China, the governments of poorer regions may struggle to afford subsidies, while big cities are too expensive and full of stressed young people more concerned with finding a job than starting a family.

In places such as Shanghai, “the labor market is very competitive for the younger generation, so these financial incentives won't easily change their minds,” Peng said.

China became the world's second-largest economy partly because young people worked hard to achieve a better life.

Now, as the economy loses momentum, the Chinese Communist Party is increasingly concerned that the dwindling labor force will soon struggle to support the rapidly aging population. It will need many more Tianmens to avoid a demographic crisis.

The introduction of “baby bonuses” often creates a moderate and immediate increase, said Shuang Chen, an assistant professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science. But this is usually because people have children earlier — or, in Tianmen's case, back in their hometown — not because they decide to have more children.

“You're simply encouraging the same group of people who were going to have children anyway to have them now,” Chen said. “That's why these effects are very temporary.”

China's demographic woes are worsened by the lingering traumas of the one-child policy, which resulted in local officials forcing women to have abortions and undergo compulsory sterilization surgery. It also left behind a generation of young women determined to make their own choices about having children, free from state interference.

But the Chinese Communist Party has once again turned to its army of neighborhood officials and volunteers who enforced the one-child policy to encourage births.

For Yin Li, an official in charge of family planning in one Tianmen neighborhood, that means making daily phone calls and home visits to try to persuade couples to keep reproducing.

“It will be hard to match last year,” she said, adding that the number of births in her neighborhood “is already starting to decline.”

The 47-year-old mother of two (unsubsidized) children is concerned that too few young couples want to get married or have children. Out of 11 newlyweds on her list, only three intend to have kids. “The rest tell me they have no plans to have children,” she said.

After 17 months, Israeli reserve soldiers are questioning their leaders' decision to restart the war against Hamas.

TEL AVIV — In the days following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, hundreds of thousands of Israelis rushed to join the fight against Hamas and allied militants in the Gaza Strip. The enlistment rate soared, according to the Israeli military, with the number of soldiers reporting for duty far surpassing those who were formally called up.

But now, as Israel resumes operations in Gaza following a temporary ceasefire, some reservist soldiers have questioned the role they are playing in their nation's longest war. The 17-month campaign, they say, has failed both to eliminate Hamas and to secure the release all of the hostages abducted during the attacks, which killed about 1,200 people. It's a shift that could complicate plans, now under consideration by Israel's political and military leaders, to reoccupy Gaza.

“In the beginning, there was no dilemma, because there was a feeling that we were all running to save the state of Israel,” said Haim Har-Zahav, who joined an Israel Defense Forces reservist unit soon after the Oct. 7 attacks.

In December, however, after serving 254 days of reserve duty over the course of the war, Har-Zahav refused to continue his service, saying he had come to the conclusion that the Israeli government “was uninterested in a hostage deal” and that “the war was going nowhere.” Har-Zahav, 47, has aged out of the category of reservists who are required to answer the call-up. But his commanders, he said, tried to persuade him to stay.

“If the government doesn't share my values, or the values of most of the country, I wondered if my being there wasn't helping the bad guys by being a useful idiot,” he said of Israel's government, citing months of public pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to end the war and negotiate a hostage deal with Hamas. “I was educated with the ethos that you serve because no one else will do it for you. But also, that if you can bring Israelis home, you do it.”

He said others in his unit have also left in recent months.

Israel, with a population of about 9 million, maintains a conscripted army but also relies on a reserve of combat-ready troops. In the early days of the war, the IDF called up about 360,000 reservists, thousands of whom have now served multiple tours in Gaza and in Lebanon, where Israel fought a war with Hezbollah in the fall.

Reservists have always been critical to the functioning of the military in times of crisis. But in the past decades, as Israel engaged in relatively short wars with Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza, combat soldiers were typically called up for a maximum of several weeks, including training and operational duties — a stark contrast with the hundreds of days that are required of reservists now.

The time away has caused hardship for the soldiers, including mounting debt as their businesses falter, pressure from family members to stay at home, and agony over the failure to eradicate Hamas and get the remaining 59 hostages — 24 of whom are still thought to be alive — out of Gaza. Together, the demands have caused some of them to reassess their commitment to the military.

The army does not publish statistics on rates of refusal among reservists, saying that the “reserve system is fully functional and fulfills all its missions,” according to an IDF spokesperson. But if it follows through on plans to launch a full-scale ground campaign and military occupation of Gaza, experts estimate that at least five divisions, or about 60,000 soldiers, would be needed — manpower that many of those who have served on the front lines suspect simply does not exist.

One active reservist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in accordance with military protocol, said his special forces unit originally made up of 14 men has whittled down to about five. He declined his call-up twice last year, but has served several stints since — a more common form of refusal among reservists who still believe Israel is under threat but are nonetheless hitting their limit, according to the reservists interviewed for this article.

The soldier added that he increasingly worries his deployment to Gaza will give a “green light” to the government to pursue unpopular war strategies there. “Now that people have been home, and had more time to think,” he said, he suspects that even fewer of his fellow soldiers will answer the next call.

During the ceasefire and hostage release deal that went into effect in January, 33 living hostages were released and aid surged into Gaza. In recent weeks, however, Netanyahu refused to continue negotiations for the second phase of the deal, saying that Israel had agreed to a 50-day ceasefire extension as proposed by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff. On March 18, Netanyahu restarted the war with deadly aerial bombardments, followed by a limited ground incursion.

As Israel gears up for another major military offensive, it has also been roiled by political crises in recent weeks, including mass demonstrations to push Netanyahu to make yet another deal with Hamas to release the hostages and end the war.

Instead, the prime minister forged ahead with controversial plans to oust the country's top security and legal officials. On Thursday, Netanyahu began the process of firing Ronen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, Israel's domestic security agency. On Sunday, he did the same to Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, who responded by saying that Netanyahu has sought to put himself “above the law, to act without checks and balances, even at the most sensitive of times,” including the war in Gaza.

“There is a feeling that the burden is on the same small number of people,” said Hagar Chen-Tzion, whose husband, a deputy company commander in the Armored Corps, was preparing to deploy for a fourth stint to Gaza this week.

She said her 3-year-old daughter has struggled with her father's absence and doesn't let him out of her sight when he is home; their 6-month-old barely knows him. Over the nearly 300 days of his reserve service, Chen-Tzion has been increasingly fearful that he will be injured or killed, as many of their friends and neighbors have. “Statistically, it feels like it will get us at some point, too,” she said.

More than 840 soldiers have died in the war, and more than 5,700 have been wounded, on Oct. 7 and since, according to IDF figures — a significant number in a small country, roughly the size of New Jersey, where the military draft is universal.

And while many reservists say they signed up for the sacrifice, they are having discussions at home with their wives, in combat buddy WhatsApp groups and on social media about the painful decision not to serve, even as Hamas regroups, the hostages remain in captivity, their fellow soldiers are increasingly stretched and the pace of war is unpredictable.

Because the army was not designed to rely on so many reservists for so long, “they never expected to put us in this situation,” said Ari Krauss, a reservist from Golani, an elite IDF infantry brigade.

He said that after being away from his home, his job and his 2-year-old daughter for five months over the past year and a half, he has been told to prepare for another two months of service in the coming year. His wife doesn't know if she can take it again.

“With our families, there's respect and appreciation or whatever,” he said. “But that really doesn't help when, at the end of the day, Daddy isn't home to help out.”

Krauss says his unit has thinned from 22 to about 15, with a couple of soldiers being swapped in to help with the shortage.

Chen-Tzion, the wife of the reservist, supported Netanyahu's far-right coalition partners, known as the Religious Zionist bloc. She worries that the government she helped vote into power is not doing enough, militarily or diplomatically, to free the hostages or neutralize Israel's enemies on its borders.

“I want to know that if my husband is called it is because it is really necessary, and because we will really win,” she said. “At the moment, the aims do not feel clear enough.”

The Israel-Gaza war: On Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched an unprecedented cross-border attack on Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking civilian hostages. Israel declared war on Hamas in response, launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel's creation in 1948. In July 2024, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an attack Hamas has blamed on Israel.

Hezbollah: In late 2024, Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire deal, bringing a tenuous halt to more than a year of hostilities that included an Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon.  Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader. The Israel-Lebanon border has a history of violence that dates back to Israel's founding.

Gaza crisis: In the Gaza Strip, Israel has waged one of this century's most destructive wars, killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into “famine-like conditions.” For months, Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.

The head of Turkey's largest opposition party visited jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu in prison on Tuesday, after his detention sparked a week of protests.

The leader of Turkey's primary opposition party visited jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on Tuesday, as sustained protests calling for his release entered their seventh night.

After a two-hour visit with Imamoglu on Tuesday, Ozgur Ozel, who leads the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), sounded defiant. The imprisoned mayor and fellow CHP members who are jailed are “not afraid,” Ozel said, and have denied the corruption-related charges brought by prosecutors.

Ozel has repeatedly said his party and its supporters will not back down, but he also announced that Tuesday night would mark the end of scheduled protests in front of Istanbul's city hall, the Associated Press reported. Amid the largest wave of Turkish street protests in years, however, agitated CHP supporters might defy their party leadership and continue protests in a different form or venue.

Gonul Tol, director of the Middle East Institute's Turkish program, said she expects protests — which appear to have already affected President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's behavior — to continue across Istanbul and the country. “I don't think [Erdogan] expected this many people to show up. I don't think anyone expected this many people to show up,” Tol said.

For Erdogan's political opponents, the coming days may serve as an inflection point. Imamoglu's victory in the Istanbul mayoral election in 2019 was a major blow to Erdogan and his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Since then, Imamoglu has widely been seen as one of the only opposition politicians who may be capable of ending Erdogan's 22-year-long grip on power.

While Turkey's next presidential election is scheduled for 2028, some opposition members suspect that the government is sidelining Imamoglu to pave the way for an earlier vote and another Erdogan term. The president's allies have increasingly tightened their control over state institutions and have been criticized for deepening restrictions on speech and expression.

Erdogan and members of his government have rejected opposition accusations of interference with the rule of law.

In response to the protests, Erdogan blamed the opposition for making “the most vile and unlawful statements” in Turkey's political history, and described the protests as a “show” and as “street terror.”

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya accused opposition protesters of provocations and incitement, including more than 40 people who were detained for “vile insults” that targeted Erdogan's family. Turkish officials say more than 1,400 protesters have been detained since the middle of last week. Almost 1,000 people were in custody as of Tuesday evening, Yerlikaya wrote on social media.

“No concessions will be made to those who attempt to terrorize the streets,” he wrote.

In several cities, including Istanbul and Ankara, protesters peacefully defied restrictions on assembling in recent days. Students across the country walked out of classes. Some demonstrations ended in violent clashes.

International human rights observers criticized the Turkish police's role. The Council of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Michael O'Flaherty, said in a statement Monday that he was “following with concern the reports about disproportionate use of force by the police,” and he called on Turkish authorities “to immediately release all those individuals who are detained for the legitimate exercise of their human rights.”

O'Flaherty and other human rights observers also voiced concern about the detention of several journalists. In a statement Tuesday, Turkey's Media and Law Studies Association said 11 journalists have been taken into custody for covering the protests. Seven of them were formally arrested Tuesday, the association said.

Turkey's political crisis also threatens to imperil the country's economy, which was already struggling after a long streak of high inflation. Turkey's currency and stock markets were thrown into turmoil by Imamoglu's arrest last week, prompting an exodus of foreign investors and the imposition of emergency governmental measures to stabilize markets.

Turkey's finance minister has spent years convincing foreign investors that Turkey is past instability and chaos, Tol said. “I think that work has been undone now,” she said.

Erdogan on Monday said that he will never allow those gains to be harmed and that protecting “macro-financial stability” is a priority, local news reported.

“The Turkish economy is in such a fragile state,” Tol said, adding that any bold moves by the president could backfire. Erdogan is banking on the protesters leaving within a few days, long before the next elections, she said. “But here he is taking a huge risk: What if they don't go back home? If there's months and months of chaos, the cost to the economy is going to be huge.”

The grain and fertilizer proposal, which drew pushback from Ukraine, came alongside a U.S.-brokered pact between Russia and Ukraine to expand a limited ceasefire.

The United States agreed Tuesday to help Russia sell its grain and fertilizer on the world market — a move that was quickly criticized in Kyiv as a unilateral concession on a long-standing Kremlin demand.

The grain deal was announced in a U.S. statement on negotiations with Russia regarding a U.S.-brokered framework between Russia and Ukraine to expand a limited ceasefire to include the Black Sea, as the Trump administration pushes for a more comprehensive deal.

In later public statements, the Kremlin said the grain and fertilizer agreement would need to include relief from Western economic sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Kyiv was not consulted on the proposal and would not support it.

“It's a concession,” Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former economy minister in Ukraine who heads the Kyiv School of Economics, said after the announcement. “But [it is] unclear for what.”

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Moscow has claimed that it has struggled to access export markets for its agricultural goods. In the past, Western officials responded by saying that there were no formal sanctions on the goods and that Russian exports had continued at high levels.

Agricultural experts said they were confused by the latest proposal, noting that while a prior agreement on shipping through the Black Sea had broken down in 2023, both Ukraine and Russia had been able to find ways to export their grain since then.

Andrey Sizov, managing director at research firm SovEcon, which tracks the Black Sea grain market, said Tuesday that the U.S. announcement was “surprising,” as Russian food and fertilizer exports had hit “record highs since the war began.” Data collected by SovEcon showed Russian grain exports hitting 71 million metric tons in the 2023-2024 season, compared with just 42 million in 2021-2022.

“Looks like another nod to Moscow,” Sizov wrote on X, adding that the move could indicate that U.S. sanctions on Rosselkhozbank, a state-owned agricultural bank, would be lifted.

In a later phone call, however, Sizov emphasized that the U.S. proposal was so vague, it was “hard to know if it was an actual concession.”

He added that some key aspects of sanctions relief, such as the reconnection of Rosselkhozbank to the Brussels-based SWIFT financial messaging system, would require cooperation with European allies.

The Kremlin said Tuesday that it would implement the agreements reached in Saudi Arabia only if the West lifted “sanctions on Rosselkhozbank and other financial institutions that provide operations in international trade in food, fishery products and fertilizers.”

“This includes connecting Rosselkhozbank to SWIFT,” the Kremlin added.

The language on U.S. support for Russian grain exports was not included in a separate White House statement detailing the results of U.S. negotiations with Ukraine in Saudi Arabia. Zelensky said that the issue had not been on the agenda for those meetings and that Kyiv did not support it.

“We believe that would weaken our position and the sanctions regime,” Zelensky said at a news conference.

“Oral bilateral agreements can only be considered as the first step towards achieving a binding trilateral agreement,” said Nikolai Petrov, an expert with the New Eurasian Strategies Center, a think tank founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

The talks in Riyadh over recent days came less than two years after Moscow unilaterally withdrew from an agreement to allow Black Sea grain exports from Ukraine, claiming that its demands to allow the export of Russian grain and fertilizer were not being met.

That agreement, known as the Black Sea Grain Initiative and brokered by Turkey and the United Nations, was designed to alleviate global food prices that had surged after Russia invaded Ukraine and cut off a major global grain supplier from world markets.

Earlier Tuesday, Russia's top diplomat said exports via the Black Sea were a key Kremlin priority for the talks being held in Riyadh.

“We are for the resumption of the Black Sea initiative in some form more acceptable to all,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Russian state television, adding that the aim was to make “the grain market, the fertilizer market to be predictable.”

Moscow, Lavrov noted, is concerned about the food situation in Africa and other countries of the Global South that have suffered from the “games of the West.”

While global food prices spiked in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, they have remained far lower in the years since then, according to U.N. statistics. Sizov said he thought it was unlikely that the U.S. proposal on Tuesday would affect global prices.

“Wheat prices are already 30 percent lower than they were before the war, despite the lack of a ceasefire, lack of a grain deal,” he said.

Daniel Fried, a retired career diplomat who now works for the Atlantic Council, wrote on X that the deal to facilitate exports was a gain for Russia but that there was little sign of gains for Ukraine so far. Russia was “slow walking” the process, he added.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte says that four U.S. soldiers who went missing while training in Lithuania have been killed, but that he does not yet know the details

WARSAW, Poland — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Wednesday that four U.S. soldiers who went missing while training in Lithuania have been killed, but that he did not yet know the details.

A U.S. official would say only that the four soldiers were involved in a training accident. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not comment on the status of the soldiers.

Rutte said, during a trip to Warsaw, that his thoughts were with their families and with the United States.

“The news came out about four American soldiers who were killed in an incident in Lithuania. This is still early news so we do not know the details. This is really terrible news and our thoughts are with the families and loved ones,” Rutte told reporters in Warsaw.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

VILNIUS, Lithuania — Four U.S. Army soldiers have gone missing at a training area outside of Lithuania's capital, and a search is underway, the U.S. military said Wednesday.

A statement from U.S. Army Europe and Africa public affairs in Wiesbaden, Germany said the soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training at the time.

It said further information will be provided as new information becomes available.

Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported that four U.S. soldiers and vehicle were reported missing Tuesday afternoon during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Belarus.

The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all NATO members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.

Relations soured further over Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 , and Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Ukraine in its fight against Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

Tributes are pouring in for a veteran Zimbabwean journalist who rose to prominence by exposing government corruption

HARARE, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe is mourning Geoffrey Nyarota, one of the country's most prominent journalists best known for exposing government corruption and launching what became the country's most popular and critical independent newspaper.

Nyarota died on Saturday of colon cancer. He was 74. His burial is set for Wednesday.

The veteran newsman came to prominence in the late 1980s when, as editor of state-run newspaper The Chronicle, he exposed a racket involving cabinet ministers and top government officials who jumped the line to buy cars from a local vehicle assembly firm, and resold them for a profit at a time the country was facing vehicles shortages.

A commission of inquiry was established, five ministers resigned, one of them eventually taking his own life, but Nyarota lost his job and left the country to teach journalism in southern Africa.

Nyarota had trained as a teacher, one of the few jobs open to educated Blacks during white minority rule in what was then known as Rhodesia, before branching into journalism.

Government spokesman Nick Mangwana said Nyarota had “left an indelible mark on the country's journalism landscape.”

“Nyarota slept, dreamt, breathed and lived journalism,” said the Media Institute of Southern Africa, a regional media freedom group.

In 1999, Nyarota helped launch The Daily News, an independent newspaper that challenged the state hegemony on the media. With its motto ” Telling it like it is,” and Nyarota as editor-in-chief, the newspaper gave space to dissenting voices while poking at government corruption and excesses. Soon, the paper was outselling the government-controlled Herald daily newspaper.

Nyarota and journalists from the Daily News were arrested multiple times, the paper's printing press was bombed in 2001, before it was closed over licensing issues in 2003. Nyarota had resigned from the paper earlier in 2002 due to differences with its new management.

In 2003, he moved to the U.S as a fellow of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University, and also ran an online publication, The Zimbabwe Times. He later returned to Zimbabwe and chaired a government-supported panel of inquiry into media ethics in 2014.

Nyarota was a recipient of several international awards, including the Committee to Protect Journalists' International Press Freedom Award in 2001, Golden Pen of Freedom Award from the World Association of Newspapers in 2002, and the Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize the same year.

He described his journalism work in the face of adversity as a kind of national responsibility.

“It's a form of national service for the welfare of our people,” he told The Harvard Gazette after his enrolment at the institution.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}"

The top editor of the Atlantic magazine revealed on Monday that he knew about U.S. airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen hours before they happened, because he was added to a Signal messaging app group chat where members of the Trump administration appeared to be discussing such war plans.

Editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg said he received a Signal connection request on March 11 from someone whom he believed to be national security adviser Michael Waltz. Two days later, he said he was added to a conversation called “Houthi PC small group” with what appeared to be 18 members of the administration, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance, where they talked about plans to bomb Yemen.

U.S. air and naval assets hit multiple Houthi targets in Yemen on March 15. The Houthi rebels are an Iran-backed terrorist organization based in Yemen that has said their attacks are intended to help end the war in Gaza, according to the Associated Press.

In a March 25 Fox News interview, Waltz said he took ""full responsibility"" for Goldberg's access to the Signal conversation.

“I take full responsibility. I built the group. My job is to make sure everything's coordinated,” Waltz said. But in terms of whether he knew who Goldberg was and his role at the Atlantic, Waltz added, “I can tell you 100% I don't know this guy... He wasn't on my phone. And we're going to figure out how this happened.""

Goldberg broke down details of the conversation between people involved in the Signal group, including accounts identified as “JD Vance,” “MAR” (the initials of Secretary of State Marco Antonio Rubio) and “TG” (which Goldberg said could be Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence).

Goldberg, a veteran foreign affairs reporter, said he struggled to believe that this Signal group chat was real. “I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,” he wrote.

""I have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal,” Goldberg wrote. “But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters — not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I've never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.""

President Trump first told reporters on Monday that he “doesn't know anything about it” when asked about the report in the Atlantic. He later told NBC News that he stands with Waltz, and Goldberg's inclusion in the Signal group chat had ""no impact at all"" on the operation.

""Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,"" Trump said.

White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that the message thread described in the article “appears to be authentic.”

“We are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” the statement continued. “The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security.”

Hegseth, meanwhile, referred to Goldberg as “a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist” and added, “Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that.”

Signal is a private, secure messaging app launched in 2018. It skyrocketed to more than 40 million users globally in 2021, after it became popular for its end-to-end encryption of messages sent and received over the app, similar to other popular encrypted messaging apps WhatsApp and Telegram. WhatsApp is owned by Meta, while Signal is owned and operated by the Signal Foundation, a nonprofit cofounded by the app's creators.

End-to-end encrypted messaging apps allow only the sender and the chosen recipient to read the messages exchanged over the platform. Signal also offers end-to-end encrypted video and voice calls.

Nothing is stored on Signal's servers — not even employees at Signal can read any of the messages being shared over the platform they run.

The app also offers an option to enable disappearing messages, where users set a timer for specific messages to delete automatically, to protect and maintain all conversation security.

“Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,” Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Atlantic reporter Shane Harris.

Several former U.S. officials told Goldberg and Harris that they had used Signal in the past specifically to share “unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems.”

Some members will therefore occasionally use Signal while traveling abroad, because the government has its own communication system specifically to share classified information either over government-approved equipment or in a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, which most Cabinet-level officials have installed in their homes, according to the Atlantic.

“They knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app,” Goldberg said of the former officials and Signal. “Waltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation.”

In addition to improperly discussing classified information, adding a journalist to the group chat, even by accident, creates new security and legal issues: providing classified information to someone who was not authorized to receive it.

“That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack,” Goldberg pointed out.

Shortly after the Atlantic's report was published, congressional Democrats called for an investigation into the national security officials who were involved in the Signal conversation.

“This is an outrageous national security breach and heads should roll,” Pennsylvania Rep. Chris Deluzio, a member of the Armed Services Committee, told Axios. “We need a full investigation and hearing into this.”

“We can't chalk this up to a simple mistake,” another Democrat, California Rep. Sara Jacobs, told the outlet. “People should be fired for this.”

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on X, “This administration is playing fast and loose with our nation's most classified info, and it makes all Americans less safe.”

New York Rep. Pat Ryan, a Democrat who also sits on the Armed Services Committee, posted on X, “If House Republicans won't hold a hearing on how this happened IMMEDIATELY, I'll do it my damn self.”

Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican on the Armed Services Committee, told Axios that while he has “accidentally sent the wrong person a text,” the “unconscionable action was sending this info over non-secure networks.”

“None of this should have been sent on non-secure systems,” Bacon said.

“It appears that mistakes were made, no question,” Republican Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said. “We'll try to get to ground truth and take appropriate action.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters at the Capitol that there should only be one investigation into how Goldberg's number was added.

“I'm told they're doing an investigation to find out how that number was included, and that should be that,” Johnson said. “I'm not sure that it requires much additional attention.”

Three people were ""found conscious"" after two jets from the French air force's acrobatics team apparently collided near an air base in northeastern France on Tuesday, authorities said.

The Alpha Jet planes are thought to have collided near an air base west of Saint-Dizier in northeastern France, the French air and space force told AFP.

Three people -- two pilots and one passenger -- ejected and were ""found conscious"", according to the military.

One person suffered multiple injuries, a source told AFP.

One of the planes crashed into a silo, sparking a fire.

There were no civilian casualties.

""Emergency services have been mobilised,"" Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on X.

France has been using the light Alpha twin-engined aircraft to train Ukrainian pilots after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

In August 2024, two French pilots died after their Rafale jets collided in mid-air in eastern France, in a rare accident involving the cutting-edge military aircraft.

President Donald Trump's executive order seeking broad changes to how elections are run in the U.S. is vast in scope and holds the potential to reorder the voting landscape across the country, even as it faces almost certain litigation.

He wants to require voters to show proof that they are U.S. citizens before they can register for federal elections, count only mail or absentee ballots received by Election Day, set new rules for voting equipment and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from being able to donate in certain elections.

A basic question underlying the sweeping actions he signed Tuesday: Can he do it, given that the Constitution gives wide leeway to the states to develop their own election procedures? Here are some of the main points of the executive order and questions it raises.

Trump's order calls for the federal voter registration form to be amended so prospective voters must provide documentary proof of citizenship, such as a U.S. passport or a birth certificate.

It also says states should turn over their voter lists and records of voter list maintenance to the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Government Efficiency for review, and directs federal agencies to share data with states to help them identify noncitizens on their rolls.

If states refuse to collaborate with federal law enforcement to prosecute election crimes, they could potentially lose out on federal grants, the order says.

Noncitizen voting, which is already a felony in federal elections that can lead to prison time and deportation, is exceedingly rare. Still, Trump falsely claimed in 2024 that it might happen in large enough numbers to sway the outcome of the presidential race, and it has been a top conservative priority in recent months.

Republicans have been trying to get a documentary proof of citizenship requirement through Congress, a goal this order seeks to accomplish. Voting rights groups have expressed concern about such a requirement, saying it could disenfranchise the millions of Americans who do not have proof of citizenship readily available.

The order requires votes to be “cast and received” by Election Day and says federal funding should be conditional on state compliance with that deadline. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Perhaps no state is more notorious for drawn-out vote counts than California, the nation's most populous. It allows ballots to be counted if they are received up to seven days following the election as long as they are postmarked by Election Day.

Most California voters cast ballots they receive in the mail, and in the pursuit of accuracy, thoroughness and counting every vote, the state has gained a reputation for tallies that can drag on for weeks or even a month or more. In one Northern California U.S. House primary last year, a recount settled the outcome nearly two months after the election. At the time, Secretary of State Shirley Weber, who oversees elections, said in a statement: “I understand that people want finality, but accuracy is of utmost importance.”

But the extended tallies have raised fears that they could undercut, rather than bolster, voter confidence. In 2018, then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan described California's election system as “bizarre” in a year when Democrats picked off a string of GOP-held House seats.

In a statement, California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla said Trump's order “does nothing to improve the safety of our federal elections — what it would do is disenfranchise millions of eligible American voters.”

Padilla, who formerly served as California's chief elections officer, said Trump “lacks the authority to implement many of the changes laid out in this illegal executive order.”

The executive order instructs the Election Assistance Commission to amend its guidelines for voting systems to protect election integrity. That would include guidance that voting systems should not rely on ballots that use barcodes or QR codes in the vote-counting process.

Trump instructed the commission to “take appropriate action to review and, if appropriate, re-certify voting systems” under those new standards within six months of the order.

In Georgia, an important presidential battleground, virtually all in-person voters use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. The machines then print a paper ballot with a human-readable summary of the voter's selections and a QR code, a type of barcode that is read by a scanner to count the votes.

It is not entirely clear how the executive order would affect Georgia and other jurisdictions throughout the country that use these machines.

Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. The Georgia Legislature last year passed a law requiring that QR codes be removed from ballots by July 2026.

The order cracks down on foreign nationals contributing or donating in U.S. elections. It's an issue that's been bubbling in recent years in the states, as Republicans seek to dampen the influence of Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss.

Wyss, who lives in Wyoming, has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to 501(c) nonprofit organizations that support liberal causes. One of those groups, the Sixteen Thirty Fund, donated a combined $3.9 million to enshrine abortion protections in the Ohio Constitution. It also helped thwart a proposed constitutional amendment advanced by Ohio Republicans the previous summer that would have made passing future constitutional amendments harder.

During the run-up to last year's presidential election, legislative Republicans linked then-President Joe Biden's appearance on Ohio's fall ballot to passing a ban on contributions from foreign individuals, companies, governments or political parties to campaigns for or against proposed amendments to the state constitution.

Other states have followed suit, most recently Kansas — which passed a nearly identical bill earlier this month after hearing testimony from Ohio's secretary of state. Like the Ohio bill, it appears partly a response to a successful campaign to protect abortion rights in Kansas, which received money from the Sixteen Thirty Fund. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly has not said publicly whether she'll sign it.

The federal government plays a fairly limited role in American elections. Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution gives states the authority to determine the “times, places and manner” of how elections are run. The so-called “Elections Clause” doesn't get into the specifics of voting or ballot-counting procedures -– those details are left to the states – but it does give Congress the power to “make or alter” election regulations, at least for federal office.

It does not mention any role for the president or the executive branch in regulating elections. Biden issued an executive order in 2021 directing federal agencies to take steps to promote voting access, but Republicans at the time argued that the order was unconstitutional and exceeded the president's authority. Trump rescinded the Biden order earlier this year.

“A president does not set election law and never will,” said Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, a grassroots advocacy organization that supports expanded voter access.

Sophia Lin Lakin, the director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, called core parts of the executive order “a blatant overreach that threatens to disenfranchise tens of millions of eligible voters.”

Given the nation's long history of decentralized, state-run elections, any attempt to change state election laws by executive order is likely to face challenges in court. Marc Elias, a leading Democratic election and voting rights attorney, promised exactly that.

“Moments ago, Donald Trump signed a massive voter suppression executive order,"" he said in a social media post. ""This will not stand. We will sue.”

Ultimately, the courts will decide how far Trump can go in overhauling election procedures.

By Raphael Satter

WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -The best-known member of Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE Service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.

Edward Coristine is among the most visible members of the DOGE effort that has been given sweeping access to official networks as it attempts to radically downsize the U.S. government.

Past reporting had focused on his youth - he is 19 - and his chosen nickname of ""bigballs,"" which became a pop culture punchline. Musk has championed the teen on his social media site X, telling his followers last month that ""Big Balls is awesome.""

Beginning around 2022, while still in high school, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, according to corporate and digital records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with half a dozen former associates. Among its users was a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name ""EGodly,"" according to digital records preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools and the online cybersecurity tool Any.Run.

The details of Coristine's connection to EGodly have not been previously reported.

On Feb. 15, 2023, EGodly thanked Coristine's company for its assistance in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

""We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website,"" the message said.

The digital records reviewed by Reuters showed the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was tied to internet protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other Coristine-owned entities between October 2022 and June 2023, and that some users attempting to access the site around that time would hit a DiamondCDN ""Security check.""

Coristine did not return messages seeking comment. Musk's team, which has adopted the name ""Department of Government Efficiency"" though it is not an official government department, did not respond to emails about Coristine. He is listed as a ""senior adviser"" at the State Department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to one official at each agency who told Reuters they had seen his name in their respective agencies' staff directory.

On LinkedIn, Coristine describes himself as a ""Volunteer (Intern) Plumber"" with the U.S. government.

The State Department did not return messages asking about Coristine. CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.

EGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for the past year; attempts to elicit comment from eight people who participated in or interacted with EGodly were unsuccessful.

'THESE ARE BAD FOLKS'

DiamondCDN's website - CDN typically stands for ""content delivery network"" - was registered in mid-2022, according to records collected by DomainTools. It pitched itself as offering ""excellent security tools"" that would help ""lower your infrastructure costs,"" according to copies of the site maintained by the Internet Archive. The site said the company ""has no business inspecting user content.""

In 2023, EGodly boasted on its Telegram channel of hijacking phone numbers, breaking into unspecified law enforcement email accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and cryptocurrency theft. Early that year, the group distributed the personal details of an FBI agent who they said was investigating them, circulating his phone number, photographs of his house, and other private details on Telegram.

EGodly also posted an audio recording of an obscene prank call made to the agent's phone and a video, shot from the inside of a car, of an unknown party driving by the agent's house in Wilmington, Delaware at night and screaming out the window, ""EGodly says you're a bitch!""

Reuters could not independently verify EGodly's boasts of cybercriminal activity, including its claims to have hijacked phone numbers or infiltrated law enforcement emails. But it was able to authenticate the video by visiting the same Wilmington address and comparing the building to the one in the footage.

The FBI agent targeted by EGodly, who is now retired, told Reuters that the group had drawn law enforcement attention because of its connection to swatting, the dangerous practice of making hoax emergency calls to send armed officers swarming targeted addresses. The agent didn't go into detail. Reuters is not identifying him out of concern for further harassment.

""These are bad folks,"" the former agent said. ""They're not a pleasant group.""

He declined to comment further about the harassment or whether EGodly had been or still was the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI didn't return messages seeking comment on EGodly.

Reuters was not able to ascertain how long EGodly used DiamondCDN, or whether EGodly paid Coristine's company. Archived copies of DiamondCDN's website said the firm envisioned having both paying and nonpaying customers.

Another individual who has been subject to abuse from EGodly and a cybercrime researcher who has followed the group said it was composed of hardened fraudsters, citing the group's makeup and the credibility of its claims. Both asked not to be identified, citing fears of retaliation.

Even if the connection between Coristine and EGodly were fleeting, Nitin Natarajan, who served as the deputy director of CISA under former President Joe Biden, told Reuters it was worrying that someone who provided services to EGodly only two years ago was part of a group that has gained wide access to government networks.

""This stuff was not in the distant past,"" he said. ""The recency of the activity and the types of groups he was associated would definitely be concerning.""

Rep. Lauren Boebert has hinted that the Trump administration is working behind the scenes on a plan to rename Washington, D.C., the “District of America.”

“I would caution my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to refrain from making fun of the ‘Gulf of America' because next up, you know it may end up being the ‘District of America' that we're working on,” Boebert told lawmakers during a Water, Fisheries and Wildlife Subcommittee hearing Tuesday in response to jibes from opposition members.

“So just, you know, keep the jokes at bay, and maybe we'll just stick with the Gulf of America for now.”

President Donald Trump took bold action on his first day in office after he signed an executive bill that ordered the renaming of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.”

Earlier on in the hearing, Rep. Jared Huffman, a California Democrat, brought up the contentious issue of renaming the water basin. He began by stating: “Now, back to the Gulf of America. Stephen Colbert proposed this as a joke in 2010, and it's important to remember what was going on at the time – what led to the joke.”

Huffman went on to explain that the late-night show host first made the “Gulf of America” suggestion in relation to the catastrophic BP Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

The roughly 4.9-million-barrel spill caused widespread environmental devastation in the Gulf region, claimed 11 lives, and devasted the coastal economy.

“Colbert used the name change as a gimmick to raise awareness of the disaster. It dragged on for five months – something our Republican friends seem to have forgotten about as they advance to a dirty drilling agenda,” Huffman continued.

“My entire career has been centered around natural resources,” Huffman told reporters in December 2024 upon being re-elected.

Boebert, a MAGA loyalist who has made a determined effort to advance President Trump's agenda – including his “Drill Baby Drill” pledge and the suggestion to place Trump's face on a $100 bill.

Danish officials appear relieved after Vice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance changed their Greenland visit itinerary, which had sparked anger among residents.

The couple, joined by national security adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, will visit the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland. The Second Lady was initially scheduled for a solo trip to Greenland's capital, Nuuk, and the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.

The visit comes after President Donald Trump reiterated his desire for the U.S. to obtain Greenland, claiming earlier this week that the territory is important for national security.

The itinerary change keeps the group away from highly-populated areas and reduces the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents protesting the Trump administration's attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster DR Wednesday that the Vances' updated travel plans are a good thing, calling it a de-escalation.

Anne Merrild, a professor and Arctic expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders.

Still, Merrild said, even a visit to the space base shows that the U.S. administration still considers annexing Greenland to be on the table.

“It's a signal to the whole world, it's a strong signal to Denmark, it's a signal to Greenland,” she said. “And of course it's also an internal signal to the U.S., that this is something that we're pursuing.”

The original itinerary was viewed as controversial because Greenland doesn't currently have a government after holding elections earlier this month, according to Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College.

“Greenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don't want the U.S. to visit right now, when Greenland doesn't have a government in place,” Jacobsen said.

Trump's oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., visited Greenland in January, arriving on Trump Force One just weeks before his father took office.

Trump Jr. posted a video of himself there on Instagram, posing beneath a statue of the Lutheran missionary Hans Egede who is credited with first settling the barren territory in 1721 before spinning his phone camera around to showcase the “incredible scenery.”

Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk also turned out to be among his entourage.

After the visit, Pipaluk Lynge, an MP from Greenland's largest party and chair of the parliamentary foreign and security policy committee, said the whole event was “staged.” A spokesperson for Trump Jr. denied this.

Danish MP Rasmus Jarlov wasn't happy with the visit, writing on X: “This level of disrespect from the coming US president towards very, very loyal allies and friends is record-setting.”

Scientists have discovered a “blueprint” for long life by decoding the genome, gut health and lifestyle of the world's oldest person who died last year at 117.

Maria Branyas Morera, an American-Catalan Caucasian woman, was born in March 1907 in San Francisco, US, and died in August 2024.

While centenarians are becoming more common thanks to advances in health care, supercentenarians aged over 110 are still extremely rare.

Morera exceeded the average life expectancy of Catalonia, Spain, by over 30 years. She attributed her longevity to “luck and good genetics” and to “avoiding toxic people”.

A yet-to-be peer-reviewed study analysed her genes, microbiome and lifestyle to find the cells in her body functioned as if they were 17 years younger than her actual age. And her gut health was extremely youthful, resembling that of a child.

For the new study, researchers developed a comprehensive analysis platform to assess different tissues of Morera for the activity of her genome and proteins as well as microbes living on them.

They compared the results with data from non-supercentenarian populations. Scientists found the supercentenarian's genome likely contained variations linked to a stronger immune system, reduced cancer risk and protection from heart disease.

They particularly probed a type of genome activity modification that happens normally in the body called DNA methylation, which has been linked in previous studies to ageing.

“DNA methylation is probably the most studied epigenetic mark in cell biology and disease, being also disrupted as we age,” the study noted.

In this measure, Morera was “an outlier”, exhibiting a “much younger biological age than her real chronological age” across three different tissues.

Morera also appeared to have an efficient lipid metabolism with low levels of VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides, which are linked to heart disease.

“Overall, these data suggest that one of the reasons that our supercentenarian reached such a world record age was that her cells ‘felt' or ‘behaved' as younger cells, with a biological age of a centenarian,” the study noted.

She had a healthy gut with what researchers described as an “anti-inflammatory” microbiome.

Morera's gut was rich in Bifidobacterium, a type of bacteria known for its anti-inflammatory properties. “Microorganisms are critical in determining not only the metabolite composition of our body, but also inflammation, intestinal permeability, cognition, and bone and muscle health,” researchers explained.

However, the exact link between the community of microbes living in one's body and longevity remains unclear.

Morera had said she avoided alcohol and smoking, enjoyed daily walks, and followed a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, along with three yoghurts a day.

A growing body of research has found links between a high-fibre and probiotic-rich Mediterranean diet to a healthy gut.

“The picture that emerges from our study shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked,” the study concluded.

A woman accusing French actor Gerard Depardieu of sexual assault told a landmark trial in Paris that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set.

Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of Les Volets Verts (The Green Shutters).

He denies any sexual assault.

Day three of the Paris trial focused on the evidence of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.

“Out of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,” she said, adding she was “under shock”, “petrified”, and said nothing.

In a second incident, she said Depardieu suddenly put both his hands on her breasts: “I said no, I was scared.”

She also described telling Depardieu “no” during a third similar incident.

The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.

Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations on Wednesday in court, saying: “I'm not like that.”

“I think that maybe, I don't know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,” Depardieu said.

“But I'm not only that.

“I still respect people.”

The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his bodyguard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.

On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualised language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault.

He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behaviour was sexual.

Neither women has consented to be identified in this case.

The four-day trial was to continue Thursday, with the verdict expected at a later date.

The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros (81,000 US dollars) if convicted.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

A panel of justices on Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former president Jair Bolsonaro to stand trial over an alleged attempt to stay in office after his 2022 election defeat.

All five justices ruled in favour of accepting the charges levelled by prosecutor-general Paulo Gonet, who accused Bolsonaro and 33 others of attempting a coup that included a plan to poison his successor, current President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and kill a Supreme Court judge.

The justices said seven close allies should also stand trial on five counts: attempting to stage a coup, involvement in an armed criminal organisation, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, damage characterised by violence and a serious threat against the state's assets, and deterioration of listed heritage.

The former president has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and says he is being politically persecuted.

Under Brazilian law, a coup conviction carries a sentence of up to 12 years. Combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars.

“Coups kill,” Justice Flavio Dino said when casting his vote. “It doesn't matter if it happens today, the following month or a few years later.”

Mr Gonet on Tuesday said those facing the charges sought to maintain Bolsonaro in power “at all costs” in a multi-step scheme that accelerated after the far-right politician lost to the current president.

As in his February indictment, Mr Gonet said part of the plot included a plan to kill Mr Lula and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who were put under surveillance by the alleged conspirators.

The plan did not go ahead because at the last minute the accused failed to get the army's commander on board, Mr Gonet said.

“Frustration overwhelmed the members of the criminal organisation who, however, did not give up on the violent seizure of power, not even after the elected president of the republic was sworn in,” the prosecutor said.

That was a reference to the riot on January 8 2023 when Bolsonaro supporters stormed and trashed the Supreme Court, presidential palace and Congress in Brasilia a week after Mr Lula took office.

Bolsonaro's running mate during the 2022 election and former Defense Minister Walter Braga Netto, ex-Justice Minister Anderson Torres and his aide-de-camp Mauro Cid, among others, will also stand trial. The court will decide on the fate of the others later.

Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of breaking the terms of a tentative US brokered deal to pause strikes on energy infrastructure, underscoring the challenges on negotiating a broader peace.

Russia's Defence Ministry said Ukrainian drone attacks hit an electric facility in the Bryansk region early on Wednesday and a power grid facility in the Kursk region on Tuesday, leading to a power cut affecting thousands of people.

“The Kyiv regime is doing everything to derail the Russian-US agreements on the gradual settlement of the Ukrainian conflict,” the ministry said on Wednesday.

Ukraine's General Staff denied the allegations, saying Moscow's claims were part of a broader disinformation campaign aimed at justifying continued hostilities.

The accusations came hours after Washington announced it had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine and Russia to pause attacks on energy sites as well as taking steps to ensure safe navigation for ships in the Black Sea.

The deal followed three days of separate US-Ukrainian and US-Russian talks in the Saudi capital.

The talks were part of efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to implement a limited, 30-day ceasefire that Moscow and Kyiv agreed to in principle last week. That has so far failed to materialise as both sides continue to launch drone and rocket attacks.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Tuesday that Kyiv had agreed with US negotiators in Riyadh “that a ceasefire for energy infrastructure can start today”, and expressed his country's willingness to comply with the agreement while warning Russia would face “strong retaliation” if it attacked Ukrainian energy facilities.

Ukrainian officials have contested claims by the Kremlin that Russian forces have not attacked energy sites in Ukraine since March 18. Mr Zelensky's communications adviser Dmytro Lytvyn said Moscow was “lying” about observing a ceasefire on energy infrastructure.

“They've been hitting our energy sites with bombs, attack drones and FPV drones. We're not going into all the details, but there have already been eight confirmed hits on energy facilities,” he wrote.

“Every night our air defence forces shoot down nearly a hundred attack drones – and many of those drones were likely targeting other energy facilities.”

On Tuesday, the White House said in separate statements that the sides had “agreed to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea”.

Details of the prospective deal were not released, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the UN and Turkey but was halted by Russia the next year.

After the White House issued its statement, the Kremlin warned that a potential Black Sea deal could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial organisations involved in food and fertiliser trade are lifted and their access to the Swift system of international payments is ensured.

Mr Zelensky described the demands as an example of Moscow “manipulating, twisting agreements and lying” about the terms of the agreement.

“There are absolutely clear statements that have been published by the White House, everyone can see what is stated there,” he said. “And there is something that the Kremlin is lying about again: that supposedly the (ceasefire) in the Black Sea depends on the issue of sanctions.”

In an apparent reference to Moscow's demands, the White House said on Tuesday that the US “will help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions”.

Asked about when Washington might help Moscow achieve those ambitions, Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said on Wednesday that contacts between Russia and the US “continue quite intensively” and that authorities are “satisfied with how pragmatic, constructive and productive our dialogue is”.

Meanwhile, Kryvyi Rih, Mr Zelensky's home town, came under the “most massive kamikaze drone attack since the beginning of the war” on Tuesday night, said the city administration head, Oleksandr Vilkul.

Although no one was killed or injured, civilian infrastructure including warehouses, an administration building and a fire station were widely targeted, he added. Multiple fires were sparked across the city, he said.

“Everyone is alive, thank God. It's truly a miracle. The destruction is significant,” Mr Vilkul said.

Civilian infrastructure also came under strike in the Sumy, Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions, local authorities said.

Greenland and Denmark appeared cautiously relieved by the news that US Vice President JD Vance and his wife are changing their itinerary for their visit to Greenland, reducing the likelihood that they will cross paths with residents angered by the Trump administration's attempts to annex the vast Arctic island, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.

The couple will now visit the US Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, instead of Usha Vance's previously announced solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut.

President Donald Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of Denmark, a US ally and Nato member.

As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.

The vice president's decision to visit a US military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation.

Yet Mr Vance has also criticised longstanding European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonising partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the US.

Danish foreign minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told Danish broadcaster DR Wednesday that the Vances' updated travel plans are a good thing.

The minister said the change was a deescalation, even as he said the Americans are treating it as the opposite, with Mr Vance suggesting in an online video that global security is at stake.

Rasmus Jarlov, a Danish politician and spokesman on Greenlandic Affairs for the Conservatives, wrote on X that the new schedule means the Vances will avoid any confrontations with Greenlanders.

Mr Jarlov noted that, after all, a vice president visiting an American military base is not controversial.

Mr Vance is allowed to visit the space base, said Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College, because of a 1951 agreement between Denmark and the US regarding the defence of Greenland.

“What is controversial here is all about the timing,” he said.

“Greenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don't want the US to visit right now, when Greenland doesn't have a government in place,” following the election earlier this month.

Coalition negotiations are ongoing.

Ahead of the vice president's announcement that he would join his wife, discontent from the governments of Greenland and Denmark had been growing sharper, with the Greenland government posting on Facebook Monday night that it had “not extended any invitations for any visits, neither private nor official”.

Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish national broadcasts Tuesday that the visit was “unacceptable pressure”, while the Danish foreign ministry said it was not involved in the planning.

Usha Vance's office said on Sunday that she would depart on Thursday for Greenland and return on Saturday.

She and one of the couple's three children had planned to visit historic sites and learn about Greenland's culture, but her husband's participation has reoriented the trip around national security, her office said.

The vice president said he did not want to let his wife “have all that fun by herself” and said he plans to visit the Space Force.

Mr Vance said that other countries have threatened Greenland as well as menacing the United States and Canada

Mr Vance said leaders in Denmark and North America had “ignored” Greenland for “far too long”.

During his first term, Mr Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world's largest island, even as Denmark insisted it was not for sale.

The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Mr Trump's plans.

Dwayne Ryan Menezes, founder and managing director of the Polar Research & Policy Initiative, said that the Trump administration's “intimidation” of Greenland could backfire.

Mr Menezes said if Trump was “smart enough” to understand Greenland's strategic importance, then he should also be “smart enough to know there is no greater way to weaken America's hand and hurt its long-term interests than turning its back on its allies, the principal asymmetrical advantage it enjoys over its adversaries”.

Mr Trump's return to the White House has included a desire for territorial expansion, as he seeks to add Canada as a 51st state and resume US control of the Panama Canal.

He has also indicated that US interests could take over the land in the war-torn Gaza Strip and convert it into a luxury outpost, displacing up to two million Palestinians.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Thousands of Palestinians have marched between the wreckage of a heavily destroyed town in northern Gaza in the second day of anti-war protests, with many chanting against Hamas in a rare display of public anger against the militant group.

The protests, which centred mainly on Gaza's north, appeared to be aimed generally against the war, with protesters calling for an end to 17 months of deadly fighting with Israel.

But the public calls against Hamas, which has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory months into the war with Israel, were rare.

In the town of Beit Lahiya, where a similar protest took place on Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated, with many chanting “the people want the fall of Hamas”.

In the hard-hit Shijaiyah neighbourhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted: “Out, out, out! Hamas get out!”

“Our children have been killed. Our houses have been destroyed,” said Abed Radwan, who said he joined the protest in Beit Lahiya “against the war, against Hamas, and the (Palestinian political) factions, against Israel and against the world's silence”.

Ammar Hassan, who took part in a protest on Tuesday, said it started as an anti-war protest with a few dozen people but swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.

“It's the only party we can affect,” he said. “Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but it can affect Hamas.”

The militant group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed its war.

Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said people have the right to protest but their focus should be on the “criminal aggressor”, Israel.

Family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's renewed offensive and its tightened blockade on all supplies into Gaza. Their statement said the community fully supports armed resistance against Israel.

“The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,” said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father of three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined a demonstration on Tuesday.

“We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,” he said.

A similar protest occurred in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to witnesses.

One protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they joined the demonstration because “everyone failed us”.

They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the western-backed Palestinian Authority and Arab mediators. They said there were no Hamas security forces at the protest but scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the group.

Later, they said they regretted participating because of Israeli media coverage, which emphasised the opposition to Hamas.

Israeli defense minister Israel Katz urged Palestinians to join the protests, saying: “You too should demand the removal of Hamas from Gaza and the immediate release of all Israeli hostages. That is the only way to stop the war.”

A 19-year-old Palestinian, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said he planned to join demonstrations on Wednesday.

“People are angry at the whole world,” including the United States, Israel and Hamas, he said. “We want Hamas to resolve this situation, return the hostages and end this whole thing.”

The protests erupted a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly two million Palestinians.

Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever were ravaging the country's southern regions, killing 24 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 residents to evacuate, officials said.

The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain wildfires in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas.

The aircraft had no other crew members.

The National Fire Agency said at least 26 other people sustained varying degrees of injuries.

An ancient Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 43,330 acres (17,535 hectares), the government's emergency response centre said.

In a televised address, South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were the worst so far.

“Damages are snowballing,” Mr Han said.

“There are concerns that we'll have wildfire damages that we've never experienced, so we have to concentrate all our capabilities to put out the wildfires in the rest of this week.”

Mr Han said crews were struggling to extinguish the wildfires because strong winds swept the areas overnight.

Mr Han said about 4,650 firefighters, soldiers and other personnel were working Wednesday with the help of about 130 helicopters.

He said that “a small amount” of rain was expected on Thursday.

As of Wednesday evening, firefighters were fighting at least four active wildfires, including in the southeastern coastal town of Yeongdeok, which alerted residents of the nearest village to evacuate to an indoor gymnasium.

Strong winds and smoke-filled skies forced authorities in the southeastern city of Andong to order evacuations in two villages, including Puncheon, which is home to the Hahoe folk village, a Unesco World Heritage Site founded around the 14th-15th century.

Hikers were advised to leave the scenic Jirisan Mountain, one of the country's largest national parks, as another fire spread closer.

Observers say the ongoing wildfires are the third biggest in South Korea in terms of land burned.

The largest fires were in Andong, the neighbouring counties of Uiseong and Sancheong, and the city of Ulsan.

On Tuesday, officials said firefighters had extinguished most of the flames from the largest wildfires in those areas, but wind and dry conditions allowed them to spread again.

The blaze in Uiseong destroyed nearly half of more than 30 structures at Gounsa, a temple which was said to be originally built in the seventh century.

Among the burned structures were two state-designated “treasures”, a pavilion-shaped building erected on a stream in 1668, and a Joseon Dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.

The another state-designated “treasure”, a stone Buddha statue reportedly manufactured in the eighth century, was moved to a safe place, according to government and Buddhist officials.

The Justice Ministry said it protectively removed 500 inmates from a detention centre in Cheongsong, another southern town, but no damages were reported to the facility.

The Korea Forest Service said it had raised its wildfire warning to the highest level nationwide, requiring local governments to assign more workers to emergency response, tighten entry restrictions for forests and parks, and recommend that military units withhold live-fire exercises.

The 18 dead include four firefighters and government workers who died in Sancheong on Saturday after being trapped by fast-moving flames driven by strong winds, according to officials.

Government officials suspect human error caused several of the fires, possibly due to the use of fire while clearing overgrown grass in family tombs or sparks from welding work.

Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever have ravaged the country's southern regions, killing 24 people, destroying more than 300 structures and forcing 28,800 residents to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.  The death toll included a pilot who died after a helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a blaze in the southeastern town of Uiseong, one of the hardest-hit areas.  The National Fire Agency said at least 26 people sustained varying degrees of injuries.

Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever were ravaging the country's southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.  A 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple, houses, factories and vehicles were among the structures destroyed in the wildfires that have burned 43,330 acres and injured 19 people, the government's emergency response center said.  In a televised address, South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo said the wildfires that began last Friday were causing worse damage than many other past wildfires.

Wildfires in South Korea destroyed nearly half of more than 30 structures at an ancient temple. The wind-driven blazes ravaging the country's southern regions have killed 18 people, destroyed more than 200 structures and forced 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said Wednesday.

Government officials say they suspect that several of the recent wildfires were caused by human error.

France and Indonesia 's top diplomats on Wednesday signed an agreement for a maritime security project aiming “to ensure peace and safety” at sea in the Indo-Pacific region.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot's visit to Jakarta, his second stop in his four-day Asia tour after Singapore, comes amid ongoing trade tensions between the European Union and Beijing.

Antibodies taken from alpacas are to be used in a new pandemic flu drug, in a £33 million project led by AstraZeneca.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a number of conditions must be met before a Black Sea maritime security deal negotiated with the United States can be activated, pointing to an earlier agreement which it said saw Moscow's needs ignored.  The United States reached separate deals on Tuesday with Ukraine and Russia to cease fighting in the Black Sea and pause attacks against energy targets, with Washington agreeing to push to lift some sanctions against Moscow.  While Russian exports of food and fertiliser are not subject to Western sanctions, Moscow has said restrictions on payments, logistics and insurance have amounted to a barrier to shipments.

            For Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other House Republicans, today's DOGE subcommittee hearing is about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding.
    


            For the broadcasters, today is about defending their existence – and maybe, just maybe, educating people about how public media actually works.
    


            What will win the day? National political noise or local media impact?
    


            The hearing, titled “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,” started at 10 a.m. ET. NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger are both testifying. So are a local station operator and a conservative critic of taxpayer-funded media.
    


            The hearing is meant to advance long-held Republican arguments against PBS and NPR.
    


            Taylor-Greene opened Wednesday's DOGE subcommittee by branding PBS and NPR “radical left-wing echo chambers” before accusing the public broadcasters of “grooming and sexualizing” children, using DEI for news standards and listener demographics, and wasting taxpayer dollars.
    


            “For too long, taxpayers have been asked to fund biased news. this needs to end, and it needs to end now,” Taylor-Greene said as in her opening remarks.
    


            President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the networks are a “waste of money” and claimed “he would love to” defund them. And yet the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this month included $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations.
    


            Congress budgets money for CPB two years in advance, so the recent bill means public broadcasting is funded through 2027.
    


            So on one level, today's hearing is a theatrical performance. But PBS and NPR leaders are taking it seriously. They have been preparing for the Republican interrogation for weeks. And they want to use the opportunity to justify the federal funding.
    


            Local TV and radio stations are doing the same. From North Country Public Radio in upstate New York, to New Mexico PBS in Albuquerque, to Hawaiʻi Public Radio in Honolulu, publicly supported stations are using the right's political attacks to galvanize grassroots support and raise money from donors.
    


            This is a “a critical moment for KQED,” an email from the SF radio station said yesterday. DOGE has “set its sights on public media,” an article from Rocky Mountain PBS explained. “Our future is in peril,” a letter from WBUR in Boston exclaimed.
    


            WBUR CEO Margaret Low wrote that the political threats – including the FCC chair's probe of PBS and NPR sponsorship practices – compound the “business model challenges that just about every news organization faces.” It's fundraising drive season, so her letter understandably urged supporters to donate.
    


            The letters and Q&As have had common themes: Explaining how taxpayer money trickles down to broadcasters and emphasizing the local benefits. Hawaiʻi Public Radio CEO Meredith Artley, the former editor in chief of CNN Digital, wrote that her news and classical music stations are “94% community supported,” with the remaining 6% coming from CPB.
    


            If the federal funds were diminished, the Hawaii stations would survive, but “there would likely be damage to the nationwide system that provides programming and infrastructure that HPR and many other stations rely on,” she wrote.
    


            That's the key point: It's a system. And smaller stations tend to need more help from the system. At KTOO Public Media in Alaska, for example, fully 30% of the budget comes from CPB. “This federal funding is essential in ensuring that Juneau's only local-owned newsroom can continue to deliver you the news from our community,” the station said.
    


            Stations large and small are highlighting their local responsibilities.
    


            “Whatever happens in Washington, DC—WQED is not going anywhere,” Jason Jedlinski, CEO of Pittsburgh's PBS station, wrote on LinkedIn. His post listed recent features (segments about a local farm, a reading club, and so on) that, quite frankly, few other media outlets would spend time on.
    


            At today's hearing, Republican lawmakers will bash national news controversies while the witnesses will pivot to the local impacts.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., calls for pulling money away from colleges that 'coddle' left-wing protesters who target Jewish Americans on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

FIRST ON FOX – Sen. Josh Hawley asked FBI Director Kash Patel Wednesday to look into alleged Biden-era abuses against Christians, urging Patel in a new letter to crack down on what the Missouri Republican described as First Amendment violations he said were carried out under the Biden administration.

In the letter, previewed exclusively by Fox News Digital, the Missouri Republican asked Patel to investigate alleged abuses against pro-life activists and Christians. He also urged Patel to release by April 30 information compiled by the FBI's Richmond, Virginia, field office – including a memo that labeled certain traditionalist Catholics as potential ""security risks"" – and to address possible violations of the FACE Act, which Hawley said targeted pro-life protesters.

""I trust that, under your leadership, this misconduct will end. But those responsible must be held accountable,"" Hawley said in the letter.

""Transparency and accountability will be paramount in restoring Americans' faith in the Bureau,"" he added. ""Getting to the bottom of the Biden Administration's violations of religious liberty is an excellent place to start.""

The letter from Hawley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, is not the first time he has used his post to urge Patel to protect against Christian persecution.

NATIONAL RELIGIOUS BROADCASTERS URGE FLORIDA LAWMAKERS TO KILL BILL TO AVOID ‘LAWFARE' AGAINST CHRISTIANS

Hawley's letter calls on the FBI to share with his office by the end of April a list of 22 memos and documents compiled by the FBI Richmond Field Office and related to the alleged FACE Act abuses, including all emails, memoranda, directives and policy guidance, sent to or from the FBI director, deputy director, or any other senior official regarding the enforcement of the FACE Act under the Biden Administration. 

Hawley also urged Patel to share all documents – including communications with state and local law enforcement agencies – that discuss how the Richmond Field Office memorandum or similar FBI policies were implemented or considered for enforcement at the state or local level.

Hawley zeroed in on these issues during Patel's confirmation hearing earlier this year.

""Do you think it's appropriate for the FBI to single out and target people of faith in order to discourage the exercise of their First Amendment rights?"" he asked Patel in January. 

Patel vowed in response that he would ""fully utilize, if confirmed, the investigative powers of the FBI to give you the information you require and also to hold those accountable who violated the sacred trust placed upon the FBI.""

Dollar Tree on Wednesday said it is selling Family Dollar for $1 billion to a pair of private equity firms, a decade after it bought the discount chain for more than $8 billion.

In a statement, Dollar Tree said private equity firms Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management will purchase Family Dollar, with the discount chain slated to remain headquartered in Chesapeake, Virginia. 

Although both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar cater to low-income shoppers, Family Dollar locations struggled to gain traction, prompting the parent company last year to announce plans to shutter about 1,000 locations. Family Dollar also faces fierce competition from Walmart and other large retailers, while a rat-infested warehouse spurred a slew of negative headlines. 

Dollar Tree has said that many Family Dollar customers were extremely price-conscious, while the chain was also hurt by rising shoplifting incidents, hurting its bottom line. 

""Dollar Tree has struggled for over a decade to make the business work,"" said Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData, in an email. ""Its efforts have been hampered by supply-chain issues, poor store locations, a proposition that isn't value-centric enough and a host of other operational problems.""

He added, ""Basically, Dollar Tree bit off far more than it could chew.""

Dollar Tree had for months been exploring strategic options for Family Dollar, and it said Wednesday that the sale will allow it to focus on its core business.

""This is a major milestone in our multi-year transformation journey to help us fully achieve our potential,"" Dollar Tree CEO Mike Creedon said in a statement. 

In recent months, Dollar Tree has had little room to maneuver, particularly in the months leading up to the sale. Americans have been tightened their spending, even at bargain chains, as consumer confidence in the economy slides.

Shares of Dollar Tree rose $2.11, or 3.1%, to $69.25 in premarket trading.

President Trump's nominee to run the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, faced questions about customer service, erroneous payments and concerns about potential interests in privatizing the agency during a Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday. 

Some Senators also tried to nail down Bisignano's stance on efforts by the Elon Musk-helmed Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) efforts to cut costs at the agency by firing workers and closing offices. They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information. 

Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.

""While Mr. Bisignano was the unconfirmed nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, he frequently spoke with senior SSA executives and was personally briefed on key SSA operations, personnel and management decisions,"" the letter from the former SSA employee claimed. 

Under questioning by Wyden, Bisignano said during the hearing that he had not, between the time he was nominated in December and Tuesday, March 25, been involved in discussions with DOGE.

The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.

Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.  

Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020. 

Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.

In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits. 

""The objective isn't to touch benefits,"" Bisignano told CNBC. ""The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,"" adding that he views himself as ""fundamentally a DOGE person.""

During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is ""five decimal places too high."" He added that he plans to ""focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down."" 

Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency. 

""My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,"" Bisignano said in response to questioning.

Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner. 

The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.

A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.

When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would ""lock DOGE out of databases"" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information ""will not be exposed.""

""I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,"" he said.

Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in ""tech bros and private equity folks"" to ""save"" it.

Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that ""my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.""

""I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,"" Mr. Bisignano said. 

Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.

Lunch Break: The Atlantic Has Receipts

Andrew Harnik|Getty Images

National security adviser Michael Waltz, left, Vice President JD Vance, center, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office on March 13.

There's an old saying somewhere: ‘Don't poke the bear if the bear has the receipts.'

And after the Trump administration spent much of yesterday insisting the contents of the Signal group chat inadvertently leaked to an editor at The Atlantic were not classified, the outlet dropped the receipts, releasing a full, minimally redacted version of the messages this morning.

The release came just hours before Trump cabinet officials like Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel began their testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Some Democrats have begun calling for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation over Signalgate, and the rest of Washington – including President Donald Trump, who has a light public schedule again today – will be watching with bated breath to see what happens next.

Here's the lunchtime lowdown, which U.S. News will be publishing each weekday to keep track of the goings-on in Washington and beyond:

The Atlantic published the full text thread from the infamous group chat that detailed U.S. military strikes carried out against the Houthis in Yemen. In the newly public texts, Hegseth can be seen sharing extraordinary details like “Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,” and “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based' targets).” Read more.

Several members of Trump's national security team are facing the House Intelligence Committee today, including Gabbard, Patel and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, where they are being grilled on that group chat. Gabbard admitted that accidentally adding the reporter was a “mistake” but maintained that no classified information was compromised. Read more.

District Judge James Boasberg, who has drawn the Trump administration's ire for his handling of a lawsuit over deportation flights, was assigned a lawsuit over Signalgate this morning filed by watchdog group American Oversight. The organization's suit against Hegseth, Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and others argues their use of Signal violated federal record-keeping laws, as some of the messages were reportedly set to auto-delete, among other violations. Read more.

Chief executives from NPR and PBS are defending their funding and pushing back against accusations of bias in a heated congressional hearing today. At it, NPR's CEO and President Katherine Maher admitted she regretted calling Trump a “racist” and “sociopath” on social media in 2020, while PBS chief Paula Kerger defended the outlet's handling of a presidential debate and other coverage. Meanwhile, the director of Voice of America – another federally funded media outlet – filed a lawsuit today over its intended shuttering. Read more.

Democrats in Pennsylvania won a special election in state House race to ensure they keep majority control of the chamber by a single representative, and appeared to flip a state Senate race in a deep red district.The latter result was cheered by high-profile Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are eager for wins amid a Republican trifecta at the federal level. Read more.

Salt Lake City has become a thriving metropolis with a booming population and plenty of job opportunities in banking and tech.

Many residents, like former Gov. Michael Leavitt, point to the 2002 Winter Olympics as the catalyst for the city's transformation.  

""A lot of good things came together at the right time. We had a growing population. Tech was becoming — it was in its infancy and was expanding. A startup culture was important,"" Leavitt said. ""We were in the position to be able to educate a lot of engineers at the right time, and then to be able to close that in the art, in the brand of the Olympics, that was a good combination.""

Salt Lake City is also a major draw for finance, with one of the highest concentrations of industrial banks in the U.S.; 15 of the nation's 23 industrial banks are located in the county.

The metro's snow economy sets it apart from other cities and will once again help boost Salt Lake City's profile on an international stage when it hosts the Winter Olympic Games in 2034. 

Yet some real challenges are ahead. Climate change and a lack of diversity, for example, could affect the city's future.

Oops, something went wrong

Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell more than 5% on Wednesday as a new report suggested Chinese environmental rules could impact the AI giant's sales in China. The decline came amid a broader sell-off in tech stocks on fears of an escalating trade war.

Nvidia shares sank after the Financial Times reported Chinese regulators are encouraging firms to use data center chips that meet strict environmental requirements. The guidelines exclude Nvidia's H20 chip, its processor compatible with US export controls for the Chinese market.

In response to the report, a Nvidia spokesperson said, ""Our products provide superb energy efficiency and value in every market we serve. As technology moves rapidly, export control policy should be adjusted to allow U.S. firms to offer the most energy efficient products possible, while still achieving the Administration's national security goals.""

The report comes amid escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing after the US imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods since President Donald Trump took office. Export curbs on advanced semiconductor technologies have also been a sore point between the two countries.

Also on Wednesday, TD Cowen analysts said Microsoft (MSFT) canceled new data center projects in the US and Europe, a move that heightened investor fears that Big Tech may pull back on artificial intelligence spending.

However, the analysts said, ""Positively for third-party data center operators, our checks point to Google (GOOG) stepping into backfill capacity that Microsoft walked away from in international markets, while our checks point to Meta (META) backfilling capacity in the U.S.""

The analysis follows a note from TD Cowen in February stating Microsoft recently canceled an unspecified number of data center leases.

Nvidia led the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks lower on Wednesday, cutting short a recent rebound in the sector after the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) entered correction territory earlier this month.

Tech stocks have led a broader market sell-off this year as investors weigh the impact of the Trump administration's tariff policy on the economy.

Read more: How does Nvidia make money?

Fears of an overvaluation in the AI trade sent Nvidia tumbling in late January after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a chatbot, reportedly with fewer resources than its US rivals.

Renewed fears of an overextended AI trade surfaced earlier this month after chipmaker Marvell Technology's (MRVL) revenue outlook failed to impress investors, and semiconductor stocks fell.

Year to date, Nvidia is down roughly 15%.

Oops, something went wrong

Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter Tuesday to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick urging him to explain how the Trump administration plans to prevent companies from using tariffs as a cover to hike prices.

""Tariffs can be a strategic tool to grow American industry and good manufacturing jobs, but President Trump's across-the-board tariffs have been chaotic, not strategic,"" the Democratic lawmaker wrote in the letter reviewed by Yahoo Finance.

""I am deeply concerned that President Trump is now enabling this corporate greed, allowing companies to increase prices across the board, regardless of whether goods are actually subject to tariffs.""

Warren said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised this possibility during a press conference last Wednesday when he said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about whether the price changes would be ""transitory.""

Powell offered the example of washing machines that were hit with duties during Trump's first term. He noted that as prices on washing machines went up, so did prices on dryers, which had no new tariffs attached.

""Manufacturers just kind of followed the crowd and raised it. So, things happen very indirectly,"" Powell said.

The comments came after the Fed held interest rates steady Wednesday for the second meeting in a row and maintained a prior prediction for two rate cuts at some point this year.

What the central bank did change, however, was its outlook on inflation (higher) and economic growth (lower), with Powell saying that a driving reason for the change was uncertainty stemming from Trump's plans for an aggressive slate of new ""reciprocal"" tariffs on top of new duties already imposed on China, Canada, and Mexico.

""The reversal of progress on inflation is troubling,"" Warren said in her letter to Lutnick. ""I urge you to explain how you will prevent companies from using tariffs as cover to hike prices as Chair Powell has just warned,"" she added.

Top administration officials have argued that the tariffs will not be inflationary or would, at the most, be a one-time adjustment.

In a speech earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged the Fed to look at any tariff-related price hikes that way — while also digging the Fed for its handling of pandemic-era inflation it expected to be transitory but didn't turn out that way.

""I would hope that the failed 'team transitory' could get back together and think that nothing is more transitory than tariffs,"" Bessent said at the Economic Club of New York on March 6.

Last week on the ""All In"" podcast, Lutnick noted that ""inflation doesn't come from tariffs."" Instead, he added, it comes from ""printing more money.""

Warren in her Tuesday letter to Lutnick also posed a series of questions about the coming tariffs, asking if the Commerce Department had analyzed the impact to date that tariffs and tariff threats have had on prices and whether they are allowing corporations to pass unjustified price increases on to consumers.

Warren also asked what specific actions the president has taken with regard to tariffs that would limit companies' ability to pass on the costs of tariffs or impose other broad price increases on consumers.

""I have repeatedly called on [the president] to protect consumers from corporate price-gouging associated with tariffs,"" Warren said.

""Instead, he has made matters worse, simultaneously threatening to implement, implementing, and backing off of threats to implement his tariffs, disincentivizing the investments in American manufacturing that the tariffs are supposed to accelerate, while creating widespread confusion and uncertainty that may give big corporations cover to increase their prices on all goods.""

The chart of the day

What we're watching

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

Can a moonshot company escape its leader's political baggage? What if the company's success is in part bound up in that polarizing activity? Elon Musk is back in reassurance mode, professing his overarching vision and long-term goals for his car company that have little to do with car sales.

Tesla stock (TSLA) is up 25% over the past week, with the biggest boost coming after an all-hands meeting at the company that conveyed the sense that Musk is ""back in the building,"" with the CEO issuing a sermon to reassure his shareholding faithful.

Fast-tracking a private transportation transformation is at the heart of Musk's plans for Tesla. But dreams of a fleet of millions of robotaxis and thousands of humanoid robots are becoming much harder to sell when Musk is busy slashing through Washington instead of shepherding a volatile brand.

Gutting a social media company and remaking it in your own image doesn't have the same consequences as messing with the American social safety net. Trying to do to the federal government what Musk did to Twitter ended up tarnishing Tesla. Or, as Dan Ives, a prominent Tesla bull, put it, created “a brand tornado crisis moment.""

But hints of a comeback are already gathering. The company's most outspoken backers see Musk placing his DOGE duties in better balance with his corporate responsibilities. And a resurgence of retail investor interest piercing through the doldrums highlights a defining trait of the ticker: convincing people that big things are coming.

As Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote earlier this month in a note to clients, Tesla is a “faith-based” stock. While all equities generally move up and down according to people's belief in them, Tesla represents a pure example of faith investing because so much of its implied value is tied up in future endeavors. In Tesla's case, that means future earnings from robotaxis, not present and near-term earnings from cratering EV sales in the US, Europe, and now China.

Looking at the stock through that lens helps explain why flagging sales in its third-largest market barely register on the stock chart. This week's rally also coincided with some good news on tariffs, lifting the ""Magnificent Seven."" But Tesla's rise was particularly pronounced and continued Tuesday.

To say that investors aren't paying attention to Tesla's fundamentals isn't quite right, either. What Tesla bulls and more sympathetic observers are arguing is that its “fundamentals” are bound up in tomorrow's breakthroughs.

Take Cathie Wood, who told our colleagues why Tesla stock would be worth $2,600 — essentially adding a zero to the current level — within five years. That thesis is entirely underpinned by robotaxis, which Wood says will make up 90% of the company's value. If she's right, who cares about European sales?

It's easy to see how this kind of “faith-based” investing comes dangerously close to blind trust. For many, it truly is as simple as ""Musk, take the wheel."" And what critics view as a gimmick, the faithful instead grasp as Musk's track record of innovation. When the line goes up, it's hard to tell the difference. And maybe there isn't one.

Oops, something went wrong

A bankruptcy filing by personalized genomics firm 23andMe (ME) calls into question what happens to its most valuable asset: genetic data from 15 million customers.

""I think the law on that is pretty unclear at this point,"" said Jonathan Lipson, a bankruptcy law professor at Temple University's Beasley School of Law.

The murky legal ground sets up an uncertain future for 23andMe and its customers, especially those who want their DNA and other information obliterated from the records of a biotech company that once dazzled Silicon Valley.

The company built a following by asking customers to mail in their biological information through ""cheek swabs."" In exchange for a fee, customers received gene-based health indicators, ancestral histories, and subscription services that provided them with control over their data.

But under bankruptcy protection, a ""stay"" halts enforcement of all contractual obligations against the company. And its assets — potentially including customer biometric data — become the property of a bankruptcy estate that is legally protected from creditors.

Lipson expects 23andMe's managers to argue that certain customer data is not theirs to delete because the data belongs to the estate.

The managers, he said, are legally obligated to maximize the value of the remaining assets, which would involve retaining the data.

""While I don't know exactly what the legal characterization of this data is,"" Lipson said, ""I'm sure they're thinking about it.""

23andMe sent an email to customers assuring them that their data would remain protected during the bankruptcy.

""The Chapter 11 filing does not change how we store, manage, or protect customer data,"" the email said. Any buyer of the company, it added, would be required to comply with applicable law with respect to the treatment of customer data.

23andMe's instructions for account deletion can be found here.

Roughly 20 states, including California, Colorado, New Jersey, Texas, Virginia, Washington, Utah, and Connecticut, have adopted protections applying to biometric data, and most give consumers a right to delete their information.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta has warned 23andMe's California customers that they are legally entitled to scrub their genetic data from the company's systems, including their DNA, identity, and biological samples — the saliva test samples submitted to the company.

""Due to the trove of sensitive consumer data 23andMe has amassed ... Californians who want to invoke these rights can do so by going to 23andMe's website,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement that outlines the steps consumers can take.

""Given 23andMe's reported financial distress, I remind Californians to consider invoking their rights and directing 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any samples of genetic material held by the company,"" Bonta said.

Daniel Gielchinsky, a partner and co-founder of DGIM Law, said the unfortunate reality is that the ""more customers who go and scrub their data ... the less value this entity has as a going concern,"" noting that the company's value resides in its data.

The stock of 23andMe fell more than 11% Tuesday after dropping 59% on Monday.

The company's bankruptcy petition seeks court authorization to pursue a structured sale of its assets through an auction. The filing reported $277 million in assets as of the end of 2024 and debts of $215 million.

The 23andMe board has rejected a nonbinding acquisition offer from co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki, who stepped down on Friday. Wojcicki has been trying to take the company private since April.

Even if 23andMe's managers were to push the bankruptcy court to free it from its consumer agreements, the company would still need to abide by state laws. And customers in states that have adopted biometric data privacy laws are in the best position to control their data, said Ryan Sulkin, a data protection attorney at Benesch.

However, Lipson cautioned that there's some uncertainty about how the bankruptcy court would apply its federal authority to administer the sale of the estate.

A major factor likely to influence the fate of customers' data is whether the US Justice Department or the US Federal Trade Commission takes an interest in the bankruptcy proceedings.

""I would expect the Federal Trade Commission to have a voice at the table here,"" Sulkin said.

And Sulkin suspects that only certain buyers would satisfy US national security interests in a transition of 23andMe's troves of personal genetic data.

""Does this entity need to be solely owned by US interests?"" he asked. If so, he said, ""then you start getting into a TikTok scenario,"" referring to a law passed last year by Congress banning the social media app unless it finds a buyer for its US operations.

One hope for customers worried about the safety of their data is that bankruptcy courts are accustomed to protecting individual healthcare records in proceedings involving hospitals or doctors' practices. Typically, courts appoint a healthcare ombudsman to ensure patients continue to receive ongoing care.

But 23andMe falls into a gray area because its customers are not technically patients, and protecting healthcare information is tangential to the ombudsman role.

""So it's not quite a perfect fit for this situation,"" Gielchinsky said. ""It's going to be an ongoing conversation between the creditors, the debtor, and the court about how best to protect customer data while still allowing there to be a competitive auction process.""

23andMe's consumer notice says that in the event of a sale, customer data would ""remain protected under the current 23andMe Privacy Policy, unless and until they are presented with materially new terms."" Notice of such a change, it says, would be made ""as required by law.""

Oops, something went wrong

GameStop (GME) stock rose nearly 15% on Wednesday as the company approved a plan to buy bitcoin (BTC-USD) with its cash holdings.

The video game operator turned popular meme stock said in a release on Tuesday that its board ""has unanimously approved an update to its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.""

The announcement comes about a month after CNBC reported GameStop was exploring cryptocurrency investments. On Feb. 8, a social media post from GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen sparked speculation over GameStop's interest in cryptocurrency. Cohen posted a picture on X with Strategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who has famously hitched his company to bitcoin. It now holds more than 447,000 tokens, per a February filing.

The strategy has worked out well for Saylor's company, with the stock up over 84% in the past year amid a rise in the price of bitcoin. But Wall Street strategists are hesitant to conclude that GameStop investing in bitcoin would mean the video game retailer's stock has upside.

""The company's strategy, which has changed about six times in three years, is they're going to buy cryptocurrency and be just like MicroStrategy,"" Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance on Monday ahead of the earnings release. 

He added, ""The problem with that thinking is MicroStrategy trades at about two times their bitcoin holdings. If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their $4.6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings,] the stock would drop five bucks.""

Also after the bell on Tuesday, GameStop reported fourth quarter earnings results. The company posted $1.28 billion in net sales for the quarter, marking a 28% decline from the year-earlier period. For the full year, GameStop reported an adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million, down from $64.7 million seen the year prior.

	The gene-edited organ was hooked up inside the body of a brain-dead recipient 

This genetically modified miniature pig served as a liver donor for a brain-dead human recipient.

K-S Tao et al./Nature 2025

By Meghan Rosen

57 minutes ago

Surgeons have now published the first report of a gene-edited pig liver transplanted into a person.

The liver, which came from a genetically modified pig, appeared to stay active, producing bile and liver proteins inside the brain-dead transplant recipient, researchers report March 26 in Nature.

Such a transplant could one day buy time for people waiting on the liver transplant list. Doctors could potentially use the pig liver as bridge until a human liver is available or the patient's liver has recovered, Lin Wang, a surgeon at Xijing hospital in Xi-an, China, said in a March 25 news briefing. “It is our dream to achieve this,” he said. Earlier this year his team also performed a different pig-to-human liver transplant, though the results from that surgery have not yet been published. 

The feats are the latest in a string of advances in xenotransplantation, the transfer of living organs or tissues from one species into another. Doctors have already seen success with pig kidneys and hearts. One woman, a 53-year-old from Alabama, received a gene-edited kidney in November and is still doing well more than 100 days after her surgery. And in February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave two companies the green light to begin clinical trials with gene-edited pig kidneys in people with kidney failure. 

But pig liver transplants pose a particular challenge, Wang said: “The liver is so complicated.” Unlike the heart, which pumps blood, and the kidneys, which produce urine, the liver is somewhat of an overachiever. The lobed organ juggles many jobs, including detoxifying the blood, making bile to help with digestion, weeding out old red blood cells, storing energy and producing molecules that help the blood clot. 

Getting a pig organ to successfully take over all those roles will be really difficult, says Adam Griesemer, a liver transplant surgeon at NYU Langone Health. The functions that the liver performs are so vital to our bodies, he says. If there's even a tiny mismatch between how pig and human organs work, “I think we're going to have problems.”

But there's certainly a need for new solutions for liver-failure patients, Griesemer says. In the United States, around 10,000 people are on the national transplant list waiting for a liver. And unlike dialysis for patients waiting for kidneys, there's no long-term way to keep liver-failure patients alive. Liver dialysis exists, but it's only a temporary solution, says Parsia Vagefi, a transplant surgeon at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “People still die waiting for a liver transplant,” he says. 

In 2023, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania tried using a gene-edited pig liver as a kind of backup device, hooking up the organ externally to a person who had recently died. The team was able to circulate the person's blood through the pig liver, a step toward using the organ to temporarily take on the liver's duties in patients with liver failure. In the new case, surgeons brought the liver inside the body. The team started with a Bama miniature pig that had some pig genes knocked out and some human genes pasted in. These genes play a role in transplant rejection; the goal of the edits was to lessen the chance the transplant would fail.

Surgeons placed the modified liver inside the recipient's body, connected it to their blood vessels, and then monitored it for 10 days. The pig liver retained its functions, blood flowed smoothly, and Wang's team did not see inflammatory cells accumulate, a sign that the human recipient was tolerating the transplant. After the experiment, the recipient's body was returned to family.

Vagefi points out that the surgery was not a typical transplant. The team didn't replace the person's liver, as would usually occur in a liver transplant. Instead, the pig liver was auxiliary, existing inside the body alongside the original liver. More recently, Wang's team has performed a full pig-to-human liver transplant, swapping out the liver of a different brain-dead person with one from a genetically modified pig. That transplant took place in January, and the researchers plan to report the results of the investigation in a future publication, Wang said at the briefing. 

Still, Griesemer suspects “that the pig liver is not going to be a long-term solution for patients with liver disease.” Previous work in primates has showcased problems with pig liver transplants, he says. The animals that receive the livers don't tend to live that long.

It's also too early to say whether an auxiliary pig organ, like the one reported in the study, could help patients by serving as a bridge for people on the transplant waiting list, Vagefi says. But, he notes, work like this is important because there's a lot left to be learned. “This is a starting point.”

	When handled, a small crustacean-munching shark from New Zealand clacked its teeth together

This small shark, called a rig or smoothhound, could be the first shark documented to make deliberate sounds.

Sharks may not be the sharp-toothed silent type after all.

The clicking of flattened teeth, discovered by accident, could be “the first documented case of deliberate sound production in sharks,” evolutionary biologist Carolin Nieder, of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and colleagues propose March 26 in Royal Society Open Science.

Humankind has been slow in picking up on sound communication among fishes, and many of their squeaks and rumbles have come to the attention of science in captive animals. For the many bony fishes, it's no longer a surprise to detect various chirps, hums or growls. Yet the evolutionary sister-branch, sharks and rays, built with cartilage, have been slower to get recognized for sounding off. They have remarkable senses, such as detecting slight electric fields. In 1971, however, clicking was reported among cownose rays, and has since turned up in other rays.

Nieder, who had studied dolphin hearing, was at the University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Lab in New Zealand, dangling an underwater microphone into a tank as part of her setup to explore hearing in a small shark species called a rig (Mustelus leucticulates). Reaching into the tank to grasp one, she heard “click…click….” After a week or so of tests, the rig still squirmed but didn't click. Perhaps the sound was voluntary, a response to stress, she mused.

She worked with 10 sharks and recorded multiple clickity bouts, averaging about nine clicks during a 20-second grasp. The sounds may come from clacking together the flattened teeth with cusps, great for cracking crustaceans shells. Rows of these teeth emerge from gum tissue, reminding her of stones set in a mosaic.

In a first, researchers have recorded what could be a shark making deliberate sounds. A small shark from New Zealand, called a rig or spotted estuary smoothhound, grows rows of flattened teeth (image below) that can crack crustaceans for food and, perhaps, make communicative sounds. Evolutionary biologist Carolin Nieder discovered the sounds accidentally when she was handling a rig in a tank. Listen closely as the shark first splashes, then clicks its teeth.

Wiggling doesn't seem important: She heard the sounds when a test shark writhed in her grasp and when it held still. She suggests that sharks click by “forceful snapping.”

The idea still needs formal testing, she cautions. What she actually measured was the hearing range of the sharks, which is restricted to below 1,000 hertz. Human hearing, in comparison, ranges up to 20,000 Hz.

Sharks are sensitive to their watery world though and can detect the tickles of changing electric fields. Yet “if you were a shark, I would need to talk a lot louder to you than to a goldfish,” she says. “The goldfish would pick up if I whisper … and the shark was like, can you speak up please?”

	“We have still not figured out policies that are protective for people”

Millions of people have used DNA testing kits from 23andMe to trace family ties and to learn more about health conditions they may be susceptible to. The company filed for bankruptcy leaving customers wondering what to do about genetic data.

2 hours ago

A genetic data giant is falling, and it's unclear what will happen to millions of people's most intimate personal information in the aftermath.

On March 23, DNA testing company 23andMe announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a move intended to facilitate its sale — along with the genetic data of over 15 million customers worldwide. A bankruptcy court hearing is set to begin March 26.

The San Francisco–based company has been reeling since a 2023 data breach exposed ancestry information — and, in some cases, health data — of about 7 million users. Bankruptcy documents made public by 404 Media show that more than 50 class-action lawsuits followed.

The situation reignites long-standing concerns about genetic privacy. The 2018 arrest of the Golden State Killer, identified through a public ancestry database, first raised alarms about the safety of genetic data. With a patchwork of state-level legislation and no clear federal oversight beyond a rule prohibiting genetic discrimination by employers and health insurance companies — but not life insurance or other entities — genetic testing companies have been free to create their own rules, says sociologist of science Alondra Nelson of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.

“We have gotten 20 years into this industry, and we are about to have a major exchange of 15 million sets of people's data, and we have still not figured out policies that are protective for people,” Nelson says.

23andMe has assured customers that bankruptcy “does not change how we store, manage, or protect customer data.” Any future buyer, the company says, will adhere to those data standards. But California Attorney General Rob Bonta has urged Californians to instruct 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any biological samples stored at the company. Other attorney generals across the country are echoing that call and making residents aware of their rights.

The stakes go beyond privacy. Genetic researchers have used 23andMe data in studies of human ancestry and disease causation. If customers scrub their data, this cache of genetic information could be lost. Moreover, the company collects approximately 2 million survey responses a week about lifestyle, health and traits, legal health privacy scholar Anya Prince of the University of Iowa and bioethicist Kayte Spector-Bagdady of the University of Michigan wrote in the Feb. 25 JAMA. These data, they note, could drive a range of applications from pharmaceutical research to targeted marketing campaigns.

To unpack what's at stake, Science News spoke with Nelson, a former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Prince, who studies the ethical, legal and social implications of genetic testing. The conversations have been edited for length and clarity.

SN: Why is 23andMe declaring bankruptcy such a big deal?

Prince: It's such a big deal because, if you think about why 23andMe was valued as high as $6 billion, it's because of the promise of the monetary value of the data that they hold. If John Deere went into bankruptcy, it would be selling the tractor parts, selling the factories. That is easier than having the asset be millions of people's data, and not just millions of people's data, but millions of people's very sensitive genetic and health data.

Nelson: By 23andMe's own accounting, 15 million customers counted on them to stay in business and to be able to keep their data safe. Part of the service that 23andMe provided was saying that they could tell people things about themselves and their families, intimate details to which they might not otherwise have access. You expect a company or relationship that's going to claim to tell you such things about yourself to stick around.

We didn't exactly know what to do when the data breach occurred, and it's not quite clear what's going to happen with the data vis-à-vis the bankruptcy. We've had a legislative and policy failure around what to do about direct-to-consumer genetic testing. What we know about genetic testing is that it can be used for forensic applications, it can be used for health care applications. The laws that we have around privacy and protection of health care data like HIPAA or the regulations and norms that we have around forensic data don't apply to consumer genetic testing.

There were a lot of companies that started doing similar tests that went out of business or got acquired by other companies. So there has been a pattern in the industry in which we don't know exactly what was happening with these data as the companies get acquired or as they're traded.

SN: Should people delete their data from 23andMe, or should they keep it so researchers can use it?

Prince: I, for example, am a very, very private person, and so if my data was in a company like 23andMe, I would want to delete it because I'm less comfortable with sharing my data and I'm more controlled about it. I know plenty of other people who are just as rational actors who say, “No, I would love my data to be used for research.”

It makes sense for some people to say, “I understand the risks. I understand that I can't control who buys my data and how it's used because of gaps in our federal privacy laws.” If somebody is OK with that, then maybe they don't need to delete it.

But if people say, “No, I'm worried about accessing insurance. I'm worried about just having my data out there. I'm worried how law enforcement could gain access to it,” — whatever it is that people could be tangibly concerned about — or just wanting their data to be private and know who it's being shared with, then I think deleting the data is a good step. There are other ways to provide data to help research that might align more with people's goals or comfort level.

Nelson: We have to open up a broad aperture of things that we can do — and we need to do it quickly — to help people secure their data. If they want to use it for research, great.

The bigger problem is how do you know that your data has been deleted? Is it deleted from everything? Are there collaborations ongoing with other partners, where the data might get circulated into laboratories, research labs and other places? So, sure, ask for the data to be deleted, but I think we also want to have a forensic accounting of the data.

This is not just somebody's Facebook profile. If you want to delete it, you want to be sure that it's deleted. How can we create a protocol or a norm, or really call upon 23andMe to act nobly and provide assurances to people that the data is actually deleted out of every database, every hard drive, every collaborator's research computer?

SN: What worries you most about 23andMe being sold to another entity?

Prince: This whole thing just highlights how little people know about how their data can be shared.

[For instance, 23andMe's] privacy policy says in the event of bankruptcy, the genetic data can be sold. It says that the new company would have to comply with the existing privacy policy. But the existing privacy policy also says that it can be changed at any time.

It just really leaves consumers with little recourse. The one power that we do have is deleting the data. The challenge of that is that it is a rich resource for research, so that's a shame.

Nelson: I worry about the 15 million customers, many of whom, if they're not following the news, may not know that this is happening. They might not have known about the breach in 2023.

I worry in particular about marginalized and vulnerable communities that have histories of repression and oppression [based on] ideas about genetics, and what that means for communities of African descent and communities of Jewish descent.

In 2019, the Department of Defense wrote to all of its employees, particularly those that worked in sensitive areas, and said, “You know what? We're going to suggest that you not get for Christmas or for Hanukkah these direct-to-consumer genetic tests, because we are worried about the ability of this information to leak, and we're worried about the ability of this information to be used by malign foreign actors.” It's dangerous to have people's personal data circulating in the world.

One would not be foolish to be skeptical of 23andMe offering assurances that they're going to abide by whatever rules they have. The company is under distress and is seeking to be sold. What are the trade-offs that are going to be made in the negotiation for this sale? Will data privacy of 15 million people be one of those trade-offs?

	Context may lead people to misread canine emotions, a small study suggests

Human perception of canine emotions is strongly influenced by the overall context, not just body language such as wagging tails or licking lips, a study shows. The finding suggests that people may misinterpret how a dog is feeling.

Many dog owners can tell how their precious pooch is feeling, watching it wag its tail or raise its ears — at least, they think they can.

But people's perception of canine emotions may be strongly influenced by environmental context around the dog, researchers report March 10 in Anthrozoös.

Animal welfare scientist Holly Molinaro filmed her father interacting with his dog, Oliver, a 14-year-old pointer-beagle mix, in a variety of situations. She filmed the dog in positive ones, such as being played with or praised, and negative ones, such as being around a cat or reprimanded.

Her team then showed edited and unedited footage to 400 college students and asked them questions about how they thought the dog felt.

In the edited footage, the dog appeared on a black background; all environmental context had been removed. On average, participants “couldn't tell the difference between whether the dog was happy or sad,” says Molinaro, of Arizona State University in Tempe. Only after they watched unedited footage could participants correctly rate the dog's emotional state.

In a second experiment, the researchers showed another 513 participants edited footage of the dog reacting to a positive situation in a negative context and vice versa, then asked them questions about the dog's emotional state. For example, Molinaro edited a video so that it looked like Oliver was reacting to a toy (positive situation), while instead he was reacting to a vacuum cleaner (negative situation).

One of these scenarios is real and one is not. Can you guess which one is authentic? The answer is at the end of this paragraph. But first, animal welfare scientist Holly Molinaro devised an experiment to test how context, not just body language, can influence how we interpret a dog's mood. She filmed her father's pointer-beagle mix Oliver in a number of scenarios, then edited the footage so that the same clip of the dog's reaction appears in both a positive and negative context. These videos show Oliver seeing a toy (positive) and a vacuum cleaner (negative). Did you guess right? The vacuum cleaner is real; the toy is not.

On average, “no matter what the dog was doing, if it was a positive situation, they rated the dog as happy, and if it was a negative situation, they rated the dog as sad,” Molinaro says. That suggests that, at least in this experiment, the participants tended to base their interpretations on the environment around the dog,

Dog cognition researcher Zsófia Virányi says that while she agrees context plays an important role in how people read canine emotions, it's hard to draw universal conclusions from only one dog.

“Basically, the conclusions that they can form here is not that much about how humans read dog behavior in general, but how humans can read the behavior of this dog in these situations,” says Virányi, of the University of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna. Oliver and other dogs with floppy ears, she adds, are much more difficult to read compared with dogs with pointier, more mobile ears.

Still the study raises something to be aware of when trying to interpret a dog's mood, Molinaro says. Try to rely less on context and more on your furry friend's body language.

In honor of April Fools' Day, I offer the puzzling case of the Lesser Fool.

In a fictional town, there lived an odd wanderer. People would present him with two amounts of money or goods and ask which is greater. Even though they offered to give him whichever amount he chose, the Fool would always select the smaller one.

People came from afar just to test him. Whatever the currency, whatever the quantities, whatever convoluted form the question took, he picked the amount worth less — and then strolled away cheerfully.

The following are some of the questions the Lesser Fool was asked. Can you get them right?

BONUS: One day, a child approached the Fool. “To answer so reliably, you must know which amount is larger. So why do you always take the smaller?” the child asked. “And if you're called the Lesser Fool, who's the Greater Fool?” The Fool only smiled. Can you answer the child's questions?

	The marker is an unexpected bubble that could signal cosmic reionization earlier than thought

The extremely distant galaxy JADES-GS-z13-1 is the small red dot in the center of this image from the James Webb Space Telescope. New observations show the galaxy is emitting a surprising amount of ultraviolet light, indicating it is radically reshaping the cosmic landscape around it.

The James Webb Space Telescope has caught a distant galaxy blowing an unexpected bubble in the gas around it, just 330 million years after the Big Bang.

The galaxy, dubbed JADES-GS-z13-1, marks the earliest sign yet spotted of the era of cosmic reionization, a transformative period in the universe's history when the first stars and galaxies began to reshape their environment, astronomers report in the March 27 Nature.

“It definitely puts a pin in the map of the first point where [reionization] very likely has already started,” says astrophysicist Joris Witstok at the University of Copenhagen. “No one had predicted that it would be this early” in the universe's history.

For millions of years before JADES-GS-z13-1 and others like it began to shine, the universe was filled with cold, neutral gas, mostly hydrogen and helium. This gas absorbed short-wavelength light from any stars that shone before about 200 million years after the Big Bang. But as more and more stars began to burn and gather into galaxies, they produced enough ultraviolet light to knock electrons off the neutral gas atoms, ionizing them and making the gas transparent to short-wavelength light.

One clear signal of this ionization comes in a particular UV wavelength of light called Lyman-α, which is produced by excited hydrogen atoms returning to their lowest energy states. Seeing Lyman-α photons emanating from a galaxy means the galaxy must have blown a bubble of ionized gas around it big enough to let the particles of light reach our telescopes today.

“You can think of galaxies as little Lyman-α flashlights,” says astrophysicist Steven Finkelstein of the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the new study. “If you can see the Lyman-α, it means they're sitting in an ionized part of the universe.” If you can't see Lyman-α, the galaxies are shrouded in neutral hydrogen fog.

Previous observations showed that the universe was completely ionized about one billion years after the Big Bang. But it's hard to tell when the process began, or what exactly produced the light.

Witstok and colleagues used JWST to observe JADES-GS-z13-1, one of the clearest of these early galaxies, for almost 19 hours, splitting its light into a spectrum of wavelengths to seek details of the galaxy's makeup.

JWST was designed to seek out these brilliant, ancient galaxies. As the universe expands, the ultraviolet light that these galaxies originally emitted gets stretched to longer, infrared wavelengths. Since starting operations in 2022, JWST's sensitive infrared detectors have turned up a growing gaggle of galaxies whose light comes from as early as less than 300 million years after the Big Bang.

To their surprise, the researchers found a clear, bright signal of Lyman-α photons coming from JADES-GS-z13-1. If you were standing next to the galaxy, this light alone would shine as bright as 10 billion suns.

“We suddenly saw this huge, booming emission line” that makes all the other distant galaxies JWST has found “look a bit boring,” Witstock says. “Just the pure strength of it tells us whatever this source is has to be really, really powerful and unlike anything we've seen before.”

The finding is “both surprising and exciting,” says cosmologist Michele Trenti of the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the study and wrote a perspective article that accompanied the paper in Nature. “I would not have expected the ultraviolet light that is emitted from this galaxy as Lyman-α to be able to reach the JWST,” she says. “This suggests that early forming galaxies are more efficient than previously thought at reheating the universe.”

It's still not clear exactly what the light's source is. The light could come from matter that was heated as it fell onto a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center. The galaxy's compact size supports this idea — it looks like it's only about 230 light-years across, compared with 32,000 light-years for the Milky Way.

The light could also have come from extremely hot, massive stars, about 100 to 300 times the mass of the sun and more than 15 times hotter. More observations are required to figure out which it is, but either one has implications for the conditions in the early universe.

“Both possibilities are stimulating for innovation,” Trenti says. “I expect theorists will be on the drawing board, developing new models for galaxy and black hole evolution during the dawn of the universe, while observers will certainly try to discover additional similar galaxies to solve the puzzle.”

“I just cannot believe how I don't crave alcohol anymore!” writes one person. Others declare: “Took my first shot… have not had a drink or cigarette since,” and “I love coffee but I've noticed that I cannot finish a cup anymore.”

These quotes were all collected in a recent study led by Davide Arillotta at the University of Florence, Italy, from Reddit's weight-loss forums. Here, you will find many people rhapsodising about the benefits of drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. That these treatments are helping people curb their eating should be no surprise: that is exactly what they are meant to do, by mimicking the satiety hormone GLP-1 (see “How they work”, below).

Among the comments, however, you will frequently find reports of other – wholly unexpected – behavioural changes. According to these accounts, when taking these drugs, the urge to drink alcohol, smoke and even shop compulsively plummets (but not libido, though anecdotal reports on this subject elsewhere online are mixed). Such tales are becoming familiar to prescribing physicians.

If this anecdotal data can be supported by controlled clinical trials, it may tell us a lot about how the brain processes anticipation and reward – and could also suggest whole new ways of dealing with addiction. By targeting areas of the brain responsible for reward signals from food, GLP-1 drugs might also reduce the rewards people get from other things, such as addictive substances. But what does the current evidence show about these complex behavioural processes?

First, we need to understand how drugs…

There are many claims about the benefits of microdosing weight-loss drugs, from anti-inflammatory effects to extending longevity. Do any of them stack up?

Madison Burgess decided to get serious about weight loss when the scale hit 91 kilograms (200 pounds). She began taking Ozempic. The medication worked better than she ever thought possible: even on the low starter dose, she lost more than 2 kg (5 lbs) within the first week.

Problems began, however, when Burgess, a 25-year-old healthcare administrator from Bloomfield, Michigan, ramped up her intake, as per the manufacturer's guidelines. “The higher doses were rough on me,” she says. The constipation, nausea, diarrhoea and acid reflux hit hard and made eating difficult. That's when she decided to drop back down to a lower dose and determine whether she could continue seeing benefits.

Burgess is just one of a growing number of people who are “microdosing” – a practice more typically associated with psychedelics such as LSD and psilocybin – by taking lower-than-standard amounts of weight-loss drugs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro (see “How they work”, below).

For some, the hope is to avoid side effects while losing weight, while others want to tap into the anti-inflammatory effect of these medications or reap their other benefits for the heart and the brain (see “A wonder drug”?, below). Microdosing the drugs has even been touted for extending longevity by ultra-wealthy elites like tech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson, and is rumoured to be the secret weapon of Hollywood stars wanting to look svelte for photo calls.

The question is, does this off-label, low-dose experimentation work?

GLP-1 drugs have revolutionised the treatment of obesity, but the very reason they are effective is also why it's vital to prioritise exercise when taking them

By Grace Wade


                                    26 March 2025

For decades, conventional wisdom held that, to lose weight, you must eat less and move more. Of course, that is easier said than done, which is why drugs like Wegovy are so revolutionary. By suppressing appetite, they help tackle the first part of that equation, typically leading to dramatic weight loss. But what about the second? Do we still need to hit the gym if weight-loss drugs are causing the number on the scales to drop? And what impact do these drugs have on our ability to exercise?

What is becoming clear is that exercise may be even more crucial for people who are on these medications than it is for those who aren't. The ability of semaglutide to induce rapid weight loss (see “How they work”, below) also leads to notable declines in muscle mass. For instance, a 2021 study of 95 people who were overweight or had obesity and were taking semaglutide found that lean body mass decreased by almost 10 per cent, on average, after 68 weeks.

Lean body mass encompasses body tissues like muscle and bone. So, these results suggest that both deteriorate when taking weight-loss drugs, says Signe Sørensen Torekov at the University of Copenhagen. Because these drugs lead people to consume fewer calories, the body must break down fat, muscle and even bone for nutrients.

“Our understanding is that up to about 40 per cent of the overall weight loss that is seen from semaglutide is thought to be potentially from the loss of muscle mass,” says …

Invasive Plants Are Not the Enemy

Botanist Mason Heberling challenges how we think about invasive species and our role in their spread.

By Rachel Feltman, Fonda Mwangi, Naeem Amarsy & Alex Sugiura 

Anaissa Ruiz Tejada/Scientific American

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

What do you think of when you hear the words “invasive plant?” According to some botanists, our mindset around invasives can do more harm than good.

Here to tell us more is Mason Heberling, associate curator of botany at Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. He's one of the experts behind the museum's new exhibition, Uprooted: Plants Out of Place, which opened on March 22.

Thank you so much for joining us today.

Mason Heberling: Yeah, happy to be here.

Feltman: What do you think is missing or lacking right now in the way we talk about invasive plants, and why is that important to address?

Heberling: Yeah, I guess, first and foremost, people, I think [laughs] ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: Is, is largely absent out of the invasive-species conversation. And that is: “How did species get where they are, and who and what is responsible for that?” That's a missing key. Oftentimes we talk about invasive plants, invasive insects, invasive—introduced whatever, and we oftentimes focus on specific species or we focus on particular areas that they come from. But we rarely talk about the underlying cause of the introduction, so I think that's one thing that's really missing in kind of science communication around the topic.

Feltman: Yeah, and how do you think that the way we talk about and deal with invasive species would be different if, if we address that?

Heberling: I mean, I think the hope is and the thought is that there's not just these nasty organisms that are just out to get humans but that humans are part of nature and humans are part of the problem but also part of the solution, so instead of just ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: Pointing at a particular plant and being like, “This plant is ruining our life,” we instead see it as the broader context of how the plant got here, what we might do to mitigate the problem, but then also what we might do to prevent future problems.

Feltman: What are some key concepts about invasive species that, that tend to be oversimplified or underemphasized?

Heberling: Well, there's a lot [laughs]. I think just in general, in the field of ecology, there's not necessarily these big laws and rules like maybe other sciences have, like physics or something. And so it—it's complicated.

So what happens in an ecological web when you remove one species? Sometimes nothing really happens [laughs], and sometimes, if it's, you know, a keystone species or an important species, the whole web has to be re-networked. It's not totally random, but there is certainly an element of chance, but also it's just complicated.

So I think that kind of big question of, “If you introduce species X to a region where it hasn't been before,” there's a lot of factors at play that might help you predict, but ultimately you don't always necessarily know the impact of a given introduction.

Feltman: Yeah. You've done some work on how we might change the messaging around invasive species. Can you give us an example of how poorly considered messages can lead the public to do more harm to the environment than good?

Heberling: There are plenty of examples of that. And I guess just to step back, even if you don't study invasives, you do study invasives, whether indirectly or directly. With that being said, being at the museum, my position as botany curator really has a pretty strong public-facing-outreach component. And being a plant ecologist, also giving a lot of guided hikes, pointing out plants, what plants are what, telling fun stories about particular plants to hook in, and of course, the topic of invasives comes up in that, too.

And so both out in the field, giving these types of tours to the public, and then also in the museum galleries, in the dioramas or other exhibit spaces, it, it kind of came to me that I'm actually not that great at communicating about this particular topic. It's a very nuanced, complicated topic, a lot of finger-pointing happening.

And I think one big thing that really hit hard for me was: being in Pennsylvania—and in the eastern U.S., period—a lot of our invasives and forests, in particular, our work has found are from East Asia. So going on hikes, pointing out, “Hey, this plant is from Japan,” it kind of depends on, you know, what kind of background and philosophies people have, but there's oftentimes either intentional or unintentional connection with, like, human migration. I really noticed it when COVID-19 started and there was kind of a resurgence of anti-immigration sentiments and, and a resurgence of—or, you know, a fear of East Asia.

A while ago that happened to me, where someone is just like, “Oh, well, it's just, like, Japanese coming to America.” And I'm like, “Ugh, I wasn't looking to have a conversation about human migration.” But then, more thinking about that, you really do see that the way that we address and talk about plant invasions, or invasions in general, really is seeded in this larger context of, you know, if, if you have an issue with this plant because it's from Japan, what else does that say about us, either ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: As a society and as science?

So there's people that are really worried about introduced plants from a biological conservation side. And then there is this kind of other side that especially has been strong and more like the humanities fields where there is this general notion of, “Who are you to say what can live where and when?” And I think that's a valid question, but also it, it brings up this binary of yes or no, or native or non-native. And I think that can be very off-putting to a lot of people.

From my stance as a botanist we really don't want the take-home to be like, “We hate plants.” And from the same sense we don't want to be—the take-home to be, “We hate people for particular reasons.”

Feltman: Sure.

Heberling: So I've seen it go sour that way. And then I've also seen it go sour in this kind of vilifying particular organisms—these fear appeals. They've been really popular, and they've been really effective in some ways. For instance: “Don't move this wood because the emerald ash borer or some other introduced insect or something, we don't wanna move it around.” And that can be pretty effective to, to instill change, but those little sound bites don't actually give the full nuance of: “How did we get where we are now? What can we do in the future to prevent that?”

And so you oftentimes also see kids, they are chasing after invasive bugs and squashing them. And you could see, as an environmental educator, there being a bit of a conflict there in terms of ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: Killing organisms and maybe not necessarily getting that message across of why we are advocating for killing or removing particular organisms in a given context. So it's really complicated.

And again, working at the museum, exhibit labels need to be short and punchy, and people come to the museum to be inspired, to be instilled with wonder, to be happy. You don't necessarily come to an exhibit to read an exhibit label that requires you to get out your dictionary and sit there for an hour to read it. So how do you distill these, these big-picture topics to get across both the biological concepts and the sense of action and inspiration for land stewardship?

That's something that we've been really working on in the—at the museum here, so we're really excited that now we are opening this exhibition, Uprooted: Plants Out of Place, that we really are trying to present this topic in a way that is both informational, inspirational and accurate and gives that full nuance rather than other exhibitions or short science communication pieces that are just kind of like, “This plant is bad; get rid of it.”

Feltman: Very cool. So what got you interested in invasive plants?

Heberling: I actually got into plants through invasive plants, helping my parents garden. That's a good child job, right? “Remove these weeds; we don't want these weeds here.” And so that always got me thinking, but I didn't really know much more than that. And then I went to school for biology then, and as an undergraduate I was really interested in nature generically. Then I quickly ended up working a bit in, in horticulture, you know, as a summer job, and again these weeds kind of came back to me: “How did they get here? What are they doing? How do they interact?” And then from there it kind of spiraled.

My interest, fundamentally, really was the basic science of invasion ecology or introduced plants, seeing it as this big—unintentional—but this big kind of global experiment: What happens when you mix species around with different evolutionary histories? There's a lot of basic scientific, ecological, evolutionary principles to be tested there that's really quite fascinating. And that's what originally drove me and still does drive a lot of my research here at the museum.

Feltman: I know you've done some writing on how naming conventions can change the way we talk about invasive species. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?

Heberling: So this was work that kind of culminated in this exhibition at the museum but also in more behind-the-scenes and public-facing work with different environmental organizations here around Pittsburgh addressing this issue of: “How do we talk about invasives? What's the most effective way, and what's the most accurate way?” Which sometimes aren't necessarily the same thing.

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: Something that, that we're really putting to practice in exhibition labels is common names of plants. Now, unlike other organisms, there's no official common names for plants. We tend to focus on scientific names, and there's a big conversation going on now, too, about scientific names and renaming them on various bases. But for common names and for introduced plants in particular, oftentimes we say “Japanese wisteria,” “Japanese knotweed,” “Chinese privet.” So we have this kind of geographic descriptor. And at first, honestly, I, I really had no issue with that. I thought, “Yeah, that makes sense ...”

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Heberling: “I'm really interested in where plants are from.” And I thought giving that name provides some context of, yes, this plant is introduced, first off. And then second off, where generally is it from? That's just interesting.

But what I found in practice with science communication, sometimes, first off, it's not necessarily accurate. Japanese knotweed may not necessarily be all from Japan, and plants don't necessarily follow political boundaries. And we also see plants like Canada thistle, for instance, which is a European plant, but we call it Canada thistle, so that's a different story. So sometimes there's straight-up misnomers, and sometimes there's just some blurred lines that isn't necessarily true; maybe it was just first introduced from there or the first person who encountered it—first European, I should say, or Euro-American—kind of called it that. And that's not always accurate.

In the case of Japanese knotweed, for instance, which is a huge invasive plant that's introduced from East Asia and is now in Europe and in North America, and it's also a huge one in Pittsburgh area here, so it's one that we're featuring. And so it was like, “Do we wanna say ‘Japanese knotweed'?” First off, is that accurate? And then second off, we don't know where everyone's coming from when they read the label ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Heberling: And we don't necessarily want Japan to be the first thing they think about and then read ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: A bunch of negative things about this plant. And it seems relatively subtle, but it really is important. So we instead say things like “knotweed,” for instance, or use the name that the Japanese call it, which is itadori. And I think little, subtle shifts like that reframe it a little bit. And, and there are other names, too, that are absolutely offensive to certain ...

Feltman: Sure.

Heberling: Groups of people, but there are other things that aren't necessarily offensive—there's nothing offensive about “Japanese knotweed,” for instance—but it's more about the tone and how it's presented and also the biological accuracy of where exactly is this plant from.

So in a way the good thing about common names is, we can call plants whatever we want [laughs]. We don't need to necessarily go with scientific conventions when we're talking in the vernacular. It's actually really quite cool, too, that different regions of the world may call the same plant different things, and it oftentimes will say [something] about how they use the plant or how it's engaged in their culture in some way, or it could be descriptive, but it is a powerful and relatively easy way to shift the narrative a little bit about invasives and keep the conversation going rather than just being like, “Oh, they're from this particular place—I know these other plants are from there, too; they must be bad,” and walk away.

Feltman: [Laughs] Yeah. What would you say are the big things that everyday people and, you know, home-gardening enthusiasts can do to support native plants?

Heberling: It depends where you are in the world, of course, but there's a big native-plant movement, I would say, this kind of revolution happening in people's backyards—you know, rethinking gardening in general for not only the plants that they plant but also the other organisms that they can help with their plants.

It's kind of like voting, I would say: you know, every little bit matters. It might not seem like you removing a particular plant and switching it out with another one may be huge, but collectively it really does matter. And also it's a time for engagement, you know, personal engagement.

One of the things we're doing here at the museum—connecting with local resources, because there's a lot of native-plant nurseries in a lot of places across the world. And going to a big-box store or even a, a big commercial nursery, don't assume that all the plants there are, are great for you to plant. And so you have a little bit of responsibility but also agency to make those decisions. And I think in the last couple of years for Pennsylvania but also in the last, really, couple of decades for a lot of different U.S. states, there's been a lot of increased regulation of the commercial trade. And some of that I see as being really positive because some of that is out of the hands of the consumer; it affects consumer decisions—what's available to buy, for instance.

So it's not only about necessarily removing plants but then also cultivating an environment that is conducive to the type of healthy ecosystems that we want. It really needs to be an active restoration, and active restoration also doesn't mean that it necessarily has to be super difficult ...

Feltman: Mm.

Heberling: There are a lot of native weeds. So I'm using the term “weed” here, and a weed is just a plant out of place; it doesn't matter if it's native or non-native. And sometimes we hear the word “weed” and we're like, “Oh, that's bad.” But what I mean by that is we can foster self-sustaining gardens, too, and that's a really exciting, empowering thing.

For instance, plants like milkweed, we consider that a weed, and maybe it once was really reviled for various reasons—oftentimes weeds are these early species that do well in these kind of early successional or in these disturbed environments, which is true in cities and a lot of other places. But what's beautiful is they can self-seed and they can be a keystone species in these ecological networks and really take it from there.

Feltman: Yeah, thank you so much for joining us today. This has been a great conversation.

Heberling: Yeah, you're welcome.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. For more on invasive plants, head over to Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh to check out its new exhibit Uprooted: Plants Out of [Place].

We'll be back on Friday with an episode I'm super excited to share: an inside look at MIT.nano, a cutting-edge facility for nanoscale science and engineering. And I do mean an inside look.

The purpose of a mysterious pyramidal structure in the Judaean Desert is unknown, but excavators are finding many well-preserved artifacts there.

Archaeologists are uncovering a mysterious pyramid-shaped structure and way station in the Judaean Desert. The excavation site, just north of the valley of Zohar (Nahal Zohar) along the coast of the Dead Sea, contains a host of exceptionally well-preserved artifacts that are more than 2,000 years old.

""The discoveries are exciting and even emotional, and their significance for archaeological and historical research is enormous,"" Eli Escusido, director of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said in a statement.

The pyramid is built from hand-cut stones, each weighing hundreds of pounds. But the structure's purpose is still unknown, according to the site's excavation directors. It may have served as a historical monument, a grave, or a guard tower protecting a commercial route from the Dead Sea to coastal ports.

The site dates back 2,200 years to the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty and Seleucid Empire. After Alexander the Great died in 323 B.C., his generals divided his vast empire among themselves. His general Ptolemy took control of Egypt and the surrounding areas, including Israel, while Seleucus ruled the northern part of what is now the Middle East. By 200 B.C., the Seleucid Empire had conquered what is now modern-day Israel.

Given that the pyramidal structure dates to the time of this power switch, it's unclear if it was built under the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty or the Seleucid Empire. The Roman Empire absorbed both empires in the first century B.C.

The archaeologists also unearthed a number of artifacts at the site. The low-moisture environment of the desert likely helped preserve the artifacts through the millennia. Low humidity deters mold and minimizes warping and cracking in organic materials like wood and fibers.

""The extreme dryness has preserved things here in an extraordinary way,"" archaeologist Ido Zangen, who was involved with the excavation, said in a translated video released by the Israel Antiquities Authority. ""We're finding papyrus fragments, all kinds of amazing wooden artifacts, baskets and ropes that you simply don't find anywhere else in the country.""

—1,900-year-old coins from Jewish revolt against the Romans discovered in the Judaean desert

Some of the papyrus fragments contain writing in ancient Greek, one of the languages spoken by denizens of both the Ptolemaic and Seleucid empires. Also among the unearthed artifacts are bronze coins and vessels, remnants of ancient furniture, beads, weapons, fabrics and seeds, all preserved by the dry climate.

Eva Balbin Brafman, a volunteer at the excavation, described finding part of a papyrus document from the upper part of the site. ""You could clearly make out the letters, probably in Greek,"" Balbin Brafman said in the video. ""It's incredibly exciting to find something in such a wonderful state of preservation.""

A team of professional archaeologists and volunteers will continue to excavate the site through April 8 in hopes of learning more about the structure.

A Chinese automaker has developed a battery that will enable electric vehicles (EVs) to charge almost as quickly as it takes to fill a regular car's gas tank.

The new battery, named the e-platform, was developed by BYD, a Chinese firm that is overtaking Tesla as the world's top seller of electric vehicles.

Assigned a 10C rating — meaning the battery can move charge at ten times the rate of its nominal capacity — the e-platform can reach full charge in just six minutes. At its peak charging power of 1,000 kilowatts , the battery's charging rate is twice as fast as Tesla's 500 kW superchargers. This means that the two new models using the battery — BYD's Han L saloon and its Tang L SUV — can travel up to 250 miles (400 kilometers) on just a five-minute charge.

—World's 1st silicon anode EV battery will let you drive up to 186 miles after just 5 minutes of charging

—EV batteries could last much longer thanks to new capacitor with 19-times higher energy density that scientists created by mistake

""We have been pursuing a goal to make the charging time of electric vehicles as short as the refueling time of petrol vehicles,"" BYD founder Wang Chuanfu said at a launch event in Shenzhen, China. ""This is the first time in the industry that the unit of megawatt has been achieved on charging power.""

To charge at such rapid speeds, the e-platform works by simultaneously creating a high voltage and delivering a large current to the charging car. But high currents also tend to generate heat that damages EV batteries.

To get around this, BYD says it massively reduced the internal resistance inside the battery. The company's new silicon carbide power chips are also designed to withstand higher voltages.

To facilitate the cars' launch, BYD said it will install a network of 4,000 flash charging stations across China. This technology is currently only available in China, and the company has yet to confirm whether it will make it available internationally.

An Iron Age hoard discovered in England is on a ""kind of scale and size that is exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe.""

An amateur metal detectorist in Northern England has discovered an ""unusual"" 2,000-year-old hoard of artifacts that was burned and then buried.

The Iron Age finding, named the Melsonby Hoard after the nearby village of Melsonby in North Yorkshire, contains more than 800 artifacts, including a cauldron, wine-mixing bowl, horse riding equipment, pieces of wagons or chariots, a large iron mirror, and ceremonial iron spearheads.

""The bowl we discovered is very interesting because it was a very unusual type — not something you'd normally find in Northern Britain,"" said Tom Moore, a professor and head of the Department of Archaeology at Durham University in the U.K. who helped excavate and analyze the hoard.

""Its decoration combines both Mediterranean and British Iron Age styles,"" Moore said in a video released by Durham University. This suggests that whoever owned it likely had ""a network across Britain and across into Europe and even the Roman world,"" he said.

Peter Heads, a hobbyist metal detectorist, discovered the hoard in December 2021 after he secured permission from a private landowner to survey a field. He then contacted Moore, who looped in the government and The British Museum, according to a statement released Tuesday (March 25) by Durham University.

""It was only really when we went back to excavate the hoard and we opened up a much larger area that I think Peter and I, and all of the team, realized we were on to something really exciting,"" Moore said in the video.

The excavation revealed that the entire find included a small hoard, as well as a large hoard ""that was of a kind of scale and size that is exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe,"" Moore said.



From the field, the team cut out a large block of earth holding the artifacts and they then had it CT scanned so they could create a virtual, 3D model of it. An analysis revealed that much of the ironwork and copper alloy items had either been burned or broken. It's possible that these items had been placed in a funerary pyre, although no human bones were found at the site.

""Our working theory at the moment is that [the hoard had] been gathered together and maybe heated in a sort of a big bonfire or perhaps a pyre,"" Sophia Adams, curator of the European Iron Age and Roman Conquest Period at The British Museum who is studying the find, said in the video.

After the burning, some of the items appear to have been further damaged as they were thrown into a ditch and had stones tossed on top of them, she said.

—More than 1,300 coins buried during Roman emperor Nero's reign found in England

Despite the damage, many of the artifacts are still recognizable. Some of the horse harnesses are decorated with red coral from the Mediterranean and colored glass, which hints at far-flung trade.

""The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts,"" Moore said in the statement.

Researchers are still analyzing the artifacts, and they hope that the finds will one day go on display in a museum, they said in the video.

Auroras are possible over the U.S. tonight (March 25) as a ""moderate"" geomagnetic storm hits Earth.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


UPDATE: The Northern Lights could be visible in the U.S. tonight (March 26), appearing as far south as New York and Idaho due to a ""coronal hole"" sending streams of charged particles toward Earth.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initally issued a G2 geomagnetic storm warning for Tuesday, March 25, which has now been extended into Wednesday (March 26).

Like hurricanes, geomagnetic storms follow a 5-point severity scale. G2 storms are considered ""moderate"" in strength and could cause minor technological disruptions such as radio blackouts, GPS malfunctions, and an increased chance of spotting auroras at lower latitudes than usual.

""Watches of this level are not uncommon,"" according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center; G2-strength geomagnetic storms hit Earth about 360 days in each 11-year solar cycle. These storms can affect spacecraft orbits and cause weak power grid fluctuations at high latitudes, but they mostly cause ""manageable effects to some technological infrastructure,"" according to NOAA.

The Space Weather Prediction Center issued the extended storm warning because a ""coronal hole"" on the sun is facing Earth. Coronal holes are cooler, darker regions of the sun's outermost atmosphere (the corona) that are less dense than normal, allowing high-speed solar winds — streams of charged particles — to escape from the sun and gush outward into space. Currently, one of these escaped high-speed streams is pointed directly at Earth.

Earth's magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, but some charged particles make it through into the upper layers of the atmosphere. When the solar wind hits Earth's atmosphere, charged particles shoot toward Earth's poles, agitating atmospheric molecules along the way and forcing them to emit energy in the form of colorful auroras.

In October 2024, the sun reached its solar maximum period, the most active part of its 11-year cycle. During this period, the sun's magnetic poles flip, and space weather events like geomagnetic storms and solar flares occur more frequently. Scientists predict that the solar maximum will continue for at least a few more months if not longer, providing additional opportunities to spot the Northern Lights.

On Wednesday night, ""the aurora may become visible over some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho,"" according to a statement from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.

The best chances of spotting an aurora are on dark, clear nights between 10pm and 2am, far from artificial lights. You can see auroras with the naked eye, but their colors might look even more vivid through a smartphone screen.

Researchers made the first known recordings of sharks making sounds after noticing they made clicks while being handled at a marine laboratory.

Sharks have long been thought to be mute, relying on stealth to hunt their prey and avoid predators. But now, sharks have been recorded making sounds for the very first time.

The new recordings reveal that rig sharks (Mustelus lenticulatus) — small, bottom-dwelling sharks native to New Zealand — emit distinct clicks when handled by researchers underwater. These sounds were consistent and repeated across multiple individuals, and were potentially tied to distress or defensive responses, according to a study published Wednesday (Mar. 26) in the journal Royal Society Open Science.

The recordings represent the first known case of a shark actively producing sound. ""Sharks have sensory systems that are more refined than their hearing, like their electroreceptors, their smell and the way they propel themselves through the water,"" study lead author Carolin Nieder, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, told Live Science. ""But I think the original notion that we had that sound isn't important at all is also likely not true.""

Ten juvenile rig sharks were observed making sounds by accident during routine behavioral experiments at the University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Laboratory. When briefly handled by researchers underwater, all 10 sharks produced audible clicks.

These clicking sounds were very frequent during the first few handlings but then stopped as the experiments progressed, Nieder said. ""Maybe they weren't afraid for their lives anymore,"" she said, adding that in the wild, loud clicks may serve as a split-second distraction for juvenile sharks to make their escape when they are seized by predators.

Most sharks are thought to be silent because they lack swim bladders — air-filled sacs commonly used by fish to make sounds. MicroCT scans and 3D reconstructions of rig sharks also revealed no obvious sound-producing organs or structures.

The team proposed that the sounds could be coming from the sharks snapping their teeth.

Rig sharks have broad, blunt teeth arranged in tightly packed, plate-like formations, which are ideal for crushing hard-shelled prey like crabs. This ""pavement dentition,"" may also serve a second function of producing noise when the jaws snap shut, the researchers said.

However, Nieder noted that without direct observation of the sharks' jaws during click production, the mechanism remains speculative.

Each click lasted around 48 milliseconds, with volumes sometimes exceeding 155 decibels, which is comparable to shotgun blast.

Roughly three-quarters of the clicks were single bursts, while the rest were short double-clicks. The scientists observed that about 70% of these clicks were accompanied by calm, swaying body movements, but a few occurred without any visible motion at all.

Whether the clicking is an accidental byproduct of handling or a purposeful behavior remains unknown.

The sharks' own hearing range is largely below 1 kilohertz, far lower than the frequencies of its clicks, meaning it's unlikely the clicks are meant for communicating with other sharks.

However, some known predators of rig sharks, such as New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri), are sensitive to higher frequencies and might be startled or confused by the sharp clicks.

Several species of rays and skates — close relatives of sharks — are also known to produce clicks when disturbed by divers. These sounds are thought to serve as warning signals or distress calls.

—A really big shark got gobbled up by another, massive shark in 1st known case of its kind

Nieder said future studies could target closely related shark species to investigate whether they are also capable of making noises, and whether they make noise in response to stress.

Adrian Gutteridge, a shark biologist with the IUCN Shark Specialist Group who was not involved in the study, said more research will be needed to establish what the shark clicks are for, and what they could mean.

""It's too early to tell whether it's a response, kind of saying, 'go away,' or if [it's] just their nervous system is firing off which just happens to make their teeth and jaws click,"" he told Live Science.

After suspecting the presence of a series of underwater volcanoes near the Cook Islands, researchers have now mapped out the newly discovered structures.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A series of relatively young underwater volcanoes has been discovered under the waves of the Pacific Ocean, some of which may even be active.

The volcanoes were found during an expedition to map the seafloor near the Cook Islands in the Central Pacific, about 2,900 miles (4,700 kilometers) south of Hawaii. If these structures are volcanically active, the heat that they generate may have spawned a unique and exciting marine habitat nearby, the researchers said.

""So far, we have not seen any clear signs of volcanic activity, but then again, no one has yet had the chance to look carefully at the seabed and sample it,"" representatives from the Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA), which co-led the research, said in a statement. ""Once fully processed and interpreted, our new seabed map should help any future scientists quickly go directly to the best points for this sampling.""

The Cook Islands are a group of 15 islands in the South Pacific Ocean, located between French Polynesia and American Samoa. This archipelago was created millions of years ago as the Pacific plate moved over a magma hotspot in the Earth's mantle — similar to the way the Hawaiian Islands were formed. A magma hotspot is a localized area in Earth's mantle where unusually hot rock rises toward the surface, causing volcanic activity. Unlike volcanoes at tectonic plate boundaries, hotspots occur in the middle of tectonic plates and remain stationary, while the plate above moves over time.



A hot mantle plume from the hotspot brings heat and magma toward Earth's crust, which can cause magma from the mantle to erupt onto the seafloor and then cool rapidly in the water. Over time, repeated eruptions build up a volcanic structure, forming an underwater volcano. If the eruptions continue, the volcano grows large enough to break the ocean surface, forming a volcanic island.

Most of the volcanoes in the Cook Islands are ancient, with their rocks dating back tens or even hundreds of millions of years. However, the islands of Rarotonga and Aitutaki are made of a combination of older and younger rocks, because they are among the most recent islands to form over the hotspot — the youngest rock on Rarotonga dates back only around 1.2 million years.

These newly mapped underwater volcanoes were first theorized in 2024 after researchers discovered that the rocks of one submerged volcano were only 670,000 years old. The rocks were discovered roughly 37 miles (60 km) southeast of Rarotonga, on a volcano called Tama, and they mark the youngest volcanic rocks discovered in the Cook Islands to date.

The team also theorized that, going southeast from Rarotonga through Tama, there may be several other underwater volcanoes lurking on the seafloor, which may also be much younger than the other Cook Islands.

To investigate these structures further, the ARTEX 2025 expedition was launched to map the ocean floor in the area surrounding Rarotonga. The team discovered that there was indeed a series of smaller structures dotted along the seafloor to the southeast of Rarotonga, including a 0.6-mile-high (1 km) volcano named ""Pepe"". The team's data is yet to be fully processed, however, and the structures have not yet been confirmed as volcanically active.

The researchers hope to return to the area to learn more about the seamounts, or underwater volcanoes, and to collect samples of the rocks to figure out exactly how old they are.

The National Institutes of Health employee said she knew things would be difficult for federal workers after Donald Trump was elected. But she never imagined it would be like this.

Focused on Alzheimer's and other dementia research, the worker is among thousands who abruptly lost their jobs in the Trump administration's federal workforce purge. The way she was terminated — in February through a boilerplate notice alleging poor performance, something she pointedly said was ""not true"" — made her feel she was ""losing hope in humans.""

She said she can't focus or meditate, and can barely go to the gym. At the urging of her therapist, she made an appointment with a psychiatrist in March after she felt she'd ""hit the bottom,"" she said.

""I am going through hell,"" said the employee, who worked at the National Institute on Aging, one of 27 centers that make up the NIH. The worker, like others interviewed for this story, was granted anonymity because of the fear of professional retaliation.

""I know I am a mother. I am a wife. But I am also a person who was very happy with her career,"" she said. ""They took my job and my life from my hands without any reason.""

President Trump and his allies have increasingly denigrated the roughly 2 million people who make up the federal workforce, 80% of whom work outside the Washington, D.C., area. Trump has said federal workers are ""destroying this country,"" called them ""crooked"" and ""dishonest,"" and insinuated that they're lazy. ""Many of them don't work at all,"" he said earlier this month.

Elon Musk — who is the world's richest person and whose Department of Government Efficiency, created by a Trump executive order, is infiltrating federal agencies and spearheading mass firings — has claimed without evidence that ""there are a number of people on the government payroll who are dead"" and others ""who are not real people."" At a conference for conservatives in February, Musk brandished what he called ""the chain saw for bureaucracy"" and said that ""waste is pretty much everywhere.""

The firings that began in February are taking a significant toll on federal employees' mental health. Workers said they feel overwhelmed and demoralized, have obtained or considered seeking psychiatric care and medication, and feel anxious about being able to pay bills or afford college for their children.

Federal employees are bracing for more layoffs after agencies were required to deliver plans by this month for large-scale staff reductions. Compounding the uncertainty: After judges ruled that some initial firings were illegal, agencies have rehired some workers and placed others on paid administrative leave. Then, Trump on March 20 issued a memo giving the Office of Personnel Management more power to fire people across agencies.

Researchers who study job loss say these mass layoffs not only are disrupting the lives of tens of thousands of federal workers but also will reverberate out to their spouses, children, and communities.

""I'd expect this will have long-lasting impacts on these people's lives and those around them,"" said Jennie Brand, a professor of sociology at UCLA who wrote a paper about the implications of job loss. ""We can see this impact years down the road.""

Studies have shown that people who are unemployed experience greater anxiety, depression, and suicide risk. The longer the period of unemployment, the worse the effects.

Couples fight more when one person loses a job, and if it's a man, divorce rates increase.

Children with an unemployed parent are more likely to do poorly in school, repeat a grade, or drop out. It can even affect whether they go to college, Brand said. There's an ""intergenerational impact of instability,"" she said.

And it doesn't stop there. When people lose their jobs, especially when it's many people at once, the wealth and resources available in their community are reduced. Kids see fewer employed role models. As families are forced to move, neighborhood stability gets upended. Unemployed people often withdraw from social and civic life, avoiding community gatherings, church, or other places where they might have to discuss or explain their job loss.

Although getting a new job can alleviate some of these problems, it doesn't eliminate them, Brand said.

""It's not as if people just get new jobs and then pick up the activities they used to be involved with,"" she said. ""There's not a quick recovery.""

The firings are upending a long-standing norm of the public sector — in exchange for earning less money compared with private-sector work, people had greater job security and more generous benefits. Now that's no longer the case, fired workers said in interviews.

With the American economy moving toward temporary and gig jobs, landing a traditional government job was supposed to be ""like you've got the golden goose,"" said Blake Allan, a professor of counseling psychology at the University of Houston who researches how the quality of work affects people's lives.

Even federal workers who are still employed face the daily question of whether they'll be fired next. That constant state of insecurity, Allan said, can create chronic stress, which is linked to anxiety, depression, digestive problems, heart disease, and a host of other health issues.

One employee at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, who was granted anonymity to avoid professional retaliation, said the administration's actions seem designed to cause enough emotional distress that workers voluntarily leave. ""I feel like this ax will always be over my head for as long as I'm here and this administration is here,"" the employee said.

Federal workers who passed on higher-paying private sector jobs because they wanted to serve their country may feel especially gutted to hear Trump and Musk denigrate their work as wasteful.

""Work is such a fundamental part of our identity,"" Allan said. When it's suddenly lost, ""it can be really devastating to your sense of purpose and identity, your sense of social mattering, especially when it's in a climate of devaluing what you do.""

Andrew Hazelton, a scientist in Florida, was working on improving hurricane forecasts when he was fired in February from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The mass firings were carried out ""with no humanity,"" he said. ""And that's really tough.""

Hazelton became a federal employee in October but had worked alongside NOAA scientists for over eight years, including as an employee at the University of Miami. He lost his job as part of a purge targeting probationary workers, who lack civil service protections against firings.

His friends set up a GoFundMe crowdfunding page to provide a financial cushion for him, his wife, and their four children. Then in March, after a federal judge's order requiring federal agencies to rescind those terminations, he was notified that he had been reinstated on paid administrative leave.

""It's created a lot of instability,"" said Hazelton, who still isn't being allowed to do his work. ""We just want to serve the public and get our forecasts and our data out there to help people make decisions, regardless of politics.""

Along with their jobs, many federal workers are losing their health insurance, leaving them ill equipped to seek care just as they and their families are facing a tidal wave of potential mental and physical health consequences. And the nation's mental health system is already underfunded, understaffed, and overstretched. Even with insurance, many people wait weeks or months to receive care.

""Most people don't have a bunch of money sitting around to spend on therapy when you need to cover your mortgage for a couple months and try to find a different job,"" Allan said.

A second NIH worker considered talking to a psychiatrist and potentially going on an antidepressant because of anxiety after being fired in February.

""And then the first thought after that was: 'Oh, I'm about to not have insurance. I can't do that,'"" said the worker, who was granted anonymity to avoid professional retaliation. The worker's health benefits were set to end in April — leaving too little time to get an appointment with a psychiatrist, let alone start a prescription.

""I don't want to go on something and then have to stop it immediately,"" the worker said.

The employee, one of several NIH workers reinstated this month, still fears getting fired again. The worker focuses on Alzheimer's and related dementias and was inspired to join the agency because a grandmother has the disease.

The worker worries that ""decades of research are going to be gone and people are going to be left with nothing.""

""I go from anxiety to deep sadness when I think about my own family,"" the employee said.

The NIH, with its $47 billion annual budget, is the largest public funder of biomedical research in the world. The agency awarded nearly 59,000 grants in fiscal 2023, but the Trump administration has begun canceling hundreds of grants on research topics that new political appointees oppose, including vaccine hesitancy and the health of LGBTQ+ populations.

The NIH worker who worked at the National Institute on Aging was informed in mid-March that she would be on paid administrative leave ""until further notice."" She said she is not sure whether she would find a similar job, adding that she ""cannot be at home doing nothing.""

Apart from loving her job, she said, she has one child in college and another in high school and needs stable income. ""I don't know what I'm going to do next.""

We'd like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what's happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

A groundbreaking new study of young people's digital media use has revealed surprising results, including evidence that smartphone ownership may actually benefit children.

The study also suggests a link between social media posting and various negative outcomes, as well as data connecting cyberbullying to depression, anger and signs of dependence on digital media.

The Life in Media Survey, led by a team of researchers at the University of South Florida in collaboration with The Harris Poll, conducted a survey of more than 1,500 11-to-13-year-olds in Florida. The findings will inform a 25-year national study that will track young people's digital media use and wellbeing into adulthood. The findings are embargoed until Tuesday, March 25, at 6 a.m. ET and may be publicly released at that time.

Key findings include:

""We went into this study expecting to find what many researchers, teachers and other observers assume: smartphone ownership is harmful to children. Not only was that not the case, most of the time we found the opposite – that owning a smartphone was associated with positive outcomes,"" said Justin D. Martin, lead researcher on the project and the Eleanor Poynter Jamison Chair in Media Ethics and Press Policy as USF.

Based on the findings, the research team of experts from journalism, psychology, public health, political science and communications, as well as a researcher from the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, provide a few recommendations:

Our findings indicate that the effects of smartphone ownership are complex. It's what kids do with cell phones and challenges in regulating their device use, rather than merely owning a smartphone, that may cause difficulties or inversely benefit their lives.""

Wendy Rote, Associate Professor, Psychology, University of South Florida

Informed by this survey, the research team will now prepare to start a nationwide, long-term study of some 8,000 children in early adolescence. 

The Life in Media Survey is the first lifespan study of its kind examining digital media use. It sets out to track participants from youth to adulthood to learn more about the long-term health and wellness impacts of smartphones, social media and other digital media and devices. 

Research will be conducted over the next 25 years, and data collected every six months will give ongoing insight to parents, teachers, researchers, health providers and others on the impact of digital media use on children and as they age into adults.

""Our data provide a snapshot of how the media influences young people in the moment. But many of the problems and benefits of media use accumulate over time, which is why it is essential to also conduct a long-term study to accurately assess the effects of digital media on wellbeing through an individual's life,"" said Stephen Song, co-principal investigator and USF assistant professor of journalism.

Researchers hope to determine how digital media impacts and changes attitudes, behaviors and health throughout people's lives. For example, over time, the Life in Media Survey will be able to provide specifics about the impact of six-second videos on developing brains, the effects of staring at screens for five hours a day on eyesight and how online socialization in childhood affects sociability at age 30.

A special unit that began as a cold case task force recently helped secure a murder indictment against an active-duty airman accused of killing a missing Native American woman.

Quinterius Chappelle, 24, an aircraft inspection journeyman stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday for the alleged murder of 21-year-old Sahela ""Shy"" Toka Win Sangrait, who friends and family told Fox News Digital was his girlfriend of about one year.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Missing and Murdered Unit (MMU) became involved in the case March 10, when a state lab confirmed a DNA sample from the body matched Sangrait, a registered tribal member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.

""At that point in time, our criminal investigators were notified and were brought online with it,"" MMU Regional Agent In Charge Robert Schoeberl told Fox News Digital in an interview Friday.

Active-duty Us Airman Charged In Killing Of Missing Woman On Military Base

The unit originated as a cold case task force, part of operation ""Lady Justice,"" a multi-agency initiative established by the Trump administration in 2019 to improve the functioning of the criminal justice system and address the staggering number of missing and murdered Native Americans in tribal communities, according to Schoeberl.

In February, the BIA announced the Office of Justice Services launched ""Operation Spirit Return"" in conjunction with MMU.

Homicide was among the top three most frequent causes of death among American Indian and Alaska Native females aged 15 to 24, as of 2019, according to data provided by the National Congress of American Indians. More than four in five indigenous women experience sexual violence in their lifetime.

The Not Invisible Act was also passed by Congress during Trump's first term in 2020, aimed at addressing the rampant number of missing persons and murder and trafficking of American Indian and Alaska Native peoples.

""President Trump is the president of law and order, and he is always working to deliver justice for victims of violent crime,"" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

According to a redacted indictment, Chappelle, an airman basic who has been in the service since 2019, allegedly ""unlawfully, and with premeditation and with malice aforethought"" killed Sangrait at Ellsworth Air Force Base on or about Aug. 11, 2024.

The Pennington County Sheriff's Office said Sangrait, of Box Elder, was reported missing Aug. 10, just one day prior to when authorities claim she was killed.

Isabela Arroyo, Sangrait's sister, told Fox News Digital Chappelle was verbally abusive toward Sangrait, who had a one-way plane ticket to move in with Arroyo and her husband in Colorado Sept. 6.

Sangrait told Chappelle she was going to go to Colorado for the birth of Arroyo's son Sept. 27, her sister said. However, it is unclear if Chappelle found out about her plan to remain in Colorado.

""She never got on the plane,"" Arroyo said. ""It was really hard. I had assumed that she had just chosen not to come anymore, and, unfortunately, that wasn't the case.""

Sangrait's body, discarded in a wooded area near the Pennington and Custer County line, was discovered by a hiker March 4, about seven months after her disappearance.

The sheriff's office said the body was ""badly decomposed"" and there was ""no identifying information available.""

The cause of death has not yet been released.

Tayagonique McGloghlon, who met Sangrait in 2021 while participating in a program for young adults who recently aged out of foster care, told Fox News Digital the prospective nurse would call her every week, but, similar to Arroyo, the last she heard from Sangrait was Aug. 10.

""The last message I got from her was on Aug. 10, and she asked me if I was OK,"" McGloghlon said. ""The day before that, I called her about three times. The third time I called, it went straight to voicemail — like her phone had been turned off for me, which I thought was really weird. … It put me off in a weird way.""

McGloghlon said she tried sending Sangrait messages on social media, thinking maybe she had been blocked.

""I was like, 'That's not like her, especially when she always kept in contact with me,'"" she said.

McGloghlon, who met Chappelle while he was dating one of her friends prior to Sangrait, said she always found him ""a little bit weird"" and ""never liked him,"" but Sangrait only told her good things.

""I was devastated [when her remains were found],"" McGloghlon said. ""Honestly, I've never been more heartbroken. She's the light in this world. She didn't deserve that. … She was very spirited and such a good friend. She was a kind soul, just beautiful. I miss her so much. She was one of my best friends.""

Cassidy Wimble, another one of Sangrait's friends, told Fox News Digital she had yet to meet Chappelle in person, but he was one of the first people she reached out to after the disappearance.

""He told me, 'I don't know anything. I wish we [could] find her,'"" Wimble said. ""He said the same thing to a few people.""

MMU investigators collaborate with the federal National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) database and Othram, a Texas-based company that specializes in forensic genetic genealogy, to identify human remains.

""It's more advanced forensic testing, which a lot of the evidence from this case will run through,"" Schoeberl said.""[Othram] tests relatives, basically identifying you through your family members' DNA. It's been very beneficial in solving and helping solve cases recently.""

As part of the Sangrait investigation, the unit also interviewed witnesses, conducted searches and notified family of the death.

The MMU's Victim Services Program continues to provide the family with daily updates as the investigation continues, and the unit remains in close contact with the FBI and other agencies assisting with the case.

U.S. Attorney for the District of South Dakota Alison J. Ramsdell said prosecutors will pursue justice ""relentlessly.""

""The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Dakota will now proceed with the prosecution of this tragic case and relentlessly pursue justice on behalf of the victim,"" Ramsdell wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Wife Convicted Of Murdering Army Soldier Husband At Home On Military Base

Arroyo said it helps to know her sister will get justice and Chappelle is now in custody, unable to harm anyone else.

""It's just how long he was able to walk around like nothing happened,"" Arroyo said. ""He has already denied even knowing my sister. When they initially arrested him, he didn't say a word. He didn't even ask why he was being arrested.""

Chappelle is being held by the U.S. Marshals Service at the Pennington County Jail in Rapid City, South Dakota.

Fox News Digital obtained a scheduling and case management order signed by U.S. District Judge Camela C. Theeler, noting a jury trial is set for May 27.

Attorney Gina Ruggieri, who filed a notice stating she would be representing Chappelle instead of his previously appointed public defender, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fort Ellsworth said it is working closely with area law enforcement agencies.

""First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of Sahela,"" Col. Derek Oakley, 28th Bomb Wing commander, previously told Fox News Digital when Chappelle was initially charged with second-degree murder in a federal criminal complaint. ""We hold Airmen accountable for their actions, and if service members are found in violation of military or civilian law, they will be punished.""

After the indictment, Fort Ellsworth officials, in response to a request for comment, referred Fox News Digital to the U.S. Attorney's Office of South Dakota, citing the jurisdiction change.

Wimble, who said she spoke with Sangrait every day, described her as one of the strongest people she knew.

""She was one of the most resilient people that I knew,"" Wimble said. ""You could knock her down, and like bowling pins, she'd stand up every single time. … She was very strong, and she knew herself more than anybody. She was the kindest person I knew. Especially with all the things that she's gone through. … She's everything to me. … She really deserved a life.""

The Air Force and Pennington County Sheriff's Office declined Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

The FBI and U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital.

Vandals have targeted a newly-opened health centre in Newport according to a health board report. The Aneurin Bevan University Health Board has reported a ""number of incidents"" at the 19 Hills Health and Wellbeing Centre in Ringland since its opening in January.

Incidents have varied from ""trespassing and vandalism by young people in the area to a car crashing into the building"", according to a spokesman for the health board. As a result discussions are under way about having a police community support officer (PCSO) partly stationed at the facility.

A health board report addressing ""ongoing security issues"" at the Ringland Circle site was presented to health board members on Wednesday. The document indicates that as a reaction to these security concerns security personnel have been on duty at the centre in recent weeks.

The spokesman for the health board confirmed that all incidents had been promptly reported to the police who have provided ""timely responses and support"". Efforts are being made to maximise safety in the area with plans for the local PCSO to regularly work from the site, they said.

The 19 Hills centre opened in January aiming to cater for patients from Ringland Medical Practice, Park Surgery, and Ringland Dental Surgery along with offering a variety of other health services once it is fully functional.

The number of Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) Council staff who can't attend work due to mental health reasons is a “cause for concern” with one councillor suggesting the use of mental health first aiders. At a council overview and scrutiny committee on Monday, March 24, councillors discussed the workforce health data which showed that during 2024 there were 147,905 working days lost due to sickness absence.

The highest percentage of sickness absence was in community and children's services (7%) with 5.5 % being long-term absences (more than 28 days). Mental health (not bereavement related) was the biggest reason for absence at 30.5% across the council with community and children's services showing the highest levels at 33.7%.

Councillor Scott Emanuel said: “The level of staff citing mental health as a reason why they can't attend work is a cause for concern. But I think it's really important we recognise that some of our staff work in departments, children's services or housing or anything, where they can see some really distressing stuff and it is going to take a toll on their mental health.”

He said he sees the council is doing lots to support them and hopes they can do everything they can. He said he had trained as a mental health first aider through the charity Mind and found they were really effective because not everybody who is struggling wants to go and tell their manager.

He said mental health first aiders are there to signpost or just listen saying: “I think potentially mental health first aiders could be a good initiative for Rhondda Cynon Taf if you'd be prepared to explore it.” Councillor Ros Davis said she had also done that training and she thinks it's really excellent and something she would support. To get all the very latest Wales Online health news, sign up to our health newsletter here.

She said: “We do know that mental health is a problem across the UK and has been more of a problem since Covid. However I think that we as an authority need to make sure that we are not impacting adversely on people's mental health and so I do think we could do with more data to look at where those issues lie and is there any pattern to it, is there any correlation to it?

“Is there any correlation between home working and poor mental health?” In a response to a question from Councillor Julie Edwards the director of human resources Richard Evans said they've got a number of processes in place to support staff including digital and face-to-face support.

He said they can provide regular counselling to people if they feel they need it and regular mental health and wellbeing support. But Mr Evans said a lot of it comes down to volume with the numbers staying constant.

He said a lot of the issues are around outside influences such as the cost of living and personal issues. Mr Evans said they've put a lot of investment into mental health support but they could do a deeper dive to get more information for councillors.

Responding to a question from Councillor Gareth Hughes he said they are looking at different ways to promote mental health services to frontline staff who haven't got digital access on a day-to-day basis. He also said managers should make people aware of the services available.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}"

Another high-major vacancy is off the board.

West Virginia has hired North Texas coach Ross Hodge on a five-year contract, sources told CBS Sports. An official announcement is expected on Wednesday, and certainly no later than Thursday. Timing for Hodge's introductory press conference is to-be-determined because, according to a source, because North Texas is still playing in the NIT. The Mean Green won at Oklahoma State on Tuesday night and will play in the semifinals at Hinkle Fieldhouse in Indianapolis next Tuesday. Hodge will coach North Texas until the end of its season, one source added.

Hodge became the primary target for Mountaineers AD Wren Baker after trying to land Ben McCollum (who took the Iowa job) and making contact with Richard Pitino (who left New Mexico for Xavier). Hodge interviewed for the job in Texas last week with West Virginia officials.

The 44-year-old Hodge spent the past two seasons at North Texas and has a 46-23 record overall, with a second-place finish in the American Athletic Conference this season. This season's team is 27-8 despite losing starters last year in the portal to the likes of St. John's, Michigan and Vanderbilt — all teams that qualified for the NCAAs. 

Hodge, who has been coaching at the junior-college and mid-major level since graduating from Texas A&M-Commerce in 2003, is considered one of the sharpest defensive minds in college basketball. UNT has been one of the tougher programs to scheme against on the that end of the floor — not just in the past two seasons, but in the years prior, when Hodge was the program's defensive coordinator under former coach Grant McCasland (now at Texas Tech). 

With West Virginia's vacancy now closed, Villanova is the lone high-major program yet to fill.

If there's any narrative that holds true in the NFL, it's hard to win a Super Bowl. Of course it's hard to even get to a Super Bowl, yet alone win one. 

Tom Brady blocked several quarterbacks from winning Super Bowl titles in the midst of the New England Patriots dynasty, making Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger's two Super Bowl titles all the more impressive. Patrick Mahomes is doing the same in today's NFL, winning three Super Bowl titles and preventing MVP quarterbacks from getting to the Super Bowl. 

Two quarterbacks have beaten Mahomes in the Super Bowl: Brady and Jalen Hurts. The Philadelphia Eagles quarterback is just one of three players to beat Mahomes in the playoffs, creating his own legacy with his first Super Bowl title. Hurts has been to two Super Bowl at this stage in his career -- and he is only 27 years old. 

With Hurts leading the Eagles to a championship, quarterbacks on good teams can go toe to toe with Mahomes and win. An entire roster is responsible for producing a championship team, but the quarterback gets the most praise and criticism because they touch the ball on every offensive possession and get paid the most money -- hence the never-ending spotlight. 

With Hurts winning the Super Bowl, which quarterback is under the most pressure to secure the Lombardi Trophy in 2025? These five will certainly be monitored over the course of the year. 

Joe Burrow is one of the three quarterbacks to beat Mahomes in the postseason, leading a comeback in Arrowhead Stadium to win the AFC Championship game and take the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl. That was three years ago. 

The Bengals have missed the playoffs in back-to-back years, but that hasn't been Burrow's fault. Burrow has completed 69.2% of his passes and thrown 58 touchdowns to just 15 interceptions over the past two seasons. He's third in the league in completion rate, fourth in touchdown passes, fifth in touchdown rate (5.7%), and fourth in passer rating (102.2).

The 2024 Bengals allowed the most points per game in losses in NFL history (27.8), and had six losses with 25+ points last season. Burrow was the third quarterback in league history with 40+ passing touchdowns in a season (43) who missed the playoffs while leading the league with 4,918 passing yards. 

So why is there pressure on Burrow? The Bengals need Burrow to perform at a high level every week to win games, and lose games when Burrow is just ""good."" Burrow has a loaded group of pass catchers, but a poor offensive line and a bad defense. He has to play excellent in order for the Bengals to win football games. 

Perhaps if the Bengals get their roster construction figured out, Burrow can make deep playoff runs again. His quarterback success will be skewed until that's figured out. 

Jared Goff is certainly a good quarterback, and found a home as the franchise quarterback in Detroit. Over the last two seasons, the Lions are 27-7 in Goff's starts as Goff has thrown 67 touchdown passes to 24 interceptions. Of quarterbacks with 500+ pass attempts over the last two seasons, Goff is second in completion percentage (69.7%), first in passing yards (9,204), second in touchdown passes, fourth in touchdown rate (5.9%), and second in passer rating (104.4). 

The Lions have reached at least the divisional round of the playoffs over the last two seasons, yet Goff's completion percentage (66.2%), touchdown rate (3.3%), yards per attempt (7.6), and passer rating (91.8) have all declined. The Lions also were the first team in NFL history to lose consecutive playoff games while scoring 30+ points. 

Goff is the third quarterback to win 13+ games in a season for two different teams (Brady, Peyton Manning) yet is just 4-5 in the playoffs while completing 61.2% of his passes with an 85.1 passer rating. Can Goff perform well enough in the playoffs to win a championship? 

The Lions are in ""win-now"" mode, and have an excellent chance to win the Super Bowl in 2025. There's a lot of pressure for Goff to exercise his playoff demons and get Detroit to the Super Bowl, especially for a franchise that has never been to the Super Bowl. 

Outside of an MVP award, Dak Prescott has accomplished nearly everything a quarterback could accomplish in the regular season. He's won a Rookie of the Year award, been an MVP runner-up, was selected to an All-Pro team, and won multiple division titles. The Cowboys are 76-46 in Prescott's starts and never had a losing season in which Prescott has started 10+ games. 

For all the regular-season success Prescott has, that doesn't seem to translate to the playoffs. Prescott is 2-5 in his postseason career, tied for the worst postseason record for any quarterback who has made a minimum of five playoff starts. He still hasn't made a conference championship game in his 10 seasons in the league, despite quarterbacking a team that has won 12+ games in four of the five times he has made the postseason.

Prescott's two playoff wins were against teams with a combined 18-15 record (.545 win percentage). His playoff losses are against teams with a combined 57-27 record (.679), three of which were at home. The Cowboys are 5-13 in the playoffs since winning their last Super Bowl in the 1995 season and have the NFL record for most consecutive playoff appearances without reaching a conference championship game (12). 

Prescott is turning 32 this year. The clock is ticking on him delivering a championship to Dallas, no matter how good or bad the roster is around him. 

There's no denying how good Lamar Jackson is in the regular season, as his two MVP awards are a clear indication of his success. Jackson has one of the best win percentages in the regular season since the 1970 merger (third at .745) and is the youngest quarterback to win two MVP awards. 

Jackson was the first player with 40+ passing touchdowns and fewer than five interceptions in a season last year. He's the first quarterback in NFL history with 4,000+ yards passing and 800+ yards rushing in a season and is the first player to lead qualified quarterbacks in the NFL in passer rating (119.4) and rushing yards (915) in a season.

The NFL's all-time rushing yards leader for quarterbacks (6,173), Jackson is the only player with multiple MVP awards who doesn't have a championship. His struggles in the postseason are well known, as Jackson is 3-5 with 13 total touchdowns and 11 turnovers in his playoff career.

Jackson's .745 win percentage is the best ever by a quarterback without a Super Bowl title, as he has multiple turnovers in four of eight playoff games. He's the only multiple-time MVP quarterback with a losing record in the playoffs, as the Ravens average 18.6 points per game in Jackson's starts in the playoffs compared to 28.7 in the regular season. 

The Ravens have only been to one conference championship game in the Jackson era, as Jackson has never had a season with multiple playoff wins. For as good as Jackson and the Ravens have been in the regular season, the opposite has happened in the playoffs. 

Baltimore has 78 wins over the last seven seasons, the most for any team without a Super Bowl appearance in NFL history. The pressure will always be on Jackson until he can lead the Ravens to a Super Bowl. 

How close does Josh Allen have to get to win a Super Bowl? For as good as Allen has been in the playoffs, he still hasn't been able to defeat Mahomes and the Chiefs. Allen actually has a winning record in the playoffs (7-6) with 33 total touchdowns to just six turnovers. Over his last five playoff games, Allen has 13 total touchdowns to zero turnovers.

The postseason success doesn't stop there. Allen is the all-time playoff leader in interception rate (0.9%), touchdown-to-interception ratio (25-4), total yards per game (311.0), and total touchdowns per game (2.5). He's the only player to average 250 passing yards and 50 rushing yards per game in playoff history. 

Allen has the most total touchdowns in a player's first seven seasons (262) in NFL history and has three postseasons with having 6+ total touchdowns and zero interceptions without making the Super Bowl. The Bills have scored the most points per game (29.1) and allowed the fewest points per game (19.6) over the last five years -- and haven't made the Super Bowl.

So why is there so much pressure on Allen? The Bills can't get past the Chiefs in the playoffs, no matter how well Allen plays. There are other factors outside of Allen, who has the most playoff wins without reaching a Super Bowl (seven). The Bills just can't get out of their own way, and that includes Allen failing to convert a quarterback sneak on a ""Tush Push"" on fourth down in a conference championship game. 

Allen is a great quarterback and has all the intangibles to win a Super Bowl. Since the Bills can't beat the Chiefs in the playoffs (where Allen is 0-4 against Mahomes), the pressure is constantly on Allen and Buffalo to win that elusive first Super Bowl title. 

Allen has put the Bills in position to win a championship. Once Buffalo gets past Kansas City, the Bills may be on their way toward finally hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy. There's so much pressure on Allen when he plays the Chiefs, which is why he's under more pressure than any quarterback to win in 2025.

The days are warmer, the sunlight lasts a little longer and baseball is here. Hope springs eternal, but that shouldn't just apply to baseball. We're looking at reasons for each NHL team to be hopeful in this edition of NHL Power Rankings.

For MLB fans watching their favorite team's season get underway, the crushing reality that it will almost certainly end without a World Series hasn't set in yet. The same can't be said for NHL fans with just a dozen games left in the regular season, but that doesn't mean we can't mine a little hope out of even the worst circumstances.

One team not lacking hope these days is the St. Louis Blues. They've won seven games in a row and have pulled within two spots of the first wild card spot in the West. This turnaround, which began under new coach Jim Montgomery, has been fueled by elite defense. That's not something I expected to type about this Blues team, but I can't deny the results.

Since Montgomery made his debut on Nov. 25, St. Louis has allowed expected goals against at the lowest rate in the NHL, per Natural Stat Trick. In the month of March, the Blues have allowed two or fewer goals in nine of their 13 games. That has powered the hot streak that has the team looking incredibly dangerous with the playoffs just a few weeks away.

As the Blues build hope for another surprising Cup run, here are the updated NHL Power Rankings with one reason every team should feel hopeful.

CFL's Roughriders reportedly add former 49ers, Cowboys QB to 2025 negotiation list","https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/whats-next-for-trey-lance-cfls-roughriders-reportedly-add-former-49ers-cowboys-qb-to-2025-negotiation-list/","Wed, 26 Mar 2025 14:06:36 GMT","

Four years after he was the No. 3 overall pick in the NFL Draft, Trey Lance is without a team, drawing little interest as a free agent this offseason. An opportunity awaits the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback across the border, however, as the Canadian Football League's Saskatchewan Roughriders added Lance to their negotiation list this week, according to TSN.

The move gives the Roughriders exclusive rights to negotiate a prospective contract with Lance, provided the former North Dakota State standout is interested. CFL teams are permitted to name up to 45 players to the negotiating list, and each of those players are eligible to negotiate a contract as long as they aren't currently under contract with another team or league. In Lance's case, as a free agent, he could sign with the Roughriders immediately, if he so desired.

Last seen as the Dallas Cowboys' No. 3 quarterback, Lance does have family ties to the Roughriders. His father, Carlton, once played one season as a cornerback for Saskatchewan, earning CFL All-Rookie honors.

Trey Lance, meanwhile, has gone from potential face of the 49ers to afterthought backup in his young NFL career. San Francisco traded up to select him in 2021, tabbing him the successor to Jimmy Garoppolo, but injuries limited the Minnesota native to eight games over his first two seasons. He was then traded to the Cowboys after Brock Purdy's emergence as the 49ers' unlikely starter, spending the last two years behind both Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush in Dallas, where he appeared in just four total games.

Xavier athletic director Greg Christopher flew to New Mexico on Tuesday to try and convince Lobos men's basketball coach Richard Pitino to be the next coach of the Musketeers.

He got it done.

On Tuesday night Pitino accepted, sources told CBS Sports. 

Xavier announced the deal late Tuesday night.

""Xavier is one of the great brands in all of college basketball,"" Pitino said in a statement. ""It has always been a dream of mine to coach in the Big East. The Cintas Center is going to be rocking. I can't wait to get to work.""

The six-year deal came together over the course of the day, and Pitino was wooed to the gig despite being in contact with VCU, Villanova and West Virginia in recent days, according to sources. In fact, VCU had Pitino at the top of its list. Once Pitino turned down VCU, that program pivoted and is hiring Bryant's Phil Martelli Jr., sources told CBS Sports.

Richard Pitino will now coach in the same league as his father, Rick, who will be in Year 3 next season at St. John's. Both were knocked out of the second round of the NCAA Tournament on consecutive nights this past weekend, but they made history by becoming the first father and son to win tourney games in the same season. 

Sources said that Rick and Richard will welcome the rare opportunity to coach against each other. That's backed by the fact that the two scheduled a game at Madison Square Garden this past season, with St. John's beating New Mexico 85-71.

In 13 seasons as a Division I coach, Pitino's career record is 247-186.

Pitino is succeeding Sean Miller, who abruptly left Xavier for a second time, opting to take the Texas job on Sunday. That came with a lot of blowback.

Sources said the circumstances surrounding Miller's messy exit wound up affecting Charleston coach Chris Mack's candidacy. He would have been a two-time hire at the school, just like Miller was when he was brought back in 2022. But unlike Miller, Mack spent nearly two decades of his life at Xavier -- and is the winningest coach in program history.

""Poorly handled,"" said one connected source to Miller's departure.

It's the first time in generations Xavier has made a hire in men's basketball that didn't have a direct connection to the university. 

Pitino went at 88-49 in the Mountain West while at New Mexico and participated in the past two NCAA Tournaments. As a No. 10 seed, the Lobos upset Marquette in the first round before losing to second-seeded Michigan State 71-63 on Sunday. He previously coached at FIU and Minnesota, spending eight years at the latter and taking the program to NCAAs in 2017, when he earned Big Ten Coach of the Year honors, and in 2019. 

Pitino was fired by Minnesota after the 2020-21 season but quickly resurfaced at New Mexico. The Lobos were 13-19 in his first season before winning a combined 75 games over the last three seasons. Under his watch, UNM won the Mountain West tournament title in 2024 and won the league's regular season crown this year, led by Mountain West Player of the Year Donovan Dent.

Hours before Pitino's commitment to Xavier, Dent went into the transfer portal. It's to-be-determined whether or not one of the best guards in college basketball will follow his coach to the Big East.

Milwaukee Bucks star Damian Lillard has been diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf, the team announced on Tuesday. He has been ruled out indefinitely and has been put on blood-thinning medication, which the Bucks say has stabilized the DVT as he begins the process for ""a healthy return to play."" 

He will continue to be tested regularly, the team said, and there is cautious optimism in Milwaukee that Lillard might be able to return this season, league sources told CBS Sports NBA insider Bill Reiter. 

""Damian's health is our No. 1 priority,"" Bucks general manager Jon Horst said in a statement. ""We will support him as he moves through this weekly process of strict criteria to ensure that it is safe for him to return to play. Doctors have indicated that his situation is very unlikely to occur again. We are thankful that this was identified and medicated quickly, which helps with the recovery.""

Lillard, who is averaging 24.9 points and 7.1 assists per game, gave a statement of his own to NBA reporter Chris Haynes:

""It's unfortunate that something outside of my control would come up,"" he said. ""Along with the Bucks' medical staff, our priorities are to protect my health and safety. As much as I love basketball, I need to be there for my kids and my family. I'm grateful the Bucks acted quickly on this. They've been supportive and proactive throughout this process. I look forward to moving past this and continuing my career.""

Lillard is the second NBA All-Star to be diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis this season, joining Spurs star Victor Wembanyama. Wembanyama was ruled out for the season on Feb. 20. 

Lillard, 34, has missed the Bucks' last three games, including being listed as out with a right calf strain for Monday night's loss to the Suns. While sidelined, he underwent imaging on the calf but nothing had shown up. At that point, Lillard, a nine-time All-Star, was understandably frustrated with not being able to identify the root of a lingering problem. 

""It's been frustrating just obviously not being able to play this point in the season, but just trying to learn more,"" he said Monday, via the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. 

Now, after further testing revealed a blood clot, Lillard finally has clarity on what he's dealing with and can take the necessary steps to regain his health. The best news is the belief that this is unlikely to occur again. It's a serious situation, no doubt, but for now at least it doesn't sound like one that could jeopardize Lillard's career. 

However, Lillard's absence is a blow for the Bucks as they jockey for postseason positioning with 11 games remaining in the regular season. After Monday's loss, the Bucks fell to 40-31. They currently are two games behind the Pacers (42-29) for the No. 4 seed in the Eastern Conference and a half-game ahead of the Pistons (40-32) for the No. 5 seed.

The New England Patriots struggled in 2024, finishing the season 4-13 with major issues on both sides of the ball. They did, however, have a few bright spots that gave the team some hope for the future. 

One of those bright spots was quarterback Drake Maye, the team's No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, who moved up from QB2 to starter in his rookie year. Maye's potential was noticed by Mike Vrabel, so much so that the QB became one of the reasons the former Patriots linebacker chose to reunite with his old team as its new head coach.

The New England fan favorite gave some insight on why his one-year hiatus from being a head coach ended in Foxborough. 

""I see a young, athletic, talented, full-of-potential player,"" Vrabel said on OutKick's Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich. ""Excited to build this team around (him) and a large part of the reason why I wanted to be here. And just that talent level, to be able to build around him and to be able to grow and help him and lead and run an offense and run a football team is something that I'm excited about.""

Vrabel had high praise from what he saw from Maye in Year 1. The 22-year-old finished with 2,276 yards, 15 touchdowns and 10 interceptions as well as 421 yards rushing, third on the team, and two TDs on the ground in 13 games, with 12 starts. Despite having an offensive line with little consistency and no star wideouts to throw to, Maye was able to prove he can make smart decisions with the ball.

Vrabel liked that if the call doesn't go as planned, Maye has the ability to use his legs to extend the play. The Patriots new head coach does not feel like he will have to limit the playbook with Maye leading the offense. 

""He can throw from in the pocket, he can throw off platform, he can run, he can scramble,"" Vrabel said, discussing his quarterback. ""You can design some things for him. So I think you have pretty much everything in the playbook that you could possibly want available. He's not just a pocket passer. He's not just a guy that's going to run. So there's a lot of different ways that we're hoping that he can be successful.""

After Jerod Mayo was fired following one year on the job, the search began for the next head coach and Vrabel was rumored during the entire search to be high on New England's list of choices. Thanks in part to Maye, the Pats got the guy they wanted.

The Patriots added some pieces during the offseason, which should only boost Maye's potential. This week, the team landed wide receiver Stefon Diggs. His veteran presence should have a significant impact on an offense that looked deflated in 2024. 

The Patriots also still have the draft to help them piece together a winning team and they currently sit at No. 4 overall. The Patriots have historically not found as much success as other teams in the draft, but their approach this year has changed.

New England executive vice president of player personnel Eliot Wolf says rather than going for what the team needs, they will select the best player available.

This will not be Vrabel's first draft experience as a head coach. He was the Tennessee Titans lead man from 2018 to 2023. Vrabel has already helped the Patriots make some much needed moves in the offseason and now all eyes will be on him to see who the team will select with its top five pick.

Well, we've hit the George Costanza portion of the coaching carousel. 

By that I mean:

Tuesday night brought a quicker-than-expected development: Xavier was able to hire New Mexico coach Richard Pitino. The deal got done in Albuquerque on Tuesday night and it's for six years. That means Pitino will coach against his father, Rick, twice a season (at least). Pitino beat out Charleston coach Chris Mack for the opening, passing on potential opportunities at Villanova, VCU and West Virginia in the process. 

VCU moved extremely quickly once Pitino was off the table; 43-year-old Bryant coach Phil Martelli Jr. will be leaving Rhode Island to head down to Richmond, Virginia, to coach the Rams on a six-year deal.

Previously ...

Sean Miller left Xavier to be the coach at Texas. It's a move that shocked — and angered — people at Xavier (understandably so). Miller was there for three seasons, took the Musketeers to two NCAA Tournaments and decided to bolt for Austin, Texas, and the promise of a bigger program in a bigger league with bigger money. Xavier was left to scramble and hire a coach just as the portal opens. 

What's more, Josh Pastner agreed Monday night to be the next coach at UNLV, per sources. Pastner coveted the job from the moment it opened and was able to break through a long list of candidates interviewed there. He'll have a five-year deal and the press conference will be Wednesday. Pastner's career record is 276-187. He spent the past two seasons working in television, but I spoke to Pastner as recently as February and he told me then he was eager and wanting to get back into coaching this cycle. UNLV was for sure the best job opportunity available to him. 

It's entirely possible we'll have one or two more job swaps before the Sweet 16 gets going again Thursday night, so that in mind, here are the other recent hirings ... which also prompted job openings. 

» Ben McCollum leaves Drake after one year to run Iowa» Niko Medved goes home to guide Minnesota» VCU's Ryan Odom is now at Virginia» Will Wade is on the ground at NC State

I've got more in the capsules below, including other hirings that are now a week-plus old.

As we told ya earlier this week, we'd hit 40 coaching flips before the tournament revved up again. And so it is. Check in all of them below.

The 2025 MLB season is upon us, and that means beautiful days and nights at the ballpark featuring delicious eats. While it's hard to beat the classics, this season will feature some wild snacks that fans can really sink their teeth into.

MLB teams are always trying to give fans more reasons to come out to the park and spend their hard-earned money at the concession stand. This year is no different with many teams introducing some fun, unique and weird menu items.

In many cases, teams have taken those classic ballpark foods like hot dogs, fries and burgers and put a fresh spin on them, for better or worse. How about a footlong hotdog smothered in mac and cheese? Maybe a dessert quesadilla will catch your eye on the concourse. Whether you prefer sweet or savory flavors, there are foods on this list for you.

Before the first pitches are thrown, let's look at the 10 wildest new menu items at MLB ballparks in 2025.

The Diamondbacks decided to throw a bunch of random ingredients on cajun fries, and there have been worse culinary ideas. Between the white cheddar mac and cheese, the pork belly bacon and the crispy onions, there is a lot to like about this very chaotic dish. Plus, any D-backs fan who shows up hungry won't need to eat for a week after taking these down.

An homage to its Polish Hill community, the Pirates are offering some unique local flair at PNC Park. Pirates fans can enjoy these fried balls full of egg noodles, kielbasa, cabbage, bacon and cheddar cheese. These sound delicious, and they're a nice handheld snack to eat at your seat.

This one is like a ""Man vs. Food"" challenge, except you can eat it while watching one of the most exciting teams in baseball. Fans better bring their appetite for this burger, which features two beef patties, queso and fried onions all in the same bite. Oh, and did I mention the pretzel bun? Anyone who gets this down in nine innings deserves an award.

New massive White Sox milkshake just dropped 👀Introducing the Celebration Cake Shake 🎂Made with Birthday Cake ice cream, confetti cake, a pinwheel cookie and a maraschino cherry(via @whitesox) pic.twitter.com/zkGE271Mxf

The White Sox are celebrating their 125th anniversary this year, and that might be all the celebrating that happens at Rate Field this season. In honor of their birthday, the White Sox are selling some birthday cake and ice cream -- just blended up and served in a cup with cake chunks and a cookie. This is one of the more indulgent items on the list, and it has my interest.

This footlong ballpark dog is topped with a few different appetizers one might order at your local BBQ joint. The Daddy Mac Dog also features brisket, mac and cheese and fried pickles. Eating this hotdog is probably a two- or three-person mission.

A whoopie pie is a classic treat, and the Royals have put their own spin on it this year. There will be no missing these when fans are snacking on these in the stands. No word yet on whether Kyle MacLachlan and Laura Dern were involved in creating this odd ballpark dessert.

The Yankees will have tiramisu helmets at games this year 🤤Made with espresso mascarpone cream, lady finger cookies, cocoa powder pic.twitter.com/ikvquRbfYZ

If you've ever been eating ice cream out of a novelty helmet on a hot summer day, you know that it can sometimes turn to soup before you even get it back to your seat. Well, the Yankees have solved that problem with Helmet Tiramisu. Fans still get their souvenir helmet, but they don't have to worry about dessert turning to liquid in 60 seconds.

Have you ever wanted to make s'mores at a baseball game but local regulations banned open flames at the ballpark? The Phillies have found a loophole with their new S'mores Quesadillas, which are actually pretty brilliant. You can get all that delicious s'mores flavor without worrying about a melted chocolate bar dripping onto your new Bryce Harper jersey.

Sometimes corndogs just look a little too appealing, you know? The Mariners have invented a corndog that will make hungry fans think twice, but once you get past the color, it does sound rather appealing. This corndog of a different color is honey-battered and covered in a spicy, crunchy coating.

Who's up for cotton candy fries at #BlueJays games this year? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/BTQqPvEcI9

Sweet and savory almost always go together, but the Blue Jays will be pushing those limits at Rogers Centre in 2025. These Cotton Candy Fries combine a pair of stadium classics and cover them in a blue sauce. If nothing else, these will be quite popular with the morbidly curious. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't intrigued.

Jimmy Butler played the classic ""this is just another game"" card before his return to Miami in a Warriors uniform on Tuesday night, but rest assured, scoring 11 points in a 26-point Golden State loss was definitely not what he had in mind. 

You can also be sure that the Heat playing like this wasn't an accident. They came in having lost 10 of their last 11 and suddenly looked reinvigorated. Butler, who was honored before the game with a tribute video and drew a lukewarm reaction from a mostly indifferent, late-arriving Miami crowd, definitely brought it out in his former team. 

Bam Adebayo barely waited one minute before dunking on Butler.

As for his current team, the Warriors have lost two straight without Stephen Curry, who is on the mend after a hard fall last week, to effectively fall back below the playoff line. Yes, the standings show them ahead of the Clippers for the No. 6 seed, but they're tied in the loss column and L.A. owns the tiebreaker. 

The good news for the Warriors is they have two days off and are expected to get Curry back on Friday when they play at New Orleans, which should be a win. Then they play the Spurs, which should be another win. But these losses are huge as the Warriors walk the very fine line between banking a playoff spot and having to win their way in, which wouldn't be a lock. 

In a one-game scenario, anything can happen. They'd get the Timberwolves in the 7-8 matchup if the season ended today, and Minnesota, a conference finalist last season that has one of the league's seven or eight best players in Anthony Edwards and has gotten solid play of late from Julius Randle, would be a real test. If they were to lose that, they would play ether Sacramento or Phoenix in a one-and-done situation. Even if they won that, they would match up with the No. 1 seed Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round. 

This is not a scenario that Golden State wants to flirt with, and it looked like they were steaming toward a sure playoff spot with 15 wins in their first 18 games with Butler on board. But they've slipped. They took a terrible loss against Denver, which was playing without Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray and Christian Braun, and now the Hawks and Heat have outscored them by 35 points. 

Butler has been mostly great for the Warriors, though a little frustrating in his inability, or at times unwillingness, to finish at the rim. He's been a connector and stabilizer and has given the Warriors what could potentially be a season-changing free-throw threat. But overall, he's been relatively passive as a scorer. He scored two points in the first half on Tuesday. By the time he got even a little aggressive, the Warriors were down 17 at the break, and he didn't score a single fourth-quarter point before he was pulled for good with seven minutes and change to go.

There's a methodical element to Butler's game to appreciate, but it can slip into malaise. Even when he catches deep he's at times pump-faking to a fault and has lacked any semblance of vertical explosion on attempts such as this one on Tuesday, which was batted away by Kel'el Ware.

All of this said, Butler was never supposed to be the go-to guy for this Warriors team. He's shown he can be a star in a secondary role to Curry, and the hope is that Playoff Jimmy is still in there somewhere, because there will probably come a point in the postseason when Golden State will need him to truly take over. 

But for this one night in Miami, Butler, whose passivity (and Adebayo's defense) was perhaps most evident in his one free-throw attempt, didn't have it. And by extension, neither did the Warriors.

Iga Swiatek has gone on to reach the Miami Open quarter-finals following the incident

Five-time major champion Iga Swiatek is being protected by increased security after an ""aggressive and taunting"" fan verbally abused her at the Miami Open.

Swiatek, 23, was targeted by the man in a practice session on Saturday.

It is believed the man shouted personal insults about Swiatek's family.

The world number two's representatives told BBC Sport the man had previously sent abusive online messages to her through social media.

""The Miami incident appears to be a direct transition from verbal aggression online to harassment in the real world,"" the Polish player's team said.

""He was aggressive and taunting.""

Swiatek's representatives added the incident was immediately reported to tournament organisers.

Her experience comes a month after Britain's Emma Raducanu was targeted by a stalker at the Dubai Tennis Championships.

'Every woman has fear' - why risks facing female athletes remain

Swiatek recently spoke out about the emotional toll she has faced in recent months, having served a one-month ban for a doping offence and not wanting to ""step on the court"".

Since the incident at the weekend, the second seed has gone on to reach the Miami Open quarter-finals, where she faces Filipino teenager Alexandra Eala on Wednesday.

""Security is a top priority. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues,"" her spokesperson said.

""Constructive criticism is one thing, and threats, hate speech or even disturbance during training is another - this cannot be condoned.""

Tournament organisers and the WTA are said to have reacted quickly, putting extra security measures in place around the former long-time world number one.

Miami Open organisers told BBC Sport the safety and security of everyone at the tournament is treated ""extremely seriously"".

""We constantly evaluate any potential threats and take every measure to respond appropriately,"" they said in a statement.

Those comments were echoed by the WTA, who said ""comprehensive"" security protocols are in place to ensure any incidents are dealt with ""promptly and effectively"".

""The details of these are not something we discuss publicly, but we are steadfast in our commitment to maintaining a safe environment for players and everyone attending one of our events,"" said the WTA.

Swiatek's experience is the latest incident involving a WTA player, providing a stark reminder of the dangers faced by female athletes on a regular basis.

Raducanu, 22, recoiled in horror when she saw a man - who she had already reported for what was described as ""exhibiting fixated behaviour"" - in the stands of her match in Dubai last month.

Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the Women in Sport charity, told BBC Sport that ""every single woman has a level of fear"".

Alex de Minaur has suffered another disappointing defeat after crashing out in the fourth round of the Miami Open, in what many tennis fans described as an epic ""choke"" against Italy's Matteo Berrettini. The Aussie World No.11 had a number of golden opportunities to send the match into a deciding third set, but came up short on every occasion in the 6-3 7-6 (9-7) defeat.

The 10th seed will be filthy with himself after being unable to covert any of the six set points he held against the former Wimbledon finalist, who fought back superbly to book his spot in the quarter-finals of the Masters 1000 event. Less than 24 hours after his superb comeback win against Joao Fonseca, the Aussie started off sluggishly and dropped the opening stanza in Miami.

But de Minaur looked on track to launch a trademark fightback after leading the Italian 5-4 in the second. He then jumped out to a 0-40 lead on Berrettini's serve but wasn't able to take any of those break point opportunities as the former World No.6 staved off the three set points, before eventually holding serve. The writing looked to be on the wall for the Australian when he was broken the very next game and the big-hitting Berrettini was left to serve for the match.

However, the Italian was unable to convert three match points as de Minaur's never-say-die attitude came to the fore and the Aussie forced the second set into a tiebreak. The momentum seemed to have completely shifted the Demon's way as the World No.11 raced ahead to set up another three set points in the breaker.

But once again Berrettini fought back and saved all three after winning seven straight points, before clinching victory on his second match point to leave de Minaur gutted. The heartbreaking defeat denied de Minaur a tour-best 18th win of the year.

While that shows the Aussie is consistently progressing to at least the last-16 in most tournaments, his inability to go deeper at the biggest events has once again been brutally exposed. And de Minaur was shown little mercy from tennis fans on social media, who were left gobsmacked by the Aussie's huge ""choke"".

De minaur might have had the biggest choke I've ever seen on this set. Not once, but twice.

— Shore (@Shore8550) March 26, 2025

How de Minaur choked that 2nd set needs to be studied man. He had like 5-6 set points 😂

— The New Kid 😈 (@PicksGoDiff) March 26, 2025

Big loss for De Minaur - wasted a lot of set points..gifted them away with UEs mostly. Love his game - but, I don't see him winning anything big. Golden opportunity in Miami and in S1, he just looked flat and that he'd rather be somewhere else. Bit like his R4 in Indian Wells.

— Nicky (@Nic_nac78) March 26, 2025

What a choke De Minaur

— Tennis Tipster🎾 (@TennisTipster05) March 26, 2025

De Minaur is the definition of solid floor, low ceiling. Has only made it past the QF at big events 1 time in his career.

— NotLite (@NotLite_03) March 26, 2025

De Minaur's sad exit ended any hopes of an all-Australian quarter-final with Adam Walton, but the qualifying lucky loser went down to third seed Taylor Fritz 6-3 7-5 later in the day anyway. Six-time Miami champion Novak Djokovic ousted Berrettini's compatriot Lorenzo Musetti 6-2 6-2 to march to within three wins of a record-extending 41st Masters 1000 crown.

The 37-year-old Serbian superstar also edged to within three victories of a milestone 100th tour-level title in a statement showing in front of Serena Williams and Juan Martin del Potro, who watched from Djokovic's courtside box.

""I was starstruck,"" fourth seed Djokovic said afterwards. ""It was amazing to see first 'DelPo', obviously a long-time friend and a rival, so happy to have him around and get his support from the box. It was amazing, the first time to have DelPo in the box, so I want to thank him really for coming.

""And Serena, that was a surprise. I didn't know. Actually, when I had that down-the-line passing shot, I pointed to her and asked her whether it was okay. She kind of said, 'Yeah, it was fine'. If Serena says it was fine, then it was amazing by everyone else's standards. So yeah, great to have them.""

Djokovic next faces American Sebastian Korda, who beat France's Gael Monfils 6-4 2-6 6-4. Elsewhere, Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo upset three-time major finalist Casper Ruud 6-4 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals for the third time in four years. That set up a quarter-final showdown against World No.15 Grigor Dimitrov, who defeated local hope Brandon Nakashima 6-4 7-5.

The Irrational‘s Alec and Rose were in a good place during the season 2 finale — but what does that last-second reveal mean for the future of the show?

During the Tuesday, March 25, finale, Rose (Karen David) revealed to Alec (Jesse L. Martin) that she was setting down roots by opening a consulting office. The fictional couple didn't have long to enjoy the relationship milestone after Alec received text messages from someone who was stalking him.

“I can't predict anything in scripted television because you never know what's gonna actually happen,” Martin, 56, exclusively told Us Weekly about the twist and how it could potentially impact Alec moving forward. “What I did hope was that it did continue with Karen's character.”

Martin was thrilled to see how season 3 would pick up with Alec and Rose solving the case, adding, “I absolutely adore working with Karen. She's a fantastic actor and a fantastic person. So luckily that's what it feels like [would happen next].”



David, 45, told Us she was on exactly the same page as Martin.

“We have so much fun together. Every day on set with Jesse is just pure joy. I just feel so blessed that this is the way we get to pay our bills by telling these interesting stories and solving very unique cases from a very different perspective,” she gushed. “It warms my heart that a lot of people watching the show can see that.”

The actress is grateful for the chance to share the screen with Martin, saying, “We just connect. We work so well together and coming into the show as Rose, you just can only hope and pray that, ‘Oh, I hope he likes me. I hope everyone likes me.' It's nerve-wracking.”

Based on the 2008 non-fiction book Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions, The Irrational takes inspiration from the life of Dan Ariely. Martin plays Alec a.k.a a world-renowned expert in behavioral science whose interest in the field started after a traumatic bombing.

Rose, meanwhile, is a crisis management professional and former spy. Her work allowed her to cross paths with Alec, which paved the way for their long-lasting romance. Despite not knowing where the story goes next, Martin and David are thrilled to see their characters tackle it together.

“You just don't know what's going to happen,” David added. “If there's any magic, it happens in the spontaneity of that moment when you are on set and they call action. It truly was a supernova just working with someone like Jesse. His enthusiasm, his kindness and his talent … It is just so wonderful to play opposite him.”

David noted that not all fictional TV couples are about to “navigate really dangerous situations,” telling Us, “Most couples don't normally go through [that], which makes it so humbling and interesting to watch them as they do.”

She concluded: “But [it is also] quite interesting to see how they navigate through very simple things. Because simple things for them are quite challenging given what they do for work. But when it comes to the simple things of navigating through a relationship, that becomes so much more heightened.”

All episodes of The Irrational are available to stream on Peacock.

Malcolm in the Middle is returning without Erik Per Sullivan — but where is the former child star now?

After Disney+ picked up a revival series for Malcolm in the Middle, Variety confirmed on Tuesday, March 25, that Per Sullivan, 33, would be recast. His character Dewey will be played by Caleb Ellsworth-Clark, who is taking over the role for the four-episode special.

The rest of the cast including Frankie Muniz, Bryan Cranston, Jane Kaczmarek, Christopher Masterson and Justin Berfield are expected to reprise their respective characters. In addition to the main cast, Kiana Madeira, Anthony Timpano, Vaughan Murrae and Keeley Karsten have been cast in key roles as well.

“25 years since we premiered Malcolm in the Middle. I'm so excited… that I may have peed just a little bit,” Cranston and Kaczmarek said in a December 2024 announcement post. “What a delight that I get to yell at that kid again! We're very, very excited about coming back together and seeing what this family has been up to.”



The revival will be written by Linwood Boomer, who created the original series. It will chronicle Malcolm (Muniz) and his daughter as they are “drawn into the family's chaos when Hal (Cranston) and Lois (Kaczmarek) demand his presence for their 40th wedding anniversary party,” according to a press release.

“Malcolm in the Middle is a landmark sitcom that captured the essence of family life with humor, heart and relatability,” President of Disney Branded Television Ayo Davis said in a statement. “Its hilarious and heartfelt portrayal of a lovably chaotic family resonated with audiences of all ages, and we're so excited to welcome the original cast back to bring that magic to life again. With Linwood Boomer and the creative team at the helm, these new episodes will have all the laughs, pranks, and mayhem fans loved — along with a few surprises that remind us why this show is so timeless.”

Meanwhile, President of 20th Television Karey Burke released a statement as well, which read, “Malcolm in the Middle literally changed the face of the television comedy landscape when it premiered two decades ago, redefining what the genre could be. When Linwood Boomer suggested it might be time to bring everyone's favorite dysfunctional family back for a bit of a reunion, we couldn't think of a more iconic and influential series to revisit, along with a truly brilliant cast to reunite.”

Per Sullivan's absence doesn't come as a surprise. He rose to stardom playing Dewey on Malcolm in the Middle, which ran from 2000 to 2006. Per Sullivan appeared on Come on Over, Arthur and the Invisibles and Twelve.

The now-former actor officially retired in 2010 and hasn't participated in any of the show's reunions over the years. Kaczmarek, who played Per Sullivan's onscreen mother, shared an update in 2024 during an interview, saying, “I admire it because so many people think being in show business is the greatest thing in the world. It's not for everyone.”

Kaczmarek revealed that Per Sullivan retired from acting because he was no longer interested in the profession. He is currently a student at “a very prestigious American university” and pursuing a degree in Victorian literature.

As Emma Kenney prepares to wrap up her journey on The Conners, she isn't ruling out any potential projects — including a possible onscreen reunion with former Shameless costar Steve Howey.

During an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Kenney, 25, said she “would love to work” with Howey again after they both made guest appearances on Happy's Place episodes apart.

“I love him. He's so much fun. He's so funny. And he's always been a safe place on set for me,” Kenney noted. “I've known him for so long ago and he is so wonderful. I honestly have to say the whole [Shameless cast] was quite a safe place for me.”

Kenney rose to stardom playing Debbie Gallagher on the Showtime hit. The series, which ran for 11 seasons, focused on the Gallagher family as they dealt with their father's alcoholism, poverty, affairs, crimes and scams while living in the South Side of Chicago. Shameless also starred Howey, 47, William H. Macy, Emmy Rossum, Jeremy Allen White, Shanola Hampton, Cameron Monaghan, Noel Fisher and more.



After moving on from Shameless, Kenney was cast as Harris during season 10 of Roseanne — and its spinoff The Conners. Kenney also recently made an appearance on NBC's Happy's Place, which previously reunited leads Reba McEntire and Melissa Peterman with their Reba costar Howey.

“It would be fun to do a meta moment between my character and Steve's character on Happy's Place. We actually did that on The Conners a couple years ago with Ethan Cutkosky and then William H. Macy joined for a couple of episodes,” Kenney recalled. “We had a little moment where he said to me on the show, ‘You look familiar.' So it was something kind of silly.”

Kenney got her start acting when she was just 9 years old. Being in the industry most of her life has allowed Kenney to become a household name — but not every person recognizes her for the same memorable role.

“Both [Shameless and The Conners] have gone on for such a long time and they've attracted different audiences. It depends where I'm at and what city I'm in. But I would say I get recognized the most for Shameless,” she shared with Us. “It went for so long and I grew up on that show. I think people can really relate to my character in a way and they feel like they know me. A lot of people will come up to me and want to give me a hug.”

Despite having consistent work for decades, Kenney is looking forward to simply taking a beat and considering what could end up being her next chapter.

“I've been working so consistently since I was 9 and this is the first time in my career and in my life that I've been able to take a step back and think about what's next for me. I really want to be intentional with my next role and my next project,” she explained. “I just want to explore a lot of different creative avenues, whether that's multicam again or movies or anything. I want to try it all. I'm definitely excited.”

Kenney has already ventured into animal advocacy with her foster-based rescue Yogi's House, telling Us, “It is probably the thing in my life that I'm most proud of. Ever since I've been a kid, I've always been super passionate about animal rescue and I always knew owning a dog rescue was going to be something I did one day. So to actually have it come to fruition and be something I'm doing every single day is such a dream come true.”

While the actress said Yogi's House— which she founded with Nicola Peltz-Beckham — is “a lot of work” it is also something Kenney is “so passionate about.”

“That is how I spend probably half of my day at least working on it,” Kenney continued. “I honestly feel like I'm getting a veterinary degree at this point because I deal with the foster vets every single day. I honestly feel I'm learning a lot about the medical side of raising dogs, which is really interesting and something that I would be interested in learning more about.”

She added: “Every single day something new comes up. It's a lot of people. I deal with a lot of people every single day and we create these relationships and we have such an amazing foster community and we really couldn't do the rescue without our fosters since we're foster-based. So I'm so grateful for every single volunteer that we've worked with. We could not do it without everyone.”

In addition to her dog rescue, Kenney is looking forward to seeing how The Conners comes to an end, saying, “This season definitely is going to hit home for a lot of people. There's humor always but also some really emotional moments that resolve a lot of story lines. It sets the rest of the characters up for their next chapter off camera ultimately.”

The Conners returns for its final season on ABC Wednesday, March 26 at 8 p.m. ET

On March 31, Searchlight Pictures' underrated black comedy The Menu will be leaving Netflix along with several other films. But this is the one you should catch before the end of the month, in part because it's probably going to stay with you for a while. Director Mark Mylod and screenwriters Seth Reiss and Will Tracy crafted a tale that has some horror elements, but it's more funny than scary.

The casting for the film is also impeccable, with Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy in the lead roles, with Nicholas Hoult, Hong Chau, Janet McTeer, Judith Light, and John Leguizamo rounding out the supporting cast. The story follows Taylor-Joy's Margot Mills on the trip of a lifetime to Hawthorne, one of the world's most exclusive restaurants on a remote island. But once Margot and her date arrive, she finds out that they may never be able to leave with their lives. And they aren't the only ones facing a dire fate.

But if you're looking for a more complete explanation about why The Menu is the one Netflix movie you can't miss in March, then keep reading.





Ralph Fiennes is a terrific villain in The Menu, in part because his character believes that he's justified in his actions. In his own way, Chef Julian Slowik can be just as intimidating as Fiennes' role as Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter films. However, Slowik has more nuance, even though he's also out of his mind.

Without giving too much away, the entire evening was orchestrated by Slowik and his followers, who carefully selected their guests. They're going to serve up more than a full-course meal for their patrons, and in Slowik's mind, they're all getting what they deserve.

More importantly, Slowik doesn't feel he's immune from retribution. He's one of the rare antagonists who is fully aware that what he has planned is brutal, and he's literally willing to suffer the same fate for his art. He's not just a parody of chef Gordon Ramsay. Instead, Slowik resembles a cult leader, and everyone follows his lead.



It's a plot point in the movie that Taylor-Joy's Margot doesn't belong with the rest of the patrons, and yet her presence is absolutely essential to the movie. She's the only one that the audience truly has any sympathy for, and as Slowik routinely demonstrates, she's also the only one there who isn't guilty of a crime, either against the law or of the heart.

Before the insanity begins, Margot shines because she isn't intimidated by Slowik and she's more than willing to call him out on the ridiculous things he does to his dishes. Margot won't even dignify those courses by describing them as appetizers or even food.

Unlike Taylor-Joy's leading character in Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Margot has to use her mind and her wit as her weapons as she tries to make her way through the night.

The last 30 minutes are probably the most satisfying part of the movie. In real life, the rich and powerful rarely get justice for the things they've done or the people they've hurt. But in The Menu, the 1 percent are finally getting what's coming to them.

Not all of the characters necessarily deserve their fates, but there is a certain cathartic sensation when characters who have all of the money in the world can't use it to barter for their lives. Slowik and his followers are far beyond bargaining when this film begins, and it's going to be a bloody good time in Hawthorn for elevated horror and dark comedy fans alike.

NFL quarterback Russell Wilson signed with the New York Giants — and no one is more excited than his wife, Ciara.

Wilson, 36, celebrated the news via his Instagram Stories on Tuesday, March 25, writing, “Been here before … can't wait to do it again #MetLife @nygiants.”

Ciara, 39, reposted Wilson's message and a photo of the New Jersey stadium onto her page alongside a row of blue, white and red hearts in honor of the team's colors.

In a follow-up post, Ciara further celebrated Wilson's new job.



“New York state of mind!” she captioned a pic of the football star. “My greatest inspiration.”

Before joining the Giants, Wilson had notably played with the Seattle Seahawks from 2012 to 2021, the Denver Broncos from 2022 to 2023 and the Pittsburgh Steelers during the 2024-2025 season. Throughout his career, Ciara and their children have been his No. 1 cheerleaders.

Wilson and the “Goodies” singer have been married since 2016 and share three children: Sienna, 7, Win, 4, and Amora, 15 months. (Ciara is also mom to son Future, 10, with ex-fiancé Future.)

“I'm so proud of Russ,” Ciara gushed during a joint appearance on the “Not Just Football” podcast last month. “It's, kind of, crazy that this is his 10th Pro Bowl and he's one of 30 men to have that under his belt. I'm always just so proud of him. He works really hard, so he inspires me. He's my biggest inspiration.”

Ciara further revealed that she has “an incredible respect” for Wilson's career.

“I love it. I have an incredible respect for what he does [and] for what all you guys do,” she said. “I actually grew up watching football with my dad. … [We were] also just a fan of great talent. I wasn't so much locked [on] a team as a whole, like, I didn't grow up my whole life saying, ‘I like this one team.' I had an appreciation for the Jamal Anderson era because I'm from Atlanta … or Michael Vick, Deion Sanders, Troy Aikman — that was that whole squad over there — but then you had Jerry Rice on the West [Coast]. It was just so much goodness happening in football that I personally appreciate it.”

Now, naturally, Ciara counts Wilson as one of her favorite NFL athletes.

“He actually helped me with my nerves, kind of, early on because you feel like, ‘Woo' when you see someone on his back,” Ciara explained to podcast host and fellow athlete Cam Heyward. “I'm, like, I wish there was a way to be in the helmet, like, ‘Babe, he's right behind you.' But you can't do that. I feel like I'm connected to him, so whatever he goes through, I go through. We're an extension of you guys in some regard.”

After surviving one of Married at First Sight's most shocking scandals, David is ready to meet his girlfriend's dad.

During the Tuesday, March 25, episode of Lifetime's reality show, David, 37, decided to enjoy an evening out with his parents and his partner Madison, 31. Along for the ride, however, was Madison's dad, Mark.

“Mark the silver fox is coming in,” David shared in a confessional interview. “I'm a little nervous. It's the pops. That is your woman's father and you always want acceptance and you want to hear the affirmation that he has about our love.”

In the Married at First Sight: Where Are They Now? special, cameras rolled as Madison revealed to her dad for the first time that she had moved in with David.



“That was a little shocking,” he later shared in a private interview. “It's premature but the heart wants what it wants, and if you know, you know.”

As if he hadn't been through enough surprises, Mark proceeded to have a private conversation with David for the very first time.

“I just wanted to thank you for being an amazing father to Madison,” David began by saying. “She is the woman of my dreams and I wish she was the woman who walked down the aisle. Everything happens for a reason.”

During Season 18 of Married at First Sight, experts Dr. Pepper Schwartz, Pastor Cal Roberson and Dr. Pia Goff initially matched David up with Michelle while Madison was paired with Allen.

During the season, however, David and Madison developed feelings for each other and decided to divorce their partners before pursuing a romantic relationship after the show.

“We have talked about marriage,” David warned his possible future father-in-law. “That is something that will be coming down the line. I will be asking for your blessing.”

Fortunately, Madison's dad was supportive of the relationship and expressed excitement for what was to come.

“She obviously looked at you and knew that something was right there,” he explained. “I'm so happy that Madison has finally found somebody who she is comfortable with and happy. You are a fantastic man. I think you are the perfect mix for her.”

After a season filled with drama, both David and Madison were relieved to discover their families got along well. And yes, they were supportive of this unique love story.

“It's real. It's strong. It's genuine,” David said about his connection to Madison. “ I can't wait for our families to coincide and be one big giant family drinking, playing darts and real love.”

Married at First Sight (produced by Kinetic Content) airs on Lifetime Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Erika Jayne and Bozoma Saint John are sharing their reaction to the departure of costar Garcelle Beauvais.

The Bravo stars appeared on the Tuesday, March 25, episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen just hours after Garcelle, 58, revealed she was leaving the show following five seasons.

When host and RHOBH executive producer Andy Cohen asked them about the news, Erika, 53, and Boz, 48, initially met Cohen's question with a frosty silence. After being pressed to answer, Boz alluded to tension between Garcelle and her costars at the recent RHOBH season 14 reunion. (A trailer released Tuesday shows Garcelle storming off during the reunion and declaring, “Everybody can go f— themselves, I don't care.”

“I am disappointed that she is departing like this. I wish that she would have stuck around to work out another season,” Boz told Cohen, referring to the way things were left at the reunion.





Erika claimed, “We've known that she's quit for two weeks,” adding that, “She did not take the cast photo with us [at the reunion], which is a clear indication that I am leaving.”

Garcelle announced her exit from RHOBH Tuesday morning in a video shared via Instagram.

“Hey, guys, so I have some news. I've decided to leave Beverly Hills,” Garcelle said. “It's been a wild ride. I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless.”

She continued, “I just want to say thank you to Andy Cohen, to Bravo, NBCUniversal, Evolution, 32 Flavors, the producers, the crew and, of course, the ladies.”

Garcelle noted that Cohen told her she can “come back any time, the door will always be open.” She added: “You never know, I might pop in sometime.”

“I want to say thank you so much, you guys have cheered me on, supported me and sometimes even fought for me or on my behalf,” Garcelle concluded. “It means a lot, and I hope you guys will continue on this journey with me. It's not goodbye, it's see you later. So, see you later.”

“I'm really pissed right now,” Garcelle said in the trailer, which premiered Tuesday following the show's season 14 finale. “So, I don't want to answer any more questions, honestly.”

Garcelle could be seen walking off the reunion set as the other RHOBH cast members looked stunned.

“Everybody can go f— themselves, I don't care,” she said as she stormed off.

As season 3 of The White Lotus comes to an end, there are some people Patrick Schwarzenegger might not be watching with: his parents.

During a recent appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show, Patrick, 31, was asked whether he would be joined by his parents, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, to watch the last two episodes. Patrick admitted that “it was a little nerve-wracking watching the first episode with my whole family because I do take some clothes off.”

For the end of the season, Patrick has a different plan in mind. “I think some upcoming episodes I'm going to watch without them,” he added. “[I] would definitely take a bathroom break [if things get too awkward]. The next episodes, they're crazy.”

Earlier in the episode, host Drew Barrymore played a message for Patrick recorded by his mother. “I think every single one you've been nervous for me to watch,” Shriver, 69, said in reference to her son's nude scene in the premiere. “You keep saying, ‘That's not me, that's a prosthetic.'”



ICYMI, Patrick left quite an impression at the beginning of The White Lotus with a full frontal scene. His story line has since progressed to include an onscreen threesome. Patrick previously received support from several of his family members for baring it all on camera — including brother-in-law Chris Pratt.

“I know where my eyes went,” Pratt, 45, joked during an interview with E! News in February about Patrick's nude scene. “I'm not blood related to him, I was looking at that d—k, bro.”

Pratt, who is married to Katherine Schwarzenegger, praised Patrick's performance, saying, “No, he looks amazing. Obviously, he's a physical specimen, but also he's a really solid actor because the character he's playing is completely different than who he is.”

After helping Patrick with his audition, Pratt was thrilled to see the season's success.

“He created a character. And it feels natural and good. I've been telling everybody for years, I've been telling him as well, I really think we're entering a decade of Patrick,” he continued. “I've been watching him, he's just been working hard.”

Pratt concluded: “He's actually a hustler across the board, not just with acting but with business, and everything. He's super driven, and I know he gets that from both his mom and his dad.”

That same month, Patrick shut down assumptions that he has been booking jobs because of his famous parents.

“I know there are people who'll say I only got this role because of who my dad is,” Patrick told The Sunday Times. “They're not seeing that I've had 10 years of acting classes, put on [high] school plays every week, worked on my characters for hours on end or the hundreds of rejected auditions I've been on.”

Patrick expressed his determination to prove people wrong, adding, “Of course, it's frustrating and you can get boxed in and you think at that moment, I wish I didn't have my last name. But, that's a small moment. I would never trade my life with anyone. I'm very fortunate to have the life and family that I have, the parents I have and the lessons and values they've instilled in me.”

New episodes of The White Lotus air on HBO Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.

Taylor Swift's name was mentioned during a U.S. Senate hearing about the leaked Signal chat that showed high-ranking security officials discussing plans to bomb Yemen.

During the Tuesday, March 25, hearing, Virginia Senator Mark Warner cited Swift, 35, while discussing the dangers of alienating international allies. Warner, 70, pointed to Swift's cancellation of three Vienna concerts last year as an example of the importance of properly handling and sharing classified information.

“That sharing of information saves lives, and it's not hypothetical,” Warner told the Senate Intelligence Committee. “We all remember, because it was declassified — last year when Austria worked with our community to make sure to expose a plot against Taylor Swift in Vienna that could have killed literally hundreds of individuals.”

As Swifties will remember, the Grammy winner canceled three planned concerts at the Austrian capital's Ernst Happel Stadium after officials uncovered an alleged terror plot inspired by ISIS. Swift addressed the situation a few weeks later, explaining that she waited a bit to break her silence because of the highly sensitive nature of the incident.



“Let me be very clear: I am not going to speak about something publicly if I think doing so might provoke those who would want to harm the fans who come to my shows,” she wrote via Instagram in August 2024. “In cases like this one, ‘silence' is actually showing restraint, and waiting to express yourself at a time when it's right to. My priority was finishing our European tour safely, and it is with great relief that I can say we did that.”

She noted that canceling the concerts was “devastating” but thanked officials for their work. “The reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows,” she wrote. “But I was also so grateful to the authorities because thanks to them, we were grieving concerts and not lives. I was heartened by the love and unity I saw in the fans who banded together.”

News broke on Monday, March 24, that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and other officials in President Donald Trump's administration discussed plans to attack Houthi militants in Yemen in a group chat on the messaging app Signal. The chats leaked because the group chat allegedly included Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of The Atlantic, who published a story about the incident on Monday. The National Security Council later said that the chat “appears to be authentic.”

Trump, 78, downplayed the leak on Tuesday, claiming that the information shared in the group chat was not mishandled because it was not classified.

“So this was not classified,” Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. ambassadors, per The New York Times. “Now if it's classified information, it's probably a little bit different, but I always say, you have to learn from every experience.”

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, said on Monday that the leak is “one of the most stunning breaches of military intelligence I have read about in a very, very long time.”

Autopsy results for Miller Gardner will take months due to an outbreak of violent crime in Costa Rica.


Miller, 14, died on Friday, March 21, while vacationing in Costa Rica with his family, including his father Brett Gardner, a former star outfielder for the New York Yankees. 

In an interview with DailyMail.com, a representative for Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) said an autopsy has already been performed on Miller — but results won't be coming anytime soon. 

“We're having a hike in homicides as these drug gangs battle for territory and every one of them needs an autopsy,” Juan Pablo Alvarado Garcia said in a story published on Wednesday, March 26.



He added, “I can confirm that an autopsy has been carried out on Miller, But the full analysis and results, as in every one of them, will take at least two to three months due to these constant killings causing a backlog of cases. That's the reality.”

There were more than 900 homicides in Costa Rica in 2023, according to the OIJ, which marked the most deadly year in the country's history. The murders were “primarily attributed to narcotrafficking groups.”

“Costa Rica, as you know, is a country that has not had an army since 1949 and has been an extremely peaceful country since then, so there is a great social impact due to the increase in the homicide rate, and last year we had 906 homicides in a population of 5.2 million inhabitants,” Mario Zamora, director of the Ministry of Public Safety, told Cronkite News in October 2024. 

Miller was found dead in his hotel room at the Arenas Del Mar Beachfront & Rainforest Resort in Manuel Antonio, a popular tourist destination in Costa Rica.

His cause of death remains unknown, but officials have ruled out asphyxia, which was listed as the preliminary cause. Authorities now believe food poisoning may have been the cause.

Miller's death was announced on Sunday, March 23 in a statement released by his parents via the Yankees. 

“With heavy hearts we are saddened to announce the passing of our youngest son, Miller,” the statement read. “He was 14 years old and has left us far too soon after falling ill along with several other family members while on vacation. We have so many questions and so few answers at this point, but we do know that he passed away peacefully in his sleep on the morning of Friday, March 21st.”

The statement continued, “Miller was a beloved son and brother and we cannot yet comprehend our life without his infectious smile. He loved football, baseball, golf, hunting, fishing, his family and his friends. He lived life to the fullest every single day.”

Charlie Hunnam has just expanded his family!

The 44-year-old Sons of Anarchy actor recently adopted two cute kittens during a little down time from filming the next installment in Ryan Murphy's Monster anthology series. 

Keep reading to find out more...

According to the River Valley Animal Rescue, Charlie visited the rescue in Momence, Ill., and showered the cats with love, before he decided to adopt. 

The rescue center shared photos of Charlie playing with a couple of adorable cats named Sugar Plum and Gingerbread. 

""Just like everyone who steps through our doors, he soaked up all the affection they had to give. He was a great sport about letting them climb all over him, snapped countless pictures, and even took the opportunity to FaceTime his lady to show off his favorites,"" they shared on Facebook. 

""But from the very beginning, two special sisters stole his heart: Sugar Plum and Gingerbread. And then came the words we never expected… I think I would love to adopt. And that's exactly what Charlie did,"" they continued. ""Who would have thought that our two little ladies—once unwanted and homeless in a small town—would end up flying off to a life of luxury in Los Angeles?""

""Charlie, thank you for giving these precious kittens the incredible life they deserve. We not only loved having you visit time and time again, but seeing the genuine affection you had for each and every cat was absolutely priceless,"" RVAR concluded. 🐾 We're honored to officially welcome you to the RVAR family! 🐾 And this just goes to show… 🙃 No matter who you are, getting two kittens to sit still long enough for an adoption photo is nearly impossible—even for this experienced CAT DAD! 🐾""

Local news station WCIA reported in February that Monster season three was filming in Kankakee County, and the production had taken over the downtown Momence. 

Charlie is set to star in the upcoming season as serial killer Ed Gein, whose crimes spanned from 1947-1957. 

He was last photographed sporting a bloody face while filming in Los Angeles back in January. Check out the pics!

Prince Harry has stepped away from the charity he helped found, Sentebale, which he started all the way back in 2006.

The 40-year-old Duke of Sussex stepped away alongside co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, along with members of the Board of Trustees, after their relationship with chairwoman Dr. Sophie Chandauka “broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.” He originally set up the organization in honor of his late mother, Princess Diana.

Prince Harry‘s statement is as follows:

“With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as Patrons of the organization until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same,” the Princes said in a joint situation.

“It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation. What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.”

Dr. Sophie Chandauka also released a statement, as follows: 

“There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.” 

“[This is a] story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir (discrimination against black women) — and the coverup that ensued.”","{'href': 'https://www.justjared.com', 'title': 'Just Jared'}"

Aaron Ashmore reveals he and wife Zoe Kate split up years ago. 

The 45-year-old Ginny & Georgia actor and his love broke up during the pandemic, he revealed during an appearance on the Inside of You podcast, which is hosted his Smallville co-star Michael Rosenbaum. 

Keep reading to find out more...

During the podcast, Michael asked Aaron about the toughest time in his life, and he opened up about their decision to split up during COVID. 

""You know, COVID was a really tough time,” he recalled. “We had a brand new baby, my dad got stuck home with a 3-year-old and a newborn, and my dad got ill over that time period and passed away. And then eight months after that, my wife and I decided to split up.”

""I was grieving my dad and then my marriage dissolved and stuff,” Aaron continued, adding, “There was about a two and a half year period that was just like … the hits just kept coming, man.”

Aaron said that before they split for good, they did try going to couple's therapy, and he also went to therapy on his own. 

""We were actually in therapy for our merit. My ex is a therapist so there was always a lot of encouragement to do therapy, and so we did. We did our due diligence for our relationship and our marriage,” he said, noting they did therapy together for a year before splitting.

Aaron and Zoe were married in 2014 and have two daughters together, Esme and Margot. 

Aaron, whose twin brother Shawn Ashmore is also an actor, can currently be seen on the series Skymed. His other credits include Locke & Key, Killjoys, Designated Survivor, Warehouse 13, and movies like Wish Upon a Christmas, Santa's Squad, Pretty Cheaters, Deadly Lies, Cider and Sunsets, Suze and more.

“I thought she hated me,” he said on the Jay Shetty Podcast of his first meeting with Selena, which was set up by her mom Mandy Teefey. They met 16 years ago to work on a song together.

“Obviously, 99% of it was in my head,” Benny went on. “I was talking to her and said, ‘Oh my God, I have so many good single guy friends… We have dinners at the house all the time, you should come over sometime.' I wasn't even thinking about anything and we're talking about our ideal date and this and that.”

“I want her to be in our friend group and I want to make sure this thing is smoothed out so the song goes well,” he continued, adding they started texting each other and would send ""ugly"" selfies.

Selena, who was also on the podcast, said that she started falling for him through their text exchanges. 

When asked about almost self-sabotaging their relationship, Benny said, “I feel like it all happens for a reason. I feel like maybe me doing that is what disarmed her enough.”

Remi Bader is opening up about her weight.

The 30-year-old influencer and outspoken advocate for body inclusivity recently spoke out about her weight loss journey, and revealed she went under a medical procedure.

In the fall of 2023, Remi chose to have gastric bypass surgery (SADI-S), which she decided to do based on a history of binge eating, weight-loss drugs and gastrointestinal issues.

""I loved being curvy my whole life; I just did. It was who I was...I will always believe that you could be a bigger size and be healthy and happy,"" she told Self.

""I was for a while, that wasn't a lie. But there was a point when it shifted, and I became really unhappy.""

After speaking with her doctor, she underwent the surgery on December 11, 2023. 

""I need to say that it was the most brutal thing,"" she admitted.

""I get the surgery. I was in recovery hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up. It was not normal. I was supposed to leave [the hospital] in one day.""

""I could not stop projectile vomiting, and I couldn't drink water. They won't let you leave if you can't drink water,” she added. 

""I actually can't explain how horrible it was.""

Remi revealed that she didn't leave the hospital until three days later, and the negative effects that came with recovery lasted six weeks. 

In the months that followed the surgery, Remi said she was ""not f--king okay"" from December to mid-February 2024. 

""I'd gotten into a very, very deep depression, and it was truly the scariest time of my life,” she said. “I couldn't tell people. I really — I wanted to die.""

Remi noted ""it happened very subtly"" and she ""never went off of the anxiety or depression medicine"" because it made her feel ""so much better.""

As far as the weight loss itself, Remi said she ""never thought it would be this quick,"" and she's still ""healing and figuring it out.""

""I was lost with my identity before...I wasn't big enough at first and plus-size enough at first for the plus-size community. Then I became too big...for some brands even to work with. Now I'm too small? I actually don't know where I'm supposed to be,"" she admitted.

""I'm going to continue to be online and cry and share and not share and be me, and that's not changing.""
