Unicoin represented a final shot against the industry from previous Chair Gary Gensler's SEC, which informed the firm in an official notice late last year that the regulator intended to accuse it of fraud, deceptive practices and handling unregistered securities. The investigation was announced in the final days of President Joe Biden's administration in December, before the SEC's leadership was taken over by those selected by crypto fan President Donald Trump.

The CEO, who has watched a dozen other crypto companies let off the hook of their enforcement actions by the agency's new management, told CoinDesk he wrote a March 17 letter to the agency's new Crypto Task Force, asking about the investigation.

""I seek your guidance on the best way to address this abuse of power and bring it to an end,"" Konanykhin wrote in the letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by CoinDesk. He requested the matter be terminated and that the conduct of the enforcement official involved with the case at the agency be reviewed, because of his ""willingness to weaponize the SEC's authority for political purposes.""

A spokesperson for the SEC declined to comment on Unicoin's status on Wednesday. A Unicoin spokesperson told CoinDesk on Tuesday that the company ""remains in the final stages of the SEC review process. As of now, we have not received any new updates or formal feedback from the SEC regarding our registration. We are fully committed to compliance and transparency, and we continue to work toward securing the necessary approvals for our planned offerings.""

The CEO believes his company, which suggests investors can see up to 8,000% returns, was targeted by agency harassment last year, he said in an interview with CoinDesk in Washington.

""They demanded from us to promise not to go public in the United States, not to ICO, not to raise funds,"" he said. ""So I packed my bags and moved to Europe to resume business.""

He said the election of Trump and the president's promises to make the U.S. the global crypto capital made him come back to New York from Switzerland, with an intent to go public here.

""We thought the war was over, and we said to the SEC, 'Hey, we're resuming our activity,"" Konanykhin said. At that point, the agency announced it intended to target the company with civil charges.

Konanykhin noted that the regulator had accused them of violating securities laws with an airdrop. Konanykhin argued that it's a common marketing strategy seen in many crypto assets, and is ""what the president of the United States is doing with his memecoin.""

""It's embarrassing that the war on crypto still continues,"" he said. If the agency continues its war on crypto by pursuing Unicoin, ""I think so many observers are going to be astonished.""

Unicoin started as an effort to create a ""more transparent and reliable alternative"" to Bitcoin in the U.S. (which, the Unicoin website said, has returned 9 million percent to investors over the last 10 years). He said some analysts believe bitcoin was ""created by Chinese intelligence, but nobody really knows by whom.""

""I'm elated by the opportunity to participate in making American the crypto capital of the planet as the president pledged he wants to do, even though it's highly annoying to still have the legacy persecution from the SEC,"" Konanykhin said.

Meanwhile, he said, ""we are preparing actively for going public.""",coindesk

That’s according to Chris Solarz, the chief investment officer of digital assets at Amitis Capital, a firm which runs a crypto-focused fund of funds — meaning a fund that specializes in allocating capital to various money managers.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the Crypto for Advisors Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

“This is the golden age for crypto hedge fund investing,"" said Solarz, who used to be responsible for almost $8 billion in allocations at investor advisory firm Cliffwater, in an interview with CoinDesk. ""It's an alignment of the stars. This beta, this secular tailwind… blockchain as a whole has such potential. At the same time, the money manager universe is so scarce that I feel like I'm shooting fish in a barrel being able to pick the winners.”

Crypto markets are still so new that money managers are able to run the same trading strategies that they used to 35 years ago in TradFi, when hedge funds were only just emerging, Solarz said.

Only 127 hedge funds existed back in 1990, managing roughly $39 billion; by 2024, those numbers had skyrocketed to over 10,000 funds managing $5 trillion in assets. In other words, the sector got way more competitive — and it became much harder to outperform the market.

Solarz’s thesis is that the crypto sector (which counts roughly 1,650 hedge funds managing $88 billion in assets) is currently 10 times less competitive than traditional markets, to the point that money managers are able to dust off and readapt 20-year-old strategies that stopped working in TradFi over a decade ago due to commoditization.

“I meet 20 managers [in crypto]… 19 out of 20 don't deserve to be running money,” Solarz said. “A lot of them are young and have never managed money before. They’ll say ‘We’re investing in bitcoin, ether and solana.’ And I’ll say, ‘Well, why am I paying you 20% for that?’ … When I pay 20% to a manager, I don't want them to give me stuff that I can just do myself or buy in an ETF form.”

The crypto sector is likely to keep presenting asymmetric opportunities to money managers until the technology is completely integrated into the financial sector, according to Solarz. Nobody says they work for dot-com companies anymore, because every firm is a dot-com company. At some point, people will stop talking about crypto as something separate from the rest of the financial system, so the reasoning goes — possibly when bitcoin catches up to gold in terms of market capitalization, which Solarz thinks could happen within the next 10 years.

No altcoin season

There are three large categories of funds that Solarz looks at for allocation: venture funds (which provides capital to startups), liquid directional (funds that bet on whether the market will go up or down) and liquid market neutral (which earn to make money regardless of market moves).

When looking at liquid directional funds, Solarz is more interested in the manager’s process and risk management than specific theses they may espouse. What’s their investment strategy? Is it repeatable? How do they think about macroeconomics? Then he plows performance data points into models that determine how much value the manager is adding.

“It's easy for me to avoid the big losers. It's always hard to pick the winners,” Solarz said. “If something seems fishy or I don't think they have a true investment process, it's easy to pass on, but there's always a little bit of luck involved as well to be the best out performer every single year.”

That process needs to be rigorous, because the days where all cryptocurrencies rise together — the fabled altcoin seasons — are over, or so he says. The crypto ecosystem now counts approximately 40 million tokens, by Solarz’ count, and he expects 99.99% of them to eventually go to zero. ""There's only 100 that are worth talking about,"" he said.

The crypto market will need an injection of at least $300 billion to sustain current prices over the next three years, Solarz argues, because of the massive token unlocks that are scheduled to weigh down the top 100 tokens. The size of the liquid token market for hedge funds is around $30 billion, Solarz noted, and retail traders have moved on to memecoins. In other words, there’s currently nobody to buy up all of that supply.

“This is the overhang. This is why there can't be an altcoin bull market in general for some time,” he said.

Market neutral strategies

Historically, five times more money has gone into crypto VC funds than into all of the crypto liquid funds combined, Solarz said, because venture investing makes it easier to hide mark-to-market losses from investment committees. This dynamic is one of the reasons why Amitis sees more opportunities on the liquid side. Solarz has allocated capital to 14 funds so far. Of these, three are VCs, four are liquid directional, and seven are liquid market neutral.

“This is a little bit glib, perhaps, but at the institutional level, they’re really trying not to lose money, while at the family office, we're trying to compound returns,” Solarz said. “If there is a venture capital opportunity that seems incredible … I will consider investing, but the hurdle rate is so much higher if you're locking up money for 10 years.”

Market neutral strategies are still very profitable, Solarz said. For example, traders were able to arbitrage the price of cryptocurrencies on South Korean exchanges back in December when President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, creating a regional crisis. South Korean investors sold their assets in a panic, but the rest of the world did not, creating disparities in price that funds were able to take advantage of.

Another popular strategy involves benefitting from the funding rates associated with perpetual contracts. Institutional investors often short a cryptocurrency while gaining spot exposure to it at the same time; this allows them to remain perfectly market neutral while they collect interest on the perps, which can sometimes reach 30% annualized. That same strategy is deployed on spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the CME Group bitcoin futures.

“That's what they're doing in this category, they're doing variations on this, and it's still very profitable, double-digit returns and in a consistent manner,” Solarz said.",coindesk

Behind the three co-founders of WLFI, Donald Trump Jr. connected via video, delivering some general cheerleading to the digital assets technology underpinning the business.

""I'm just super excited about what this can mean for the future of banking, for the future of the financial systems,"" Trump said. ""I was sort of the beneficiary of the old way of doing things, but that doesn't mean it's the best way of doing things.""

The company had confirmed the launch of its USD1 stablecoin this week, saying it would first be available on Ethereum and the Binance-linked BNB Chain. The announcement came as Congress is moving forward on legislation to regulate stablecoins in the U.S.; many of the lawmakers working on that were also at the same DC Blockchain Summit on Wednesday, hosted by the Digital Chamber.

""We're excited for the world to experience our stablecoin,"" said Zach Witkoff, one of the co-founders of World Liberty Financial. ""I do think that retail and institutions are really going to lean into the product.""

The Washington event gave the Trump-connected business its main stage, where the executives were followed by two Republican lawmakers central to the potential passage of the stablecoin legislation — Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. French Hill. Their legislation may eventually be seeking final approval by President Trump, leaving little daylight between the industry's chief lobbying goals and the president's family business.

""You don't make permanent change in policy though executive action,"" Hill said. ""That's why leadership in the Senate and House [is crafting] a stablecoin regime that can make America the principal home for stablecoins, dollar-backed stablecoins.""

The House is also close to reintroducing a market structure bill, after 71 Democrats joined a majority of Republicans in voting to advance similar legislation out of the House last year, he said.

Stablecoin use is ""just as safe as a bank account, but without all that extra nonsense,"" Trump Jr. said, adding that there's ""probably trillions"" in waste keeping traditional banking alive. ""The sky is the limit for this.""

The World Liberty protocol aims to provide a blockchain-based platform where its users would be able to borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools and transact with stablecoins. But it also has more of an extreme retail hope.

""Our goal is for you to be able to walk into your local bodega and buy a ham sandwich using stablecoins,"" Witkoff said.",coindesk

MOVE is outperforming the CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, which is trading flat. Market majors like bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are both up less than 1%.

In a March 24 blog post, Movement explained it was creating the ""Strategic Reserve"" because they wanted to proactively rectify the disruption caused by the illicit actions of a market maker, who breached contractual obligations by conducting one-sided market-making activities and profiting $38 million without properly providing liquidity.

""All cash proceeds recovered from the Market Maker will be used by the Movement Network Foundation to establish the Movement Strategic Reserve: a 38M $USDT buyback program to purchase $MOVE for long-term use and to return the USDT liquidity to the Movement ecosystem,” Movement said in a post.

As CoinDesk previously reported, crypto exchange Binance removed the market maker because it was placing substantial sell orders without meaningful buy orders, violating the exchange's rules requiring balanced liquidity provision.

Binance said in a post that market makers must place balanced bid-ask orders, have sufficient market depth, stable spreads, and cautioned against disruptive high-frequency trading practices.

“Any project-authorized market makers who do not comply with or breach such principles and rules, Binance will take further actions against such market makers to best protect our users,” the exchange said.",coindesk

The gaming retailer reported holding $4.8 billion in cash during its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Company CEO Ryan Cohen weeks ago had teased an interest in purchasing bitcoin for the GME balance sheet. He was joined by Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management — an owner of GME via its ETFs, who urged the same.

Though GameStop on Tuesday reported that a portion of its cash will go into bitcoin and U.S. dollar dominated stablecoins in the future, it did not disclose how much, or the timing of any buys.

The plan kicked off a speculative frenzy on social media: How much bitcoin would Gamestop acquire?

The company’s allocation will likely be significant, according to Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, who said that GameStop wouldn’t be going through the very bureaucratic board approval process if it was only planning on allocating 1-2% of its cash into bitcoin.

“Chairman Ryan Cohen is likely to take a big bet on bitcoin as a balance sheet asset,” Pompliano wrote in a note. “You only put the time and energy to get the change to your investment policy if you are looking to put a material amount of your cash into bitcoin.”

Pomp also pointed out that Cohen currently follows three bitcoin-related accounts on X, which he sees as “behavior of a hardcore bitcoiner.”

According to a poll posted by Michael Saylor — whose Strategy (MSTR) has spent $33 billion acquiring more than 500,000 BTC — on X, his followers believe that GameStop needs to at least hold $3 billion worth of bitcoin in order to “be respected by Bitcoiners.”

Less clear is whether GameStop plans to be as aggressive inn buying bitcoin as Strategy. The company has deployed many creative fundraise mechanisms to fuel its war chest, including debt sales. But Strategy's BTC saga started as a more humble cash reserve of $250 million generated by COVID-era cost savings.

Gamestop's share boost may prove resilient to bitcoin price swings because the company has only said it would buy BTC, but doesn't yet own any, mused Josh Mandell, a former bond trader. He called out the perplexing situation on social media.

""I will not ask anyone to make it make sense,"" he said.

Speaking at the D.C. Blockchain Summit in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, Gillibrand said that the bipartisan stablecoin bill — Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) — creates a number of protections for consumers in the event of an issuer bankruptcy scenario.

“You have to think through all the ways this can go wrong. Something as simple as how you define a dollar — is a Treasury the same as a dollar? What happens if your 1-to-1 backing is all in Treasuries and you have an interest rate misalignment like SVB just did, and you have a run on your stablecoin and all your dollar-to-dollar backing is in a three-month Treasury that you can’t get out of – that’s a run on your stablecoin, that’s a collapse,” Gillibrand said.

If dollar-backing requirements are not met or enforced, Gillibrand said: “You’ll just have another FTX. You’ll just have another algorithmic stablecoin that plunges because it never really made sense. That is a huge problem for the U.S. market.”

“The worst thing we could do is water it down,” Gillibrand said. “Do not think that a watered-down bill will help your industry. It will destroy your industry. Because one more SVB, one more algorithmic stablecoin [collapse], just continues to create such uncertainty that nobody wants to do business in the United States.”

After years of false starts, stablecoin legislation appears to finally be gaining momentum. Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee voted to advance the GENIUS Act to a Senate-wide vote. A similar bill from the U.S. House of Representatives is expected to go public on Wednesday.

Gillibrand said that if Congress is able to get the GENIUS Act signed into law, it is then more likely to be able to make progress on a market structure bill.

“A market structure bill is much more complex. It regulates the entire industry, not just one version of a digital asset,” Gillibrand said. “So it’s really important that we do this right so we can move to something much bigger, and something we need to build even broader consensus around.”

A market structure bill would create a regulatory framework for the crypto industry as a whole, giving crypto companies and digital asset issuers clearer rules of the road and a framework to determine whether their tokens are securities or not — and therefore, who their primary regulator is.

Speaking on the same panel, Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-Ohio) suggested that any digital asset with a centralized issuer is likely to be a security, not a commodity.

“If your digital currency has a CEO it's not a commodity, by definition,” Moreno said.

During another panel discussion at the same event on Wednesday, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), said the future market structure bill would need to “find a way to create a structure that works beyond the two major categories” of security vs. commodity.

Moreno said he wanted to see the GENIUS Act passed before the August recess.

“I’m gonna lay out the gauntlet — let’s get this done by August recess, what do you think? Markets structure, GENIUS Act, [Strategic Bitcoin Reserve], all done by August,” Moreno said.

Gillibrand tempered expectations, telling Moreno that there was no way to get a market structure bill done by August, but that Congress is “definitely going to get stablecoins done” before the summer break — perhaps, she amended, even before the Easter recess in April, “if we’re really productive.”",coindesk

Just after the noon hour on the east coast, bitcoin has pulled back about 3% from overnight highs to $86,500. The broad-market crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index was 1.9% lower through the past 24 hours, with ether (ETH), solana (SOL) and AAVE declining around 3%-4% during the same period.

The price action happened with U.S. risk assets showing weakness. The S&P500 and Nasdaq indexes were down 0.8% and 1.6%, respectively, erasing most of their gains since Monday's opening.

Fresh concerns over the U.S. debt ceiling perhaps loomed over markets. The Congressional Budget Office issued a warning today that the federal government may run out of money as soon as August if lawmakers don't raise the debt limit. U.S. tariffs, poised to go into effect on April 2, could also be weighing on investor nerves.



""Uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy and the broader political landscape remains front of mind,"" analysts at hedge fund QCP said in a Telegram broadcast. ""The market still lacks clarity on the scope, timing and magnitude of these potential actions. Until then, we expect more sideways volatility.""

Is GameStop buying bitcoin even bullish?

Bitcoin bulls, meanwhile, are once again left scratching their heads as the price fails to react positively to news of yet another deep-pocketed buyer planning to invest in the world's largest crypto.

""Zombie companies like GameStop 'pulling a Saylor' as a get out of jail cared would be a clear topping signal,"" said James Check, first one year ago and then again Tuesday evening following GME's announcement.

He reminded that he said similar about publicly trader miners when those capital-burning companies decided to stack bitcoin beyond what their mining activity provided.

The company's business development unit, Bitso Business, has established Juno, a subsidiary dedicated to issuing and managing digital assets including stablecoins. Bitso Business also recently appointed Ben Reid as head of stablecoins to drive the firm's ambition in the stablecoin market.

The first token Juno issues is a fully-backed Mexican peso stablecoin (MXNB), aiming to facilitate cross-border payments and financial transactions between businesses across the region. The firm deployed the token on Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum.

Stablecoins, now a nearly $230 billion asset class, have been one of the biggest success stories in crypto adoption. With prices pegged to an external asset, predominantly to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, they offer a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional financial rails for payments, remittances, savings and currency conversion. They are especially popular in developing countries with large unbanked populations or fragile local currencies. Meanwhile, regulations around the world are being laid down or advanced to fit stablecoins into the global financial system.

""Global companies face significant monetary challenges when it comes to serving customers in new markets and conducting cross-border payments, including high intermediary costs and inefficient transaction times,"" Bitso's Reid in a statement.

The token would form part of company's strategy to enter the tokenized government bonds market. Stablecoins are a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a real-world asset such as the U.S. dollar or gold. They provide a convenient way for crypto traders to preserve their fiat value without having to cash out of the market.

The news emerges just days after Fidelity filed paperwork to register a blockchain-based version of its U.S. dollar money market fund.

The company seeks to register an ""OnChain"" share class of its Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX), which holds cash and U.S. Treasury securities and is available only to Fidelity's hedge fund and institutional clients. A Fidelity stablecoin could fill the role of cash in this fund.

The stablecoin would enter an already crowded market dominated by the likes of Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. The report comes a day after World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a decentralized finance protocol backed by President Donald Trump, confirmed it too has plans to offer a stablecoin.

IT’S ALIVE! ETHEREUM PECTRA TEST: The final dress rehearsal for Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade occurred Wednesday, as the blockchain's biggest changes in over a year were tested an additional time following a series of mishaps. The upgrade on the new Hoodi testnet was closely watched given that two previous tests, on the Holesky and Sepolia test networks, failed to finalize properly. Following those tests, developers created a new testnet, Hoodi, to give ecosystem players, particularly staking providers, one more testing opportunity before the Pectra upgrade hits Ethereum’s mainnet. The test involved passing Hoodi a series of code changes meant to make Ethereum more user-friendly for both end-users as well as developers. One of those changes adds smart contract functionality to wallets, allowing wallet software developers to build new convenience-oriented features, like the ability to pay transaction fees in cryptocurrencies other than ether (ETH). ​​Testnets act as copies of a main blockchain, and are used by developers to run through any major code changes in a low stakes environment, giving them a place to patch out any bugs before they reach mainnet. Hoodi was the last of three testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. Developers previously agreed that if all went well on Wednesday, Pectra would be monitored for around 30 more days and then, finally, activated on Ethereum's mainnet. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

HYPERLIQUID EASES TOKENS FOR DEFI: The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector is among the biggest drivers of value accrual and revenue creation for crypto projects, but its complexity often leaves users tangled in a web of blockchains, bridges, wallets and tokens. A technical update by Hyperliquid is making that process easier for both developers and users, with the direct linking of tokens on HyperCore and HyperEVM platforms now being possible. HyperCore is its native platform for spot assets (think tokens you can trade directly), and HyperEVM, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) network that executes smart contracts on Ethereum. Tokens on HyperCore, dubbed “Core spot,” can be linked to their counterparts on HyperEVM and are called “EVM spot.” Once linked, users can transfer them using simple actions — like a “spotSend” on HyperCore or a standard ERC-20 transfer on HyperEVM. By letting tokens move directly between them — without a third-party intermediary — developers can create products that cut out the technical chops required to move assets, which is easy for heavy crypto users, but may be challenging for beginners. — Shaurya Malwa Read more.

CELO MIGRATION to LAYER-2: The Celo blockchain's long-awaited plan of becoming an Ethereum layer-2 chain has been completed, ending an almost two-year process, the main organizations behind the network said Wednesday. The transition ends a long journey beginning back in July 2023 for the layer-1 blockchain that included a community vote in July 2024 and a fierce competition, won by Optimism, among layer-2 networks out to convince the Celo ecosystem to build with their technology. The improved network — like other layer 2s — offers faster and cheaper transactions on top of Ethereum's mainnet. The blockchain is powered by Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build layer-2 networks based off of Optimism’s technology. According to Rene Reisberg, the CEO of the Celo Foundation, the migration is the first of its kind in the Ethereum ecosystem, and will probably be used as a blueprint for other EVM-compatible blockchains that are looking to become a layer-2 network. — Margaux Nijkerk Read more.

BITCOIN DEFI FACES FORK DILEMMA: Bitcoin developers looking to expand the blockchain's decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities are likely to be considering zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, functionality that's not currently available and which require a so-called soft fork, or new version of the software, to introduce them. That's a problem, according Edan Yago, a Bitcoin veteran of over a decade and core contributor to smart contract operating system BitcoinOS (BOS). ""Forking a blockchain, especially one with $2 trillion worth of value on it, is like open-heart surgery,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview. ZK proofs are a cryptographic method of proving the validity of statements while maintaining privacy through not revealing any information about it. The functionality is not available in Bitcoin's software, but could be made so through proposed implementations like OP_CAT and OP_CTV. Yago said developers should be able to find ways of enabling them on Bitcoin without any kind of fork. ""The burden of proof is on developers to demonstrate that there is no other way of accomplishing this through clever engineering,"" he said. This is what BOS hopes to achieve through the BitSNARK, a Bitcoin rollup protocol that is part of the family of computing paradigms being developed to scale the original blockchain. These emerged following the introduction of BitVM by Robin Linus in October 2023, which set out a framework for how Ethereum-like smart contracts could be enabled on Bitcoin. BitcoinOS has now open-sourced what Yago describes as a ""fully production-ready"" BitSNARK protocol, meaning developers now have access to ZK verification on Bitcoin and can connect it to other blockchains like Ethereum, Solana and Cardano. — Jamie Crawley Read more.

The HotStuff consensus is an example of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) for blockchains that allows consensus even when some nodes are faulty or malicious. Imagine a group of friends planning a picnic who must agree on a date, location and duration. If the majority agrees, they can successfully move forward while bypassing potential disruptions from a few unreliable friends.

STORY CONTINUES BELOW Don't miss another story. Subscribe to the The Protocol Newsletter today . See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy .

The HotStuff blockchain consensus mechanism takes this further by allowing seamless leader replacement if the decision-maker or the leader node behaves erratically, thereby reducing delays and improving efficiency.

Besides, in traditional BFT systems, every node sends multiple back-and-forth confirmations, which causes delays. The HotStuff mechanism streamlines the process where a leader node proposes a decision and validator nodes confirm in a single step.

""At its core, Plasma leverages PlasmaBFT, a Fast HotStuff–inspired consensus protocol optimized for rapid finality and low latency, supporting high‑frequency global stablecoin transfers,"" Plasma announced on X.

Finality in blockchain means the speed at which transactions are confirmed and added to blocks, following which they become irreversible. Meanwhile, low latency refers to the quickness in processing transactions.

""Stablecoins are the killer app of crypto and we haven’t had anyone build infrastructure for stablecoin interaction at a base level. Plasma changes this with a unique ability to maximize TPS while minimizing transaction fees for users because the chain is not trying to fit every use case under the sun,"" Zaheer Ebtikar, chief investment officer and founder of Split Capital, said.

Plasma's blockchain is purpose-built for tether, the world's largest dollar-pegged stablecoin with a market capitalization of $144 billion. Tether accounts for over 60% of the total stablecoin market, according to data source Coingecko, and its issuer made $13.7 billion in profits last year. The early backers of the project include prominent industry names like venture capitalist Peter Thiel, Tether's CEO Paolo Ardoino and Split Capital's Zaheer Ebtikar.

Plasma is designed to be a Bitcoin sidechain with full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Most stablecoin activity happens on smart contract blockchains such as Ethereum, Tron and Solana.

Plasma's execution layer is built on Rust Ethereum, also known as Reth, a modular engine compatible with the EVM, allowing Plasma to run any Ethereum smart contract.

The stablecoin project also has a built-in bitcoin bridge that uses the same group of decentralized validators as the BFT mechanism and periodically links to updates on the Bitcoin blockchain. This allows Ethereum applications to work easily with Bitcoin, using the latter as the settlement layer.

""By periodically anchoring state diffs on Bitcoin, Plasma achieves seamless interoperability and uses Bitcoin as a settlement layer—delivering permissionless finality, stronger censorship resistance, and a universally verifiable source of truth,"" Plasma said.

Steven Lubka, head of Swan Bitcoin said the new stablecoin infrastructure seems to be ""betting on the thesis that other blockchains are only good for stablecoins and they need Bitcoin security properties to be inherited.""

Other key features of Plasma include custom gas tokens, allowing fee payments in USDT or BTC, zero-charge USDT transfers and confidential transactions while ensuring compliance.

The improved network — like other layer 2s — offers faster and cheaper transactions on top of Ethereum's mainnet. The blockchain is powered by Optimism’s OP Stack, a customizable framework that lets developers build layer-2 networks based off of Optimism’s technology.

“You know, whenever people ask us, we always recommend the OP stack, because the team there has been so helpful and so supportive,” said Marek Olszewski, the CEO at cLabs, the main developer firm supporting the Celo blockchain.

A blueprint for other layer 1s

According to Rene Reisberg, the CEO of the Celo Foundation, the migration is the first of its kind in the Ethereum ecosystem, and will probably be used as a blueprint for other EVM-compatible blockchains that are looking to become a layer-2 network.

“This path of not just spinning up a new chain, but actually maintaining that history, and having everyone be on the new chain, while it's a lot more work, is great from a Celo perspective. It's becoming this kind of great case study for Ethereum,” Rene Reinsberg, the president at the Celo Foundation, said in an interview.

“Even just based on outreach I've been getting from other L1 founders that are like, ‘hey, so what does it actually feel like on the inside of going through this transition, and how much work is it, and how you're thinking about it?’ And so it definitely feels like there's increased interest now,” Reinsberg added.

Despite Ethereum's leaders experiencing backlash from the community because of the clunky experience of operating between the plethora of layer-2 blockchains, the lagging price of ether (ETH) relative to other cryptocurrencies and the blockchain losing mindshare and new talent to competitors like Solana, Reinsberg said other layer 1s similar to Celo are watching the transition and also considering moving into the layer-2 ecosystem.

“As some of these short-term storms come down and sentiment starts to shift, I think you'll start seeing a series of layer 1s that will likely be more public about that,” Reisberg said. “But we're definitely already seeing these early conversations happening.”

Celo’s new home

According to the team, Celo end users won’t notice much of a difference in their setups, and will still be able to access key features like SocialConnect, a protocol that connects users' phone numbers or X handles to their Celo wallet addresses to make payments. Nevertheless, there are protocol-level changes.

“Validator responsibilities have evolved from operating the consensus protocol to temporarily running community RPC nodes, with validator rewards now distributed via smart contract execution rather than at epoch blocks,” the team said in a press release. “Additionally, transaction sequencing — previously determined by validators running the consensus protocol — will initially be handled by a centralized sequencer, with a roadmap in place for transitioning to decentralized sequencing in the future.”

The Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE Act) ""is a strong continuation of our work on digital assets in the last Congress,"" Hill said in a statement.

The Senate Banking Committee had already advanced its own version of the legislation with a strong bipartisan vote, so it moves on now to consideration on the Senate floor. Rep. Tom Emmer, the House majority whip who has been among Congress' top crypto advocates for years, said the two bills have ""some minor differences that I'm sure can be ironed out.""

Also on Wednesday, Emmer reintroduced his Securities Clarity Act, which seeks to define how a crypto asset might fall within the securities law framework. Emmer introduced the bill, which was part of last year's Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT 21), alongside Democratic Representative Darren Soto.

Emmer, Steil and many other lawmakers involved in crypto efforts on Capitol Hill all appeared on Wednesday at the DC Blockchain Summit, a crypto policy event hosted by the Digital Chamber. Most of them shared hopes that the stablecoin effort would be completed by August.

As the conference wrapped up, the Senate prepared to vote for a second time on a Congressional Review Act resolution overturning the IRS' 2024 regulation governing decentralized finance (DeFi) brokers.

Unicoin представляв останній удар проти галузі від попереднього голови SEC Гарі Генслера, про що повідомила фірма в офіційному повідомленні Наприкінці минулого року регулятор мав намір звинуватити його в шахрайстві, оманливих діях і роботі з незареєстрованими цінними паперами. Про розслідування було оголошено в останні дні правління президента JOE Байдена в грудні, перед тим, як керівництво SEC перейшло до тих, кого вибрав президент Дональд Трамп, шанувальник Крипто .

Генеральний директор, який спостерігав, як дюжина інших Крипто відпустила від своїх примусових дій нове керівництво агентства, розповів CoinDesk, що 17 березня він написав листа новій робочій групі агентства з Крипто , запитуючи про розслідування.

«Я шукаю вашої поради щодо найкращого способу вирішення цього зловживання владою та припинення цього», — написав Конаніхін у листі, копію якого переглянув CoinDesk. Він вимагав припинити справу та переглянути поведінку посадовця правоохоронних органів, який займався цією справою в агентстві, через його «бажання використати владу SEC у політичних цілях».

Представник SEC відмовився коментувати статус Unicoin у середу. Представник Unicoin повідомив CoinDesk у вівторок, що компанія «залишається на завершальній стадії процесу розгляду SEC. На даний момент ми не отримали жодних нових оновлень або офіційних відгуків від SEC щодо нашої реєстрації. Ми повністю віддані дотриманню вимог і прозорості, і ми продовжуємо працювати над отриманням необхідних дозволів для наших запланованих пропозицій».

Генеральний директор вірить своїй компанії, яка пропонує інвестори можуть побачити до 8000% прибутку, був об’єктом переслідувань агентств минулого року, сказав він в інтерв’ю CoinDesk у Вашингтоні.

«Вони вимагали від нас пообіцяти не виходити на біржу в США, не проводити ICO, не збирати кошти», — сказав він. «Тож я зібрав валізи й переїхав до Європи, щоб відновити бізнес».

Він сказав, що обрання Трампа та обіцянки президента зробити США глобальною Крипто столицею змусили його повернутися до Нью-Йорка зі Швейцарії з наміром вийти тут на біржу.

«Ми думали, що війна закінчилася, і ми сказали SEC: «Гей, ми відновлюємо свою діяльність», — сказав Конанихін. У цей момент агентство оголосило про намір висунути проти компанії цивільні звинувачення.

Конаніхін зазначив, що регулятор звинуватив їх у порушенні законодавства про цінні папери через airdrop. Конаніхін стверджував, що це звичайна маркетингова стратегія, яку можна побачити в багатьох Крипто , і це те, «що президент Сполучених Штатів робить зі своїм мемкойном».

«Соромно, що війна з Крипто все ще триває», — сказав він. Якщо агентство продовжить свою війну з Крипто , переслідуючи Unicoin, «я думаю, що багато спостерігачів будуть здивовані».

Unicoin розпочався як спроба створити «більш прозору та надійну альтернативу» Bitcoin у США (яка, як стверджується на веб-сайті Unicoin, повернув 9 мільйонів відсотків інвесторам за останні 10 років). За його словами, деякі аналітики вважають, що Bitcoin був «створений китайською розвідкою, але ніхто насправді не знає ким».

«Я в захваті від можливості взяти участь у перетворенні Америки на Крипто столицю планети, як президент пообіцяв, що він хоче зробити, навіть незважаючи на те, що це дуже дратує переслідування спадщини з боку SEC», — сказав Конанихін.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,We’ve Turned A Generation of Bitcoiners Into Digital Goldbugs,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/featured/weve-turned-a-generation-of-bitcoiners-into-digital-goldbugs,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:28:28 GMT","Bitcoin is a technology. It is not some force of the universe, some natural element or mineral that was “discovered” floating out in the ether. It is a technology. Technologies are created by human beings, not discovered. They are designed. That design has intent, elements of it are made specifically in a way to facilitate that intent. The tolerances of what a technology can or cannot handle are a result of those design decisions, which are in turn a result of the intent.

New Bitcoiners are being brought into the world of Bitcoin through a lens that obscures and distorts the realities of Bitcoin as a technology and what that entails, and tries to pack it into the box of “digital gold.”

Bitcoiners are becoming goldbugs. People who think Bitcoin is some magic thing that is decentralized “just cause,” whose future success is preordained and an absolute certainty.

This is a disastrous way for people to conceptualize Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a decentralized computer network. The conditions of a network are not a static thing. Environments change, network loads change, behavior of network users change. All of these things can have impacts on the viability and functioning of the network itself.

Gold doesn’t need patches for vulnerabilities. Gold doesn’t have to overhaul major subsystems because a change in user behavior overloaded them to the point of not functioning correctly or efficiently. Gold doesn’t need to worry about Denial of Service attack vectors that could disrupt, or worst case bring down, the entire “gold network.”

Bitcoin does. Bitcoin is not “digital gold,” it is a decentralized network made of software individuals actually have to run and maintain. The Bitcoin goldbugs have completely lost connection with this reality, at least when it comes to rationally assessing risks to Bitcoin, or ways it genuinely could fail or be co-opted.

Bitcoin is going to have problems it needs to solve, at a fundamental technical level. It already does, and it will have more. This is how technology works, it is an inherent part of it. Bitcoin’s value stems from its use as a censorship resistant network, a freedom money no one can stop you from using. That is its core valuable characteristic.

That characteristic hinges entirely on its decentralized nature.

If people do not work to defend that decentralized nature, to interact with Bitcoin in a decentralized fashion, to improve and fix it as needed to counteract limitations or pressures encouraging centralization, then it will not remain decentralized.

We are going to very soon regret the consequences of focusing so much outreach the last few cycles purely on spreading this “digital gold” narrative. This entire generation of Bitcoiners does not fundamentally understand that decentralization isn’t a static unchanging characteristic set in stone forever.

It needs to be maintained.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,Congressman Ro Khanna Says Democrats Are Changing Their Tune On Bitcoin,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/politics/congressman-ro-khanna-says-democrats-are-changing-their-tune-on-bitcoin,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 08:45:06 GMT","On March 11, 2025, Rep. Ro Khanna gave a short but impactful talk at the Bitcoin Policy Institute’s Bitcoin for America summit.

“Bitcoin is transformational for so many people around the world,” Rep. Khanna stated at the summit. “That is why the Democratic Party should be embracing it as something that can create financial empowerment for people not just in the United States, but around the world.”

This is the type of message he’s been spreading for years now, and he’s urged his fellow Democrats to follow his lead. He’s implored them to not be scared of Bitcoin but to view it just as they view other major technological advancements of our time, including the internet itself.

“My goal is to make Bitcoin bipartisan,” Rep. Khanna told Bitcoin Magazine. “I want to convince Democrats that bitcoin is a next-generation store of value that millions of people around the world use and that America showing leadership on it allows us to connect with these people, often some of the most disenfranchised.”

For a party that often advocates for financial inclusion, it seems almost ironic that so many Democrats have looked past Bitcoin, an open-source technology that anyone can use with nothing more than an internet connection (and, in some cases, even without one).

With that said, Rep. Khanna made the point that, while he remains one of the few more vocal Democrats when it comes to being pro-Bitcoin, the number of Democratic politicians who have stated that they’re in favor of the technology has increased substantially over the past few years.

“We went from just 10 of us or so supporting Bitcoin and crypto to almost 70 or 80,” said Rep. Khanna. “It’s happening slowly.”

And while some have attributed to malice most Democrats’ historical stance on Bitcoin, Rep. Khanna claims the issue is more a lack of understanding of the technology’s purpose and use cases.

“Some Democratic politicians are not aware of how helpful Bitcoin can be with remittances or how it can be used by those who don’t have access to U.S. dollars,” said the congressman. “Many people around the world use it for both reasons,” he added, alluding to the idea that many, including some Democrats, might not be aware of this fact.

The Bitcoin And Crypto Voting Bloc In U.S. Swing States

According to research from Coinbase, in each of the swing states in the most recent U.S. presidential election, there were about 10 times the number of crypto holders compared to the vote differential between Biden and Trump in 2020.

Harris lost to Trump in each of these swing states, leaving some to speculate that the turnout of the Bitcoin and crypto voting bloc may have been one of the primary forces that swayed the election in Trump’s favor.

While Rep. Khanna doesn’t know to what extent this voting bloc impacted the election results, he agreed that it was likely one of many major factors that affected the outcome of the election.

“I think it made a difference,” said the congressman. “In such a close election, everything matters, and the fact that there were some Democrats who offended Bitcoin and crypto voters was not helpful.”

And Rep. Khanna is not alone in acknowledging this.

In December 2024, at the New York Times DealBook Summit, Van Jones — political analyst, media persona, and prominent voice within the Democratic party — stated that it was to the Democratic party’s detriment that it shut out pro-Bitcoin and pro-crypto voters.

Rep. Khanna sang Jones’ praises and said that we should be hearing more voices like Jones’ within the Democratic party speaking up in favor of Bitcoin in the near future.

“I have a lot of respect for Van Jones,” said Rep. Khanna.

“He spent some time in the Bay Area, so he gets technology. The party will be moving in a direction that’s going to embrace Bitcoin and other technologies,” he added.

Will President Trump’s Embrace Of Bitcoin Deter Democrats From Supporting It?

While it only seems logical that the Democratic party would reverse its stance on Bitcoin if it’s looking to pick up seats on the House and Senate come the 2026 midterm elections, it simultaneously seems difficult to imagine more Democrats coming out in support of Bitcoin given the highly partisan political climate in the U.S. coupled with the fact that President Trump is an ardent Bitcoin supporter.

Rep. Khanna argued that Democrats shouldn’t be thinking along party lines when it comes to Bitcoin, but rather assessing the technology based solely on what it is.

“Politicians are capable of evaluating Bitcoin on its merits,” said Rep. Khanna.

“Bitcoin is just a decentralized digital currency that enables peer-to-peer transactions without a need for an intermediary. People just need to study Bitcoin and learn that it’s just a medium of exchange,” he added.

Rep. Khanna also took a moment to differentiate between Bitcoin and meme coins, highlighting the fact that the president’s recently released coin ($TRUMP) creates much confusion regarding the value proposition of crypto assets, including bitcoin.

“We shouldn’t have elected officials like President Trump launching meme coins,” said the congressman.

Getting Democrats on the Right Side of History

At a time when many U.S. citizens are struggling to make ends meet, should Bitcoin be a front-and-center issue for Democrats, once widely regarded as the political party of the middle and working class?

Rep. Khanna doesn’t necessarily think so, but he also doesn’t think the party should continue to pooh-pooh the technology.

“There are far bigger issues at hand right now like the cuts in Medicaid, the firing of veterans, and the erratic policy of tariffs,” the congressman explained.

“But the Democrats were on the wrong side of issues of innovation and Bitcoin in 2022 and 2024, and we now have an opportunity to get on the right side of it,” he added.

So, how can pro-Bitcoin Democrat voters help to get their party on the right side of history when it comes to Bitcoin?

Rep. Khanna had a few suggestions:

“They should point to those of us who are leading on Bitcoin and crypto,” he said.

“They can encourage members of government to study the issue, so that they’re not uninformed,” he added.

“And they should talk about the enormous adoption of Bitcoin.”",bitcoinmagazine
https://bitcoinmagazine.com,GameStop Announces $1.3 Billion Fundraising Plan to Purchase Bitcoin,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/news/gamestop-announces-1-3-billion-fundraising-plan-to-purchase-bitcoin,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 15:34:17 GMT","GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) announced today that it intends to raise $1.3 billion through a private offering of convertible senior notes and will use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin. The move comes a day after the company revealed an update to its investment policy, allowing Bitcoin to be used as a treasury reserve asset.

The offering consists of $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2030. Additionally, the company plans to grant initial purchasers an option to buy up to $200 million more in notes within a 13-day period from the first issuance date. The notes will be general unsecured obligations and will not bear regular interest or accrete in value. They will mature on April 1, 2030, unless converted, redeemed, or repurchased earlier.

Upon conversion, GameStop will have the option to settle in cash, shares of its Class A common stock, or a combination of both. The initial conversion rate and other terms will be determined at the time of pricing. The company stated that it expects to use the U.S. composite volume-weighted average price of its stock from 1:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the pricing date as the reference for the initial conversion price.

GameStop emphasized that neither the notes nor any shares of common stock issuable upon conversion have been or will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws. As a result, they may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption. The company also stated that there are no assurances that the offering will be completed as described or at all.

This marks a significant financial decision for GameStop as it pivots toward integrating Bitcoin into its corporate strategy. A strategy pioneered by Strategy’s Michael Saylor, who met with GameStop’s CEO Ryan Cohen in person last month, and has definitely appeared to have had an influence on the GameStop’s decision to embrace BTC as a reserve asset.",bitcoinmagazine

With approximately $4.78 billion in cash—nearly 37% of its $12.9 billion market cap—this move marks more than just a diversification of reserves.

JUST IN: @GameStop updates its investment policy to add #Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.

It’s a signal that corporate treasury strategy is evolving. That excess cash on the balance sheet can—and perhaps should—be more than idle. And that new asset classes are gaining legitimacy in the boardroom, not just on message boards.

GameStop’s move may not be typical. But it is highly strategic—and increasingly relevant for CFOs evaluating how to preserve capital and unlock value in a shifting macro landscape.

Why Bitcoin—and Why Now?

For companies with material cash holdings, the erosion of purchasing power is no longer theoretical—it’s measurable. Over the past decade, the U.S. dollar has declined in real terms by more than 25%, driven by inflation, expansionary monetary policy, and global fiscal uncertainty.

Bitcoin presents a compelling counterweight to this degradation, particularly for balance sheets with the flexibility to tolerate mark-to-market volatility in pursuit of long-term strategic payoff.

Consider its defining characteristics:

Fixed supply: Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, making it the only digital asset engineered to be verifiably scarce in a world of expanding monetary supply.

Bitcoin is capped at 21 million units, making it the only digital asset engineered to be verifiably scarce in a world of expanding monetary supply. Global liquidity: Bitcoin trades 24/7 in deep global markets, offering CFOs a high-liquidity, non-sovereign asset class accessible without jurisdictional constraints.

Bitcoin is not subject to interest rate policy, quantitative easing, or the political whims of central banks. Long-term outperformance: With a 6-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 72.7%, Bitcoin has dramatically outpaced equities, bonds, and real estate over the same period.

For CFOs thinking in 3-, 5-, or 10-year increments, the case for allocating even a small portion of excess cash to Bitcoin is no longer fringe—it’s prudent exploration.

Accounting Clarity Unlocks Strategic Action

Until recently, many finance teams ruled out Bitcoin simply due to unfavorable accounting treatment. Under legacy GAAP standards, Bitcoin had to be impaired when its price dropped, but could not be revalued when it recovered—an asymmetric model that distorted true economic value and discouraged adoption.

In late 2024, that barrier was removed.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) approved new rules that now allow companies to measure Bitcoin at fair market value. Beginning in 2025, companies can:

Reflect both unrealized gains and losses in earnings

Report Bitcoin more transparently in financial statements

Align accounting treatment with actual asset performance

This change addresses one of the most common objections from CFOs and audit committees alike. It brings Bitcoin into compliance with modern reporting standards—making it viable not just for speculation, but for responsible treasury management.

Why GameStop Was a Natural Fit

Every company has a unique capital structure, investor base, and operational profile. GameStop’s decision to allocate to Bitcoin wasn’t just bold—it was structurally appropriate.

High liquidity: With over $4.6 billion in cash and equivalents, GameStop’s balance sheet provides room for allocation without compromising near-term operations.

GameStop’s shareholders have already demonstrated long-term conviction and a willingness to support unorthodox but calculated strategies. Cultural alignment: As a company that challenged Wall Street norms in 2021, GameStop’s embrace of a decentralized, digital reserve asset aligns with its identity as a financial outlier.

This doesn’t mean Bitcoin is a fit for every public company. But for those with excess reserves and a forward-looking treasury mindset, it deserves serious consideration.

The Bigger Picture: What It Means for Other Companies

GameStop’s move is part of a broader rethinking of the traditional treasury reserve model. For decades, companies stored value in cash, short-term bonds, and dollar-denominated equivalents. But in today’s environment, those instruments may preserve nominal value while degrading purchasing power.

Bitcoin introduces an alternative—and the macro backdrop is increasingly supportive.

Ongoing inflation: Despite cooling from its peak, inflation remains persistently above central bank targets, steadily eroding the real value of corporate cash holdings.

Shift in investor expectations: As digital-native generations begin to shape capital markets, shareholder interest in Bitcoin and hard assets is rising—especially among retail and growth-oriented investors.

These tailwinds create space for CFOs to begin allocating conservatively—without needing to commit to a radical overhaul of reserve strategy.

A Quiet Signal to the Market

GameStop’s move didn’t come with a flashy press conference or social media fanfare. It came through a formal policy update—exactly how strategic treasury decisions are typically made.

The signal it sends is simple but important: “We believe excess capital should be protected—and positioned for asymmetric upside.”

Bitcoin is not a cure-all. But it is now, for the first time, auditable, liquid, and institutionally viable. For CFOs with flexibility and foresight, exploring Bitcoin is no longer about being first—it’s about preparing for what’s next.

You can watch the full video here: Will MicroStrategy Realistically Surpass $1,000 – Data Analysis

Strategy’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Over 500,000 BTC

Strategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has firmly positioned itself as a Bitcoin-centric company. In less than five years, it has accumulated over 500,000 BTC—accounting for more than 2.5% of Bitcoin’s total supply—turning its stock into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure.

This dashboard empowers investors to assess the intrinsic value of MSTR and its correlation to Bitcoin price movements.

Can Strategy’s MSTR Price Reach $1,000? Data-Backed Scenarios

Matt Crosby walks through multiple valuation models based on the following assumptions:

Bitcoin price levels at $100K, $150K, and $200K

BTC holdings expanding to 700K or even 800K BTC

NAV premiums ranging from 2x to 3.5x

Using these inputs, Crosby outlines realistic Strategy stock price targets between $950 and $2,000. In ultra-bullish scenarios, extreme targets of $15,000 or even $25,000 are modeled, though acknowledged as speculative.

Capital Raises Fuel Future BTC Accumulation

To support further Bitcoin acquisition, Strategy is leveraging several financial instruments:

A $2.1 billion at-the-money stock offering

A $711 million perpetual preferred stock issuance

These capital raises could enable the company to purchase an additional 200K to 300K BTC.

MSTR Insights Based on Numbers

For investors closely tracking Strategy (MSTR), the numbers tell a powerful story:

500,000+ BTC Accumulated: Strategy now holds over 2.41% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist — making it the go-to public stock for BTC exposure.

Strategy now holds over 2.41% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist — making it the go-to public stock for BTC exposure. From $9 to $543: Since 2020, MSTR’s stock has soared from around $9 to over $543 (adjusted for stock splits), thanks largely to its Bitcoin accumulation strategy.

Since 2020, MSTR’s stock has soared from around $9 to over $543 (adjusted for stock splits), thanks largely to its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Revenue vs. BTC Value: While Strategy pulled in $463 million in software revenue in 2024, its Bitcoin holdings are worth around $43 billion — it would take a century of software sales to match its BTC portfolio.

At times, MSTR has traded at a 3.4x premium to its net asset value. The current premium is around 1.7x, with room to expand in a bullish market. Higher Volatility Than BTC: MSTR’s price swings are more intense than Bitcoin’s — its 3-month volatility peaked at 7.56%, compared to BTC’s 3.32%.

MSTR’s price swings are more intense than Bitcoin’s — its 3-month volatility peaked at 7.56%, compared to BTC’s 3.32%. Deeper Drawdowns in Bear Markets: In past down cycles, BTC lost about 80%, but MSTR fell as much as 90%, showing it tends to amplify Bitcoin’s moves.

Together, these figures highlight both the massive upside potential and the high volatility risk that come with investing in Strategy.

Strategy vs. Bitcoin: Volatility and Correlation Analysis

Crosby points out that Strategy tends to move even more sharply than Bitcoin. Over the past three months, Bitcoin’s volatility averaged around 3.32%, while MSTR’s volatility reached 7.56% — more than double.

Looking back at bear markets, Bitcoin typically retraced about 80%, but Strategy’s stock fell closer to 90%. This highlights that Strategy doesn’t just follow Bitcoin — it amplifies it. That means bigger gains in bull markets, but also steeper losses during downturns.

Limitations: Will Strategy Ever Rival Apple in Market Cap?

While the numbers might hint at sky-high stock price possibilities, reaching them is another story. For Strategy to seriously compete with tech giants like Apple, it would need to:

Accumulate between 850,000 and 1 million BTC

See Bitcoin’s total market cap rise above gold’s $20 trillion

Sustain a net asset value (NAV) premium of 3x to 4x consistently

Even if all that happened, Strategy’s market cap would need to grow by 45 times to match Apple’s $3.3 trillion valuation. That kind of leap is extremely unlikely in this current cycle — it’s more of a long-term, speculative scenario.

Conclusion: Strategy’s MSTR Price Outlook is Bullish but Speculative

According to Matt Crosby’s analysis, Strategy’s MSTR price reaching $1,000 or even $2,000 is entirely within the realm of possibility during this market cycle—provided Bitcoin maintains its upward trajectory and investor sentiment remains bullish. These targets are grounded in data models that factor in current BTC holdings, potential future acquisitions, and historical NAV premiums.

However, this opportunity doesn’t come without its caveats. Strategy’s stock is known for its heightened volatility—often exceeding that of Bitcoin itself—which makes it a high-beta, high-risk investment vehicle. Investors considering MSTR should be prepared for significant price swings and prolonged drawdowns, particularly during Bitcoin market corrections.

That said, for long-term Bitcoin believers and those with a higher tolerance for risk, Strategy offers a compelling, leveraged play on the broader crypto market. With its continued accumulation strategy and substantial institutional backing, MSTR remains one of the most data-driven and high-conviction ways to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s future growth.

As always, potential investors should do their due diligence, factor in risk management strategies, and align their investments with personal financial goals and time horizons.

https://bitcoinmagazine.com,How PlebLab is Shaping the Future of Bitcoin Startups in Austin,https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/how-pleblab-is-shaping-the-future-of-bitcoin-startups-in-austin,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 07:15:00 GMT","Born in the heart of Texas, PlebLab.dev is a well-known name within the Bitcoin start-up world. And yet, most people who have heard about this niche Bitcoin community in Austin are probably unaware of their wins and influence.



Started as a coworking space out of Capital Factory in 2021 by a couple of Bitcoin enthusiasts, PlebLab has grown into a Mecca of the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem in the United States. They host various events and meetups throughout the year and have become a reliable work environment for Bitcoiners, whether living in Austin or just passing through.

“In art school, I had this professor who’d make us stop after an hour of creating, walk around, and give honest feedback on each other’s work—it built a collaborative vibe where we can grow together. That stuck with me,” Car González, CEO of PlebLab, recalls. So when I took over PlebLab, I asked: ‘How do I make it more collaborative? How do I make it more about that, not just coworking?’ When you say coworking, it’s literally just working. How boring is that—working among other people who are also working? That’s not fun.”

Yet more than just a “coworking” space, PlebLab has become a “community accelerator for the Bitcoin era” with multiple successful Bitcoin companies and developer celebrities going through it since its inception.

Genesis

Car González, Keyan Kousha, and Kyle Murphy – founders of PlebLab

Founded out of the dream to build on Bitcoin and grow a local community, PlebLab got its first office in Capital Factory, a renown tech coworking hub in Austin in 2021. The three cofounders, Car González, Keyan Kousha, and Kyle Murphy started doing Bitcoin meetups that grew to crowds of over 200 people. Among them, various entrepreneurs and Bitcoin developers started to stick around, asking to co-work with them out of Capital Factory.

Over time PlebLab grew into different office locations, currently installed next to the Unchained Capital offices and the Bitcoin Park (Formerly Bitcoin Commons) in downtown Austin (at 6th St. and Congress Ave.). With more space, talent, and experience, PlebLab transformed from a coworking space into a mix between a hacker garage and a start-up incubator.



Today they offer various membership packages, mentorship, and a wealth of resources to start-ups that join them, but this is not a pay-to-play “Bitcoin We-work”: Memberships can be denied depending on the goals and purpose of the project. It’s more akin to a private Bitcoin club for builders and technologists than anything else.

“I really think we’re an accelerator for the Bitcoin era. How you do that in an open source, cypherpunk way is you don’t give somebody 500k on day one and say, ‘You got three months to make it or see you later.’ To me, that sounds like a fiat-era thing,” said Car.

Main Events

The main events held by PlebLab are Top Builder and Startup Day. Often taking place within six months of each other.



“Top Builder is the Top Chef of Bitcoin. We try to find the latest, greatest builders, pile them in, and get them to build an MVP or something pitchable,” said Car, describing the event which functions like a three-month hackathon, exposing finalists to VCs and angel investors.

Startup Day on the other hand is a short conference that provides a platform for Bitcoin start-ups to present their work, meet talent, and get exposure in the Bitcoin world. In Car’s words it is meant to “inspire people to go from the sidelines to building their own company. They’ll see themselves in those people talking on stage.”

Judge it by its Fruit

A variety of big names within the Bitcoin start-up world have spent time in PlebLab, Car was very hesitant to take credit for the work of others, and stressed his admiration for the founders and leaders whose journey he has witnessed.

“Seeing their journey go from a person you meet, shake hands with initially, to where they are—seeing the numbers they have, and when they get to a point like base camp, a raise, a pre-seed or seed”, Car said. “That base camp for me is just, ‘Cool, they did it.’ Now, let’s go help somebody else. That’s the thing I love—the shipment of the code, so to speak—We just try to be good stewards of that.”

Nevertheless, the track record is impressive. Here’s a quick overview of Bitcoin projects, companies, and developer celebrities closely associated with PlebLab:

Jippi – Winner of Top Builder 2025

Lead by Oliver, Jippi.app is a beautiful and fun Bitcoin app designed with Gen Z in mind. Echoing the success of Pokemon Go, Jippi invites young people to explore their cities in search of Bitcoin Beasts, charming little 3D creatures that hide in augmented reality, waiting for future owners with sats rewards.



The app has been in development for over a year and just last week won the first prize in PlebLab’s Top Builder competition among fierce competition. Mind-blowing to the judges and audience alike, Jippi has a live, functioning app, man-on-the-street surveys, and app tests in a local university. As well as a masterful presentation of the rationale and vision for Jippi, the app may have the potential to go viral in the United States — and with it bring a new generation into Bitcoin.

Quick shout out to @JippiApp for winning the Top Builder contest from @PlebLab, $15,000 is nothing to sneeze at.

Stacker.news

Started in 2021 by one of PlebLab’s cofounders Keyan Kousha, Stacker.news has quickly become a hub of news for many tech-savvy Bitcoiners. Boasting an open source Lightning-powered Reddit, the platform has gathered an active and loyal fan base that reward each other with sats for every upvote, often being early to integrate the latest technologies in the Bitcoin-social media tech scene.

Zaprite

Started at the end of 2021 by John Magill, Zaprite has quickly grown into a full payment gateway suite for businesses, supporting both Bitcoin and Lightning payment rails as well as event ticketing and all the accounting and invoicing tools necessary for a modern merchant.

Zaprite made recent history by being the interface Donald J. Trump used to pay for a burger with bitcoin at the Bitcoin Pub Pub Key in New York.

Mutiny Wallet

Launched in early 2023 and led by celebrity Bitcoin developers Ben Carman and Tony Giorgio, Mutiny Wallet quickly gained popularity among Lightning power users as a fully featured and innovative Bitcoin app. It consistently integrated cutting-edge payments technology like e-cash-denominated payments and Nostr integration, while rocking its signature red-and-black color scheme.



Following the arrest of Samourai Wallet developers and the consequent chilling effect on Bitcoin self-custody wallet development, Mutiny Wallet announced it would be sunsetting the project, nevertheless demonstrating incredible technical ability and leaving behind a sophisticated set of open source software tools for the Lighting, Nostr, and e-cash ecosystem.

Nifty (Bitcoin++)

As a Bitcoin and Lightning developer, Nifty became famous for her developer education efforts via Base 58, her world-renowned developer events called Bitcoin++, her relentless work ethic, impressive travel schedule, and of course her charm, bringing together Bitcoin developer communities all over the world, multiple times a year.



Nifty has quickly become a recognized and influential figure in the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem, including a seat on the board of directors of Opensats, a public charity focused on funding open source Bitcoin projects of all types, with a special focus on Nostr – the Bitcoin native social media protocol. In her journey to stardom, she spent significant time at PlebLab, and is still often seen at Austin Bitcoin events.



Speaking of which, Nifty’s next Bitcoin++ event will be in Austin, TX on May 7-9, diving deep into the Bitcoin Mempool.

Supertestnet

An early member of the Plelab and Bitcoin Austin scene, Supertestnet appeared out of nowhere in 2021, quickly mastering the art of creating Bitcoin prototypes in JavaScript. He has since implemented cutting-edge Bitcoin technologies like BitVM, even participating in the first Ark mainnet pool, the only other noncustodial Bitcoin layer-2 scaling solution, and is an avid user of X and Nostr.

Supertestnet’s many open source projects, passion for Bitcoin, and unshakable integrity have granted him quick recognition in the Bitcoin start-up ecosystem and likely a fair mention in the annals of Bitcoin history.

Cascdr

Led by Jim, AI engineer and ruthless Bitcoin maxi, Cascdr’s mission is to bring the power of AI and Bitcoin together with strong privacy foundations and a full suite of cool AI apps and workflows. His most recent hit is PullThatUpJamie.ai a podcast search engine that transcribes voice content making it searchable, and facilitating the creation of sharable podcast clips.

BRANTA

Led by Keith, Branta is a cyber security company focused on limiting man-in-the-middle attacks for Bitcoin payments work flows, such as the injection of malicious addresses or invoices in a merchant interface. Grown from the PlebLab accelerator, Branta has already had successful pre-seed raises and was a top-five finalist at the Top Builder contest.

Topher

A renowned Bitcoin developer in his own right and a regular at PlebLab, Topher has shipped a variety of open source Bitcoin tools such as Tapscript, a library for managing Taproot, Schnorr Signatures, and Bitcoin transactions.

Among other things, Topher and Austin (app developer) are currently working on Frostr, a key management solution for private digital identities. Specifically, Frostr is built to solve issues of the sort in Nostr, the Bitcoin-adjacent social network protocol that’s become very popular with Bitcoin users. It reimagines “Frost,” the new and rising multisignature standard in Bitcoin wallets, and uses it to solve key rotation problems in Nostr.

Star Atlas, an upcoming Solana-based sci-fi video game, is collaborating with the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance founding member SingularityNET to integrate AI agents into its spacefaring online world, the two companies announced on Wednesday.

Star Atlas developer ATMTA said the collaboration aims to use AI agents to provide an immersive gaming experience using SingularityNET’s Autonomous Intelligent Reinforcement Interpreted Symbolism, or AIRIS, system, along with the OpenCog Hyperon framework to introduce adaptive AI agents and NPCs that evolve with players.

“Integrating advanced AI is about building the ultimate world-building moments and celebrating players in our dynamic, decentralized ecosystem,” ATMTA co-founder and CEO Michael Wagner said in a statement.

ATMTA, the developers of Star Atlas, are joining forces with @SingularityNET to take immersive gaming to the next level. By integrating advanced Artificial General Intelligence, we're redefining what's possible in the metaverse. 🔗 Read more: https://t.co/FHvf1ogTYg pic.twitter.com/uDlKpzRasS — Star Atlas (@staratlas) March 26, 2025

OpenCog Hyperon is an open-source AI framework from SingularityNET designed to support human-like thinking by learning, storing, and reasoning from experience. AIRIS is another AI system that learns by interacting with its environment, allowing it to solve problems independently without needing preset instructions. These systems support SophiaVerse, a project by Hanson Robotics and SingularityNet that uses the Sophia Robot as a testbed for exploring human-AI collaboration through tools, games, and decentralized governance.

Star Atlas is a blockchain-based, space exploration-themed role-playing game set in 2620. The full-fledged, expansive open-world game is still in production, though a pre-alpha “Showroom” experience was added to the Epic Games Store in September 2022. In October 2023, ATMTA launched SAGE Labs, aka Star Atlas Golden Era, a browser-based game that is part of the larger Star Atlas universe.

Wagner said that integrating advanced technologies like AI agents is essential to enhancing player engagement and scalability as Star Atlas continues evolving.

“Imagine AI agents partnering with players to provide support across onboarding, progression, seasonal quests, and enabling our rich economy with player tools, even scaling and expanding the many worlds and personalization opportunities of Star Atlas,” he said.

“By embedding SingularityNET frameworks like AIRIS and OpenCog Hyperon into Web3 gameplay, we’re not only enriching the user experience—we’re advancing the co-evolution between humans and AIs in a virtual world that, as it develops, will increasingly mirror the complex dynamics of the real one,” said SingularityNET founder and CEO Dr. Ben Goertzel, in a statement.

Launched in 2017 by Goertzel and David Hanson, SingularityNET is a decentralized marketplace for AI models that uses blockchain to make advanced AI available to everyone.

Let's start 2025 with a bang! 🎇 Thread of gameplay videos from our latest update. 👇🧵pic.twitter.com/mBREIiD67X — Star Atlas (@staratlas) January 1, 2025

Goertzel emphasized the broader vision behind the Star Atlas integration with AI agents, saying that this approach shows how decentralized networks and token economies can accelerate the path toward superintelligence while empowering global developer and player communities.

“By building this on Solana and Sophiaverse and within the ASI Alliance ecosystem, we’re demonstrating how decentralized networks and token economies can accelerate the path toward superintelligence while empowering global developer and player communities,” he said.

Star Atlas’s integration of AI reflects a growing trend in the broader blockchain ecosystem. The industry’s fascination with AI agents has led to a surge in projects focused on autonomous artificial intelligence programs. The combined market capitalization of AI agents is $4.8 billion, and $1.3 billion is for AI agent launchpads, according to CoinGecko.

Several U.S. legislators revealed Wednesday their plans to advance stablecoin and crypto market structure legislation through Congress over the next few days—steps toward fulfilling the Trump administration’s promises to the crypto industry.

Speaking on a panel at the Digital Chamber’s Blockchain Summit 2025 Conference in Washington D.C., U.S. Rep French Hill (R-AR) said that in the “next few days,” lawmakers will publish in a revision to FIT 21, a legislative plan that provides regulatory guardrails for the U.S. cryptocurrency industry.

“Business needs certainty and predictability,” said Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), who spoke alongside Hill on the panel. “You want that embedded in the laws of our country.”

Meanwhile, House Financial Services Crypto Subcommittee Leader Rep. Bryan Steil (R-WI) teased that a House stablecoin bill would be unveiled before the end of the day. The draft went live on a government website on Wednesday afternoon.

For months, President Donald Trump has vowed to refashion the U.S. into the “crypto capital of the world” by supporting the development of a more favorable regulatory climate for the digital assets industry. His crypto czar David Sacks doubled down on those promises early last month, pledging to pass both stablecoin and markets structure bills within the first 100 days of President Trump’s second term.

While it's clear that Sacks’ deadline was far too ambitious, policymakers are making moves to signal to the crypto industry that passing comprehensive crypto legislation is top of mind for Congress.

On a panel with three other congresspeople, U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno (R-OH) attempted to pump up a crowd of onlookers with a call to pass a comprehensive digital assets markets structure bill by Congress’ summer recess, beginning in early August.

“Market structure, Genius Act, SBR done by August, right,” Moreno said. “What do you guys think?”

Gillibrand chimed in to temper the crowd’s expectations.

“We cannot get market structure done [by then], but you’re definitely gonna get [a] stablecoin [bill],” she said.

Video game retailer GameStop said on Wednesday that it plans to offer up to $1.3 billion worth of convertible senior notes to investors, taking a page straight out of Strategy's Bitcoin-buying playbook.

The Texas-based firm said in a press release that proceeds from the sale will be used for ""general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin."" The announcement comes one day after GameStop said it could purchase Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset following an update to the company's investment policy.

GameStop expects its offering of convertible senior notes to pay a 0% dividend, according to the press release. The debt can be converted into GameStop’s class A common stock, with a conversion date and pricing set to be determined at a later date.

Strategy has issued billions of dollars of convertible senior notes, raising capital to purchase more Bitcoin than it could otherwise. The company unveiled its latest offering of convertible debt in February, raising $2 billion via convertible notes maturing in March 2030.

GameStop’s expected offering has a similar maturation date. The notes are expected to mature in April 2030, unless they’ve already been converted or are redeemed by GameStop.

The retailer said that holders of its convertible senior notes may receive a mix of cash and shares when the notes are converted at its own discretion.

GameStop shares rose 11% on Wednesday during regular trading hours to $28.38, according to Nasdaq. In after hours trading, however, GameStop’s share price slipped to $26.63.

GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen hinted at the firm’s Bitcoin pivot. Last month, he posed alongside Strategy co-founder and Executive Chairman Michael Saylor in a photo he posted to X.

While GameStop may soon buy Bitcoin using debt, the company is already flush with cash. Per its latest earnings report, the Texas-based firm held $4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. That was up significantly from $921 million a year prior.

Seoul, Korea, March 26th, 2025, Chainwire

CROSS Protocol, a blockchain gaming pioneer, has secured $10 million in its private token sale while establishing an unprecedented equal pricing model for all investors.

The company sold 100 million tokens—10% of its planned 1 billion supply—at $0.10 per token, a price that will remain consistent for its upcoming public sale.

“It's fair that passionate early investors pay the same, whether private or public,” said NEXUS CEO Henry Chang in a statement on X. This approach marks a significant departure from industry norms, where early private investors typically receive substantial discounts.

While many crypto projects offer discounted rates during private sales, CROSS Protocol is challenging this norm by ensuring a level playing field for all participants. This commitment to fairness and trust underpins the project’s transparent and equitable approach to ecosystem development.

Global crypto outlet BeInCrypto recently highlighted CROSS Protocol’s readiness to outpace traditional blockchain gaming projects, pointing to the project’s developer-friendly SDK, robust API, and comprehensive framework for building in-game economies as key differentiators.

Industry experts are closely watching CROSS as it gears up for its public sale and subsequent distribution strategy. “Actions speak louder than words.” CEO Chang tweeted, underscoring the rapid expansion and decisive execution of the CROSS ecosystem.

As CROSS prepares to make its mark on the blockchain gaming market with a fair pricing model and robust developer support, the crypto community eagerly anticipates its next steps.

Role-playing game Forgotten Runiverse has launched in early access on the Ronin Network, allowing users to master spells and earn rewards as they explore the open fantasy world based on the Ethereum NFT collection, Forgotten Runes Wizard’s Cult.

The launch is the culmination of three years of development work and more than 1 million hours of gameplay testing, according to a post by Ronin Network, the game’s new home after it opted to migrate from Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum last year.

“We just launched the first true live service Web3 MMORPG. And it’s free,” posted Forgotten Runes pseudonymous co-founder and COO Bearsnake. “The world, storylines, and even NPCs are based on a blend of community lore and team.”

Runiverse’s Early Access Global Launch is LIVE! Enter Moonlit Wilds now 🌙 Wizards, the moment we’ve been waiting for has arrived. Play. Runiverse. NOW 👇 🔗 : https://t.co/glwld7jWiR Here’s what’s happening 🧵👇pic.twitter.com/8sZTi2TSNE — Ronin (@Ronin_Network) March 26, 2025

Now live after three playtests, the Forgotten Runiverse opens with its first major game content update, called Moonlit Wilds. In Moonlit Wilds, players can access land plots, build new structures, craft and mint items, and master up to 32 spells while embarking on quests.

The launch follows the game’s most recent playtest, called Crash the Runiverse, in which it asked users to push its servers to the limit to be ready for the launch. Eligible users from that test, as well as previous playtests Eve of Memory and New Foundations, are also now able to claim their allocation of Quanta, the world’s in-game currency.

Quanta will ultimately be used to claim the Forgotten Rune’s native token, XP, as well as other partner reward tokens when the token generation event occurs.

Any users that have a portion of Quanta waiting to be claimed will have until May 7 to do so, otherwise the remaining coins will be redistributed to users buying or earning Mana in-game.

The game’s developers anticipate that it will stay in early access for “a while,” noting the complexity and “massive undertaking” that comes with building an MMO.

“The full version of the game will bring significantly more polish, content, and completeness, moving us much closer to the grand vision we’ve set out to build,” the project wrote in a pre-launch article on X (formerly Twitter).

The creators of Forgotten Runiverse recently said that it is the first Web3 game to be accepted for development across all three major console platforms, including Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo. Other blockchain games like Off the Grid, Moonray, and My Pet Hooligan are being built on Xbox and PlayStation, albeit with crypto elements handled differently than on PC.

Forgotten Runes previously raised money from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s Seven Seven Six venture fund to help build out its world.

The game’s early access launch comes one day after Ronin Network NFTs went live on the OpenSea marketplace, further advancing the gaming-focused Ethereum scaling network’s “open” initiatives to bring Ronin to even more users and developers.

https://decrypt.co,Hyperliquid Delists Surging Solana Meme Coin to Avoid Liquidation Crisis,https://decrypt.co/311713/hyperliquid-delists-solana-meme-coin-liquidation-crisis,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 18:38:45 GMT","Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Discover SCENE

Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid delisted perpetual futures for the Solana-based meme coin JELLYJELLY on Wednesday, describing the move as critical to ensuring its network’s integrity amid a looming liquidation crisis.

Hyperliquid uses its own high-speed blockchain, built upon the Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum, and the project said its networks’ validators had convened to take “decisive action,” in a post on X (formerly Twitter).

The decision came after a Hyperliquid user opened a $6 million 20x leveraged short on JELLYJELLY that became toxic as the meme coin’s price rose. On X, spectators speculated that the user may have intentionally tried to liquidate themselves, forcing the decentralized exchange to take over the bad bet as it spiraled out of control.

After evidence of suspicious market activity, the validator set convened and voted to delist JELLY perps. All users apart from flagged addresses will be made whole from the Hyper Foundation. This will be done automatically in the coming days based on onchain data. There is no… — Hyperliquid (@HyperliquidX) March 26, 2025

On Thursday, JELLYJELLY’s price surged as high as $0.043, according to the crypto data provider CoinGecko. Around 2:30pm Eastern Time, it was changing hands around $0.023, showing a 73% jump in value over the past day.

Though Hyperliquid said the decision to delist JELLYJELLY was a collective choice, the move sparked criticism as some traders and industry observers argued that it conflicted with decentralized finance, or DeFi, norms.

$HYPE can’t handle the $JELLY Let’s stop pretending hyperliquid is decentralised And then stop pretending traders actually give a fuck Bet you $HYPE is back where is started in short order cause degens gonna degen — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) March 26, 2025

“Let’s stop pretending Hyperliquid is decentralized,” Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of the crypto exchange BitMEX, said on X.

Users that had JELLYJELLY positions on the platform would be “made whole from the Hyperliquid Foundation” at a later date, Hyperliquid said in the post. The Hyperliquid Foundation is a distinct entity that’s responsible for governing the project’s overall direction.

As the decentralized exchange began unwinding the toxic JELLYJELLY bet, a community-owned vault dubbed the Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) temporarily took a hit.

The vault, where users can pool funds and potentially earn a return as the HLP executes trading strategies and accrues platform fees, saw its all-time profits dip by $11 million, according to Hyperliquid’s website. Those losses were subsequently reversed.

Still, the development spooked the market for HYPE. The cryptocurrency, which is Hyperliquid’s native token, saw its price fall nearly 14% over the past day to $13.85, as of this writing.

The drama surrounding Hyperliquid on Thursday echoed a $4 million loss that the HLP sustained earlier this month. A user on the decentralized exchange made $1.8 million by liquidating themselves, sticking the HLP with another bad bet instead of selling.

When an investor takes on leverage, they are borrowing funds to control a larger position than they could otherwise. That position is often secured by collateral, which can be automatically sold by an exchange to cover losses if a leveraged bet sours beyond a certain point.

Earlier this month, Hyperliquid said that it would reduce the amount of leverage that traders could access for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The project also said it would increase maintenance margin requirements for leveraged bets teetering toward liquidation.

When Hyperliquid’s validators opted to delist JELLYJELLY on Thursday, $3.7 million in JELLYJELLY positions were settled at a price of $0.0095 per token.

Doug Colkitt, founder of the decentralized trading protocol Ambient Finance, said on X that overriding JELLYJELLY’s so-called oracle price left “the attacker with a small loss.”

On Thursday, crypto exchanges Binance and OKX launched perpetual futures contracts for JELLYJELLY, allowing their users to speculate on the meme coin that was launched as part of a marketing campaign for a podcast app months ago.

The price of meme coins, which trade on little more than vibes, will often jump when an exchange decides to list them. Some X users suggested, without providing evidence, that the crypto exchanges were attempting to “bury a competitor” amid the liquidation drama.

When it comes to the centralization of Hyperliquid’s network, experts raised concerns after North Korean-linked wallets started using the platform in December. At the time, the network had just four validators.

Binance and OKX did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Decrypt.

The DeFi Education Fund and leading crypto companies have called out the U.S. Department of Justice for its ""unprecedented and overly expansive” interpretation of criminal code that has been used to define crypto firms as unlawful money transmitters.

In a letter signed today and addressed to leaders of the House and Senate Committees on Banking and Judiciary, and the House Committee on Financial Services, the DeFi Education Fund said that the DOJ’s position, which first appeared in 2023, “threatens the viability of U.S.-based software development in the digital asset industry and other industries.”

The letter was signed by 34 companies, foundations, and associations in the crypto industry, including the exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Crypto.com, as well as VC firms Andreessen Horowitz, Paradigm, and Dragonfly. The list continues with Uniswap Labs, Polygon Labs, and Consensys (one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt), among others.

“The DeFi Education Fund’s number one policy priority is obtaining Congressional clarity on Section 1960,” which has been misused by the DOJ to enact “regulation by criminal indictment,” Amanda Tuminelli, DeFi Education Fund executive director and chief legal officer, told Decrypt.

One of the most timely examples of the “money transmitter” definition being used by the DOJ is the ongoing prosecution of Tornado Cash co-founder Roman Storm. He was arrested on money laundering charges.

In the case, the DOJ has underscored Tornado Cash’s use by state-sponsored hackers as a threat, while crypto advocates like the DEF have rallied around Storm, saying the code he wrote is protected under freedom of speech. But Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the case would proceed because of the statutes under which Storm was charged.

“These laws do not target protected expressive conduct,” Failla said of the laws Storm allegedly violated in launching and maintaining Tornado Cash. “They punish money laundering, [...] the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business, and [...] sanctions evasion.”

DEF wrote in its letter that Section 1960 is one of two pieces of U.S. legal code that defines a “money transmitting business.” It’s designed to be the “enforcement mechanism” that criminalizes operating an unlicensed money transmitter, the letter says. In Section 5330, where the definition of “who” should be licensed as a money transmitting business can be found, the definition is ""substantively identical” to Section 1960, the DEF argues.

“Despite the intentional similarity in definitions of ‘money transmitting business’ in both Section 5330 and Section 1960, and despite FinCEN’s 2019 Guidance, the DOJ has taken the position that the definition of a ‘money transmitting business’ under the [Bank Secrecy Act] is not relevant to determining whether someone is operating an unlicensed ‘money transmitting business’ under Section 1960,” the DEF wrote.

The organization also argued that “in no case has a criminal court’s analysis of Section 1960 supported or endorsed the DOJ’s novel interpretation.”

If left unaddressed, the DeFi Education Fund says that the DOJ’s departure from a “clear, logically sound, and well-established definition of money transmission,” creates a liability for software developers of non-custodial technology in the United States.

Crypto’s relationship with regulators has taken a major step forward under President Donald Trump’s administration, highlighted by the SEC’s growing list of closed investigations and lawsuits, plus progress on a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

But getting clarity from the DOJ on Section 1960 remains an important challenge, according to the DeFi Education Fund.

“We are seeing incredible progress, and as an industry are working towards a goal of ‘durable wins’—ultimately, our priority is to ensure that software developers (for DeFi, crypto, AI, etc.) are protected for the long-term,” a spokesperson for the DeFi Education Fund told Decrypt. “We believe that clarity around Congressional intent regarding Section 1960 is in the best interest of software developers.”

Earlier this year the non-custodial software developer of Pharos sued the DOJ regarding its interpretation Section 1960, alleging the agency criminalizes crypto development via its overly broad interpretation.

Fidelity Digital Assets is actively testing a stablecoin it has developed, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Decrypt.

The crypto-focused arm of Fidelity Investments, a $5 trillion asset manager, does not yet have plans to bring the token to market, the source said.

The Financial Times first reported on the Boston-based firm's stablecoin experiment.

The firm's testing of its own stablecoin comes as it also explores the tokenized U.S. Treasury market. A few days ago, Fidelity filed to roll out a tokenized version of its U.S. dollar money market fund.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to another asset. Many of the tokens are backed one-to-one by U.S. dollar reserves.

Fidelity's stablecoin experiment comes as several firms jockey to roll out dollar-backed tokens ahead of lawmakers' efforts to implement clearer rules for stablecoin issuers in the U.S.

The Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial decentralized finance project revealed Tuesday that it will launch a dollar-pegged stablecoin called USD1, while crypto custodian BitGo launched its USDS stablecoin in January.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee greenlit the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that introduces new regulations for stablecoins. The bill is poised to clinch broader Senate approval.

President Trump also called for “simple, common-sense rules” for stablecoins at a crypto conference in New York last week. He added that the tokens would promote “the dominance of the U.S. dollar.”

Introduced in 2014, stablecoins have become increasingly popular among crypto holders.

The stablecoin market is worth nearly $250 billion, CoinGecko data shows. Tether’s offshore USDT dominates the market, followed by USD-backed tokens such as Circle's USDC, BitGo's USDS and Ethena USDe.

Circle USDC stablecoin market cap has hit a new all-time high, surpassing $60 billion for the first time.

Artemis Analytics data shows USDC now has a 25.4% share of the stablecoin market, compared with 20.7% three months ago.

But the digital dollar, which is issued by Circle, remains streets behind Tether. The total value of USDT currently stands at $144 billion—representing about 63% of this still-nascent sector.

All of this comes against a backdrop of growing demand for stablecoins, not to mention significant regulatory shifts.

New USDC worth about $16.5 billion was minted over the past three months, compared with the $4.7 billion of USDT that entered circulation.

The arrival of Europe's MiCA regulations, which fully came into force on Dec. 31 last year, are a big factor here.

USDC had become the first stablecoin to achieve full compliance with these new standards, with Circle selecting France as its European headquarters.

On the other hand, Tether has been delisted by a flurry of exchanges across the EU because it doesn't have an e-money license on the continent.

Coinbase Europe was among the first to remove USDT from its platform back in December, with Binance following suit earlier this month.

A report recently shared with Decrypt by Circle revealed that USDC circulation also grew by 78% over the course of 2024.

Tether's standing in the stablecoin market could be weakened further as the GENIUS Act winds its way through Congress in the U.S. The bill offers clear provisions addressing everything from reserve requirements to audits—both areas where Tether has faced criticism in the past.

But just this past week, Tether is in talks with a Big Four accounting firm—PwC, EY, Deloitte or KPMG—to get independently audited, according to a report on Friday by Reuters.

Regulators and lawmakers alike have previously raised questions about whether USDT is backed by U.S. dollars, with JPMorgan claiming Tether may need to offload the Bitcoin it holds in reserve to achieve compliance.

That led to a swift rebuke from a Tether spokesperson, who told Decrypt last month that adapting to any new requirements would be ""straightforward.""

The Bank Central Asia (BCA) has responded to claims that its accounts were exploited as part of a cryptocurrency scam targeting investors.

This particular scam used social media to make contact with potential investors and then used BCA accounts to take payment, according to a report in local media outlet Tempo.co.

One victim, a 63-year-old, said that she invested about $20,000 (Rp330 million) from her and her husband's retirement savings.

Hera F. Haryn, BCA’s EVP of Corporate Communication & Social Responsibility, at the bank said, told Tempo: ""BCA consistently backs law enforcement initiatives and remains open to coordinating with relevant authorities.""

She added: ""We encourage customers to remain cautious of various fraudulent tactics and to never disclose their banking information.""

Investigators said the scammers made contact over social media platforms like WhatsApp, offering a cryptocurrency investment group run by ""Professor AS."" Investments were made via the JYPRX platform, where account numbers for BCA and BRI banks were given for the transfers.

To gain trust initially, investigators said the scammers provided a bonus in USDT stablecoin and even allowed for small withdrawals. It then froze the accounts, claiming an investigation was underway before coercing the return of the bonus and purchase of a new coin.

Despite complying, in this case, the victim's bank balance remained inaccessible.

Police expose network

This follows a March 19 announcement from the director of cybercrime in Jakarta warning that an online fraud network masquerading as stock and cryptocurrency investment opportunities had recently been shut down.

It was estimated that approximately 90 victims had suffered a total loss of $90,000 (Rp105 billion).

Earlier that month a further 26 crypto scam sites, tied to $4.6 million in losses, were shut down in California.

This follows the major Bybit theft where over $1.4 billion were taken and are still under investigation.

Haliey Welch, better known to the internet as “Hawk Tuah Girl”, will be the subject of a new documentary produced by Bungalow Media + Entertainment, Deadline reported on March 25.

The Tennessee native shot to viral fame in mid-2024 after a street interview in which she was asked, “What’s one move in bed that makes a man go crazy every time?”, to which she responded, “You gotta give ’em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on that thang!”.

The original video has been viewed on YouTube over 9 million times.

Welch parlayed her viral stardom into several projects, launching a podcast featuring guests including billionaire Mark Cuban and dabbling in entrepreneurial ventures.

Then she launched a memecoin.

In December 2024, Welch released $HAWK, which briefly soared to a market cap of $490 million before crashing by over 93% within minutes.

Bubblemaps reported that 285 wallets had acquired 96% of the token’s supply during its presale and early distribution. Most of these wallets immediately dumped their tokens.

Welch’s team claimed she didn’t sell her share and insisted no influencers received free tokens. Still, investors who lost millions have since filed suit against the token’s creators.

Welch herself is not named in the suit, which targets web3 launchpad overHere and its founder Clinton So, the Tuah the Moon Foundation, and the influencer Alex Larson Schultz, also known as “Doc Hollywood.”

The $HAWK fiasco drew immediate comparisons to other celebrity and influencer rug pulls and sparked calls for legal accountability.

Welch issued a since-deleted statement saying she was taking the matter “extremely seriously” and was cooperating with legal teams representing affected investors.

On March 25, Welch also posted on Instagram for the first time since the debacle, sharing a video poking fun at internet rumors that she was dead, pregnant, or arrested.

Her profile describes her as “an influence for good” and links to the Deadline article about her upcoming documentary.

Ethereum may be entering a period of heightened volatility, according to the latest outlook from decentralized options platform Derive, which sees signs of a breakout despite bearish indicators in the near term.

Nick Forster, founder of Derive, told Decrypt Ethereum’s implied volatility is currently near monthly lows, with 7-day and 30-day tenors sitting at 59% and 45%, respectively.

“Historically, such low levels rarely hold,” he said, adding that April could mark the beginning of a sharp upswing in Ethereum volatility.

Despite the muted volatility, Ethereum’s forward rate—a measure of expected future value—is currently below the U.S. 5% treasury bill rate, signaling weak near-term confidence.

However, Forster said that such conditions have previously preceded price spikes.

""When forward rates are this low, we often see sharp price increases in the following weeks as leveraged positions become more attractive and demand builds,"" he said.

Ethereum’s circulating supply on centralized exchanges has fallen to a nine-year low, which could amplify any price reaction if demand rises.

Derive estimates a 30% probability Ethereum will dip below $1,800 by the end of May, but a 19% chance it will rally above $2,500.

Bitcoin remains more stable by comparison, with Derive predicting a 33% chance the asset falls below $80,000 by May and a 20% chance it breaks $100,000.

Meanwhile, other layer-1 tokens are gaining traction. XRP is seeing renewed interest following the SEC’s decision to drop its lawsuit against Ripple Labs, alongside potential ETF applications under review. Derive projects up to $8 billion in inflows if those funds are approved.

Solana is also seeing increased institutional signals, including a Fidelity-registered fund in Delaware that may evolve into a Solana spot ETF.

Ethereum experienced $86 million in outflows last week, compared to $724 million in Bitcoin inflows.

Short-term sentiment may favour Bitcoin, but the Ethereum Foundation’s roadmap, including Etherealize and the Pectra upgrade, could shift institutional attention back to Ethereum in the second half of 2025, Forster said.",decrypt

BlackRock has launched a new Bitcoin exchange-traded product in Europe through its iShares fund service as issuers push forward on efforts to create crypto-focused products following the success of U.S.-based Bitcoin funds.

The iShares Bitcoin ETP (IB1T) is listed on German, French, and Dutch stock exchanges, according to a prospectus on the iShares website.

“Each ETP security corresponds to a specific amount of Bitcoin,” the prospectus reads.

Decrypt has reached out to BlackRock to learn more.

Coinbase, the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, would custody the digital assets for the investment vehicle, according to the prospectus.

BlackRock’s application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in mid-2023 was considered a pivotal moment in their eventual approval in January 2024, given its status as the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11 trillion in assets under management.

It's iShares Bitcoin Trust has generated nearly $40 billion in net inflows, the most among the 11 bitcoin funds currently trading, according to U.K. asset manager Farside Investors. Spot Bitcoin funds now control nearly $100 billion in assets.

BlackRock’s spot Ethereum fund has received more than $4 billion in assets since it debuted in July 2024. Crypto ETFs have given investors exposure to the asset in a more familiar financial product.

Separately, in an announcement Tuesday, tokenization platform Securitize said that it had launched BlackRock’s $1.7 billion tokenized treasury fund BUIDL on the Solana blockchain.

“Following the one-year anniversary of BUIDL’s launch, BlackRock and Securitize are expanding access with a new share class on the Solana network,” Securitize said in a post on X.

“This milestone marks an important step in the continued institutional adoption of tokenized real-world assets,” it added.

The gaming retailer reported holding $4.8 billion in cash during its fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Company CEO Ryan Cohen weeks ago had teased an interest in purchasing bitcoin for the GME balance sheet. He was joined by Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management — an owner of GME via its ETFs, who urged the same.

Though GameStop on Tuesday reported that a portion of its cash will go into bitcoin and U.S. dollar dominated stablecoins in the future, it did not disclose how much, or the timing of any buys.

The plan kicked off a speculative frenzy on social media: How much bitcoin would Gamestop acquire?

The company’s allocation will likely be significant, according to Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, who said that GameStop wouldn’t be going through the very bureaucratic board approval process if it was only planning on allocating 1-2% of its cash into bitcoin.

“Chairman Ryan Cohen is likely to take a big bet on bitcoin as a balance sheet asset,” Pompliano wrote in a note. “You only put the time and energy to get the change to your investment policy if you are looking to put a material amount of your cash into bitcoin.”

Pomp also pointed out that Cohen currently follows three bitcoin-related accounts on X, which he sees as “behavior of a hardcore bitcoiner.”

According to a poll posted by Michael Saylor — whose Strategy (MSTR) has spent $33 billion acquiring more than 500,000 BTC — on X, his followers believe that GameStop needs to at least hold $3 billion worth of bitcoin in order to “be respected by Bitcoiners.”

Less clear is whether GameStop plans to be as aggressive inn buying bitcoin as Strategy. The company has deployed many creative fundraise mechanisms to fuel its war chest, including debt sales. But Strategy's BTC saga started as a more humble cash reserve of $250 million generated by COVID-era cost savings.

Gamestop's share boost may prove resilient to bitcoin price swings because the company has only said it would buy BTC, but doesn't yet own any, mused Josh Mandell, a former bond trader. He called out the perplexing situation on social media.

""I will not ask anyone to make it make sense,"" he said.

The upgrade on the new Hoodi testnet was closely watched given that two previous tests, on the Holesky and Sepolia test networks, failed to finalize properly.

Following those tests, developers created a new testnet, Hoodi, to give ecosystem players, particularly staking providers, one more testing opportunity before the Pectra upgrade hits Ethereum’s mainnet.

The test involved passing Hoodi a series of code changes meant to make Ethereum more user-friendly for both end-users as well as developers. One of those changes adds smart contract functionality to wallets, allowing wallet software developers to build new convenience-oriented features, like the ability to pay transaction fees in cryptocurrencies other than ether (ETH).

​​Testnets act as copies of a main blockchain, and are used by developers to run through any major code changes in a low stakes environment, giving them a place to patch out any bugs before they reach mainnet.

Hoodi was the last of three testnets to run through a simulation of Pectra. Developers previously agreed that if all went well on Wednesday, Pectra would be monitored for around 30 more days and then, finally, activated on Ethereum's mainnet.

The company's business development unit, Bitso Business, has established Juno, a subsidiary dedicated to issuing and managing digital assets including stablecoins. Bitso Business also recently appointed Ben Reid as head of stablecoins to drive the firm's ambition in the stablecoin market.

The first token Juno issues is a fully-backed Mexican peso stablecoin (MXNB), aiming to facilitate cross-border payments and financial transactions between businesses across the region. The firm deployed the token on Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum.

Stablecoins, now a nearly $230 billion asset class, have been one of the biggest success stories in crypto adoption. With prices pegged to an external asset, predominantly to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, they offer a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional financial rails for payments, remittances, savings and currency conversion. They are especially popular in developing countries with large unbanked populations or fragile local currencies. Meanwhile, regulations around the world are being laid down or advanced to fit stablecoins into the global financial system.

""Global companies face significant monetary challenges when it comes to serving customers in new markets and conducting cross-border payments, including high intermediary costs and inefficient transaction times,"" Bitso's Reid in a statement. ""Stablecoins provide a fast, cost-effective and transparent fiat-pegged alternative and have been instrumental in expanding access to foreign markets and transforming payments worldwide.

""Juno's new MXNB stablecoin will help ""global companies to do business in Latin America in a more efficient way,"" he added.

To support adoption of its stablecoin, Juno has rolled out the Juno Mint Platform, which provides APIs and tools for businesses to issue, redeem and convert MXNB.

Rep. Bryan Steil, the Republican who leads the crypto subcommittee within the House Financial Services Committee, said at a Wednesday event in Washington that the bill would be unveiled before the day is out. The Senate has already recently advanced its own version of the U.S. stablecoin oversight legislation through the Senate Banking Committee.

Both bills would set up guardrails for the issuance of digital tokens that are based on the value of steady assets — almost always the U.S. dollar — and the major historical sticking point was over how the issuer would be regulated by states and federal agencies.

A House stablecoin markup — a session in which a relevant committee debates amendments and decides whether to move a bill to the overall House floor — should happen ""in the very near future,"" Steil said. House lawmakers, including Rep. French Hill, the chairman of the full committee, are working to ""close the gap"" with the Senate, Steil said.

The stablecoin effort in Congress, which cleared the House during the last session but was stymied in the Senate, is the narrower and potentially easier of the two major crypto bills the industry hopes become law this year. The other is legislation that would regulate how the digital assets markets function in the U.S., and how the assets and transactions would be governed. That one is significantly more complicated, but Steil outlined how this Congress is in better shape to get it done.

""We now have a very different political landscape,"" he said. ""We maintain a very pro-crypto House of Representatives,"" he added, with ""really good working relationships with a number of Democrats,"" and a similar situation in the Senate.

He said the market-structure bill should get a House hearing in early April.

The speaker list at the Washington event, hosted by the Digital Chamber, reveals how much more connected to Congress the industry is this year. More than a half dozen U.S. senators were set to appear, and almost a dozen members of the House, including multiple Democrats.

The crypto sector has already seen momentum on Capitol Hill in the early days of the congressional session, with big bipartisan support in an effort in both the House and Senate seeking to erase an Internal Revenue Service rule targeting decentralized finance (DeFi). The Senate Banking Committee also easily advanced a stablecoin bill with supporters from both parties.

The legislation includes amendments that exempt certain blockchain operations from stringent money transmission and securities regulations.

You Can Own BTC in KY!

The law, supported unanimously in both legislative chambers, allows individuals to control their crypto without external interference. It also prevents discriminatory taxation of digital asset transactions, meaning that users are treated equitably compared to traditional payment methods.

The new legislation will legalize the operation of blockchain nodes and staking, a move expected to bolster Kentucky’s digital infrastructure. Under the law, certain blockchain activities will be exempt from money transmission and securities rules.

These amendments are aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on blockchain businesses, making Kentucky a more attractive destination for investment. The new law could effectively position the state as a hub for the digital asset industry.

House Bill 701(HB701) was introduced in the House on February 19, where it quickly gained support. Following a series of committee reviews and readings, the House passed the bill with overwhelming support on February 28 by a vote of 91-0, accompanied by a Committee Substitute.

The Senate took up the measure shortly thereafter, ultimately passing it on March 13, with an equally decisive 37-0 vote.

After receiving final enrollment and signatures from both the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate on March 14, the bill was delivered to Governor Beshear for approval. His signature on March 24 officially enshrined the Bitcoin Rights bill into state law.

In addition to HB701, Kentucky lawmakers also introduced House Bill 376, titled “Inflation Protection Act of 2025,” in February.

The bill’s primary goals are to modernize state financial practices by incorporating digital assets and bullion into investment and payment systems while prohibiting the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

Under the proposed legislation, the State Investment Commission would be authorized to invest in digital assets and bullion.

However, only digital assets with a market capitalization exceeding $750 billion, averaged over the previous calendar year, are authorized for investment. Currently, Bitcoin is the only digital asset that meets this criterion.

According to CoinGecko data, Bitcoin’s market cap currently stands at $1.7 trillion, while Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, has a market cap of around $249 billion.

The bill would also allow state retirement funds and deferred compensation fund participants to invest in exchange-traded products linked to digital assets.

The bill is currently pending in the House Banking and Insurance Committee.

Bitcoin Surges Past $87,000 as States Explore Reserve Strategies

A growing number of U.S. states are examining the implementation of strategic Bitcoin reserves. As of March, 28 U.S. states have introduced legislation to establish state-level strategic Bitcoin reserves.

The concept is also gaining traction at the federal level. The Trump administration is exploring budget-neutral strategies to acquire additional Bitcoin without imposing costs on taxpayers, which is part of the President’s executive order issued on March 6.

The Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is currently capitalized with Bitcoin seized through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings, currently estimated at around 200,000 BTC. The U.S. government will not sell these Bitcoin units, instead holding them as a long-term store of value.

Although legislative developments have been positive, Bitcoin’s price has shown little reaction to these narratives. Macroeconomic factors are proving more influential.

Bitcoin has stayed above $87,000 following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s speech post-FOMC meeting last week, where he, despite being cautious, did not show a hawkish stance.

According to Markus Thielen of 10x Research, political and economic conditions are laying the groundwork for potential easing, which might lead Bitcoin to recover toward $90,000.

Bitcoin is currently trading at around $87,200, up almost 5% in the last 7 days. The digital asset shows little changes over the past 24 hours.",blockonomi

Ben ‘BitBoy’ Armstrong was arrested in Florida on March 25, 2025 as a fugitive from justice

Armstrong claimed on social media that arrest warrants were due to emails he sent to Judge Kimberly Childs while representing himself

This is Armstrong’s second arrest, following a September 2023 incident outside a business associate’s home

Armstrong was previously named in a class-action lawsuit regarding promotion of Binance that settled for $340,000

He is currently being held without bail according to jail records

Ben Armstrong, the cryptocurrency influencer known online as “BitBoy,” has been arrested in Florida. The Volusia County Division of Corrections took him into custody on March 25 at 7:18 pm local time.

Records show Armstrong is listed as a fugitive from justice. He is currently being held without bail according to jail records.

This arrest comes shortly after Armstrong himself announced there were warrants for his arrest. On March 21, Armstrong posted on social media platform X that the warrants stemmed from emails he sent to Cobb County, Georgia Superior Court Judge Kimberly Childs.

Armstrong claimed he sent these emails while acting as his own attorney. He also stated that Judge Childs deleted her social media accounts because of these communications.

I can now confirm that the warrants for my arrest are due to me sending emails (as my own attorney by the way) to the DISHONORABLE Kimberly Childs of @cobbcountygovt who has NOW DELETED her Twitter lmao. Public officials hiding corruption one day at a time. — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) March 21, 2025

Some footage circulating on social media appears to show Armstrong being taken into custody following a dispute at a Popeyes restaurant. However, some members of the crypto community have questioned whether the person in the footage is actually Armstrong.

The exact details surrounding the arrest have not been officially confirmed. As of now, information about Armstrong’s legal representation is not available.

Legal Troubles Mount for Crypto Personality

This is not Armstrong’s first brush with the law. He was previously arrested in September 2023 in Gwinnett County, Georgia.

That incident occurred while Armstrong was livestreaming outside the house of a former business associate. The dispute reportedly involved a Lamborghini that Armstrong claimed belonged to him.

During that arrest, authorities charged Armstrong with “loitering/prowling” and “simple assault.” Police also reported finding a firearm and illegal drugs in his car at the time.

Armstrong has faced other legal challenges in recent years. In March 2023, he was named in a class-action lawsuit that claimed he promoted Binance.

The lawsuit alleged that Binance had sold unregistered securities. NBA star Jimmy Butler was also named as a co-defendant in the case.

This legal matter was settled in August 2024. Armstrong and Butler agreed to pay a combined sum of $340,000, though they made no admission of wrongdoing.

Outside of his legal troubles, Armstrong has remained active in the cryptocurrency community. In early 2024, he participated in a fight night hosted by combat sports company Karate Combat.

Armstrong fought against a pseudonymous memecoin developer known as “More Light” at the February 24 event in Mexico. He won the match by unanimous decision after three two-minute rounds.

Following the fight, “More Light” stated there was no bad blood between them in real life. He described Armstrong as a “good guy” in person despite their public rivalry.

Armstrong’s relationship with the BitBoy Crypto brand has been complicated in recent times. Hit Network, the parent company controlling the BitBoy Crypto brand, cut ties with Armstrong in August 2023.

The company cited alleged substance abuse and unprofessional behavior toward employees as reasons for the separation. Armstrong denied these allegations.

Instead, he claimed the move represented an attempted “coup” against him. The details of this business dispute have not been fully resolved publicly.

As this situation continues to develop, more information about Armstrong’s legal status may become available. Currently, he remains in custody in Volusia County, Florida.",blockonomi

Crusoe Energy is selling its Bitcoin mining business to NYDIG to focus on AI infrastructure

The deal includes 425 modular data centers across seven US states and Argentina, with 135 Crusoe employees joining NYDIG

Crusoe pioneered technology that captures waste gas from oil fields to power Bitcoin mining operations, preventing approximately 2.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions

Crusoe’s AI business has grown to become the majority of its revenue

Crusoe is expanding its AI infrastructure with a data center campus in Abilene, Texas, planned to reach 1.2 gigawatts capacity by mid-2026

Crusoe Energy announced on March 25 that it plans to sell its Bitcoin mining operation to New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG). The transaction will allow Crusoe to focus fully on building artificial intelligence infrastructure.

The deal includes Crusoe’s Digital Flare Mitigation business, which has been operating since 2018. This innovative technology captures waste gas from oil fields that would normally be burned off and converts it into electricity.

NYDIG will acquire 425 modular data centers spread across seven US states and Argentina. These facilities currently account for approximately 1% of global Bitcoin mining capacity.

About 135 Crusoe employees will join NYDIG as part of the transaction. No jobs will be eliminated as a result of the deal, according to the announcement.

Crusoe will retain a major equity position in the combined business. The company will become the second-largest equity holder after Stone Ridge, NYDIG’s parent company.

Crusoe was founded in 2018 with a mission to solve environmental problems in the energy sector. The company pioneered technology that captures gas flaring from oil production and converts it into usable electricity.

This captured energy has powered Bitcoin mining operations for years. The company’s approach has prevented approximately 2.7 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions since its founding.

Crusoe’s technology has saved nearly 22 billion cubic feet of natural gas from being flared. This is equivalent to taking about 630,000 cars off the road for a year.

The AI Pivot

“The AI business — it’s become the majority of our revenue,” said Cully Cavness, co-founder and chief operating officer of Crusoe, in an interview with CNBC. The shift toward AI reflects changing market opportunities.

Crusoe has been developing its AI infrastructure from the beginning. “We’d actually been building this AI business since the start of the company,” Chase Lochmiller, Crusoe CEO and co-founder, told CNBC.

The company is now focusing on large-scale AI data center development. In Abilene, Texas, Crusoe is building a hyperscale data center campus with 206 megawatts of initial capacity.

This Texas facility is expected to scale to 1.2 gigawatts by mid-2026. Crusoe claims this project could set speed records for greenfield data center development.

The company is also expanding its cloud platform to offer on-demand access to high-performance GPUs. Crusoe is already running AI workloads in Iceland, powered entirely by geothermal and hydropower.

“We see a huge opportunity in front of us, and we have a big advantage and a big head start with what we’ve already announced — and more coming soon,” Cavness said in his CNBC interview.

Crusoe closed a $600 million Series D funding round in December at a $2.8 billion valuation. This capital will support the company’s AI infrastructure expansion plans.

NYDIG, valued at approximately $7 billion, plans to continue operating and investing in the Bitcoin mining business it’s acquiring. The company sees strategic value in supporting Bitcoin’s proof-of-work security.

“It is critically important to keep the Bitcoin network secure, and at the lowest possible cost,” said Ross Stevens, NYDIG founder and executive chairman. He added that fiat currencies are “collapsing against Bitcoin around the world.”

The transaction requires regulatory approvals and other customary consents before closing. Both companies expect the deal to strengthen their respective market positions.

“Crusoe is proud to have been a pioneer in repurposing otherwise wasted energy resources such as gas flaring to power the bitcoin network,” said Lochmiller. “Our innovative approach to energy utilized for mining is uniquely complementary to NYDIG’s bitcoin custody, institutional trading and mining businesses.”

Tejas Shah, CEO of NYDIG, expressed enthusiasm about the acquisition. “Crusoe has built an extraordinary bitcoin mining business by demonstrating remarkable innovation—bringing together the industry’s top talent to solve complex challenges and unlock untapped energy sources.”

This deal represents a major strategic shift in the crypto and computing industry. As companies like Crusoe pivot from cryptocurrency mining to AI infrastructure, they follow a path similar to CoreWeave.

CoreWeave also started in crypto before shifting to AI. It is now preparing for a stock market debut that could value the company at well over $25 billion.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,Dogecoin (DOGE) Price: 25% Gain Follows Major Whale Buying Activity,https://blockonomi.com/dogecoin-doge-price-25-gain-follows-major-whale-buying-activity/,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 10:30:21 GMT","TLDR

Dogecoin whales accumulated 200 million coins in just two weeks

DOGE price increased nearly 25% in two weeks, rising from $0.15 to $0.19

Analysts predict significant growth potential in DOGE’s third cycle, with some forecasting up to 1,160% price increase

Futures Open Interest (OI) soared 6%, reaching $1.94 billion, with derivatives volume rising 16% to $4.09 billion

Technical indicators suggest continued bullish momentum with key resistance at $0.21

Dogecoin has seen a wave of buying activity in recent weeks as whale investors accumulated 200 million coins over just 14 days. This buying spree has helped push DOGE price up nearly 25% from $0.15 to $0.19 since March 11.

The meme cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.19, up about 5% in the last 24 hours. This price movement comes amid rising market interest and analyst predictions of major gains ahead.

Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez revealed the whale accumulation data in a recent post on X. These large purchases have reinforced positive market sentiment despite the broader crypto market experiencing price volatility.

Whales have accumulated over 200 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the past two weeks, showing strong confidence despite recent volatility. pic.twitter.com/hWtzq7BtYP — Ali (@ali_charts) March 25, 2025

Whale activity often signals growing market interest in a cryptocurrency. When large holders buy in bulk, it typically creates buying pressure that can drive prices higher due to increased demand.

The recent price action has aligned with these whale movements. DOGE bottomed at $0.1825 and peaked at $0.1955 in the past day, showing strong momentum.

Weekly performance has been even more impressive with 14% gains. This aligns with the massive buying that has taken place over recent days.

Market Analysis

Market analysts are increasingly bullish on Dogecoin’s prospects. One analyst known as ‘Trader Tardigrade’ stated that DOGE price is completing the final stage of ‘cycle 3,’ which based on historical patterns could lead to a major upswing.

Some experts are making bold predictions about DOGE’s third cycle potential. Analysis of previous price patterns suggests the possibility of up to 1,160% growth from current levels, which could take the price above $2.28 or even higher.

Derivatives markets also show growing enthusiasm for Dogecoin. Futures Open Interest has increased 6% to reach $1.94 billion, while derivatives trading volume rose 16% to $4.09 billion according to Coinglass data.

These metrics indicate rising trader interest in DOGE’s future price movement. Higher open interest and volume typically suggest more market participants are placing bets on the asset’s direction.

Technical indicators support the bullish case. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at 0.19, indicating positive money flow into Dogecoin. Meanwhile, the MACD has crossed above its signal line, often considered a buy signal.

Dogecoin’s market capitalization has now crossed $28.67 billion with a trading volume of $1.54 billion. The ratio of market cap to trading volume is 5.37%, suggesting active trading and good liquidity.

DOGE currently faces resistance near $0.21, which represents a key level for continued upward momentum. Breaking through this barrier could open the path to $0.22 and potentially $0.25 in coming months.

If bearish pressure emerges, support levels exist at $0.17 and $0.15. These would likely be tested if market sentiment reverses.

Beyond speculation, Dogecoin has evolved from its meme origins to find real-world applications. Its low transaction fees and fast block times have made it useful for online purchases and tipping.

The cryptocurrency continues to gain acceptance among merchants, increasing its utility beyond investment purposes. This growing use case helps support its long-term value proposition.

Dogecoin’s strong community and ongoing development efforts contribute to its staying power in the crypto market. Unlike many speculative assets that fade away, DOGE has continued to adapt and find new applications.

The broader crypto market environment also supports Dogecoin’s rise. As Bitcoin and Ethereum gain ground, DOGE often follows the overall market sentiment.

For traders watching DOGE, the next psychological resistance level is near $0.30. Reaching this target would represent a 60% increase from current prices.",blockonomi

Ethereum (ETH) price currently at $2,062.2 after a -0.35% move on March 26

Technical analysts predict potential five-digit ETH targets, with estimates ranging from $10,000 to $20,000

ETH shows a pattern of higher highs and higher lows, with key resistance levels at $2,100 and $2,166

Spot Ethereum ETF outflows have been reducing since February, potentially turning to inflows soon

Q1 2024 has been challenging for ETH with a 43% decline, contrasting with Bitcoin’s 23% gain

Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,062.20 as of March 26, showing a slight decline of 0.35% over the past 24 hours. Despite this small drop, multiple technical analysts are pointing to patterns suggesting that the second-largest cryptocurrency could be setting up for a major rally in the coming months.

The recent price action has been marked by consolidation, largely influenced by Bitcoin’s own sideways movement. ETH reached a daily high of $2,083.30 before settling at its current level.

Several crypto analysts have identified fractal patterns that hint at a potential five-digit price target for Ethereum. One analysis notes a “1, 2, 3 bounce pattern” similar to what occurred in 2017, 2018, and 2020, which previously led to a rally from $100 to $4,900.

If this pattern repeats, Ethereum could reach between $10,000 and $11,000. Another analyst has identified a declining broadening wedge pattern that suggests a possible target around $20,000.

The daily chart for ETH shows successive higher highs and higher lows, indicating buyers are trying to reverse the bearish trend. Key resistance levels at $2,100 and $2,166 need to be flipped into support to confirm a bullish trend.

If successful, ETH could attempt rallies of 20%, 28%, and 40% to reach resistance levels at $2,600, $2,770, and $3,000. As long as Ethereum forms a higher low above $1,934, the bullish trend remains intact.

Supporting these targets are CME gaps at $2,623, $2,888, $3,237, and $3,930. With continued buying pressure and Bitcoin’s macro bullish outlook, ETH could potentially reach $4,000 in April.

However, if Ethereum breaks below $2,134, it would suggest that selling pressure is dominant. In this case, ETH might revisit the $1,756 support level, with a breakdown potentially leading to a drop to $1,500.

Ethereum has formed a complex Inverse Head and Shoulder (iH&S) pattern on the weekly timeframe. This well-known bullish reversal structure often signals the end of a downtrend and the beginning of a new uptrend.

Market Analysis

According to analyst Gert van Lagen, this pattern suggests a possible price target of $18,000 for ETH. The left shoulder of this pattern formed from 2021 to 2022, with the head developing from 2022 to 2023 during the cycle low.

$ETH [1W] bounces off the ~$1800-$2000 support range while having formed a complex iH&S structure, targeting ~$18k. This support level acted as resistance during the 'head' phase. Now price successfully retested it as support. Now the Left and Right shoulders are well-aligned. pic.twitter.com/909aRoeajD — Gert van Lagen (@GertvanLagen) March 24, 2025

The right shoulder formed in 2024, creating a higher low that aligns with the left shoulder. The key level to watch is the neckline of this pattern at approximately $3,978, which acts as the primary resistance area.

If ETH can break above this resistance with strong volume, it could validate the pattern and open the door for the rally toward $18,000. A rejection at this level might lead to consolidation or a pullback to $1,888 before another attempt.

Despite these promising technical indicators, Ethereum has had a challenging start to 2024. It has recorded its second-worst performance in the first quarter of its history, with a 43% year-to-date decline.

This stands in stark contrast to Bitcoin’s 23% gain and XRP’s 279% surge during the same period. Market expert Lark Davis highlighted that ETH’s 38% drop in Q1 is approaching its worst quarterly performance of 46% recorded in Q1 2018.

$ETH experienced one of its worst Q1s in its entire history this year. Will we witness an explosive Q2 for Ethereum? pic.twitter.com/Rc8waqA1TY — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark) March 25, 2025

Historically, since 2016, ETH has averaged a 66% surge during the second quarter. If this trend continues, Ethereum could climb to $3,200 in the coming months, levels not seen since early February of this year.

Approximately $701 million worth of short positions will face liquidation if Ethereum’s price hits $2,114, according to CoinGlass data. These forced closings would require investors to buy back their positions, adding buying pressure to ETH’s outlook.

Spot Ethereum ETF outflows have been decreasing since February 26 and reached zero on Monday. If this trend continues, ETH ETFs might begin to see inflows, further boosting the positive outlook for the cryptocurrency.

For a sustainable rebound in the short term, Ethereum must overcome key resistance levels. While it has reclaimed its realized price of $2,040, the next challenge lies at the $2,300 mark, where strong resistance has been observed.",blockonomi

Bitcoin has climbed nearly 5% in the past week, reclaiming key support levels.

BTC needs weekly closes above $88,400 and $93,500 to end its downside deviation period.

Analysts suggest a reclaim of the $90,000 level could propel BTC to jump between 8-14%.

GameStop has approved adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves.

President Trump’s Global Reciprocal Tariffs decision on April 2 could impact Bitcoin’s price movement.

Bitcoin has shown positive momentum over the past week, climbing nearly 5% and reclaiming key support levels. The flagship cryptocurrency has pushed toward the $88,000 mark, with analysts suggesting a potential reclaim of its previous price range is within reach.

After being rejected from the $84,000-$85,000 zone several times in the past two weeks, Bitcoin finally reclaimed this range over the weekend. BTC surged 4.7% from last week’s levels, closing above the $86,000 mark.

During the start-of-week pump, Bitcoin eyed the $89,000 resistance level. It hit a biweekly high of $88,765 but failed to retest the next crucial zone as bullish momentum slowed.

The cryptocurrency has held its current range well. It has been hovering between the $86,000-$88,000 support zone for the past 24 hours.

Analyst Alex Clary believes Bitcoin’s momentum “looks awesome” for a break above the $88,000-$90,000 support zone. His optimism stems from Bitcoin showing a Relative Strength Index (RSI) bullish divergence, a V-shaped recovery, and a breakout above its downtrend resistance.

A breakout and reclaim of the crucial $90,000 resistance level could be very positive. It might propel BTC to jump between 8 to 14% from current prices to the $95,000-$100,000 levels lost in February.

Trader Daan Crypto Trades noted that Bitcoin “has not moved much in the past few weeks relative to SPX.” According to him, BTC’s price has been correlated to the S&P 500 (SPX) and “has mostly been moving hand in hand with each other.”

Technical Analysis

Analyst Rekt Capital warns that Bitcoin needs weekly closes above $88,400 and $93,500 to end its downside deviation period. Over the past five weeks, BTC has been consolidating between two major bull market Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), the 21-week and 50-week EMAs.

Its price action has recently gotten closer to the 21-week EMA, around $88,400, ready “for a major trend decision.” According to the analyst, Bitcoin needs a weekly close above this level and a retest into support to target its Macro Range.

Meanwhile, blockchain analytics firm Santiment warns of excessive bullish sentiment on social media. This type of sentiment often signals a market correction, as history suggests that when the majority turns overly bullish, a pullback often follows.

In corporate news, GameStop’s board approved the company’s investment policy to include Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This strategic move allows GameStop to allocate a portion of its cash holdings or future financing proceeds into Bitcoin.

GameStop’s stock, the so-called original “meme stock,” experienced a surge after the announcement. It rose more than 8% in after-hours trading.

A major shift is happening in the U.S., with governments and institutions increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s value. The Oklahoma House recently passed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill, joining Texas, Arizona, and Utah in embracing Bitcoin as a state treasury asset.

This move reinforces Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a store of value. It signals growing confidence in its long-term stability and could boost its institutional adoption if more states follow suit.

Right now, all eyes are on President Trump’s Global Reciprocal Tariffs set to take effect on April 2. This decision could create uncertainty in financial markets and impact Bitcoin’s price movement.

Initially, broad levies were anticipated. However, recent reports suggest a more selective approach, focusing on countries with significant trade imbalances with the U.S.

The cryptocurrency market has shown sensitivity to geopolitical developments. Bitcoin’s price movements have been closely linked to news on trade policies throughout this period.

If Trump’s tariffs turn out to be less restrictive than initially feared, Bitcoin could see increased demand. This might further push its price higher toward the key $90,000 level and beyond.",blockonomi

Technical indicators suggest the possibility of a bullish reversal from oversold conditions

Smart Money has shown interest with a net flow of $813K in recent trading

PEPE is attempting to break through a resistance zone at $0.00000780 with positive technical signals

The past month has been rocky for PEPE coin. The popular meme cryptocurrency has seen its value drop by half.

Its market cap fell from $8.7 billion to $4 billion. When measured from its all-time high of $11.12 billion, the decline is nearly 60%.

This downturn has made many investors cautious. Few are willing to buy at current prices. But some see this as a chance to dollar-cost average their holdings.

One positive sign is the behavior of large investors, often called “whales.” Reports show up to $20 million worth of PEPE has been moved from exchanges to cold storage.

This suggests these big players have faith in PEPE’s future. They’re holding for the long term rather than selling during the dip.

As of the latest data, PEPE is trading at around $0.00000789. Its 24-hour trading volume remains high at $905 million.

The price has fallen 8% over the past week. The 30-day decline stands at 42%.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis shows some hope for recovery. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates PEPE may be oversold. This often precedes a price bounce.

Other technical signs are also promising. Multiple confirmations of “Breaks of Structure” (BOS) and “Changes of Character” (CHoCH) suggest PEPE is reclaiming key support levels.

The coin is now attempting to break through a resistance zone at $0.00000780. If successful, it could target $0.00000850 in the medium term.

Open interest in PEPE has increased by 8.47% in 24 hours. This shows growing optimism among traders.

The funding rate has turned positive in the last 48 hours. This reflects a renewed appetite for risk in the market.

The long/short ratio stands at 1.41. This means buyers currently outnumber sellers, creating upward pressure on the price.

“Smart Money” traders have shown interest in PEPE. Data shows $1.14 million in buy volume against $323,000 in sell volume, creating a net flow of $813,000.

These sophisticated investors bought at an average price of $0.0000071. With current prices higher, they’re already seeing profits.

If PEPE breaks above $0.00000840, it could trigger further rallies. Targets include $0.00000900 and possibly $0.00000950.

Some analysts believe PEPE could even return to its December highs. This would represent a potential gain of 285%.

However, risks remain. If PEPE falls below $0.00000740, it could trigger a bearish breakdown. This might push prices down to $0.00000680 or lower.

The broader crypto market has also been volatile. This affects all cryptocurrencies, including PEPE.

Despite these challenges, PEPE’s community continues to grow. The token has surpassed 400,000 holders.

Social media activity remains strong. February saw consistent efforts to maintain community engagement through memes and discussions.

High-profile figures like Elon Musk have indirectly influenced sentiment around frog-themed tokens. This adds speculative momentum to PEPE’s potential comeback.

For now, PEPE remains in a critical position. It’s battling key resistance levels while showing signs of a possible recovery.

Long-term investors are watching macroeconomic factors that could influence the entire crypto sector. These include geopolitical tensions and traditional market uncertainty.

If the broader crypto market regains bullish momentum, PEPE could benefit. History shows that meme coins can recover quickly when market sentiment turns positive.",blockonomi

FARTCOIN price surged 100% in the past week, reaching $0.58 but showing overbought indicators

Despite being overbought, MACD and EMA indicators suggest bullish momentum may continue

A whale recently dumped 3.5 million FARTCOIN tokens worth $1.87 million, causing a 6.7% price drop

The token is forming a rounded bottom pattern which often signals a shift in market sentiment

Price targets range from a bearish $0.15 to a bullish $1.13 depending on whether profit-taking increases

Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), the third-largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem, has experienced dramatic price movement over the past week, rallying 100% before facing a recent pullback. This price action comes amid mixed signals from technical indicators and whale activity.

The memecoin reached a peak of $0.58 recently, making it the highest gainer among the top 300 cryptocurrencies. This impressive surge pushed its market cap to approximately $510 million.

Despite this strong performance, FARTCOIN has entered overbought territory. The Money Flow Index (MFI) currently reads 83.08, well above the 80 threshold that indicates an overbought condition.

This overbought status has contributed to a mild 2.67% decrease in price within 24 hours. The token is currently trading around $0.54, suggesting a short-term correction may be underway.

However, momentum indicators tell a different story. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows that bullish momentum remains strong, with the 12 EMA holding above the 26 EMA.

Additionally, FARTCOIN’s price has risen above both the 20 EMA and 50 EMA on daily charts. This positioning typically signals a bullish trend as long as the price maintains these levels.

If the current momentum continues, FARTCOIN could retest the 0.786 Fibonacci level at $0.70. A breakthrough at this resistance could push the price toward $1.13, near the 0.618 Fibonacci level.

Technical Analysis

Chart analysis reveals FARTCOIN is forming a rounded bottom pattern, characterized by a gradual, U-shaped curve. This pattern often indicates a shift in market sentiment as selling pressure eases.

The token bottomed at $0.2015 this month before staging a recovery to current levels. It’s now trading at its highest point since February, hovering around the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.

Recent whale activity has added pressure to FARTCOIN’s price. Data shared by Lookonchain shows that a whale dumped 3.5 million FARTCOIN tokens for $1.87 million at an average price of $0.53.

This massive sell-off has contributed to today’s 6.7% price decline. The whale’s actions suggest some large holders may be taking profits after the recent rally.

Several bearish indicators have emerged alongside this whale activity. FARTCOIN is now moving within a descending triangle pattern, which often signals continuation of a downward trend.

Market sentiment metrics have also turned negative, with weighted sentiment falling to -0.41169. This indicates a bearish outlook among investors and traders.

Open interest in FARTCOIN futures has dropped 10.35% over the past 24 hours, showing a decline in trading activity and community interest. Traders appear cautious about opening new positions amid current market volatility.

In a bearish scenario, if profit-taking intensifies, FARTCOIN could drop toward the $0.15 level. This would represent a major correction from recent highs.

The current price movement is happening within a broader context of recovery in the Solana meme coin ecosystem. Other tokens like Bonk, Dogwifhat, and Popcat have also seen gains of 20-35% in the past week.

Overall, FARTCOIN stands at a critical juncture. Technical indicators suggest continued bullish momentum, but whale selling and negative sentiment metrics point to possible downside risk.

For traders and investors, the key levels to watch are $0.70 on the upside and the moving averages on the downside. A break above $0.70 could confirm the bullish case, while dropping below the EMAs would validate bearish concerns.",blockonomi

Bitcoin integration through Babylon Labs and Lombard could bring significant new capital

Phantom Wallet’s 7 million monthly active users now have access to SUI

Technical analysis suggests a potential price target of $7.00 (221% increase) from current levels

The Sui network has been making steady progress in early 2025, holding strong support levels despite January market volatility. SUI price is currently maintaining position above the crucial $2.26 support line while showing promising technical patterns that could lead to significant price appreciation.

SUI has demonstrated remarkable resilience since its 2022 low point. The cryptocurrency has gained 850% from its August 2022 bottom, positioning it as one of the leading Layer 1 alternatives in the market.

The current price action shows SUI trading at approximately $2.27, with buyers consistently entering at the $2.24-$2.26 zone. This price level corresponds to the lower boundary of an ascending channel that has directed SUI’s movement in recent days.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis reveals a falling wedge pattern on the 3-day chart. This pattern has previously signaled major trend reversals for SUI. Similar breakouts in mid-2023 and late 2023 led to substantial rallies.

The wedge formation suggests decreasing selling pressure and tightening price movement. These conditions often precede strong upward breakouts once validated by increased trading volume.

On-chain metrics support the bullish technical setup. SUI’s transfer volume has reached an impressive $73.85 billion, surpassing TON’s $49.46 billion. This high volume of stablecoin transactions reflects active economic participation within the blockchain.

The network ranks among the top three chains for capital inflows in recent 24-hour periods. This places SUI behind only Base and OP Mainnet according to Artemis data. The positive ratio between inflows and outflows indicates growing trust and liquidity.

Several key catalysts could drive SUI’s growth in the coming months. The first is DeFi innovation through Steam’s Automated Market Maker (AMM). Unlike traditional AMMs that leave significant liquidity idle, Steam creates a capital-efficient solution that puts all liquidity to work through SUI’s lending protocols.

This system allows liquidity providers to earn both trading fees and lending yields. The dual revenue stream could attract substantial new capital into the ecosystem.

Bitcoin integration represents another major growth driver. The collaboration between Babylon Labs and Lombard enables Bitcoin holders to stake their assets and receive liquid staking tokens. These tokens can then be used across SUI’s DeFi protocols.

The integration opens SUI to the massive Bitcoin community. It provides Bitcoin holders with new utility for their assets without requiring them to sell.

Phantom Wallet integration brings SUI to a much wider audience. With 7 million monthly active users and 32 million total downloads, Phantom’s support opens the platform to a vast new user base.

Phantom’s reputation for user-friendly design could help SUI replicate Solana’s successful retail adoption path. Easy access is often a key factor in driving mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.

The Walrus decentralized storage protocol expands SUI’s utility beyond traditional blockchain applications. This blockchain-agnostic solution enables large-scale data storage for AI training and content hosting.

Walrus also allows developers to build fully decentralized websites. This innovation could attract enterprise users and broaden SUI’s appeal beyond its current user base.

Recent technical upgrades further strengthen SUI’s foundation. The Mystic V2 update and SIP-45’s dynamic gas pricing improve the network’s efficiency and scalability.

While resistance remains at the $5 level and the current all-time high of $5.36, the combination of technical strength and fundamental growth points to potential targets of $7 in the near term. Some analysts project even higher prices of $35 by the end of 2025, assuming favorable market conditions.",blockonomi

Solana (SOL) has broken key resistance levels with price hovering around $142, rising 7% this week

BlackRock’s BUIDL fund launched on Solana platform while Fidelity filed for a spot Solana ETF

Network activity has increased with active wallets rising from 1M to 3M between March 20-23

Total Value Locked (TVL) in Solana stands at $6.85 billion, showing renewed user interest

$150 remains a crucial resistance level for SOL to potentially reach $170

Solana (SOL) is currently trading at around $142, having recovered approximately 7% so far this week. The cryptocurrency has gained strong market attention after breaking a key resistance level, which has fueled discussions about its future trajectory.

The recent price movement comes as Solana announced on Tuesday that BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), a tokenized money market fund with assets exceeding $1.7 billion, has launched on its platform. This marks a major institutional adoption milestone for the network.

Securitize, a blockchain-based tokenization company that partners with top-tier asset managers including BlackRock, KKR, and Hamilton Lane, highlighted Solana’s advantages. “Solana’s high throughput, low costs, and scalability make it an ideal blockchain to support institutional-grade RWAs,” the company stated on social media.

During the same period, Fidelity Investments filed for a Solana spot ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing was submitted through Cboe Global Markets, which uploaded a 19b-4 filing to list the proposed ETF.

The filing comes shortly after Fidelity registered a Delaware Trust entity for its Solana fund. However, Fidelity has yet to submit an S-1 filing, which is necessary for companies seeking to issue new security and be listed on a public stock exchange.

Technical Analysis

Crypto analyst Crypto Rand noted that Solana has formed an upward reversal pattern by breaking the downward trend line. He revealed that similar buying pressure exists at lower levels due to a sharp rebound from the $120-$130 support zone.

If the breakout is sustained, there’s a possibility of testing the next important resistance level of $160. However, failure to maintain a level above $137 could pull the price back toward support levels.

Another analyst, WizCat, pointed out that SOL had been trading in a tight range and suggested that such movement indicates smart money entering the market during price stagnation. WizCat also highlighted increased network activity as a positive sign.

Solana’s blockchain recently experienced a surge in usage, with active wallets increasing from 1 million to 3 million between March 20 and March 23. This rise in network activity suggests growing interest in the Solana ecosystem.

$SOL has been consolidating in an ultra-tight range for weeks. ⏳ In a bull market, this is usually when smart money starts loading up💰 Now that $SOL has broken above $137, this could be the spark for the next big move! 🔥 pic.twitter.com/t8LEgmbJc5 — WizCat (@cryptoWizCat) March 24, 2025

This rising interest is also reflected in Solana’s total value locked (TVL), which was at $6.72 billion on March 10, rose to $7.09 billion on March 20 before settling at $6.85 billion on March 24, according to data from DefiLlama.

The integration of Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, has also been viewed as a positive development for Solana. Recently, Polymarket announced that users can now deposit funds using SOL, expanding the token’s functionality.

After this announcement, Solana’s price increased by nearly 7% and touched $140 before leveling off. By enabling SOL transactions, Polymarket can attract new users to its platform while enhancing activity within the Solana ecosystem.

Whale accumulation has also been observed, with the number of large holders growing to at least 5,031 from 5,008 in the past week. However, this remains below the level observed earlier in March.

For Solana to reach higher price targets like $170, it must first break through the $150 resistance level. Technical analysis shows strong bullish momentum but with clear resistance at key levels.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen below 50 recently, indicating weakening momentum. Meanwhile, the MACD indicates bearish divergence, suggesting the potential for short-term consolidation before any possible price rally.

If Solana manages to break above $150, it could potentially reach higher levels such as $162 and eventually $170. This would likely be driven by continued network adoption, favorable market sentiment, and increasing institutional demand.

However, if Solana fails to break the $150 resistance, the price may return to support levels of $135 or below. Broader market corrections, macroeconomic trends, or changes in investor sentiment could also affect Solana’s price action in the short term.",blockonomi

Berachain (BERA) has surged 37% in the past 7 days, trading around $8.04

The launch of Proof of Liquidity (PoL) system has driven recent price gains

BERA has surpassed Avalanche and Arbitrum in Total Value Locked (TVL)

Technical analysis suggests potential breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern

If breakout occurs, BERA could reach a new all-time high of $12.37

Berachain’s BERA token has experienced a remarkable price surge of 37% over the past seven days, reaching approximately $8.04 at press time. This price movement has catapulted the cryptocurrency into the top 100 by market capitalization, with a current valuation of $864 million.

The recent price jump coincides with the launch of Berachain’s Proof of Liquidity (PoL) system. This innovative mechanism has generated excitement within the crypto community and contributed to BERA’s upward momentum despite the broader market experiencing downward pressure.

Berachain’s mainnet initially launched in February 2025 with a $1.17 billion airdrop to early participants. This initial phase was limited to BEX, the native decentralized exchange, but the ecosystem has expanded rapidly.

The newly implemented PoL system differs from traditional Proof of Stake (PoS) models. Instead of users staking directly with validators, PoL encourages participation in DeFi liquidity pools to earn BGT, the governance token of the Berachain ecosystem.

Validators stake BERA tokens to secure the network and propose blocks. This activity earns them BGT, which flows into reward vaults and can be swapped for BERA at a 1:1 ratio, though this conversion is irreversible.

The PoL launch has introduced 37 whitelisted reward vaults. These vaults initially focus on DEX liquidity pools such as those on BEX, Kodiak, and Beradrome.

These vaults pair major tokens including BERA, HONEY, USDC, and wETH to maximize liquidity depth. The role of BERA in these pools has driven trading activity, with a 24-hour volume reaching $165.9 million.

Market Analysis

Technical analysis reveals BERA is trading inside a symmetrical triangle pattern. The cryptocurrency recently broke out from a short-term parallel channel that contained upward movement since March 11.

This breakout suggests the increase is not merely corrective but possibly the beginning of a new rally. After reaching a high of $8.06, the price retraced slightly, validating the channel’s resistance trend line as support.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to hover above the overbought range in the daily time frame. Meanwhile, the 14-day EMA acts as consistent support for the BERA price chart, suggesting a positive outlook for the week ahead.

The Cross EMA 50/200-day appears to be approaching a Golden Cross on the Berachain price chart. This technical event often signals sustained bullish action in the market.

If market conditions remain favorable to bulls, BERA could target its immediate resistance level of $9.35. Should the price maintain above this threshold, it may continue toward an upper target of $12.37, which would represent a new all-time high.

Conversely, any bearish reversal could pull BERA toward its support level of $7.15. More intense selling pressure might drive the price down to $5.

Beyond DEXes, Berachain plans to expand into real-world assets, gaming, and other sectors. A second batch of vaults is currently under review, with decisions expected by March 27th.

Governance forms a cornerstone of the PoL system, with BGT holders now having influence over the network’s direction. While the initial airdrop laid the foundation, PoL decentralizes control by allowing the community to dictate incentive flows.

As pseudonymous founder Homme Bera noted, the PoL launch represents a major step in the network’s evolution and promises sustainable growth. The upcoming review of additional vaults next week could further broaden the ecosystem’s scope.",blockonomi

Pi Coin price has fallen by 12% to $0.81, extending weekly losses to 28%

Investors are concerned about Pi Network’s ability to recover above $1

Community members urge the Core Team to address delays in mainnet launch and Binance listing

About 8 million tokens transferred to exchanges in the past week, increasing sell pressure

Analysts suggest Pi could rebound from $0.71-$0.86 support zone if it stabilizes

Pi Network’s cryptocurrency, Pi Coin (PI), continues to face significant downward pressure as its price has fallen below the $1 mark. The token has dropped 12% to $0.81, extending its weekly losses to 28%. This decline comes amid delays in the mainnet launch, Binance listing, and growing concerns within the Pi community about the project’s direction.

The Pi Coin was trading at around $0.86 at the time of writing. This represents a stark contrast to its peak of nearly $3 in late February 2025. The token has now lost over 68% of its value from that high point.

Investor sentiment has waned as the price continues to drop. Many Pi holders are questioning whether the coin can recover to trade above the $1 level any time soon. Trading volumes have also decreased by over 30%, falling below $200 million.

One key factor behind the price decline is the large number of Pi tokens being unlocked and moved to exchanges. Nearly 8 million tokens have been transferred in the past week alone. This has created an oversupply in the market.

The daily rate of token unlocks has slowed from 13 million to 3.8 million. This reduction might help ease some of the selling pressure. However, concerns remain as approximately 99.3 million more Pi tokens will enter circulation in the next 30 days.

Community members have expressed frustration with the Pi Network Core Team’s silence on critical updates. They want answers about delays in the mainnet launch and the Binance listing that many had hoped for after a supportive community poll ended on February 28.

Some users have alleged that the Core Team is moving away from its promise of full decentralization. They claim the project now seems to be courting large institutions instead. This shift has caused concern among early supporters who believed in the network’s original vision.

Despite these issues, some analysts remain optimistic about Pi’s future. Technical analysis suggests that if Pi can maintain support around the $0.71-$0.86 zone, it could potentially bounce back toward a $2 target. This would represent a significant recovery from current levels.

Critics vs. Partnerships

The network has announced a partnership with PiDaoSwap, a community-driven platform aimed at improving governance and transparency. This move could help rebuild confidence in the project’s long-term vision.

Pi Network has faced criticism from prominent figures in the crypto industry. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou and Cyber Capital Founder Justin Bons have both publicly called Pi Network a “scam.” Bons specifically criticized the project for being “extremely centralized” while claiming to be decentralized.

Bons also pointed to the project’s five-year delay in delivering its mainnet and accused it of using multi-level marketing tactics through its referral programs. He claimed the core technology was “simply copied from Stellar.”

To address the current price issues, some analysts have suggested that the Pi Network team should burn between 60-100 million tokens. This reduction in supply could help stabilize the price and reduce volatility.

Looking forward, Pi Network’s price performance will likely depend on how the team addresses these concerns. Increased transparency, progress on decentralization, and successful management of token unlocks will be key factors.

If Pi can expand its exchange listings to major platforms like Binance, this could increase liquidity and demand. Some optimistic projections suggest the token could eventually reach $10 if the project achieves its vision of becoming a stablecoin for peer-to-peer transactions.

However, investors should remain cautious and monitor market activity closely. Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and Pi Network’s current challenges highlight the volatility of this market sector.

Pi Network faces a critical period as it works to stabilize its price and address community concerns while dealing with the ongoing token unlock process.",blockonomi

XRP has maintained a price above $2 for nearly three months, showing unusual stability at this level

Technical analysis suggests XRP is building liquidity above $2.60, possibly preparing for another bullish leg

Analyst EGRAG Crypto predicts potential targets of $15, $22, $27, and an extended target of $44

Inclusion in the U.S. Digital Asset Reserve signals growing institutional acceptance

Current price stability contrasts with previous cycle tops where XRP quickly reversed from highs

XRP has been trading above the $2 mark for nearly three months, showing unusual stability at this level compared to previous market cycles. Currently changing hands at around $2.44, the cryptocurrency has maintained this base despite facing bearish pressure at resistance levels between $2.6 and $2.8.

This stability comes amid several positive developments for XRP. These include progress on XRP ETFs, inclusion in a U.S. strategic stockpile, and the SEC’s decision to drop its appeal against Ripple.

Market analyst Dom points out that XRP’s current behavior differs significantly from past cycles. In previous bull runs, XRP would see sharp rallies followed by immediate crashes, without establishing stable price ranges at peak levels.

$XRP There's one reason I will be pretty surprised if $XRP does not go higher this year, read along – Every time $XRP has historically put in a multi month or year top, it did it quickly (as shown below) Essentially, it never showed any mid term acceptance at those higher… pic.twitter.com/RahjM2xHwz — Dom (@traderview2) March 24, 2025

For example, in December 2013, XRP rose to $0.0614 only to crash to $0.00281 months later. Similar patterns occurred in December 2014 and January 2018, when XRP hit $3.8 before dropping sharply.

The recent extended period of trading above $2 suggests market participants are reaching a consensus on XRP’s value. According to Dom, “The longer price spends time at a level, it’s always just reflective of how much market participants agree on that price.”

This prolonged stability contrasts with true cycle tops, which typically form quickly without giving traders much opportunity to exit at high levels. The steady volume at current prices further suggests continued market participation.

Technical Analysis

Technical analysis from EGRAG Crypto identifies what appears to be an ascending triangle pattern on XRP’s weekly chart. This pattern features a flat upper trendline at around the $2 psychological level and an upward-slanting lower trendline showing higher lows.

XRP has been testing this resistance for nearly seven years. The asset attempted to breach this level in April 2021 but hit resistance at $1.96. More recently, in late 2024, XRP surpassed the $2 mark, breaking through the upper trendline.

EGRAG’s analysis suggests that the recent pullback from January 2025’s high of $3.4 represents an attempt to retest the triangle breakout. Once this retest is complete and XRP maintains a position above $2, an explosive rally could follow.

The analyst has presented multiple price targets for this potential breakout. The conservative target sits at $15, representing a 514% increase from current levels. A normal measurement of the breakout puts the next target at $22.

EGRAG’s personal target has been $27, which he predicted last December following what he calls a Break of Structure. In his most ambitious projection, he suggests an “extended target” of $44, which would represent a massive 1,703% increase from current prices.

#XRP – Extended Target of $44: Investing and Trading in crypto is a Multi-Dimensional Game. GET USED TO IT. Choose your targets Wisely:

🔹Conservative Target: $15

🔹Normal Measurement: $22

🔹Extended Measurement: $44

🔹Personal Target: $27 Take Profits: It’s wise to… pic.twitter.com/aHBB3kWeie — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) March 25, 2025

Despite these ambitious targets, EGRAG advises investors to take profits along the way. He suggests beginning to take profits when XRP reaches $5 and continuing until the $9 mark.

Another analyst, Crypto Patel, highlights a bullish structure shift after XRP swept sell-side liquidity. Patel identified $2.2220 as a strong bullish order block, making it a key entry point for long positions.

With XRP reclaiming key levels, traders are now targeting $2.9990 and $3.4000 as potential upside zones. Breaking above these resistance levels could trigger the next major pump.

The inclusion of XRP in the U.S. Digital Asset Reserve has been a major boost to market sentiment. This development signals growing institutional acceptance and reinforces XRP’s position as a key player in the broader financial ecosystem.

With regulatory hurdles clearing following the resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple case, attention is turning toward new industry catalysts. These include potential ETF developments, stablecoin expansion, and increased blockchain adoption.

Bitcoin’s recent breakout has injected fresh energy into the crypto market, driving bullish sentiment across major assets. Historically, strong BTC rallies often lead to capital rotation into altcoins, and XRP appears well-positioned to benefit from this trend.

At the time of writing, XRP has a 24-hour trading volume of $5.50 billion and a market cap of $142.87 billion. The price has increased slightly over the past 24 hours.

Technical indicators suggest that XRP is building up liquidity above $2.60, a crucial level that could trigger the next significant move upward. A breakout above this resistance could open the door for a larger price surge, especially as market momentum aligns with bullish macro trends.

With regulatory clarity, increasing institutional adoption, and a strong technical setup, XRP appears primed for further gains. The key question now is whether the asset will break past established resistance levels and confirm its next bullish leg.

As liquidity continues to stack up and the market reaches equilibrium, traders are closely watching for signs of a breakout from XRP’s current trading range.",blockonomi

These tokens have captured the imaginations of investors worldwide, and their prices have skyrocketed thanks to viral social media trends and community-driven support. However, there’s a new contender on the rise—Coldware (COLD), a new coin priced at just $0.0045, that has experts and investors alike wondering if it’s poised to outperform even Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE).

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) are still riding the wave of their meme-driven success, Coldware (COLD) is rapidly gaining attention for its unique blend of innovative culture and utility-driven features. Its presale success has made it an exciting prospect, drawing comparisons to the early days of both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE). With the cryptocurrency market evolving, Coldware (COLD) could very well be the next big thing, attracting those looking for a crypto coin with long-term potential and innovative features.

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Meme Coin Kings

Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have long been synonymous with the meme coin movement. Dogecoin (DOGE), initially created as a joke, has evolved into a significant player, primarily driven by its vast community and celebrity endorsements, including Elon Musk. The token’s ability to maintain a strong market capitalization, despite lacking intrinsic utility, showcases the power of community-driven projects in the crypto world. Dogecoin (DOGE) has consistently been one of the top meme coins in the market, recently trading at around $0.18 after a dip from its peak of $0.43 earlier in the year.

Similarly, Pepe Coin (PEPE) has gained widespread recognition, thanks to its meme status and the viral nature of its community-driven campaigns. While both tokens have experienced incredible growth, their value often fluctuates based on speculative trading and social media hype. This has left many investors looking for something with more stability and potential long-term growth—enter Coldware (COLD).

Coldware (COLD): A New Crypto Coin with Real Potential

Coldware (COLD) is a fresh take on the crypto market, combining the viral appeal of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) with real-world utility. Unlike many other coins, Coldware (COLD) is designed to provide tangible applications beyond just viral appeal. Its development team is focused on creating a platform that integrates unique community culture with robust blockchain functionality, making it more than just another speculative asset.

What makes Coldware (COLD) stand out is its unique approach to tokenomics and its promise to offer long-term growth. The presale of Coldware (COLD) has already exceeded expectations, and its price has steadily increased as more investors see its potential. At just $0.0045, it’s positioned as an affordable entry point for those looking to invest in the next crypto coin that could surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) in terms of both price and market cap.

Crypto Market: Why Investors Are Turning to Coldware (COLD)

As the market continues to evolve, there’s a growing shift towards projects that offer more than just viral hype. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) are still top contenders, but they are increasingly being overshadowed by projects that integrate technological innovations and utility into their design. Coldware (COLD) fits this mold, combining investment culture with blockchain technology that could lead to sustainable growth.

Experts believe that the future of crypto coins lies in their ability to offer something beyond just community hype. Coldware (COLD) taps into this sentiment, providing both a fun atmosphere and the promise of real-world applications. As a result, it’s quickly gaining traction with investors who are looking for the next big thing in the crypto world—an investment that’s not just fun but has staying power.

The Future of Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE)

While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) are still going strong, their future is uncertain. Both coins have faced challenges in terms of volatility and speculative trading. However, they continue to dominate the coin market, with strong communities and celebrity endorsements keeping their prices afloat. Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently struggling to regain its momentum, trading at a significant dip from its highs, while Pepe Coin (PEPE) continues to maintain a strong presence in the meme coin sector.

Despite these challenges, experts remain bullish on the long-term prospects of both Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE), especially as meme culture continues to influence the broader crypto landscape. However, as more investors look for serious coins with utility, Coldware (COLD) is beginning to emerge as a serious contender in the market.

Coldware (COLD) and Its Place in the Crypto Ecosystem

Coldware (COLD) is quickly gaining attention as the crypto coin of the future. With its innovative approach to tokenomics, real-world utility, and rapid presale success, it’s positioning itself as the next big thing in the coin market. While Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have paved the way for meme coins, Coldware (COLD) is carving its own niche, offering a blend of fun and utility that could appeal to a wider range of investors.

As the crypto market continues to mature, the demand for coins with real-world applications is growing. Coldware (COLD) is at the forefront of this movement, offering a serious coin that’s not just about community hype but also about building a sustainable future for its holders. With its affordable entry price and innovative features, Coldware (COLD) is a crypto coin worth watching in 2025 and beyond.

Conclusion: Why Coldware (COLD) Could Be the Coin to Buy Now

In conclusion, while Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe Coin (PEPE) remain the top players in the meme coin market, Coldware (COLD) is quickly becoming a serious new contender for serious investors. With its unique combination of innovative appeal and practical utility, Coldware (COLD) offers investors the chance to get in on the ground floor of what could be the next big thing in cryptocurrency. As the coin market evolves, Coldware (COLD) is positioning itself as a long-term growth asset, making it the perfect time for investors to get involved before it skyrockets in value.

https://blockonomi.com,Rexas Finance Crypto Price Prediction: Why RXS is Expected to Grow Explosively for Years and Years,https://blockonomi.com/rexas-finance-crypto-price-prediction-why-rxs-is-expected-to-grow-explosively-for-years-and-years/,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 13:22:14 GMT","With a strong ecosystem and Rexas Finance (RXS) creative approach to distributed finance (DeFi), RXS is set for exponential expansion in the following years. One thing is evident when experts assess its possible: Rexas Finance is a coin to keep an eye on; forecasts point to a long-term upward path that might yield significant rewards to investors.

The Revolutionary Vision of Rexas Finance (RXS)

Rexas Finance (RXS) is a groundbreaking tool bridging the gap between actual assets and blockchain technology. Unlike many digital currencies that depend on speculation, RXS is founded on utility and provides flawless asset tokenizing, enabling users to own, trade, and profit from real-world assets anywhere in the world. This innovative technique places Rexas Finance first in the changing terrain of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Rexas Finance is rewriting conventional investment tactics by allowing investors to buy fractional ownership of high-value assets, including real estate, commodities, and intellectual properties. This capacity makes mass adoption possible since regular investors can now access assets meant for institutional players. Rexas Finance is positioned to ride the tide of acceptance, confirming its dominance in the crypto market as tokenization takes the front stage in global banking.

The Ongoing Presale Success

The remarkable presale performance of Rexas Finance is among the best evidence of its explosive potential. Pricing at $0.20, RXS is in its 12th and last presale stage and shows a fantastic 6x increase from its starting price. Over $47.22 million raised thus far indicates the great investor demand driving this price momentum. The final presale stage fills over 91.23%, emphasizing the token’s great demand. With June 19, 2025’s official launch price set at $0.25, there is growing expectation for a robust market debut. Early-stage cryptocurrencies with strong foundations often experience notable appreciation post-launch, hence analysts believe RXS could see quick gains once it goes public. The substantial presale expansion reflects investor confidence and prepares RXS to take front stage in the DeFi market.

CertiK Audit: Ensuring Trust and Security

Security and trust are vital in crypto, so Rexas Finance has gone big to project its legitimacy. Leading blockchain security company Certik, well-known for reviewing elite cryptocurrency initiatives, has conducted a comprehensive security audit on the initiative. This accreditation guarantees users that the RXS ecosystem is created transparently and safely, significantly boosting investor confidence. Through smart contract integrity assurance and security vulnerability correction, Rexas Finance’s Certik audit reduces risks and promotes institutional adoption. Many investors avoid new initiatives because of concerns regarding security and fraud, but Rexas Finance has effectively allayed these fears. Growing trust in the platform will probably draw users and investors, increasing demand and price.

Community Engagement and Incentives Driving Demand

Beyond its solid principles, Rexas Finance has aggressively involved the crypto community with calculated rewards. With almost 1.64 million entries from its continuous $1 million contest, the initiative has even more buzz. Twenty lucky participants will receive $50,000 worth of RXS each from this promotion, generating excitement and increasing the token’s availability. The significant involvement in the giveaway emphasizes the increasing interest in RXS and the need for community-driven development. The network effect will probably speed adoption as more users participate in the ecosystem, driving higher trade volume and price appreciation. Rexas Finance guarantees a consistent flow of new users into its ecosystem by using innovative incentives to support its long-term development path.

Explosive Growth Potential in the Crypto Market

Due to Rexas Finance’s (RXS) distinctive value proposition and growing demand, market analysts and top crypto traders foresee an excellent surge for Rexas Finance. RXS is predicted to increase exponentially as the project becomes popular, possibly surpassing numerous well-known cryptocurrencies in the next few years: strong presale performance, security assurance via Certik, and community-driven momentum help RXS to soar. Rexas Finance distinguishes itself in the constantly changing DeFi market by combining real-world assets with blockchain technology. Projects like RXS that provide actual value will experience ongoing demand as conventional finance keeps blending with blockchain ideas. The idea that RXS is not only another fleeting fad but also the growing institutional curiosity in RWA tokenization strengthens a long-term powerhouse.

2. First-of-its-Kind AI & RWA Launchpad on XRP Ledger

XRPTurbo is bringing revolutionary capabilities to the XRPL as the first launchpad specifically designed to incubate innovative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Real-World Asset (RWA) projects.

By simplifying complex blockchain tasks, XRPTurbo’s groundbreaking launchpad enables projects to mint tokens, NFTs, and deploy sophisticated decentralized applications effortlessly, essentially becoming a “Kickstarter meets DAO Maker” for XRP’s rapidly evolving ecosystem.

The upcoming platform demo and sleek, redesigned landing page—teased earlier this week—further amplify investor excitement as the project moves towards public launch.

3. Easy-to-Use Token Minting and Innovative Liquid Staking

A critical gap XRPTurbo is filling is providing an intuitive GUI Token Minter, allowing anyone—even non-technical creators—to mint XRP-native tokens with a simple click.

Previously, XRP token minting required complex command-line processes; XRPTurbo is eliminating these barriers.

Moreover, XRPTurbo is introducing an innovative Liquid Staking feature, allowing holders to earn up to 25% APY without ever locking up their XRT tokens or losing control of their assets—tokens never leave users’ wallets.

This approach ensures maximum security, flexibility, and profitability for XRPTurbo stakers.

4. Undervalued Opportunity with Massive Growth Potential

Currently sitting at under a $1 million market cap, XRPTurbo is notably undervalued compared to established launchpads like DAO Maker or Seedify which have market caps of tens of millions. This valuation gap means early investors potentially stand to gain significantly as XRPTurbo’s innovative DeFi suite attracts broader adoption.

Investors seeking high-upside projects in the XRP ecosystem will find XRPTurbo perfectly positioned to capture immense growth opportunities.

5. Strategic Roadmap, First-Mover Advantage, & Experienced Team

XRPTurbo boasts a clearly defined roadmap highlighting ongoing developments like the Liquid Staking Portal, token minting platform, and AI-driven launchpad features.

Leveraging the first-mover advantage within the XRPL ecosystem, XRPTurbo has abundant room for further expansion.

The dedicated and experienced team behind XRPTurbo is committed to continuous innovation, already demonstrating impressive execution and transparency that has resonated strongly with the growing XRP community.

https://blockonomi.com,Avalanche (AVAX) Rallies 12% After Breakout—Is It Time to Consider MUTM Before Its Own Surge?,https://blockonomi.com/avalanche-avax-rallies-12-after-breakout-is-it-time-to-consider-mutm-before-its-own-surge/,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 07:56:25 GMT","Avalanche’s recent price action has brought renewed energy to the crypto market. A 12% rise within a single day has put AVAX back on investors’ radar, reminding traders of the potential hidden in technically strong assets. While AVAX continues to gain momentum, another project quietly gaining interest is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently in its presale phase. With its price still at $0.02—but set to rise soon—some are now asking whether this is the better entry point ahead of its own breakout.

Avalanche (AVAX)

AVAX’s movement came after it broke through a key resistance at $21.39, reclaiming lost ground after several weeks of sideways action. On-chain metrics have shifted, with a notable jump in daily trading volume—up 185%—and a rise in open interest signaling renewed confidence from traders. Its current market cap has passed $9.07 billion, backed by rising interest across both technical and sentiment indicators.

Supporting this outlook are several signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart has moved above 50, suggesting positive momentum, while the MACD has confirmed a bullish crossover. Additionally, the long-short ratio hit a one-month high at 1.18, showing that more traders are positioning for further upside. A continuation of this trend could push AVAX toward the $30 mark, especially if it maintains its position above $24.99 in the coming sessions.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM)

While AVAX is enjoying its moment, some are turning their attention to early-stage tokens with growth potential—and that’s where Mutuum Finance comes in. Still in Phase 3 of its presale, MUTM is trading at just $0.02. This phase is already 76% filled, and once completed, the price will move to $0.025 in Phase 4. That upcoming 25% increase makes now the lowest possible entry point, especially for those who want exposure before momentum starts building.

Mutuum Finance is a decentralized liquidity protocol built around transparency and capital efficiency. It enables users to lend or borrow crypto assets directly through smart contracts, all while maintaining full custody of their funds. Instead of matching borrowers and lenders one-to-one, Mutuum works through shared liquidity pools, which allows for greater flexibility and faster access to capital. When users deposit funds, they receive mtTokens that reflect both their original deposit and the interest it earns over time. These mtTokens can be redeemed or even traded, offering ongoing access to liquidity.

Borrowers on the platform don’t have to sell their assets to get capital. Instead, they can secure loans by locking in collateral, keeping exposure to their holdings. There are no fixed repayment deadlines as long as the collateral stays above the required level, giving users more breathing room and control over their positions. The system is structured to support a healthy lending cycle, with interest rates adjusting automatically depending on how much liquidity is being used in each pool.

What makes Mutuum stand out is the way it plans to sustain long-term value for its token. A portion of protocol revenue will be used to purchase MUTM from the open market and distribute it to mtToken holders who stake their tokens. This creates steady demand for MUTM, while also rewarding users who contribute liquidity to the system. It’s a self-reinforcing mechanism that supports both token growth and user engagement.

With AVAX showing that market breakouts are very much alive, it’s worth asking which token might be next. MUTM’s presale price is still low, but that window is closing. Once Phase 3 ends, the increase to $0.025 brings more attention—and often, more buyers. For those watching from the sidelines, this may be the last chance to enter before momentum shifts upward.

https://blockonomi.com,SEC Schedules Four Cryptocurrency Roundtables for Spring 2025,https://blockonomi.com/sec-schedules-four-cryptocurrency-roundtables-for-spring-2025/,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 09:17:57 GMT","The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will host four more crypto roundtables in the coming months, with each event focused on key aspects of the cryptocurrency industry. The agency announced the schedule on March 25, continuing what Commissioner Hester Peirce has called a “Spring Sprint Toward Crypto Clarity.”

The series of discussions will begin on April 11 with a roundtable titled “Between a Block and a Hard Place: Tailoring Regulation for Crypto Trading.” This first event will examine how regulations can be adapted to the unique characteristics of cryptocurrency markets.

The second roundtable is scheduled for April 25 and will focus on crypto custody with the theme “Know Your Custodian: Key Considerations for Crypto Custody.” This session will likely address how crypto assets should be stored and protected.

On May 12, the SEC will host a roundtable on tokenization titled “Tokenization – Moving Assets Onchain: Where TradFi and DeFi Meet.” This discussion will explore how traditional assets can be represented and traded on blockchain networks.

The final roundtable in the series, set for June 6, will tackle decentralized finance under the theme “DeFi and the American Spirit.” This event will examine the growing sector of blockchain-based financial services that operate without central intermediaries.

These upcoming roundtables follow the first such event held on March 27, which discussed the security status of tokens. That initial meeting brought together industry lawyers to address one of the most contested areas of crypto regulation.

Join us on March 27 for a roundtable discussion on artificial intelligence in the financial industry. Topics include the risks, benefits, and governance of AI. More details: https://t.co/ekX2RWp2KQ pic.twitter.com/7fH3j1tlwj — U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (@SECGov) March 25, 2025

The roundtables are organized by the SEC’s Crypto Task Force, which was established on January 21 by Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda. The task force aims to create a workable framework for cryptocurrency regulation.

Commissioner Hester Peirce, who leads the task force, emphasized the value of these discussions. “The Crypto Task Force roundtables are an opportunity for us to hear a lively discussion among experts about what the regulatory issues are and what the Commission can do to solve them,” she said in the announcement.

All four roundtables will be open to the public, with options to attend in person at the SEC headquarters in Washington, DC, or to watch online. The agency has not yet announced the specific agendas or speakers for each event.

From Enforcement to Collaboration

The roundtable series marks a clear shift in the SEC’s approach to cryptocurrency under the new administration. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC took what many in the industry viewed as a hardline stance toward crypto companies.

The agency has recently dismissed some enforcement actions against crypto firms that were initiated during Gensler’s tenure. This change in direction comes as part of a broader review of crypto policies.

Acting Chair Uyeda has also indicated plans to scrap a rule proposed during the Biden administration that would tighten crypto custody standards for investment advisers. He announced this intention on March 17, further showing the agency’s new direction.

In a March 10 speech, Uyeda mentioned he had asked SEC staff to explore options for abandoning parts of proposed changes that would expand regulation of alternative trading systems to include crypto firms. These changes would have required such firms to register as exchanges.

The SEC’s changing approach to crypto regulation comes during the early months of the Trump administration. Industry observers have noted that the agency seems to be taking a more collaborative approach with the crypto sector.

Anyone interested in being considered as a panelist for the upcoming roundtables can email the SEC’s Crypto Task Force. The agency notes that due to expected demand, not all requests can be accommodated.

In addition to the crypto roundtables, the SEC will also host a discussion about artificial intelligence in the financial industry on March 27. This event will explore the risks, benefits, and governance of AI, with Uyeda, Peirce, and Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw scheduled to speak.",blockonomi

SEC officially dropped its investigation into Immutable, deciding to take no further action

IMX token surged 15% following the announcement, reaching its highest price since March 3

Immutable co-founder Robbie Ferguson called it “an enormous win for Web3 gaming”

This is part of a larger trend of the SEC dropping crypto investigations under new leadership

The regulatory shift follows Trump’s return to office and former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s exit

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has closed its investigation into Web3 gaming platform Immutable, the Australian company announced on Tuesday. This decision marks the latest in a series of dropped probes as the regulatory approach to cryptocurrency continues to shift under new leadership.

Immutable revealed that the SEC had concluded its inquiry without finding any violations. This closes “the loop on the Wells notice issued by the SEC last year,” according to the company. A Wells notice is an official notification that the SEC intends to bring an enforcement action.

The market responded quickly to the news. Immutable’s native token, IMX, surged approximately 15% on March 25. The token reached just under $0.74 shortly after the announcement, its highest level since March 3.

Before this recent uptick, IMX had followed the broader crypto market downtrend. Uncertainty over U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariffs and interest rates had pushed the token down to $0.46 on March 11. At the time of publication, IMX had settled at around $0.67.

Robbie Ferguson, Immutable’s co-founder and president, celebrated the news on social media. “After a year of fighting, this threat to digital ownership rights has finally been put to rest,” Ferguson stated. He called the SEC’s decision “an enormous win for Web3 gaming.”

Ferguson added that the firm was “thrilled” at the developing regulatory clarity coming from the U.S. government. “With a clear regulatory framework, we plan to accelerate our ambitions to bring digital ownership to the 3.1 billion gamers in the world,” he said.

The SEC has now officially dropped its inquiry into Immutable, with no enforcement action to be taken. This is an enormous win for web3 gaming – after a year of fighting, this threat to digital ownership rights has finally been put to rest. We’re excited to build. — Robbie Ferguson | Immutable (@0xferg) March 25, 2025

The gaming token sector showed positive movement following Immutable’s news. Several top gaming cryptocurrencies experienced gains over a 24-hour period. Gala rose 2.78%, The Sandbox increased 3.78%, FLOKI gained 1.91%, and Axie Infinity moved up 1.50%.

IMX’s all-time high remains $9.32, which it reached in November 2021 during a major rally in gaming tokens. The total market cap of gaming tokens has dropped 3.65% to $13.13 billion over the past 30 days. Trading volume has declined more sharply, falling 33.45% to $1.75 billion.

Shifting Regulatory Landscape Under New Leadership

The SEC’s decision regarding Immutable is part of a broader pattern of regulatory shifts. The agency has closed numerous investigations in recent weeks under the leadership of Acting Chair Mark Uyeda. This represents a departure from former Chair Gary Gensler’s approach to crypto regulation.

Under Gensler, the SEC had taken a more aggressive stance toward cryptocurrency companies. Gensler had maintained that most cryptocurrencies are securities and called for crypto platforms to register with the agency. He also brought cases against various entities in the crypto space.

Since President Trump took office and Gensler’s exit in January, the SEC has signaled a complete overhaul of its crypto regulation strategy. The agency has established a Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is known for her crypto-friendly stance. The SEC has also begun a series of roundtable discussions with industry players.

In less than three months, the SEC has dropped investigations into several major crypto entities. These include crypto exchange Gemini, trading platform Robinhood, NFT marketplace OpenSea, NFT company Yuga Labs, and now Immutable. None of these investigations resulted in enforcement charges.

The agency has also dropped litigation against companies including Kraken, Coinbase, ConsenSys, Ripple, and Cumberland DRW. Cases against Tron and Binance have been paused. However, not all entities that received Wells notices have been cleared. Crypto issuer Unicoin, for example, remains “in the final stages of the SEC review process,” according to a company spokesperson.

Immutable expressed support for the U.S. government’s new approach to creating clearer rules for digital assets. “Constructive regulation provides certainty for builders, and helps foster the innovative potential of blockchain technology,” the company stated on Tuesday.

The SEC declined to comment on the Immutable decision. The agency typically “does not comment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation,” according to their standard response to media inquiries.",blockonomi
https://blockonomi.com,GameStop Adds Bitcoin to Investment Policy Following Board Approval,https://blockonomi.com/gamestop-adds-bitcoin-to-investment-policy-following-board-approval/,"Wed, 26 Mar 2025 09:05:17 GMT","TLDR

GameStop has approved Bitcoin as a “Treasury Reserve Asset” in a unanimous board decision

The company’s stock rose over 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement

GameStop held $4.7 billion in cash as of February 1, 2025

CEO Ryan Cohen hinted at this move last month by posting a photo with Strategy’s Michael Saylor

GameStop reported profits of $131 million on $3.8 billion in sales for fiscal year 2024

Video game retailer GameStop has updated its investment policy to include Bitcoin as a “Treasury Reserve Asset.” The company announced the change in its 2024 annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Tuesday, March 25.

The board of directors unanimously approved the policy update on March 18. This new strategy allows GameStop to invest its corporate cash in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

GameStop’s stock responded positively to the news. After closing at $25.40 with a 0.82% loss for the regular trading day, GME shares jumped more than 6% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The company made it clear in its SEC filing that it has not set any upper limit on how much Bitcoin it may purchase. GameStop also noted that it reserves the right to sell any Bitcoin it acquires in the future.

This move comes about a month after speculation began about GameStop’s interest in cryptocurrency investments. CEO Ryan Cohen had hinted at this direction in February when he posted a photo on social media with Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy).

Following Strategy’s Bitcoin Playbook

Michael Saylor’s Strategy is known for its massive Bitcoin holdings. The company currently holds more than 447,000 Bitcoin tokens, according to a February filing, making it the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency.

As of February 1, 2025, GameStop held $4.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This represents a major increase from the $921 million reported a year earlier.

The company’s financial position has been improving under Cohen’s leadership. For its 2024 fiscal year, GameStop reported profits of $131 million on $3.8 billion in sales, which came primarily from video game hardware and accessories.

This performance marks an increase from the previous year when the company reported a profit of $6.7 million on $5.3 billion in sales. The fourth-quarter results showed net income of $131.3 million, more than double the $63.1 million earned in the same quarter last year.

Cohen, who founded online pet supplies retailer Chewy, took over as CEO nearly a year and a half ago. Since then, he has focused on cutting costs and streamlining operations to make the business profitable.

This move into Bitcoin represents GameStop’s latest effort to revitalize its business model. The company acknowledged in its SEC filing that this strategy comes with risks, noting that “Bitcoin is a highly volatile asset and has experienced price fluctuations over time.”

Bitcoin itself has seen major price movements recently. After reaching a record high above $100,000, the cryptocurrency has declined about 18% to approximately $88,000.

The cryptocurrency market has been on a roller coaster ride since President Donald Trump won reelection. These price swings highlight the volatile nature of the asset class that GameStop is now entering.

Some Wall Street analysts have expressed caution about GameStop’s Bitcoin strategy. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance, “If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their $4.6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings], the stock would drop five bucks.”

The company’s plan follows a trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Tesla made headlines in 2021 when it purchased $1.5 billion in Bitcoin, though it later sold most of its holdings.

GameStop follows Strategy’s approach of using corporate cash to buy Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Strategy’s stock has performed well with this strategy, rising over 84% in the past year as Bitcoin’s price increased.",blockonomi
