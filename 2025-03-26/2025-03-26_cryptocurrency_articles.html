According to Ai 姨, the term 'preferential pricing' used by bwenews may indicate humor or sarcasm, suggesting a potential perception of the current cryptocurrency prices as perhaps inflated or manipulated. This sentiment could influence traders to be cautious and critically evaluate market pricing strategies. The humorous tone implies skepticism, which might affect market confidence and trading volumes.

GameStop GME shares are up some 15% on Wednesday, March 26 after the gaming merchandise retailer announced plans of using its corporate cash to buy Bitcoin BTCUSD. 

In its press release, the firm did not set a limit on how much it may invest in the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. 

Investors are cheering the announcement because putting BTC on the balance sheet has worked wonders for MicroStrategy MSTR stock over the past year. 

Including today's surge, GME shares are up nearly 35% versus their year-to-date low.  

What a Bitcoin Strategy May Mean for GameStop Stock

MicroStrategy has transitioned from a business intelligence software company into a Bitcoin proxy in recent years. It started buying BTC in August 2020, when MSTR traded for roughly $15. 

Today, the Virginia-headquartered firm owns more than 500,000 BTC in total, while its share price sits at about $33. That's a well over twenty-fold increase in less than five years. 

In 2024, the company now known as Strategy achieved a “BTC Yield” of 74.3%, indicating its Bitcoin acquisition strategy has been immensely successful in improving shareholder value. 

So, if GME succeeds in replicating MicroStrategy with its Bitcoin strategy, it's reasonable to believe that its stock price will rally in the medium to long term as well. 

That is what's driving GameStop stock price up at the time of writing. 

GME More Than Doubled Net Income in its Q4

GameStop shares may be worth buying at current levels because the retailer's earnings release also showed signed of improvement on Wednesday. 

For its Q4, the gaming merchandise company reported about $131 million in net income. That translates to a more than 100% growth from $63.1 million in the same quarter last year. 

More importantly, the NYSE-listed firm has sharply improved its overall liquidity in the trailing 12 months, from $1.19 billion only to $4.775 billion. 

Wall Street Remains Bearish on GameStop Shares

While things seem to be picking up for GameStop, investors should note that Wall Street remains bearish as ever on GME shares. 

The consensus rating on GameStop currently sits at “Strong Sell” with the mean target of $10 indicating potential downside of about 65% from current levels. However, investors should note that Barchart is only tracking one analyst in coverage of GME.

Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matthew Hougan says the firm is "extraordinarily bullish" on Bitcoin BTC/USD as the cryptocurrency gains widespread acceptance from governments, corporations and traditional asset managers. 

What To Know: Hougan sat down with Benzinga at the Future Proof Citywide event in Miami Beach, FL last week and talked about the importance of a crypto-friendly administration and President Donald Trump's recent announcement of a strategic bitcoin reserve. 

The last existential threat to bitcoin was removed when governments began accepting and adopting the cryptocurrency as an asset, Hougan said.

"We see governments around the world buying it. Do you wanna wait til it's too late to get in, or do you want to build your position now? The reason it's important for crypto investors is the biggest existential risk to crypto has always been that governments wouldn't like it, right?," Hougan told Benzinga. 

The chief investment officer said that the bitcoin of today has matured and become legitimized and accepted in a way it was not even five or 10 years ago. He pointed to institutional investors, hedge funds, ETFs and more than 70 corporations that now keep bitcoin as part of their holdings. 

Bitwise designed the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF OWNB that provides exposure to corporations with at least 1,000 bitcoin on their balance sheets.

"BlackRock is in the space. Fidelity is in the space. Stan Druckenmiller owns bitcoin. Ray Dalio owns bitcoin. The United States owns bitcoin," Hougan said. 

Hougan said that though the short-term outlook for bitcoin is risky, he sees the influx of capital eventually pushing bitcoin to $200,000 in the long run. 

"Short term: risky. Long term: extraordinarily bullish," Hougan said, sharing Bitwise's current outlook for bitcoin.

GameStop shares jumped over 14% over the past 24 hours after the company's board approved a plan to buy Bitcoin.

The video game retailer and meme stock darling has $4.8 billion in cash reserves, but it's unclear how much it wants to allocate to the number one cryptocurrency.

While the announcement has caused a stock price uptick, some market observers say it's a double-edged sword.

“In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company's stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility,” analysts at crypto business payment company B2BINPay told DL News.

“Stablecoins, of course, won't carry those risks, but Bitcoin can go both ways ― offering potential for growth but also for a drop.”

Bitcoin dropped on Wednesday, to $86,858 in afternoon trading UK time, and is still almost 20% off its January peak.

Still, the move would put GameStop in the swelling company of public firms that have added Bitcoin to their corporate balance sheets ― most famously Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which holds the largest Bitcoin hoard worth more than $44 billion.

Championed by its laser-eyed founder Michael Saylor, Strategy's Bitcoin bet has turned the software company into a de facto Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

Bitcoin adoption has been a stock booster for some companies. 

Strategy's stock price has soared 84% in the last 12 months, and it's up 23-fold since it began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020. 

The shares of Metaplanet, a Japanese investment firm, have skyrocketed 1,600% since it started buying Bitcoin last April.

But not every Strategy copycat has done so well. The swoon in Bitcoin's price in the first quarter, along with stocks and other cryptocurrencies, has punished newer entrants to the Bitcoin treasury play with significant losses.

If Strategy is any guide, GameStop might need its own Bitcoin-maxi. CEO Ryan Cohen was seen with Saylor last month, which stoked speculations that GameStop could join the 170 entities with Bitcoin treasuries.

Matt Cole, CEO of asset management firm Strive Asset Management, also urged Cohen in an open letter to convert some of GameStop's cash holdings into Bitcoin ― to which Cohen responded, “Letter received.”

Co-founded by entrepreneur and Donald Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy, Strive filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF earlier in the year. The proposed ETF invests in bonds that are issued by public companies with Bitcoin treasury holdings.

Oops, something went wrong

MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), recently rebranded to Strategy, co-founder and executive chair Michael Saylor said that he may burn his own private keys to Bitcoin instead of donating the cryptocurrency before he dies.

It would be an “ethically proper, ethically sound form of charity” that would grant “economic immortality,” added Saylor.

Saylor made these remarks while speaking to Christine Lee in an interview on March 25.

Strategy co-founder explained that burning his Bitcoin would reduce its supply, making the asset more valuable. The step would make “everyone in the network much richer and more powerful.”

Saylor added, “We're all in it together, from now to eternity. So yeah, that's my legacy.” He personally holds more than 17,000 Bitcoin.

Strategy itself would “never sell” its Bitcoin holdings the way the U.S. government has vowed not to, Saylor clarified.

The Bitcoin evangelist predicted Bitcoin's market capitalization to reach $200 trillion by 2045. As of March 26, it stands at $1.7 trillion. Saylor believes that in 2045, artificial intelligence (AI) agents will interact millions of times a second and use Bitcoin as a base currency.

Thanks to Saylor's highly bullish outlook towards Bitcoin, Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The company currently holds 506,137 Bitcoin, worth approximately $44.3 billion at current prices.

As GameStop joined the list of select companies that add Bitcoin to their corporate holdings on March 25, Saylor welcomed the move on X (formerly Twitter).

As per Kraken's price feeds, Bitcoin was trading at $87,818.80 at press time. Meanwhile, MSTR was exchanging hands at $341.81 at press time.

The current stock market correction has been difficult not just for equity investors, but also for crypto investors. Across the board, nearly every major cryptocurrency is down for the year.

And, right now, the one cryptocurrency on everyone's mind is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which has historically been the bellwether for the crypto market. So just how much of an impact has the stock market correction had on Bitcoin?

The answer to that question should have been "not much." That's because Bitcoin has historically been uncorrelated with any major asset class, including both the S&P 500 and tech stocks. In other words, Bitcoin could zig when stocks zagged. Due to Bitcoin's wild volatility, which led to huge market swings up and down, it was pretty much impossible to say that it was correlated with anything.

But that no longer seems to be the case. Bitcoin is now down 10% for the year, and nearly 25% since it hit an all-time high of $109,000 back on Jan. 20. So you could say that the stock market correction has had a very obvious and direct impact on Bitcoin, which is also in correction mode right now.

It's important here to keep an eye on Bitcoin's correlation with the overall stock market. This correlation is a mathematical measurement telling you how connected Bitcoin's moves (up or down) are with the broader market. Historically, this number has been very low, or even negative, suggesting a possible inverse relationship between Bitcoin and stocks.

But, in early January, Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 surged to 0.88, suggesting a nearly 1-to-1 correlation with the stock market. This correlation has remained stubbornly high, suggesting that Bitcoin will likely continue to feel the impact of stock market moves to a much greater degree than in the past.

From a portfolio diversification perspective, a relatively high correlation with the stock market makes Bitcoin much less attractive to investors. It's getting harder and harder to make the point that Bitcoin should be a stand-alone asset class when it is behaving more and more like a highly risky tech stock.

It is also possible to measure the shift in investor sentiment. This, too, we can measure with some mathematical precision, thanks to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Measured between 0 and 100, this metric tells you what investors are thinking at any point in time. If they are deeply fearful, the number is close to 0. If they are ebullient and euphoric, the number is closer to 100.

When Bitcoin briefly dipped below $80,000, that number fell below 20, reflecting intense fear in the marketplace. Back in December, when Bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time, that number was closer to 80, reflecting intense euphoria in the marketplace. That makes sense, given that Bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark approximately a month after the presidential election, when investors were feeling very bullish about the prospects of crypto headed into 2025.

These days, crypto sentiment can swing wildly between fear and greed, depending on the day of the week. When the White House is talking about creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, sentiment tends to move positive. However, discussions of trade tariffs and economic tightening measures from the White House often lead to a negative shift in sentiment.

This change in sentiment is having an immediate impact on investor inflows and outflows into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have become a popular tool for adjusting one's overall exposure to Bitcoin. For five straight weeks, there were massive outflows, with investors moving their money out of the Bitcoin ETFs.

That makes sense, right? If investors wake up each day feeling fearful, they are going to find ways to act on that fear. And that means shifting money out of the Bitcoin ETFs. That money has to go somewhere, and it now appears that it is shifting into gold ETFs. In the 30-day period ended March 14, $5 billion flowed out of the Bitcoin ETFs, while $10 billion flowed into gold ETFs.

If you are trying to predict where Bitcoin is headed next, there are three different pieces to the puzzle: Bitcoin's correlation with the stock market, investor sentiment, and investor inflows (or outflows) to the Bitcoin ETFs. The good news is all of these can be measured mathematically, and can be tracked on a regular, recurring basis.

2025 is shaping up to be an important test for Bitcoin. If it can zig when the stock market zags, investors will know that the "old Bitcoin" is back. They will become more positive about its long-term price prospects, and more willing to pump additional money into the Bitcoin ETFs. And that steady buying pressure over time should help to put Bitcoin on the path to hitting a new all-time high.

03/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25

Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher.

Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday's market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor's Strategy.

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector."

Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity."

“Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy.

03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor's Strategy that's built up the world's biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.”

While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy.

GameStop's "investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively," the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read.

GameStop's stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin.

Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020.

"Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen," Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair.

That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies.

“Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements," analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. 

“In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company's stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won't carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop's financial standing.”

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020.

Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month.

Last week, Saylor predicted there's about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.</p>

Key Takeaways:

Fold Holdings Inc. and Bitdeer Technologies Group have been included in the holdings of the Bitwise Investments Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB). This was announced on March 25, 2025, via the company's X account.

Founded in 2019, and headquartered in Phoenix, Fold Holdings develops Bitcoin financial services, allowing consumers to earn Bitcoin rewards through the Fold app. Bitdeer Technologies is a Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company which has operations in the well-known locations such as the United States, as well as more obscure countries such as Norway and Bhutan and thus a significant player in the setup behind the Bitcoin network itself. This follows the launch of the Bitwise fund, highlighting the ETF's rapid expansion and appeal to companies with significant Bitcoin exposure.

The addition of Fold Holdings and Bitdeer Technologies to the OWNB ETF fits with Bitwise's strategy of broadening its holdings with companies that encompass multiple dimensions of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

With the addition of these two new companies, the ETF now consists of 22 companies holding at least 1,000 BTC in their treasuries. The fund is passively managed, offering exposure to publicly traded Bitcoin companies.

Note that the fund does not own Bitcoin outright or through derivatives linked to Bitcoin, so it avoids some of the direct volatility of the cryptocurrency itself. It is not, however, a measure of Bitcoin's price itself, but rather the price of companies associated with Bitcoin. As a result, the performance of the ETF is influenced by the financial health, market positioning, and strategic decisions of the included companies, rather than Bitcoin's day-to-day fluctuations.

The OWNB ETF is based on the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations Index, which includes significant Bitcoin holders like Strategy (MSTR) (previously called MicroStrategy), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Tesla (TSLA), which is run by Elon Musk.

The OWNB ETF's other major companies include Riot Platforms, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific. Like Strategy, Metaplanet has also been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin.

As of March 21, 2025, Strategy (MSTR) holds the largest share in the Bitwise Standard Corporations Index, accounting for 21.98%. The company owns 506,137 BTC, valued at over $42 billion. Second and third after these are MARA and Riot Platforms, with respective weightings of 10.07% and 9.85%.

Metaplanet, which has been very active in acquiring Bitcoin, has a weight of 4.81% in the index as the fourth largest holding and clearly values Bitcoin as a treasury asset.



The expanded OWNB ETF now holds a cumulative 648,000 BTC, worth over $54 billion USD. This represents approximately 3.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. In other words, the OWNB ETF is a barometer for the growing trend of corporations allocating to Bitcoin.

Fold Holdings currently owns 1,485 BTC worth nearly $124 million according to the Bitwise OWNB site, while Bitdeer holds 1,090 BTC that has an estimated value of about $91 million. According to analysts, ETFs offer a distinctive way to gain exposure to Bitcoin's growth story via the stock market.

Bitwise's move reflects heightened corporate interest in Bitcoin and allows investors to ride this growing trend with exposure through the OWNB ETF.

            After GameStop closed about a quarter of its locations within the past year, shuttering 1,000 stores across the world, the company said it's not close to done. And as the struggling company closes stores, it will invest cash in cryptocurrencies.
    


            GameStop revealed in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it expects to close a “significant number” of additional locations in the coming months, although the “specific set of stores has not been identified for closure.”
    


            A majority of the closures occurred in its biggest market, the United States, with 590 locations shutting down and reducing its store count to 2,325 as of February 1. More than 330 locations closed across Europe, plus nearly 50 stores in Canada and Australia.
    


            Globally, 3,203 GameStops remain — down drastically from its peak of about 6,000 a decade ago.
    


            GameStop has closed hundreds of stores over the past several years because it has struggled to adapt to customers' changing habits of buying games online and streaming. The company was also center of the “meme stock” craze in 2021, which briefly boosted its stock.
    


            GameStop joins a number of other well-known retailers closing stores or completely disappearing, including Joann, Forever 21, Kohl's and Macy's. Among the reasons contributing to the retail exodus is continuing inflationary pressure on consumers' wallets, pressure from private equity and retailers not quickly adapting to changing shopping habits.
    


            As part of GameStop's pivot away from retail, the company also said that it's getting into bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, announcing that a “portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances” might be invested in the digital currency.
    


            “The pivot to bitcoin is really a defense against irrelevance,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail told CNN, adding that it's “an odd thing as it's basically saying the strategy isn't retail but to act as some kind of cryptocurrency investment vehicle.”
    


            Nevertheless, the crypto announcement helped juice the stock: GameStop (GME) shares soared 16% in premarket trading Wednesday.

Bitcoin remained steady above $87,000 in Asian afternoon hours Wednesday as traders continued to monitor U.S. data releases and how the levy of U.S. tariffs will play out starting April 2, with most in wait-and-watch mode.

Majors were little-changed in the past 24 hours as Solana's SOL, xrp (XRP), BNB Chain's BNB, and ether (ETH) rose under 3%, while memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) outperformed with a 5.5% jump.

That was the second-straight day for gains for DOGE, alongside continued bumps in pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), as a tendency among these tokens to act as a “beta bet” on ether's strength showed no signs of reverting.

Elsewhere, shiba inu (SHIB) zoomed 11%, buoyed by a rotation to riskier memes and a 228% jump in its native ShibaSwap exchange in the last 30 days. Open interest on SHIB-tracked futures has risen upward of 20% since Sunday, data shows, indicative of expectations of further volatility.

Concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown remain, however, while a rapid unwinding of momentum trades in equities has led to money managers retreating to full defensive mode, some day.

“We expect markets to continue their soft rebound from last week into month-end, with the next major catalyst being the 'liberation day' reciprocal tariff announcement from Trump scheduled for April 2nd,” Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Rumors of a softer tariff response will go a long way to recover some of the recent technical damage in US stocks, helping to spark a global rally along with the recent jump in EU/China stocks.”

“Crypto will remain a close proxy of equities in the foreseeable future as we don't see a unique catalyst in the meantime, though the recent M&A announcements with Coinbase/Kraken give us faith that the long-term bull market remains alive and well,” Fan added.

Meanwhile, traders at QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast that the upcoming quarter and April in particular, have historically been one of the best periods for risk assets, second only to the festive December rally.

“The S&P 500 has delivered an average annualized return of 19.6% in Q2, while Bitcoin has also recorded its second-best median performance during this stretch - again, trailing only Q4, QCP said, pointing out caution among options traders.

“Options markets remain cautious. Call skew hasn't meaningfully shifted toward calls, with call skew only emerging from June onwards, suggesting traders are waiting to see how the tariff situation develops,” they said, adding that attention is turning to the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data, which could become the “next key catalyst.”

The PCE index captures inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflects changes in consumer behavior.

Released monthly, the PCE is said to influence Fed interest rate decisions. High PCE readings signal rising inflation, potentially prompting rate hikes to cool the economy, which can reduce risk appetite and pressure bitcoin prices downward as investors favor safer assets. Conversely, low PCE data suggests tame inflation, possibly leading to rate cuts or steady policy, boosting liquidity and supporting Bitcoin's price as a speculative asset or inflation hedge.

The next release is on March 28 and could sway market sentiment, with bitcoin's reaction tied to how the data shapes Fed expectations — volatility often follows as traders adjust positions.

Bitcoin, the digital currency and virtual payment system, has grown increasingly popular in recent years. The top cryptocurrency token holders have made billions of dollars off the digital asset.

Getting into the crypto space can be simple or complicated, and creating your own coin is possible, but not everything has to be performed digitally. Physical tools like cryptocurrency ATMs are within reach nationwide.

Here's what to know about Bitcoin ATMs and how to locate them in Ohio.

Like traditional ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs are kiosks that allow you to purchase or sell crypto by using cash or your own credit/debit card. Also known as BTMs, you can cash out your Bitcoin at a Bitcoin ATM, according to the personal finance website Bankrate.

Unlike traditional banking methods, however, cash withdrawals are made through a QR code that the machine provides. You then send your Bitcoin via the QR code before receiving your cash minutes after.

Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that can be bought, sold, and mined. It acts as a form of payment that's not governed by a single entity, according to Investopedia. It's run on the Blockchain, a record-keeping system of computers that tracks crypto transactions.

Bitcoin has a limited supply, and because it's a decentralized system, it's not issued by central banks or authorities, USA TODAY reports. While known for its price volatility, some investors have become rich by investing in the coin at the right time.

Planning to use a Bitcoin ATM? The rise of BTMs doesn't come without risk, as Bitcoin ATM fraud is on the rise.

The Federal Trade Commission found that during the first six months of 2024 alone, consumers lost around $65 million to Bitcoin ATM kiosks; older adults over 60 were the most vulnerable. Scammers will impersonate a government official, tech support, or business and urge victims to remove cash out of their bank accounts and instead deposit it into a Bitcoin ATM for added "protection."

The FTC notes that the scammers will give victims a QR code. Once scanned at the machine, their cash is deposited straight into the scammers' crypto account. The agency also cautions against clicking on suspicious links, responding to unexpected calls or messages, or swiftly moving funds if rushed.

"Don't believe anyone who says you need to use a Bitcoin ATM, buy gift cards, or move money to protect it or fix a problem. Real businesses and government agencies will never do that – and anyone who asks is a scammer," the FTC writes.

According to AARP, there are more than 49,000 crypto ATMs in the U.S., with over 100 Bitcoin ATMs in Ohio, including several kiosks located in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Akron.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $87,000 on Wednesday after recovering 4% in the last three days. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) find support around their key level, suggesting a recovery on the cards. Traders should keep an eye on Trump's upcoming “Liberation Day” on April 2, with significant tariff announcements, which could trigger increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market due to the potential impact of reciprocal tariffs.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $85,556 on Sunday and rose 4.45% until Monday. However, it hovered around the $87,000 level on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, BTC still hovers around $87,000.

If BTC finds support around its 200-day EMA, it could extend the recovery to retest the key psychological level of $90,000. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally toward its March 2 high of $95,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 51, above its neutral level of 50, indicating increasing bullish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to find support around its 200-day EMA and closes below $85,000, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $78,258.

Ethereum price retested and found support around its daily level of $1,861 for the last two weeks, and it recovered nearly 7% last week. ETH continued its recovery on Monday and closed above $2,081. However, it faced a mild decline on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $2,056.

If the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 39, facing rejection from its neutral level of 50 on Monday, indicating bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.



ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.

Ripple price broke above its 100-day EMA at $2.32 last week and recovered almost 7%. However, XRP consolidated around its $2.44 level in the last two days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $2.44.

If the 100-day EMA around $2.32 continues to hold, it could extend the recovery to retest its next resistance level at $2.72.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 52, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. The RSI must point upward and move above its neutral level of 50 to sustain the bullish momentum. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead.



XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP fails to find support around its 100-day EMA and closes below, it could extend an additional decline to test its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.
