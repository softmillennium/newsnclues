Donald Trump has said he is placing 25% tariffs on motor imports, a move the White House claims will foster domestic manufacturing but could also put a financial squeeze on car makers that depend on global supply chains.

“This will continue to spur growth,” the president told reporters. “We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff.”

The tariffs could be complicated as even US car makers source their components from around the world, meaning that they could face higher costs and lower sales. Shares in General Motors fell by about 3% in Wednesday afternoon trading. Ford's stock was up slightly, but shares in Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, dropped nearly 4%.

Mr Trump has long said that tariffs against car imports would be a defining policy of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would cause more production to relocate to the US.

But American and foreign firms with domestic plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles, meaning prices could increase and sales could decline as new factories take time to build.

“We are going to be doing automobiles, which you've known about for a long time,” Mr Trump said on Monday. “We'll be announcing that fairly soon, over the next few days probably.”

The tariffs are part of a broader reshaping of global relations by Mr Trump, who plans to impose what he calls “reciprocal” taxes on April 2 that would match the tariffs and sales taxes charged by other nations.

He has already placed a 20% tax on all imports from China for its role in the production of fentanyl. He similarly placed 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, with a lower 10% tax on Canadian energy products.

Parts of the Mexico and Canada tariffs have been suspended, including taxes on cars, after firms objected and Mr Trump responded by giving them a 30-day reprieve which is set to expire in April.

The president has also imposed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminium imports, removing the exemptions from his earlier 2018 taxes on the metals. He also plans tariffs on computer chips, pharmaceutical drugs, lumber and copper.

His taxes risk igniting a broader global trade war with escalating retaliations that could crush global trade, potentially damaging economic growth while raising prices for families and businesses as some of the costs of the taxes get passed along by importers.

When the European Union retaliated with plans for a 50% tariff on US spirits, Mr Trump responded by planning a 200% tax on alcoholic beverages from the EU.

He also intends to place a 25% tariff on countries that import oil from Venezuela, even though the US also imports oil from that nation.

Mr Trump's aides maintain that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico are about stopping illegal immigration and drug smuggling, but the administration also wants to use the tariff revenues to lower the budget deficit and assert America's pre-eminence as the world's largest economy.

The president on Monday cited plans by South Korean car maker Hyundai to build a 5.8 billion dollar (£4.5 billion) steel plant in Louisiana as evidence that tariffs will bring back manufacturing jobs.

Slightly more than a million people are employed domestically in the manufacturing of motor vehicles and parts, about 320,000 fewer than in 2000, according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics. Another 2.1 million people work at auto and parts dealerships.

The US last year imported nearly eight million cars and light trucks worth 244 billion dollars (£189 billion). Mexico, Japan and South Korea were the top sources of foreign vehicles.

Imports of car parts came to more than 197 billion dollars (£153 billion), led by Mexico, Canada and China, according to the Commerce Department.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — After three days of intense negotiations, the Trump administration, Ukraine and Russia agreed to a limited ceasefire in which the key details, including what was covered and how it will start, were disputed by the warring sides, indicating the road to a complete truce will be long and mired with contention.

The negotiations focused on easing Black Sea shipping and halting long-range strikes on energy infrastructure, relatively low-hanging fruit that both sides had experience in negotiating before the U.S. brokered indirect talks.

While much is yet unknown, here is a breakdown of the key elements of the partial ceasefire and what is at stake in the coming weeks as talks continue.

Conflicting statements emerged immediately after the talks on Tuesday. Both sides differed on the start time of halting strikes on energy sites and accused the other of violating the ceasefire. 

Russia also conditioned its part in opening Black Sea shipping on the U.S. lifting sanctions, which Kyiv dismissed.

Russian officials have greeted the results of the talks with optimism, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described it as a good start, though some Ukrainian officials have expressed discontent.

“Something tells me this is more advantageous for the enemy,” Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zheleznyak told the Interfax Ukraine news agency.




The U.S. said Tuesday it had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine and Russia to stop fighting and ensure safe navigation in the Black Sea in separate talks with the two sides.

Details of the deal were not released, including how or when it was to be implemented and monitored, but it appeared to mark another attempt to ensure safe Black Sea shipping after a 2022 agreement that was brokered by the U.N. and Turkey was halted by Russia one year later, in July 2023.

Russia said the Black Sea deal announced Tuesday could only be implemented after sanctions against the Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial institutions involved in food and fertilizer trade were lifted and their access to the SWIFT system of international payments was ensured.

Zelenskyy said Moscow was lying about the terms of the agreement, despite the U.S. later saying it would help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports.

While the benefits to Russia are clear, Ukrainian officials questioned how the Black Sea deal announced Tuesday would profit them. It isn't clear, for instance, if it would also halt attacks on Ukrainian ports.

“Personally, I don't think this will significantly boost our export capacity. Frankly speaking, thanks to Ukrainian naval drones, we have considerably expanded our capabilities in the Black Sea,” Ukrainian lawmaker Yaroslav Zhelezniak said. 

That's because Ukraine took matters into its own hands after Russia backed out of the grain deal in July 2023. It carved out a trade route requiring ships to sail near the coast lines of Bulgaria and Romania, guided by the Ukrainian Navy. At the same time, Ukrainian forces launched a campaign of sea drone attacks to further push back Russia's fleet. 

The new deal, Zhelezniak said, “unfortunately worsens our position in terms of influence in the Black Sea.” 

The ceasefire also included a halt to long-range strikes on energy infrastructure, but sharp difference emerged immediately after Tuesday's announcement over when the halt to fighting would begin.

Moscow said the ceasefire had started on March 18 and accused Kyiv of violating the terms by striking energy sites inside Russia, a charge that Ukraine's General Staff denied on Wednesday. 

The Kremlin later posted a list of the types of facilities covered by the limited ceasefire. 

It included refineries, oil and gas pipelines, oil storage facilities, including pump stations, power-generating and transmitting infrastructure, as well as power plants, substations, transformers, distribution switchgear, nuclear power plants and hydropower plant dams.

The fallout continues over a security breach in which high-ranking members of the Trump administration accidentally shared plans about a forthcoming U.S. military attack on Yemen with the top editor of the Atlantic magazine on the Signal messaging app.

Military and intelligence experts, along with some members of Congress, have expressed shock over the inadvertent leak, leading to questions about national security protocols and the use of unsecured channels for sensitive information.

President Trump and U.S. intelligence officials have tried to downplay the security risks, and insist no classified material was shared.

The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, revealed in an article published on Monday that he knew about U.S. airstrikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen hours before they happened, because he was added to a Signal group chat where members of the Trump administration appeared to be discussing such war plans.

Goldberg said he received a Signal connection request on March 11 from someone whom he believed to be Michael Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser. Two days later, Goldberg said he was added to a conversation with 18 members of the administration — including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard — where they talked about plans to bomb Yemen.

U.S. air and naval assets hit multiple Houthi targets in Yemen on March 15.

Goldberg said that he initially did not believe the Signal group chat was real. “I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans,” he wrote. "I have never seen a breach quite like this.

“It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal,” Goldberg added. “But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters — not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I've never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion."

Related from Yahoo News: What is Signal, anyway?

White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement that the message thread described by Goldberg “appears to be authentic” and that security council officials were “reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain.”

Trump first told reporters on Monday that he knew nothing about the incident. Then, in a phone interview with NBC News, the president said he stood by Waltz.

“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man," Trump said. The president suggested that a member of Waltz's staff accidentally added Goldberg to the group.

Speaking to reporters at the White House Tuesday, Trump disparaged Goldberg and the Atlantic, calling the editor a “total sleazebag” and the 167-year-old publication a “failed magazine.”

On Wednesday, White House reporters asked Trump which members of his administration bore responsibility for the chat.

“It was Mike, I guess, I don't know,” Trump responded.

When pressed on Hegseth's role in the scandal, the president did not seem fully briefed on the fact that his defense secretary had shared sensitive information on Signal.

“How do you bring Hegseth into it? He had nothing to do with it,” Trump said.

In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday night, Waltz said he takes “full responsibility" for the “embarrassing” security breach, and that he built the group chat himself.

“I take full responsibility. … I built the group,” Waltz said. “My job is to make sure everything's coordinated.”

But Waltz also said he doesn't know how Goldberg was added to the chat.

"I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy," Waltz said, adding that he had spoken to Elon Musk for help in finding out what happened.

Appearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Gabbard and Ratcliffe were grilled by Democrats over the breach, which they both sought to downplay

During a House Intelligence Committee hearing Wednesday, Gabbard acknowledged the inclusion of a Goldberg on the Signal chat was a “mistake,” but said no classified information was shared.

Speaking to reporters in Hawaii on Monday, Hegseth flatly denied sharing any sensitive military information.

“Nobody was texting war plans,” Hegseth said. “And that's all I have to say about that.”

He reiterated those comments on Tuesday.

“Nobody's texting war plans,” Hegseth said. “I know exactly what I'm doing.”

During a news conference in Kingston, Jamaica, on Wednesday, Rubio said he hoped "there'll be reforms and changes made so this never — it's not going to happen again. It can't."

“Obviously, someone made a mistake. Someone made a big mistake and added a journalist. Nothing against journalists, but you ain't supposed to be on that thing,” Rubio added.

In the article published Monday, Goldberg did not reveal details of the strike plans, saying the information “could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.”

But on Wednesday, the Atlantic published the full text thread from the Signal group under the headline: “Here Are the Attack Plans That Trump's Advisers Shared on Signal.”

“The statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump — combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts — have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions,” Goldberg and colleague Shane Harris explained.

The messages include specific details on the timing of launches by U.S. military jets that were to strike Houthi targets.

The Atlantic said that the thread it published was the entire text chain except for the name of a CIA officer that it withheld at the agency's request.

Current, former intelligence officials and Democratic lawmakers have expressed shock over the breach, wondering how members of the Trump administration would be discussing security plans on Signal in the first place.

"This Signal chat situation sheds light on a sloppy and grossly incompetent national security strategy from the Trump administration," said Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.

“Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined that they'd be this reckless and careless with our national security,” Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who was deputy to the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Biden administration, told NPR.

Price said he had spoken to former national security officials and colleagues involved in military planning, adding, “It's fair to say ... that heads are exploding.”

While most Republicans have avoided criticizing the administration over the breach, a few have spoken out.

Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday that the panel is calling for an independent investigation into the leak.

“Classified information should not be transmitted on unsecured channels — and certainly not to those without security clearances, including reporters. Period,” Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican from New York, wrote on X. “Safeguards must be put in place to ensure this never happens again.”

Israeli PM warns of seizure of territories and ‘other measures' if Hamas refuses to release remaining hostages

Benjamin Netanyahu has repeated Israeli threats to seize territory in Gaza if Hamas refuses to release the remaining Israeli hostages, as, for the second consecutive day, hundreds of Palestinians joined protests against the militant group and demanding the end of the war.

The Israeli prime minister's warning came a week after Israel resumed its military operation in the territory, shattering the relative calm of a January ceasefire with Hamas.

“The more Hamas continues in its refusal to release our hostages, the more powerful the repression we exert will be,” Netanyahu told a hearing in parliament, which was occasionally interrupted by shouting from opposition members.

He added: “I say this to my colleagues in the Knesset, and I say it to Hamas as well: this includes the seizure of territories, along with other measures I will not elaborate here.”

Hamas warned on Wednesday that hostages may be killed if Israel attempts to use its military to retrieve them. “Every time the occupation attempts to retrieve its captives by force, it ends up bringing them back in coffins,” the group said in a statement.

Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas's attack on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war, 58 are still held in Gaza, including 34 that the Israeli military says are dead.

For the second consecutive day, hundreds of Palestinians have joined protests in northern Gaza, shouting anti-Hamas slogans and calling for an end to the war with Israel, in a rare display of public anger against the militant group.

On Tuesday, videos and photographs shared on social media, which appeared to be authentic, showed hundreds of people, mostly men, chanting: “Hamas out” and: “Hamas terrorists” in Beit Lahiya.

Some protesters were seen carrying banners emblazoned with slogans including: “Stop the war” and: “We want to live in peace”. At least one appeal to join the protest was circulating on the social media network Telegram.

“I don't know who organised the protest,” one man told Agence France-Press. “I took part to send a message on behalf of the people: enough with the war.” He said he had seen “members of the Hamas security forces in civilian clothing breaking up the protest”.

A statement released by family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's offensive and its tightened blockade. They also said the community fully supported armed resistance against Israel and rejected “any attempt to exploit legitimate popular demands by a fifth column”, apparently referring to opponents of Hamas.

In a separate development on Wednesday, at least nine Palestinians were killed by two separate Israeli airstrikes in central Gaza, medics said.

One strike hit a group of Palestinians gathered outside a charity providing hot meals in the Nuseirat refugee camp. At least five people, including a woman and her adult daughter, were killed by the strike, according to the al-Awda hospital, which received the casualties.

The resumption of Israeli military operations in the Gaza Strip had displaced 142,000 people in seven days, the UN said on Wednesday, warning of dwindling stocks of humanitarian aid.

“In just one week, 142,000 people have been displaced,” the spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said, adding that about 90% of Gaza's population had been displaced at least once between the start of the war on 7 October 2023 and January of this year.

There has been no sign that Israel will open entry points to allow essential aid to flow or ease its new offensive.

The Gaza health ministry said more than 50,000 Palestinians had been killed in Gaza and another 113,408 wounded since the beginning of the war.

Leo Brent Bozell III, founder of a conservative media group, is president's nomination amid rising diplomatic tensions

Donald Trump has nominated a conservative, pro-Israel media activist as US ambassador to South Africa, at a time when the relationship between the two countries is at a nadir.

Leo Brent Bozell III founded the Media Research Center – whose website states it is “a blog site designed to broadcast conservative values, culture, and politics [and] to expose liberal media bias” – in 1987.

His son Leo Brent Bozell IV was sentenced to 45 months in prison in May 2024 for assaulting police and smashing windows in the 6 January 2021 Capitol riots. He was released in January as part of Trump's mass pardon.

The 69-year-old's nomination, which needs to be confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate, comes after South Africa's ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelled earlier this month, and amid US claims that South Africa is discriminating against its white minority.

Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, had called Rasool “a race-baiting politician who hates America” after Rasool told a thinktank that Trump's Maga movement was partly a response to “a supremacist instinct”.

In February, Trump signed an executive order cutting aid to South Africa, accusing it of racial discrimination against white Afrikaners, who ruled the country during apartheid. The order also offered them refugee resettlement.

South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, told reporters on Tuesday he would appoint a “top-class” replacement for Rasool. He added that US funding cuts were “entirely within their own right … and in many ways a wake-up call … [to be] more self-reliant.”

The US-South Africa relationship had worsened under the previous US president, Joe Biden, after South Africa refused to take sides when Russia invaded Ukraine. In 2023, the then US ambassador, Reuben Brigety, accused South Africa of supplying Russia with arms.

Things soured further when South Africa brought a case accusing Israel, a US ally, of genocide in Gaza at the international court of justice. The UN court ordered Israel to take measures to prevent potential acts of genocide. Israel, which reacted furiously to the allegations, has until July to answer South Africa's case.

However, Trump's overturning of norms and spreading of misinformation about South Africa has catapulted the relationship into new territory.

“There is just an absolute disagreement on the way in which Ramaphosa and Trump see the world,” said Ziyanda Stuurman, an independent political risk analyst.

Trump's executive order criticised South Africa for its case against Israel.

It also claimed that a law signed in January allowing land to be expropriated with “nil compensation” in limited circumstances enabled South Africa to “seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property”. The South African government has said that the US has similar laws allowing the government to take over land for public purposes.

Conservative Afrikaner groups that have the ear of Trump allies have promoted conspiracy theories of a “white genocide” in South Africa.

Meanwhile, land and wealth remain concentrated among white South Africans, who make up 7% of the population (about half Afrikaans), while black people represent 81%.

“How do you respond when it seems like the main motivation for the breakdown of the relationship is based on a complete and utter untruth, ie that whites are being treated badly,” said Melanie Verwoerd, a former ambassador to Ireland and MP for the African National Congress, the former liberation movement that has led all South African governments since the end of white minority rule.

South Africa's history of successful negotiations to end apartheid, in which Ramaphosa led the ANC delegation, were cause for hope in improving relations, though, she said.

Some analysts suggest South Africa could build bridges through Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire who is leading Trump's bid to slash the size of the US government. Musk has been increasingly critical of South Africa, with Trump echoing some of his statements.

Musk, who wants to expand his satellite internet business Starlink globally, has repeatedly railed against a requirement that telecoms investors cede 30% of equity in their South African subsidiary to black owners.

On Monday, Musk posted on X: “The legacy media never mentions white genocide in South Africa.”

Last week, he criticised the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party for singing the controversial Kill the Boers song at political rallies. A South African court ruled in 2022 that the song was not meant to be taken literally.

Dropping the equity condition could be part of a “pragmatic” deal that doesn't compromise sovereignty, said Ronak Gopaldas, a director at risk consultancy Signal Risk: “I would focus on the commercial rather than the moral aspects.”

Rescue mission off Lost Coast Trail required US Coast Guard, fire department, helicopter team and swimmers

Two hikers were rescued from California's rugged and remote north coast over the weekend after one of them slid more than 100ft (30 metres) down a steep cliff and was clinging to a “near vertical” bluff with hiking poles, authorities said.

The Shelter Cove fire department and a US Coast Guard team responded to a call on Saturday afternoon for a hiker stranded on a cliff near the Lost Coast Trail, which traces more than 50 miles (80km) of the wild and undeveloped coast in far northern California, in the King Range national conservation area. The difficult terrain and conditions required a “highly technical” rescue operation that included a boat, jet ski and several rescue swimmers as well as a helicopter team, the agencies said.

The two hikers were off trail, along a deer or game trail, on Saturday when one of them fell more than 100ft, causing injuries that left him unable to move and preventing rescuers from accessing him by land, according to the Shelter Cove fire department. He was “barely holding on” roughly 60ft above another unstable cliff, the US Coast Guard sector in Humboldt Bay said in a statement.

Because of the rugged terrain and history of rescues in the area, the fire department had requested assistance from the Coast Guard in Humboldt Bay. The Coast Guard team used a 160ft hoist to evacuate the stranded hiker, who was bleeding and had a dislocated shoulder, and transported them to a nearby airport where emergency response workers were waiting. They then returned to the hillside to rescue the uninjured hiker. The rescues “required intense crew coordination due to the loose cliffside, dead trees, and limited power”, the Coast Guard said.

The helicopter had just 15 minutes left of fuel, the Coast Guard statement said, and waited at a nearby airport until a Cal Fire truck brought additional fuel.

The response to the incident required significant resources, the Shelter Cove fire department said. The agency urged would-be Lost Coast hikers to stay on marked trails, and to be prepared for delays. Experts say hikers should not attempt the challenging coastal trail – sections of which are inaccessible during high tide – without experience.

“This rescue required the coordinated efforts of six different agencies, utilizing millions of dollars of specialized equipment and extensive training to ensure a safe and professional outcome,” the fire department said in its statement, praising the 20 rescuers, most of whom are volunteers, for their work.

Federal authorities have detained an international student studying at Tufts University near Boston and have revoked their visa, the university said in a statement Tuesday night.

Tufts said the graduate student was taken into US custody from an off-campus apartment building in Somerville, Massachusetts and that it had no further details about the incident or the circumstances surrounding the student's status.

Representatives for the US Department of Homeland Security, US Customs and Border Protection and the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement could not be immediately reached for comment on the university's statement.

A lawyer representing the student could also not be immediately reached.

The detention is the latest move by Republican US President Donald Trump's administration targeting international students as it seeks to crack down on immigration, including ramping up immigration arrests and sharply restricting border crossings.

Trump and his top diplomat Marco Rubio in particular have pledged to deport foreign pro-Palestinian protesters, accusing them of supporting Hamas operatives, posing hurdles for US foreign policy and being antisemitic.

At Columbia University, student protester and lawful permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil was arrested this month. He is legally challenging his detention after Trump, without evidence, accused him of supporting Hamas, which Khalil denies.

Federal immigration officials are also seeking to detain a Korean American Columbia University student, who is a legal permanent US resident and has participated in pro-Palestinian protests, a move blocked by the courts for now.

Earlier this month, a Lebanese doctor and assistant professor at Brown University in Rhode Island was denied re-entry to the US and deported to Lebanon after Trump's administration alleged her phone contained photos "sympathetic" to Hezbollah. Dr. Rasha Alawieh said she does not support the operative group but held regard for its leader, who's now dead, because of her religion.

Trump's administration has also targeted students at Cornell University in New York and Georgetown University in Washington.

Elon Musk sent a strange warning to Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters after she recommended that First Lady Melania Trump should be investigated and potentially deported from the US.

Musk attacked Waters after a clip of her addressing a rally against the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in Los Angeles, California, went viral on social media.

Musk reacted to one of the viral videos of Walters on X. “At some point, the many crimes of Maxine Waters will catch up to her,” he stated.

Maxine Waters issues empty threat to Melania TrumpWalter's video, which was shared by Fox News commentator Sean Hannity on Tuesday and “End Wokeness” on X features Waters issuing a message for President Donald Trump, "If he wants to start looking so closely to find those who were born here and their parents were undocumented, maybe he ought to first look at Melania.” Continuing her tirade against the First Lady, she said that nobody knows if her parents were documented or not, adding that “maybe we better just take a look.” Waters was alluding to the executive order that Trump signed on his first day of office, which outlaws birthright citizenship.

After top US officials denied the release of war plans, including President Donald Trump, The Atlantic shared the full text of all chats on a Signal group, where plans to attack Houthis in Yemen on March 15 were being discussed.

The confidential information was first shared on an unclassified Signal group chat, including defence secretary Pete Hegseth, vice president JD Vance, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe, and more. However, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeff Goldberg was accidentally added to the chatroom two hours before the strikes, giving him access to the plans.

In response to the journalist being added to the group chat, Trump said the lapse was not “a serious one.”

The Atlantic magazine has published new messages from the Houthi strike chat between key Trump officials that its editor-in-chief was mistakenly added to. Follow the latest here - and listen to the Trump 100 podcast as you scroll.

Watch live as US vice president JD Vance visits Marine Corps Base Quantico.

The vice president is expected to deliver remarks which could touch on the security breach that has dominated US news this week.

Watch live in the stream at the top of the page - and we'll bring you the latest here too.

Asked on who was looking into the security breach, Karoline Leavitt said Elon Musk's team would be helping out as well.

She said: "The National Security council, the White House council office and also yes, Elon Musk's team [will look into it]. 

"Elon has offered to put his technical experts on this to figure out how this number was added to the chat to take responsibility and ensure this never happens again."

The White House press briefing has ended now, lasting about 20 minutes - shorter than usual.

For context:

Trump officials have repeatedly avoided committing to an official investigation.

They've instead said that it is being looked into.

But it isn't clear if there would be repercussions or the publication of any findings from such an inquiry.

The US government has made transparency a key part of its administration in DOGE.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt is now facing questions from reporters.

The second reporter to ask questions raised questions over what is, or isn't, classified information.

Leavitt doubles down on claiming the chat did not contain any classified information.

"I would characterise this as a policy discussion, a sensitive policy discussion," she said instead.

She is pressed by several reporters on how the sharing of the timings of attacks and weapons used could not be defined as classified, she struggles to put together an answer.

In a scattergun attempt to evade the question, she tries to discredit the journalist, lists other types of classified information that wasn't in the chat, tries to divert attention to the defence secretary's service in the military, and attacks the previous administration. even going so far as to raise its withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Signal is an "approved" app, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, during the ongoing briefing.

"This is an approved app. This is an encrypted app ... this is the most secure and efficient way to communicate," she said.

Leavitt added that Donald Trump had placed "great trust" in his national security team.

For context:

We reported earlier today on much of what was coming out of the Intelligence Committee in Congress.

National Security Agency (NSA) director General Timothy Haugh spoke during it about risks associated with Signal.

Under questioning from Democratic representative Jason Crow, Haugh said an advisory on how to use Signal was sent to NSA employees.

"Because there's risk to that app?" Crow asked.

To which Haugh responded: "There are."

Karoline Leavitt is speaking now in a press briefing.

She has immediately gone on the attack, personally going after The Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, as well as the Democrats and what she claimed, without evidence, were its "allies in the media".

"The mainstream media continues to be focused on a sensationalised story."

She also detailed specifics of the Houthi attack that she said people should be more focused on.

"Several Houthi leaders were killed," Leavitt said.

Even for a punchy spokesperson, Leavitt isn't holding back, describing the Biden administration as "pathetic". 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt is holding a briefing now after the new revelations in Signalgate today.

Watch live in the stream at the top of the page - and we'll bring you the latest here too.

The encrypted messaging platform Signal has been at the centre of the furore in Washington.

A competitor to the likes of Meta's WhatsApp, it has found itself a key part of a US national security row.

National Security Agency (NSA) director General Timothy Haugh spoke about risks associated with the platform during the Intelligence Committee hearing earlier today.

Under questioning from Democratic representative Jason Crow, Haugh said an advisory on how to use Signal was sent to NSA employees.

"We put out an advisory on how to use the Signal app and other encrypted applications, because we do encourage our employees and their families to use encrypted apps," he said.

"Because there's risk to that app?" Crow asked.

To which Haugh responded: "There are."

Some reporting to bring you from across the pond now.

The information shared by defence secretary Pete Hegseth on the Signal chat was highly classified at the time he wrote it, according to CNN.

It cited a US defence official familiar with the operation and another source briefed on it afterward.

"These are operational plans that are highly classified in order to protect the service members," the defence official reportedly said.

Experts previously told Sky News there was a chance that the White House had retroactively declassified the information on the group to stand up its defence that nothing classified was shared on Signal.

Intelligence director Tulsi Gabbard is answering questions in congress.

She said yesterday she was not aware of any discussion relating to weapons packages, targets or timings shared on the Signal group chat.

Congressional representatives haven't taken well to it today after The Atlantic published messages revealing specifics on weapons packages and timings.

Asked if she stood by her comments, Gabbard said the second Atlantic story was a "refresher".

She also admitted the inclusion of a reporter in the Signal chat was a "mistake".

"It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added," she added.

White House attack line

Gabbard repeated a previous phrase Mike Waltz used in his response to the story - perhaps showing an agreed White House line.

"There were no sources, methods or locations [shared]," she said.

Republican Greg Steube also repeated this phrase in questioning.

Pete Hegseth has issued a response to the latest Atlantic article.

"So, let's me get this straight [sic]. The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods. And no classified information. 

"Those are some really s****y war plans. 

"This only proves one thing: Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an 'attack plan' (as he now calls it)."

Does his defence hold up? Here's his Signal message...

A reminder that the article quoted Hegseth as posting operational details of the plan, including weapon packages, targets and timing.

He texted: "1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package)".

"1345: 'Trigger Based' F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME - also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)".

Further texts by the Pentagon chief followed, the magazine reported: "1410: More F-18s LAUNCH (2nd strike package)".

"1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier 'Trigger Based' targets)".

He also posted: "1536 F-18 2nd Strike Starts - also, first sea-based Tomahawks launched". And then: "MORE TO FOLLOW (per timeline)".

        The Democrats have increased their calls for US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth to resign for sending Yemen war plans via a messaging app.
    

A national security scandal involving senior US intelligence and defence officials has intensified with the release of screenshots showing Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing detailed information about airstrikes in Yemen via a messaging app.

The Pentagon leader used a group chat on Signal to communicate with other top Trump administration figures about imminent airstrikes against the Iran-backed Houthis on 15 March this year. 

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, revealed the existence of the chat on Monday, explaining that he had mistakenly been added to the group by Michael Waltz, the US national security adviser. 

Since Goldberg's bombshell piece was published, Democrats have called for Hegseth  and Waltz to resign over what they have called a serious intelligence breach, while the Trump administration has sought to limit the fallout. 

After Trump and his allies insisted that no classified information had been shared in the group, the Atlantic decided to publish a longer transcript of the conversation on Wednesday along with screenshots from the group chat.

In the course of the discussion, Hegseth lists the precise timings of US military operations against the Houthis mere hours before they are due to take place. He also details the weapons and aircraft that will be used. 

In response to the latest revelations, Democrats have ramped up their demands for Hegseth to step down. 

Andy Kim, a Democratic senator from New Jersey, posted on X: “This new signal chat is shocking. Clearly incredibly sensitive and classified information.” 

“As someone who worked in the Situation Room before, I cannot believe Hegseth would recklessly text info that could put a target on our pilots and service members. He needs to resign,” Kim wrote. 

Jim Himes, a Democratic congressman representing Connecticut, thought it was lucky that the US' enemies had not intercepted the messages and handed them to the Houthis. 

“It's by the awesome grace of god that we are not mourning dead pilots right now,” he said. 

During an appearance before the House intelligence committee on Wednesday, Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence, continued to insist that the country's national security had not been endangered.

“There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,” she said.

Hegseth, who is currently on a tour of the Indo-Pacific, has denied revealing “war plans”. 

Analysts have questioned why Hegseth and his colleagues were using Signal, an encrypted messaging app that cannot be used on secure government devices, to exchange such sensitive information. 

One day before the 15 March strikes against the Houthis, the defence department warned its staff about the vulnerability of Signal, saying Russia was trying to hack the app, according to an anonymous US official. 

The US government has been targeting the Iran-backed group in Yemen over its attacks against ships in the Red Sea.

Thousands of Palestinians have marched between the wreckage of a heavily destroyed town in northern Gaza in the second day of anti-war protests, with many chanting against Hamas in a rare display of public anger against the militant group.

The protests, which centred mainly on Gaza's north, appeared to be aimed generally against the war, with protesters calling for an end to 17 months of deadly fighting with Israel.

But the public calls against Hamas, which has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory months into the war with Israel, were rare.

In the town of Beit Lahiya, where a similar protest took place on Tuesday, about 3,000 people demonstrated, with many chanting “the people want the fall of Hamas”.

In the hard-hit Shijaiyah neighbourhood of Gaza City, dozens of men chanted: “Out, out, out! Hamas get out!”

“Our children have been killed. Our houses have been destroyed,” said Abed Radwan, who said he joined the protest in Beit Lahiya “against the war, against Hamas, and the (Palestinian political) factions, against Israel and against the world's silence”.

Ammar Hassan, who took part in a protest on Tuesday, said it started as an anti-war protest with a few dozen people but swelled to more than 2,000, with people chanting against Hamas.

“It's the only party we can affect,” he said. “Protests won't stop the (Israeli) occupation, but it can affect Hamas.”

The militant group has violently cracked down on previous protests. This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed its war.

Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said people have the right to protest but their focus should be on the “criminal aggressor”, Israel.

Family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's renewed offensive and its tightened blockade on all supplies into Gaza. Their statement said the community fully supports armed resistance against Israel.

“The protest was not about politics. It was about people's lives,” said Mohammed Abu Saker, a father of three from the nearby town of Beit Hanoun, who joined a demonstration on Tuesday.

“We want to stop the killing and displacement, no matter the price. We can't stop Israel from killing us, but we can press Hamas to give concessions,” he said.

A similar protest occurred in the heavily destroyed area of Jabaliya on Tuesday, according to witnesses.

One protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution, said they joined the demonstration because “everyone failed us”.

They said they chanted against Israel, Hamas, the western-backed Palestinian Authority and Arab mediators. They said there were no Hamas security forces at the protest but scuffles broke out between supporters and opponents of the group.

Later, they said they regretted participating because of Israeli media coverage, which emphasised the opposition to Hamas.

Israeli defense minister Israel Katz urged Palestinians to join the protests, saying: “You too should demand the removal of Hamas from Gaza and the immediate release of all Israeli hostages. That is the only way to stop the war.”

A 19-year-old Palestinian, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said he planned to join demonstrations on Wednesday.

“People are angry at the whole world,” including the United States, Israel and Hamas, he said. “We want Hamas to resolve this situation, return the hostages and end this whole thing.”

The protests erupted a week after Israel ended its ceasefire with Hamas by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people. Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly two million Palestinians.

Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds — 24 of them believed to be alive. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Israel's controversial plan to relocate the people of Gaza abroad – a proposal supported by US President Donald Trump but widely condemned by the international community – has left the lives of millions hanging in the balance. Hailed as an “opportunity for renewal” by its proponents and labeled “ethnic cleansing” by critics, the plan aims to empty the war-torn enclave, offering those leaving a chance to rebuild their lives abroad. 

However, with Arab and African nations firmly closing their doors, and Gazans themselves torn between despair and defiance, the question remains: Is this truly a route to stability, or merely another chapter of displacement and uncertainty?

Israel remains committed to relocating Gazans. Earlier this week, the Political-Security Cabinet approved Defense Minister Israel Katz's proposal to establish a voluntary transitional administration for residents willing to move to third-party nations, aligning with President Trump's vision.

Initially announced in February at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the initiative proposes relocating nearly two million Gazans to various countries, away from the now devastated territory described as a “demolition site.” Abroad, Palestinians would supposedly gain opportunities previously unavailable to them.

Meanwhile, Hamas – the governing authority in Gaza – would be disarmed and dismantled, allowing reconstruction efforts to turn the Strip into a Middle Eastern riviera.

The proposal quickly drew widespread condemnation. The United Nations characterized the plan as “ethnic cleansing,” underscoring that forced displacement violates international law. Several Arab nations denounced the proposal as an “injustice” impossible to support. European countries labeled it “unacceptable,” and Hamas dismissed it as “ridiculous and absurd,” with spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warning it could ignite regional tensions.

Inside Gaza, criticism is similarly fierce.

“This is a ridiculous proposal without value,” said Asmaa Wael, a teacher from Gaza сity. “We rightfully own this land and deserve to live here with dignity. We were born here, grew up here, and faced every obstacle and injustice, oppression, and war. We've endured tremendous pressure, and we won't abandon our home.”

The problem is that Gaza, a 140-square-mile territory along the Mediterranean coast, has been completely destroyed. 

Since the war began in October 2023, nearly 70 percent of Gaza's infrastructure has been destroyed. Over 170,000 homes, 200 government buildings, 136 schools, 823 mosques, and numerous hospitals have been bombed.

The human toll is immense, with over 50,000 killed, according to official Hamas statistics. More than 113,000 have been injured, and 1.8 million urgently need shelter.

Asmaa realises that the Palestinian people have no other choice but to live on “the streets and in tents”. But she says that her people have enough patience to pull through.

Asmaa is far from being alone. Other Palestinians we have spoken to but who preferred to remain anonymous said they would rather stay on their land simply because they doubted the outside world would have anything better to offer them. Others were scared their departure would have a bad impact on their extended family that would remain; and there were also those who were afraid they would never be able to go back.

But not everyone shared that pessimism. Omar Abd Rabou, a young journalist based in Gaza, views the Trump proposal as “an opportunity for renewal and reconsideration of the Palestinians' futures.” He believes that relocation “may provide those who wish to change their environment with access to new resources and better opportunities”. It would give people, he reasoned, a personal and economic growth.

Some have already taken that path. According to Israel's channel 12, 35,000 Gazans have left the Strip since October, 2023. In March alone, a thousand Gazans have evacuated themselves, with 600 new applicants on their way out. And Israel believes their numbers will only be going up.

Many of those who left so far are Palestinians with foreign passports, or those who have residence or relatives abroad. Those, who stayed, have nowhere to go but Israel and the US are actively looking for volunteers, who would be willing to absorb the masses.

Yet no countries have stepped forward. Jordan, despite agreeing to accept 2,000 sick children and their families, rejected broader displacement plans. Egypt's President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi canceled a planned visit to Washington, fearing US pressure to accept Gazans – an action he refuses.

African nations, including Sudan, Somaliland, and Somalia, have also been approached. Sudan was offered military and reconstruction aid, Somaliland international recognition as an independent state, while Somalia denied any talks had occurred. 

Negotiations remain stalled, despite the US pressure suggesting Egypt's military aid could be at risk if Cairo refuses to accept half a million Gazans – a scenario Egypt is unlikely to accept given its own economic challenges.

In recent years, Egypt has faced significant economic difficulties. In 2024, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) downgraded Egypt's GDP growth forecast to 3.6%, a reduction from the previous projection of 4.1%. Similarly, forecasts for 2025-2026 were adjusted downward from 5.1% to 4.1%. Accepting half a million additional residents on top of its current population of 117 million is thus not feasible.

Egypt's hesitations extend beyond economic concerns. Cairo has long battled terrorism linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and fears radical elements disguised as civilians could infiltrate, threatening national security.

To Asmaa, the reluctance of neighboring Arab countries borders on betrayal.

“Arabs are fearful and incapable of taking meaningful action,” she laments. “They're preoccupied with oil, agreements, and business deals. Our children are slaughtered in their infancy, and these countries respond with empty slogans because they're not the ones suffering.”

Asmaa believes the solution will not come from Gaza's neighbours. The resolution will only be achieved, she believes, if the war ends and with it Israel's occupation. 

But for Omar, the situation is not black and white. Unlike many in the Strip, who have taken a rather militant approach towards Israel, especially after October 7, Omar is speaking about co-existence and about solving the conflict through diplomatic means. 

“Resolving this conflict does not require escalation but rather a constructive dialogue. There must be room for negotiation that ensures security and rights, away from the use of force or continued escalation,” he reasoned.

Yet, with the resumption of hostilities on March 17, and the ground incursion that followed shortly after, the prospect of peace seems nowhere in sight.

Palestinians chanted against Hamas during an anti-war protest in northern Gaza Strip on Wednesday, videos showed. Wednesday's protest comes after similar ones the day before, marking a rare show of public anger against the militant group that has long repressed dissent and still rules the territory 17 months into the war with Israel.

Watch: White House says there were 'certainly no war plans discussed' in group text

Edited by Brandon Livesay, with Bernd Debusmann reporting from White House

The BBC's North America editor Sarah Smith has spoken with The Atlantic's editor Jeffrey Goldberg to find out what the reactions have been since he reported that Trump administration officials accidentally invited him to a Signal group chat. 

Today, the White House has vigorously defended the group chat, saying no war plans were shared and no classified information was texted. 

Goldberg tells the BBC the text messages seem like "sensitive, war-planning information to me".

"This is why we put the all the information on our website, just so people can read themselves and make up their own minds," Goldberg says.

Goldberg says the Trump administration is more interested in blaming reporters than "actually acknowledging that they have a massive national security breach, and that they should just go fix it". 

"I mean, that's, that's the point," he says. "That's the point about leadership. Leadership, you deal with your mistakes, try to make things better, move on. But that's not the playbook here."

The Signal chat leak "doesn't bother me", Trump tells reporters in the Oval Office.

The president goes on to suggest that Signal may be a "defective" platform and "isn't very good". 

"Everybody uses signal, but it could be a defective platform, and we're gonna have to find that answer," Trump says

He offers no evidence as to why he thinks the Signal app could be defective.

For context, Signal is the publicly available messaging app that was used by top US officials to discuss military strikes on Houthis. Trump's national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently invited a journalist to that group chat.

President Trump is asked who was responsible for the Signal leak.

"Mike Waltz, I guess he claimed responsibly," Trump says about his National Security Advisor. "I was told it was Mike."

He adds that Waltz "took responsibility" and that no other of his officials are responsible. 

"Hegseth is doing a great job. He had nothing to do with this."

Trump also speaks about the success of the military strike on Houthi targets, saying it was "beyond our wildest expectations".

He says the strikes will continue "for a long time".

Asked about the Signal scandal, Trump claims it is a "witch hunt" that is being overhyped by the media.

He goes on to says he had "nothing to do with it" and "wasn't there", and that the US campaign against Yemen's Houthis is going well.

When asked if there was classified information sent in the Signal chat, he says "I don't know," but he has "heard" that there wasn't. "I really don't know," he says.

"You'll have to ask the various people involved." 

President Trump has just announced new tariff measures at an event inside the Oval Office. 

He's now taking questions from reporters and we're expecting one or two about the Signal scandal.

You can follow all the action by pressing Watch live at the of the page.

We're expecting to hear from US President Donald Trump later today.

He is scheduled to speak in the Oval Office about tariffs, but he usually takes questions from reporters - so expect the president to be asked about the Signal chat group scandal.

Trump has previously said that nothing in the chat could have "compromised" the attack plans in Yemen, though he did admit a member of his team may have "screwed up".

The president yesterday said "there was no classified information, as I understand it" in the messages. 

Earlier today White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt re-iterated that stance.

The leader of the Republican majority in the Senate has said that those involved in the Signal chat affair had made a mistake and should own up to it.

“The important thing here is these guys, they made a mistake, they know it. They should own it and fix it so that never happens again,” John Thune told CNN.

When asked whether Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth should resign, the majority leader avoided answering and said that the strikes on the Houthis alluded to in the chat seemed to have been "pretty flawless".

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, and other members of the Trump administration, have spent a lot of time today talking about what the Signal group chat text messages were not. 

They weren't “war plans”, they didn't include a detailed list of targets or specific military units, they didn't contain detailed flight paths or routes, and they didn't reveal intelligence sources of methods.

Trump officials have tended to avoid discussion of what was actually in those messages – including timings of the strikes, military assets used and post-strike damage reports – and whether sharing those details through a commercial messaging service put American national security at risk.

For an administration that regularly touts how it is restoring “common sense” to government, such misdirection and semantic wordplay may seem decidedly out of step with reality. 

As the political pressure continues, the administration's ability to hold this line will be tested.

Top of the news agenda today is the release of the full Signal group chat, which the US administration has repeatedly said did not include any classified information. 

The new information includes a thread of messages apparently written by defence secretary Pete Hegseth, where he tells officials - and inadvertently The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg - specific timings of US strikes in Yemen.

A month before the breach of Signal group chat of high-level US officials was revealed, the National Security Agency (NSA) sent out an operational security special memo to its employees to caution them about using the encrypted messaging application, the BBC's US partner CBS News reports, citing internal NSA documents.

"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application," the agency said in February. "The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information."

The memo warned that Russian hackers were using phishing scams to get access to conversations on the application and bypassing encryption.

The agency also said that the application - as well as WhatsApp - were permitted for unclassified uses but not for communicating about more sensitive information, CBS reports.

Since the messages were first released there's been a distinct partisan divide in the reaction from lawmakers:

Democratic Senator Mark Kelly said "this is what happens when you put unqualified people in important jobs where lives are on the line," while Senator Ruben Gallego said "the incompetence and cover-up is embarrassing".

Some, including Gallego, have called for Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi pushed this message while displaying larger print-out screenshots of the messages during a hearing of the House Intelligence Committee earlier today.

Republicans, meanwhile, have by and large defended their colleauges.

President Donald Trump has insisted that none of the information was classified, and "there was nothing in there that compromised" the operation - something reiterated by his press secretary earlier today.

House Speaker Mike Johnson said the administration has "acknowledged it was a mistake" to add the journalist to the chat, but "no one was jeopardised because of it". That was echoed by Senator Ted Cruz who called it a "screw up" but that the Trump administration "took responsibility" for it.

However one top Republican is among those calling for an official probe into the incident - Senator Roger Wicker said based on his knowledge, "I would have wanted it classified".

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio with Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness earlier

Secretary of State Marco Rubio just spoke to media in Jamaica, where he is on a state visit.

He's asked about the Signal scandal and says it's obvious that "someone made a big mistake and added a journalist". 

"Nothing against journalists, but you ain't supposed to be on that thing," he says.

Rubio downplays his role in the Signal chat group, saying he messaged to identify his point of contact, and then messaged again after the strikes were carried out to offer his congratulations.

He says the information shared on Signal wasn't intended to be made public, but says the Pentagon has said none of the information threatened the lives of service members.

Anthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent

Karoline Leavitt, in her recently concluded White House press conference, presented the American public with a choice. 

Who did they believe in the group-chat controversy? Jeffrey Goldberg, whom she characterised as an “anti-Trump sensationalist reporter", or Pete Hegseth, the Senate-confirmed secretary of defence who “honourably served our nation in uniform”.

That's the kind of framing that's a red meat appeal to Donald Trump's base. The administration's strategy for handling this crisis is to trust that Trump's loyal supporters - and the Republican politicians they help elect - will stick with the president. 

Such faith has carried Trump through more formidable situations than this, and White House officials seem to believe that it will do so again.

There are risks to this strategy, however. While the base may keep Trump afloat, Republicans need more than their core supporters to win elections – such as state races later this year and in the 2026 congressional mid-terms. 

Undecided middle-of-the-road Americans may look at the details of the text messages and be less willing trust that Hegseth is honestly assessing whether his own actions put national security at risk. 

And trust, once eroded, is difficult to win back.

Pete Hegseth reaffirms there was 'no classified information' in Signal chat

Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has again denied sending war plans in the Signal chat group.

Speaking to reporters from an air strip in Hawaii, Hegseth says the information in the messages released today "doesn't look like war plans".

"They know it's not war plans", he says, "there's no units, no locations, no routes, no flight paths, no sources, no methods, no classified information".

His job, Hegseth adds "is to provide updates in real time... that's what I did".

The messages from Hegseth, which were shared by The Atlantic, noted what time F-18 fighter aircraft were scheduled to launch, as well as when strikes would take place and in what time frame "trigger-based" attacks could occur.

Mike Waltz criticised Joe Biden's team for email-related security conduct in the past

By Jake Horton

Several of the Trump officials apparently included in the Signal chat have previously criticised other people for their handling of classified information.

In June 2023, Trump's National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who appears to have added the Atlantic journalist to the chat - criticised President Biden's National Security Adviser, external for sending "top secret emails" to a private account.

In January 2023, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth, who was a Fox News host at the time, criticised Biden as "nefarious, sloppy and dumb" after classified documents were found in his garage.

Talking about the same incident, Trump's Secretary of State Marco Rubio said: "Any time documents have been removed from their proper setting it's a problem, I don't care who did it."

And earlier this month US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, when posting about government leaks, external, said that "any unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such".

JD Vance gave a very quick set of remarks to US Marines this afternoon, making no mention of the Signal scandal that is dominating headlines. 

He talked about the importance of investing in the military and praised the Marines for their sacrifices to the US. 

Minutes ago, White House Press Secretary Karoline said she needed to cut her media briefing short so it wouldn't overlap with Vance's speech.

Leavitt faced dozens of questions from reporters about the Signal chat group.

The White House briefing just wrapped up a bit earlier than usual, with Karoline Leavitt saying she didn't want to interfere with JD Vance's speech.

So let's pivot to that.

The vice-president is speaking to US marines in Quantico, Virginia as his team battles allegations that they mishandled sensitive military information. A reminder that Vance was one of the members of that Signal group chat which inadvertently included a journalist.

During his first few minutes of speaking, Vance is yet to address the Signal scandal that is gripping the White House. He talks to Marines about investing in the US military "like we never have before".

We're listening in and will bring you more updates as they happen.

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

We've just wrapped up an unusually short - and tense - news briefing at the White House. It lasted 24 minutes. 

The ending was abrupt, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt citing a desire to not "counter-programme" Vice President JD Vance's remarks at a US Marine Corps base in Quantico. 

News briefings vary in length, but in this administration have rarely timed in at under 45 minutes. 

As a reminder, we're now also going to hear directly from President Trump from the Oval Office at 16:00 ET. 

Billionaire Elon Musk will look into how a journalist from The Atlantic was added to a Signal chat that included some of the highest-ranking officials in Washington DC, Leavitt says.

Musk, who has made news headlines for leading the charge to terminate thousands of federal workers, will now "figure out how this number was inadvertently added" to the Signal chat, she says.

Musk's assistance will help "ensure this can never happen again," Leavitt continues.

Watch: Signal messaging app is 'secure and efficient', says White House

A reporter has just asked Leavitt whether Trump's team will review how often they'll use Signal in the wake of the scandal, and other applications like it. 

Leavitt repeats her earlier remarks that the app is "improved", and claims that Signal is the "most safe and efficient way of communicating" when officials can't be inside a room together.

Leavitt slams Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg who was apparently inadvertently added to the chat as an "anti-Trump hater" 

She also repeats there was no classified information in the leaked Signal group chat messages 

Messages from the group chat newly published by the Atlantic appear to show Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth sharing information about US air strikes on Yemen earlier this month

One message from Hegseth says, in part, "Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch" and "14:15: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP"

Earlier, US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told a House committee that adding a journalist to a high-level chat about air strike plans was "a mistake"

Watch: Mike Waltz says he takes 'full responsibility' for group chat leak

Edited by Caitlin Wilson, with Bernd Debusmann reporting from White House

As expected, Leavitt is being pressed by reporters about the White House's description of the Signal group chat conversation. 

One reporter notes that the text messaging thread detailed the exact time of the planned attacks before they occurred as well as some of the military assets that were to be used. 

He asks Leavitt, what would you call this discussion if not war plans? 

Leavitt responds that the texts contained "sensitive policy discussions", but she adds, that the conversation should reassure the American people of Trump's "dynamic" military and intelligence team. 

Leavitt again states that "no war plans" were discussed, and that "no classified materials" were sent in the group chat.

Leavitt has finished her opening remarks and is now taking questions from reporters, including one who asks how "comfortable" President Trump was with the conversations shared on the Signal messaging thread by some of his top officials.

Leavitt says Trump's response to the situation has remained the same. She says he himself has wanted to address the scandal. 

Leavitt says Trump told her he will "tackle this story". 

Leavitt also says that Signal is an "approved app" that the Department of Defense and CIA have loaded onto government phones because it is "secure". 

After a lengthy criticism of the journalist who was inadvertently invited to a group chat with top US officials on Signal, Leavitt then pivots to attacking former President Joe Biden.

She claims the reason why Trump approved attacks on Houthis in Yemen in the first place was "because of Joe Biden's incompetence and pathetic weakness on the world stage".  

Leavitt says the Houthis grew emboldened "immediately" after Biden took office in 2021. 

"President Trump's strength and resolve eliminated those terrorists," Leavitt says.

In keeping with what has become standard practice, today's briefing begins with Karoline Leavitt touting what the administration sees as its most notable achievements of the last several days. 

She then quickly pivots to attacking the media for coverage of "Signalgate". 

"There were certainly no war plans discussed," Leavitt says, echoing a talking point she shared on social media earlier. 

She directly attacks The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg as an "anti-Trump hater" and registered Democrat. She also criticises his career as a reporter, including during the Iraq War and the 2016 electoral campaign. 

"The real story here is the overwhelming success of decisive military action against Houthi terrorists," Leavitt continues.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has a briefing planned to begin shortly.

Reporters are filing into the room. 

Those without assigned seats are crowding the aisles, jostling for spaces they believe will give them a higher chance of being called on. 

Briefings are relatively infrequent in Trump's administration so far, with only one or two happening each week. 

They are often crowded - but today promises to be particularly well-attended by the US and global media that covers Washington as the Signal group chat story continues to develop. 

Without even the slightest exaggeration, I've not heard anything else being discussed among reporters since I arrived here several hours ago.

I've been exchanging messages with Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for the Middle East and a retired CIA paramilitary officer, who since yesterday has been expressing concern with how the information in the Signal chat was being handled.

Of particular concern, Mulroy tells me, are the messages which depict a "real time order of battle sequence of an ongoing operation". 

"It is highly classified and protected," he says. "Disclosure would compromise the operation and put lives at risk. Next to nuclear and covert operations, this information is the most protected." 

Mulroy also pushed back on the assertion, from White House officials, that the contents of the group chat do not constitute "war plans". 

The primary difference between "war" and "attack" plans - which are both sensitive and classified - is one of scale. 

"War plans are generally the plan to conduct an entire conflict," he adds. "Attack plans stem from that and go down to the individual unit level and are very detailed." 

"One could actually make the argument that attack plans are more sensitive, because they are more detailed and specific on time, place and manner."

In one part of the newly published Signal chat, CIA Director John Ratcliffe notes that the US is "mobilising assets" to help a strike, but that a delay would "not negatively impact" the agency's work in Yemen.

Ratcliffe has said there was no classified information discussed in the chat. 

The House Intelligence Committee has just wrapped up the public part of its session - it's now moving to closed questioning of the intelligence chiefs to talk about more secretive information that won't be broadcast. Here's what we learned:

Whether or not the information US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth shared is classified is at the core of Signal-gate. 

Here are some of the details of the mission he wrote to officials - and a reporter who was inadvertently added to the Signal group chat, according to Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg: 

US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has hit back after the Atlantic, external published new details from the Signal group chat on a Yemen attack that its editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added to, doubling down that there was "no classified information" in the message thread.

"The Atlantic released the so-called 'war plans' and those 'plans' include: No names. No targets. No locations. No units. No routes. No sources. No methods," he said in a post on X.

"This only proves one thing: Jeff Goldberg has never seen a war plan or an 'attack plan' (as he now calls it). Not even close.

"We will continue to do our job, while the media does what it does best: peddle hoaxes," he adds.

Hegseth's posts in the chat as released by the Atlantic include details about how the attacks would be carried out, their timing and military hardware that would be used. 

There's a heated exchange between Democrat Jimmy Gomez and CIA Director John Ratcliffe over the disclosures by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Signal thread, which included military plans. 

Gomez asks both Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard: "Do you know whether Pete Hegesth had been drinking before he leaked classified information?"

Media reports about Hegseth's alcohol use dogged his confirmation hearings before he was eventually approved to his post. 

Gabbard says she has no knowledge of Hegseth's "personal habits", while Ratcliffe takes issue with the question, calling it an "offensive line of questioning".

Both Gomez and Ratcliffe talk over one another, with Gomez defending himself and Ratcliffe saying the lawmaker doesn't want to "focus on the good work that the CIA is doing".

Gomez say he has a "huge respect" for the CIA, but Americans need to know whether the defence secretary's "performance is compromised".

Back on Capitol Hill as the House hearing continues with intelligence officials, Democrat Chrissy Houlahan says she finds it "offensive for [CIA Director John Ratcliffe] to accuse me as a Democrat of not caring about national threats".

Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, says she "had wanted to talk about those" global threats - which was the topic that brought these officials to the hearing - but now "I don't have time to ask those questions because the threat is in the House".

"When I served in the military.... if this happened to me I would have walked my resignation" in straight away, Houlahan says of the leaked military plans. 

She presses Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, on whether she would investigate the leaked military plans. 

"This was a chat among a great variety of people," Houlahan argued, saying Gabbard had an "obligation" to probe any significant leak. "Do you not think it's important to do such a thing?" 

Gabbard pointed to the Defense Department having authority over the classification of the information discussed in the Signal chat and said the National Security Council, not her agency, was examining the leak. 

Bernd Debusmann JrReporting from the White House

As the morning in Washington grinds on, the White House's strategy for dealing with the fall-out of what has now been dubbed "Signal-gate" is becoming more clear. 

In the hours since the Atlantic published the contents of the messages, various White House officials - including Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, Communications Director Steven Cheung and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard - have contested that the shared messages constituted a "war plan". 

"The Atlantic has conceded: these were not "war plans"," Leavitt wrote earlier. "This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin." 

The semantics argument is unlikely to hold much weight with national security professionals, who have noted that the messages included specific attack plans and timetables that could have allowed the Houthis to prepare, if the messages had fallen into the wrong hands. 

There is about an hour until today's news briefing is due to begin at the White House, and, for now, it appears as if this argument is likely to form a key part of Leavitt's answers to questions from the news media. 

A lot has happened with this story today, so let's take a look at how we got here. 

We started our coverage this morning US time after the Atlantic, external journalist who was added to a Signal group chat with top US security officials released new details from that message thread on Wednesday.

Some of the new details include specific timings of the airstrikes and, hours before the attack, confirmation from Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth saying: "We are a GO for mission launch".

Some of those who were on the Signal message thread are continuing to testifying before the House Intelligence Committee. 

The CIA Director testified the reports from the Atlantic were "misleading" and he never transmitted classified information". Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers there would be an "in-depth review" by the National Security Council about the mishap and also denied there was any classified information discussed. 

Democratic lawmakers like Senator Mike Warner have called for the resignation of Hegseth and others involved in the chat. Warner also said that the new information was "obviously classified", posing legal risks.

The White House on Wednesday dismissed the Atlantic story as "another hoax" and said the details of the chat were not war plans, though Trump did say in an interview today that someone on his team may have "screwed up". 

Vice-President JD Vance says that Atlantic journalist "oversold what he had".

Soon, we're expecting to hear more from the White House in a news briefing where Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt is set to take questions from reporters. 

Ruth ComerfordLive reporter

One of the big questions
in this latest leak of messages from the Atlantic is whether they are classified and whether they ever were.

The White House and members of the group chat, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth who laid out the military plans over Signal, have denied the messages are classified. 

But former senior military intelligence expert Philip Ingram said these messages are likely very classified. He says the most recent leak posted by the Atlantic "falls firmly into the bracket of what would have been classified top secret".

There is a huge amount of detail about what is being launched and when, he says. "You can practically plot where the aircraft are going to come from."

"There are likely to be other messages before and after this, and anyone with a bit of military knowledge - well this is plain speak to them."

Here's what some of the military jargon means.

A "package" refers to a set of aircraft that will be carrying different weapon systems and intelligence gathering devices.

A "trigger" means the set of parameters that have to be acknowledged before an airstrike or missile is deployed. It could be a visual reference point, like a mobile phone lighting up.

We've been talking a lot about Signal, the app that was used to discuss war plans.

It's a free, open-source encrypted messaging app that was launched in 2014.

Conversations within the app are end-to-end encrypted - meaning they can only be read or heard by the recipients.

It is often used by journalists and Washington officials because of the secure nature of its communications, the ability to create aliases, and the ability to send disappearing messages.

Here's more about the app, how it was used here and a look at how secure it truly is. 

Democrat Jason Crow

At the hearing, Democrat Jason Crow is focusing on the security of the Signal app itself.

He asks National Security Agency (NSA) Director Timothy Haugh if the agency has recently warned its employees not to use the app, which has been reported in the media. 

Haugh says they have put out advisories related to how the use Signal and other encrypted applications.

Crow asks if that was because there are risks to using the app. "There are," Haugh replies.

Crow also asks Defense Intelligence Agency Director Jeffrey Kruse whether the Department of Defense has also recently issued a warning about the vulnerability of the app.

"That's correct," Kruse says.

A Pentagon spokesperson said in a statement the additional messages released by the Atlantic on Wednesday contained "no classified materials or war plans". 

"The Secretary was merely updating the group on a plan that was underway and had already been briefed through official channels," spokesmen Sean Parnell said of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 

"The American people see through the Atlantic's pathetic attempts to distract from President Trump's national security agenda."

New details from the Signal chat show specific times for airstrikes in Yemen and the types of weapons used. 

Rep Krishnamoorthi had a large poster with the Signal messages displayed at today's hearing

Senior Democrats have been highly critical of the way messages about attacks on the Houthis were shared on Signal and that a journalist was added to the group. 

Some have now gone further, calling for Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation on the grounds that he texted sensitive and classified information on the chat.

At the ongoing House Intelligence Committee hearing, where several members of the Signal group are testifying before lawmakers, Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi says Hegseth "needs to resign immediately".

He displayed large print-out screenshots of the messages during the hearing, which he says should have been classified.

Others have piled on with similar thoughts. Arizona Senator Ruben Gallego, who is a former US Marine, said on X that "the incompetence and cover-up is embarrassing".

"This could have gotten our men and women killed!" he wrote. "Strike times, when planes are taking off, what weapons are being used all shared in unsafe manner.@SecDef, external needs to resign." 

"I cannot believe Hegseth would recklessly text info that could put a target on our pilots and service members," wrote New Jersey Senator Andy Kim on X. "He needs to resign."

Arizona's Mark Kelly, who sits on the Intelligence Committee, agreed: “This is what happens when you put unqualified people in important jobs where lives are on the line.”

And Michael Bennet, Colorado senator and another committee member, said National Security Adviser Mike Waltz should also go, adding that their continued denial of wrongdoing was making things worse.

President Donald Trump is so far today continuing his claims that nothing in the encrypted chat that was leaked could have "compromised" the attack plans in Yemen, though he did say that a member of his team may have "screwed up". 

Speaking over the phone on the conservative Vince Show, Trump said: “There weren't details, and there was nothing in there that compromised and it had no impact on the attack, which was very successful."

But, he added: “Somebody in my group either screwed up, or it's a bad signal,” he said.

Trump has so far stood by his officials and has claimed the incident has been blown out of proportion.

In 2019, researchers based at India's Chandigarh University published 362 peer-reviewed research studies. In 2023, that number had shot up to 2281 – a 530% increase – which has seen Chandigarh jump from a ranking below 2000th to 578th in Elsevier's SciVal tool ranking tool, which records the number of papers over 24,000 institutions publish annually.

Chandigarh is not the only university whose fortunes in these rankings have changed drastically. A total of 80 universities worldwide increased their research output by 100% or more, compared with a global average of around 20% between 2019 and 2023, according to a recent analysis.

At the same time, researchers at 14 of these institutions, including Chandigarh, showed significant declines in rates of first authorship – by up to eight times the global average. And the same 14 universities increased the rate by which their faculty co-authored papers with international colleagues by more than 10 times the global average in 2019–23. The group includes six public universities in Saudi Arabia, with the rest private institutions in India, Egypt, Iraq and Lebanon.

Chemistry World reached out to Chandigarh University for comment but received no response.

Study co-author Lokman Meho, an information scientist at the American Institute of Beirut, says the issue isn't that research outputs are increasing at these institutions while first-author rates are decreasing. In fact, he says, that trend is very normal. ‘Globally, when research output increases significantly, it is natural to observe a decline in first-authorship rates,' says Meho. ‘A larger number of publications typically involves more collaborative efforts, which inherently dilutes individual leadership roles.' First authors carry out most of the work on a study, including research design, data collection and analysis.

Meho says the problem is how much output has increased and first-authorship rates declined at these institutions. ‘We were surprised at the sheer scale of the anomalies that we found,' he says. The publication output of the 14 universities rose by between 100% and 1457% in the five-year period – an average increase of 234%. Research output from institutions in a control group – including the California Institute of Technology, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Princeton University – increased by 1–6% during the same period.

Meho adds that the decline in first-authorship rates among the 14 institutions was much greater than that for their respective countries as a whole.

The data raise questions over how researchers at these universities are sustaining such spikes in research output while their first-authorship rates plummet significantly. Meho and his Beirut colleague Elie Akl are concerned that the trend could point to unethical behaviour, such as gift or sold authorship.

Saveetha Institute of Medical and Technical Sciences (SIMTS) in Chennai, India, is another of the flagged institutions. According to reports, Saveetha Dental College, which is part of SIMTS, was publishing papers that its undergraduate students completed as part of their exams, leading to a significant spike in the number of papers produced by the institution. In 2023 and 2024, Saveetha Dental College was the highest-ranked dental institute in India. But it appeared that excessive self-citations and citation cartels were partly behind Saveetha's success.

Chemistry World approached SIMTS for a comment.

Reducing incentives for researchers and institutions to game the system could combat the problem, says Meho. Higher rankings, for instance, can draw higher-quality researchers and students, and more funding, he points out. The pursuit of higher rankings, therefore, puts ‘intense pressure' on institutions to publish more – ‘sometimes at the expense of ethical considerations'. 

Meho recommends that agencies that produce rankings should only consider a paper's primary affiliations and not give equal credit to each co-author. 

Elizabeth Gadd, head of research culture and assessment at Loughborough University, agrees that it's a problem if ranking agencies aren't picking up on unethical practices. ‘I would like to see the sector taking much greater interest and control over the mechanisms by which they are assessed on the global stage, because I think there are much better ways that we could be doing this,' she says.

In a separate analysis, Achal Agrawal, a data scientist who founded the India Research Watchdog, showed that countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, Egypt and India, whose research output has been rising rapidly, are retracting studies at much higher rates than other countries. Agarwal says that more sophisticated tools and metrics are needed to spot suspicious patterns. He adds that national regulators should audit institutions that are continually suspected of ‘cooking the books'. ‘Some accountability is needed,' he says.

A ceasefire will cover the Black Sea after the US held separate talks with Russia and Ukraine. But what are the details of the agreement?

Russia and Ukraine have agreed to a Black Sea ceasefire deal.

The agreement came after Ukraine and US delegations held talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.

But what is the Black Sea deal - and is it a full ceasefire?

Follow live: Kyiv and Moscow dispute Black Sea ceasefire details

What is in the Black Sea ceasefire deal?

These are the main aspects of the deal set out by the US:

• The US and Russia have agreed to safe navigation in the Black Sea, which had been a key focus of talks this week• Additionally, they agreed to work together on measures banning strikes on energy infrastructure in Russia and Ukraine• Washington will also help to restore Russia's access to global markets for agricultural and fertiliser exports, the White House said - although where this leaves Western sanctions against Russia is unclear at this stage.

The US also said it has agreed it will remain committed to returning forcibly transferred Ukrainian children.

Ukraine's defence minister Rustem Umerov confirmed the agreement, but added that Kyiv maintains any movement by Russian military vessels outside of eastern part of the Black Sea will constitute violation of the spirit of this agreement.

"In this case Ukraine will have full right to exercise right to self-defence," he said.

He added: "All parties agreed to develop measures for implementing the presidents' agreement to ban strikes against energy facilities of Ukraine and Russia."

Kirill Dmitriev, one of Russia's negotiators, welcomed it on X as "a major shift toward peace".

The Kremlin has confirmed that it has agreed to the ceasefire - but complications have already arisen.

Immediate disputes over ceasefire deal

Just hours after the ceasefire deal was announced, Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the Kremlin were at odds over the timing and conditions.

The Ukrainian president said he understood the ceasefire came into effect immediately upon the US announcement, but Moscow said it would only come into force after Western sanctions were lifted against companies involved in food and fertiliser exports.

The US had said it agreed to "help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertiliser exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions".

Donald Trump later said his administration was "looking into" Russian requests to lift sanctions.

The sanctions it wants lifted include those against:

On Wednesday morning - the day after the agreement was reached - Ukraine reported downing seven Russian drones over the port city of Mykolaiv, while Russia said it had destroyed nine Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea - though it was not immediately clear whether they were aimed at Black Sea targets or just flying over the waters.

No deaths or injuries were reported by either country.

How significant is the ceasefire deal?

The deal won't do much to end the war, according to Sky News' security analyst Michael Clarke.

He says Russia will be quite happy dragging the US through peace talks without making any meaningful concessions.

The deal is one the US "can boast about" - without it changing much on the ground for Ukraine, he says.

"The Russians will be quite happy about that because they'll just keep going down more and more rabbit holes and they'll present little gains for the US," he explains.

"But they won't address the central issue," he says.

No real deal can be agreed unless Donald Trump starts putting meaningful pressure on Vladimir Putin, he says.

"Unless the Americans are prepared to pressure Russia as opposed to just keeping offering them more advantages, the war will just go on."

He also says Mr Trump will stay interested until it "gets difficult", at which point he'll "just go onto something else".

"He's a disrupter, but when disruption becomes hard to follow through, he goes on to the next topic, and I think that's what will happen."

Why is Russia willing to agree to a ceasefire at sea now?

Under the ceasefire at sea, Russia would once again be able to export farm produce and fertiliser through the Black Sea, getting relief from sanctions imposed by Western countries.

The US even referred to helping Russia access the world market for agricultural products again.

According to Prof Clarke, Russia is happy to continue fighting on land, where it is slowly making gains, while signing up to something that protects its ships at sea - where Ukraine has been growing in confidence and damaging Russian vessels.

And it helps with Russia's goal of getting its equipment out of the Black Sea.

Why is the Black Sea so important to Russia?

The agreement has come in the midst of negotiations between Russia, the US and Ukraine in Riyadh in recent days centred on the Black Sea.

But the basis of the negotiations was a deal to secure shipping there that collapsed more than 18 months ago.

That UN-backed deal was negotiated in July 2022 between Turkey, the UN and Russia as a way of ensuring that Ukraine, one of the breadbaskets of the world, could keep exporting grain via its southern ports without being attacked.

It was known as the Black Sea grain initiative.

That deal benefited Russia, as it also allowed for greater Russian agricultural exports - but but Moscow pulled out of the initiative in July 2023 after accusing the West of reneging on this part of the agreement.

This meant Russia stopped granting safe passage to cargo ships going to and from Ukraine, and the country's grain exports subsequently slumped.

But Russia is now said to be keen to revive parts of the grain deal.

What happened the last time Ukraine and Russia had a ceasefire agreement?

Last week, Mr Putin agreed to an immediate 30-day pause in strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

However, within 24 hours Ukraine and Russia accused the other of breaking the pledge.

Just this weekend, a Canadian professor warned that illegal immigration and drug smuggling in Canada would hit the roof, all thanks to Donald Trump's strict border policies. Speaking on '60 Minutes Overtime,' Mount Royal University's Kelly Sundberg, who also 15 years as an officer in the Canadian Border Services Agency, spread the word of caution, saying a “tsunami” of illegal migrants would inevitably flow into Canada. 

“I hope I'm wrong, but it would appear that we're going to be overwhelmed by the illegal immigrants fleeing American authorities coming into our country, and they very well might be bringing guns and drugs with them,” he said.

Days later, The New York Post appears to have confirmed those fears as official sources have told the US outlet that more migrants are picking Canada for their refuge instead of slipping into the US. In light of President Trump's crackdown on the issue, Homeland Security sources argued how “lots of northbounders” have been “self-deporting” from the US.

While it's obvious that with Donald Trump back in the US, migrants are switching paths because they fear his policies to curb illegal immigration, these numbers had reportedly already started mounting even before the Trump administration returned to power with full swing.

According to official data quoted by The Post, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police reported 40 illegal crossing from Washington into British Columbia in January 2025. Border Patrol agents on the US side also witnessed 30 migrants crossing south. Even Agents in a remote area of Washington state saw an average of five migrants moving illegally north into Canada every day.

It was also observed that many of these migrants running to Canada share some temporary status in the US as they previously crossed into the country from Mexico. Sources contended that migrants are also illegally crossing into Canada “to avoid any immigration consequences that may happen if their case isn't adjudicated in their favour.” Moreover, they're keen on entering Canada before federal immigration agents working for Trump's mass deportation bid nab them.

As per the New York Times, Canadian border authorities caught roughly 20 illegal migrants so far this year in Alberta. On the contrary, only seven migrants were crossing north in the same region in 2024. The remote parts of the US-Canada border are also witnessing migrants running north.

With more and more light being shed on Canada in this context, the country has worked to tighten its visa restrictions. “Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,” Trump said in a November Truth Social post. “We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!”

In late February, David McGunity, Public Safety Minister of Canada, said that the country's progress in enhancing border security with the US and battling drug smuggling should make the Trump admin happy. 

“We are quite convinced that the efforts we've made thus far should satisfy the U.S. administration,” he told reporters in Washington. “The evidence is irrefutable – progress is being made. In my view, any test that was put on Canada in terms of showing progress and meeting standards for the border – I believe those have been met.”

The Canada Border Services Agency said in a statement, “During this blitz, border services officers will be increasing examinations of inbound and outbound shipments.”

IREDA's share price fell 2% on Wednesday after a recent surge, and the company's board approved a borrowing plan of Rs 30,800 crore for FY25-26. The company plans to raise funds through various financial instruments, including bonds and commercial borrowings. In addition, IREDA reported a 27% increase in net profit and a 35.6% increase in revenue for Q3 FY25.

Democrat James Malone is projected to win a special election for Pennsylvania's 36th state Senate district on Tuesday night, narrowly triumphing in a district President Donald Trump won by 15 percentage points in November. 

Malone's victory over Republican Josh Parsons is a significant upset, and an encouraging sign Democrats' coalition of highly engaged, highly educated voters continues to give them an advantage in low-turnout but crucial special elections. It's also an early but small sign of growing voter anger with Republicans.

Before the election, Malone told local media that voters in the county were frustrated with the role billionaire Elon Musk has played in the Trump administration. 

“Josh Parsons might be OK with that, but I'm not,” Malone told Lancaster Online. “On Tuesday, you'll get to make the choice between more Musk, or Lancaster values.”

Malone led Parsons 50% to 49%, a lead of less than 500 votes, according to results posted by the Pennsylvania Secretary of State. The district includes most of Lancaster County, a rural county in the south central part of the state best known for its Amish population.

Malone is the mayor of East Petersburg, a small borough in Lancaster County. Parsons is a Lancaster County commissioner. The two were running to fill a seat vacated by Republican Sen. Ryan Aument, who took a job working for freshman U.S. Sen. Dave McMormick. 

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), who recorded a robocall encouraging Democrats to vote for Malone, celebrated the victory on social media.

“Tonight in Lancaster County, Pennsylvanians rejected a candidate who embraced the extremism and division coming out of DC,” Shapiro wrote. “In a district carried comfortably by Donald Trump just a few months ago, they chose a better way forward — an embrace of competence, commonsense, and a desire to bring people together.”

Malone's victory shrinks the GOP advantage in the state Senate to 27-23. In a separate election outside Pittsburgh, the Democratic candidate ran well ahead of former Vice President Kamala Harris' margins in a Democratic seat to maintain the party's narrow 102-101 advantage in Pennsylvania's state House. 

Democrats similarly flipped a heavily Republican state Senate seat in Iowa in January. Some Democratic operatives were looking at Malone's victory as a sign the party could be competitive in a tentatively scheduled congressional special election in upstate New York this summer.

March 25 (UPI) -- Japan's Osaka High Court ruled Tuesday that the country's ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional.
Advertisement
The court's ruling is the fifth decision to call Japan's same-sex marriage ban a violation of the country's constitution following similar rulings in the high courts of Sapporo, Tokyo, Fukuoka and Nagoya.
Presiding Judge Kumiko Honda of the Osaka High Court ruled Tuesday in favor of three same-sex couples who filed a lawsuit against the government, seeking 6 million yen -- or $39,900 -- in compensation.
While Honda dismissed the couples' appeal for compensation, he reversed Osaka District Court's prior ruling that Japan's Civil Code and Family Register Act limit marriage to heterosexual couples.

Honda ruled Tuesday that a ban of same-sex marriage violates the right to equality in Article 14 of the Constitution of Japan, which states: "All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin."
The court also ruled that the marriage ban violates Article 24, which states laws involving family "shall be enacted from the standpoint of individual dignity and the essential equality of the sexes."

While the Osaka District Court based its decision on protecting the relationships of men and women to bring children into the world, the plaintiffs argued "there are heterosexual couples who don't intend to have children."
Japan is currently the only International Group of Seven country that does not recognize same-sex marriage. Other G7 countries have encouraged Japan to fight discrimination and uphold protections for sexual and gender minorities.
Some local governments in Japan have granted "partnership certificates" to same-sex couples, but those do not provide the same married rights of spousal visits, parental recognition or inheritance.
"What should be questioned is the rationality in excluding same-sex couples from the marriage system," the plaintiffs argued. "Legalizing gay marriage would make more people happy, while it would make no one unhappy."

Stocks skidded in afternoon trading after the White House signaled that President Trump on Wednesday would announce more tariffs, with the latest salvo targeting U.S. auto imports. 

The S&P 500 dropped 64 points, or 1.1%, to close at 5,712, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite nosed down 2% as investors pulled back from major technology players. 

After a delayed announcement, Mr. Trump said he is imposing a 25% tariff on all vehicles imported into the U.S. "This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before," he said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. "We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff."

Shares of automakers slid ahead of the announcement, with General Motors sinking 3.2% and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram, dropping 3.5%. The Detroit automakers' manufacturing plants and supply chains are spread across North America, so additional tariffs would raise their costs and crimp profits. 

Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and consumer unhappiness over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, fell nearly 6% and are down 33% this year.  

Consumers are also likely to feel the sting of additional import duties. New tariffs on U.S. car imports could drive up vehicle costs between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, Anderson Economic Group has estimated. 

Beyond the impact on the auto sector, investors have been rattled by President Trump's protectionist trade policies. The U.S. is scheduled to announce a raft of tariffs on April 2, including 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with even more sweeping matching levies on a number of U.S. trading partners. 

"The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence," Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors. 

He added, "Even those who might agree with the long-term benefits of tariffs have to acknowledge there will be a multi-quarter period of substantial disruption to the economy, with softer growth and higher inflation."

The Federal Reserve earlier this month cited the likely impact of tariffs in lowering its outlook for U.S. economic growth to 1.7%, while also forecasting a pickup in inflation. 

A new analysis by Oxford Economics found that U.S. tariffs could raise the cost of some products by as much as 4%, with home appliances, musical instruments, tableware and utensils, and personal care items potentially seeing the biggest price hikes.

The White House press briefing ended after about 20 minutes, which is shorter than usual. 

Leavitt was asked numerous questions about the Signal group chat.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Biden administration effort to regulate “ghost gun” kits that allow people to easily obtain parts needed to assemble firearms from online sellers.

The decision by a court that often backs gun rights resolves the legal dispute over whether the kits can be regulated the same way as other firearms.

Trump will announce tariffs on the auto industry today at 4 p.m., according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Leavitt said during today's news conference that Trump would hold a news conference in the Oval Office to make the announcement.

Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is requesting information from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff about whether they used Signal on personal devices as part of their jobs and is questioning whether the two were abroad during the chat involving The Atlantic's editor-in-chief. 

In a letter to the two Trump administration officials, Schiff wrote that he has grave concerns about their "participation in highly sensitive Principals Committee deliberations about a planned military operation using the commercial messaging service Signal while you were both on foreign travel."

“The national security breach caused by sharing sensitive military information over an unclassified messaging application is compounded by the fact that both of you, who are prime targets for foreign intelligence services, were traveling in high-threat environments that pose significant counterintelligence risks to U.S. personnel and devices," Schiff wrote. 

Schiff noted that public records show that Gabbard was on a multination tour to Asia that included stops in Japan, Thailand and India during the time of the Signal chat involving The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. 

The Democratic senator also said in his letter that reporting has revealed that Witkoff was in Russia at the time, meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 

"This means that Mr. Witkoff appeared to be receiving sensitive national intelligence information while in Moscow and, based on this timeline, may have been in direct meetings with the Kremlin when some of the messages were exchanged," Schiff said. 

Schiff asked that they respond to a number of questions in the letter by March 31, including whether they have used Signal for work-related purposes on their personal devices since Trump's inauguration.

The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to allow it to terminate about $600 million in Education Department grants.

The administration previously tried to terminate the grants, but a district judge blocked the move and ordered that the administration immediately reinstate the funds. The Trump administration is now asking the Supreme Court to reverse the lower court's decision.

"This case exemplifies a flood of recent suits that raise the question: 'Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever)' millions in taxpayer dollars," the government wrote.  

The group that originally sued to block the grant termination, authorized by Congress, argued that the funds are necessary to "address nationwide teacher shortages and improve teacher quality by educating, placing, and supporting new teachers in hard-to-staff schools, especially in rural and other underserved communities, and in hard-to-staff subjects, such as math and special education."

Senate Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., told reporters today that he and ranking member Jack Reed, D-R.I., are asking the administration for an “expedited” inspector general report into a Trump Cabinet-level chat that revealed military strike information to a journalist who was inadvertently included in the discussion. 

“We are signing a letter today asking the administration to expedite an IG report back to the committee," Wicker said. "We're sending a similar letter to the administration in an attempt to get ground truth. We certainly want to know if the transcript that has been published is accurate.” 

Wicker said he is confident the Pentagon will follow through with a report despite Trump's firing of the Defense Department's inspector general, along with several other of the independent watchdogs at major departments, shortly after he took office. 

Asked if he thinks the information discussed in the Signal app chat was, or should have been, classified, Wicker said, “The information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.”

Wicker said he will also request a classified briefing for committee members from a “senior person” in the administration. Asked if that person should be Hegseth, Wicker said, “We will want someone that that actually has the facts and can speak on behalf of the administration.”

A majority of American voters are generally disappointed with the people President Donald Trump has appointed to posts in his administration, according to an NBC News poll earlier this month — a record share in a question NBC News has measured at the start of four previous administrations.

The survey was conducted March 7-11, before The Atlantic published a story Monday revealing that a number of senior Trump administration officials — including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, national security adviser Mike Waltz and others — participated in a Signal chat thread about plans to launch airstrikes against Houthi militants, in which Hegseth shared plans including the timing and types of aircraft used. 

The Signal thread included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, as well as Hegseth, Waltz, Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and others.

Gabbard defended the group chat by reiterating an argument that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth can declassify information.

"Secretary Hegseth has the classification and declassification authority over DOD information," Gabbard said, referring to the Defense Department.

Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Penn., urged Gabbard to investigate the situation, speculating that it is "likely to be more than just this chat."

Megan Lebowitz

Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., pressed Gabbard about whether she stood by her testimony before the Senate yesterday that she did not recall discussions of specific weapons, timing or targets.

"My response in the Senate yesterday, yes, I stand by that response," Gabbard said. "Obviously the release of the screenshots that came from that chat group today were a refresher on what happened. As I said earlier, I was not involved with that portion of the chat, so it did not come to my recollection yesterday."

Gomez noted shortly after that the administration has said they want to "drain the swamp." "But you have become that swamp in a matter of days," Gomez said. "Not weeks or months. Days."

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., defended the Trump administration officials who participated in the Signal chat that revealed sensitive military information to The Atlantic, even after the contents of the discussion were released this morning by the magazine. 

Cotton said he doesn't think Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth broke the law in discussing pending attacks in Yemen.

“There was no locations listed there," Cotton said. "There were no sources of methods. There's no specific targets. Certainly, there was nothing called war plans, which was an embellishment and exaggeration by a known left-wing partisan opponent of the president.”

Cotton also said he doesn't see his committee investigating the security breach because “to the extent there was any allegation of classified information here, that was not information that was coming from either Tulsi Gabbard or John Ratcliffe. So, as far as I know, it's outside of our jurisdiction.”

When pressed on whether intelligence officers or the Department of Defense should share this kind of information on Signal in the future, Cotton noted that Ratcliffe said yesterday that the Signal messaging app had been installed on his computer at CIA.

“I'm sure the administration, like all administrations, will continue to review how it communicates inside and deliberates consistent with the requirements of operational security and presidential record-keeping rules," he said. "But I think here the real story is the incredibly successful strikes in Yemen that has protected our sailors and protected our friends in Israel and international shipping, and that's where we should focus.”

Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., questioned Ratcliffe and Gabbard about Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's drinking habits during his line of questioning about the Signal group chat information leak at this morning's House Intelligence Committee hearing. 

“The main person who was involved in this thread, that a lot of people want to talk to, is Secretary of Defense Hegseth, and a lot of questions were brought up regarding his drinking habits in his confirmation hearing,” Gomez said. “To your knowledge, do you know whether Pete Hegseth had been drinking before he leaked classified information?”

Ratcliffe denied that Hegseth had been drinking before texting detailed plans of the strike in Yemen over Signal and called Gomez's line of questioning “offensive.”  

“You don't want to focus on the good work the CIA is doing, the intelligence community…” Ratcliffe said in a raised voice, prompting Gomez to shout over him to “reclaim his time” for questions. 

“I have huge respect for the CIA, huge respect for men and women in uniform,” Gomez said. “But this was a question that's on the top of minds of every American right. He stood in front of the podium in Europe holding a drink. So of course, we want to know if his performance is compromised.”

At this morning's House Intelligence Committee hearing, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., cited the Trump administration's own language in pressing the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency on the administration's claim that a high-level Signal chat that revealed sensitive information on military strikes was unclassified. 

Krishnamoorthi read a Trump administration executive order on classified information, which holds that “information should be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations." 

“We clearly have weapons systems that have been identified, that is classified information,” Krishnamoorthi said, pointing to a blown-up picture of the plans texted by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Signal group chat. “The reason why it's important that this information not be disclosed is that we don't want the adversaries to know what's about to happen.” 

.

The DIA director, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, argued that the military terms used in Hegseth's texts lacked specific context and could have been used in any number of operations.  

But Krishnamoorthi countered that “Secretary Hegsth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information," adding, "He needs to resign immediately and a full investigation needs to be undertaken with regard to whether other similar Signal chats are occurring.”

Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, quipped about the emojis used in the Signal chat reacting to the Yemen strikes.

"I will note I always use fire emojis when I see terrorists getting killed," he said.

After the strikes in Yemen, Waltz responded in the group chat with the fist, American flag and fire emojis.

The judge who the government has argued can't be trusted with sensitive information in the Alien Enemies Act case has been assigned to a case about top government officials appearing to share sensitive information on the commercial messaging application Signal.  

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg in the District of Columbia has been assigned to oversee the case of American Oversight against top officials involved in a Signal group chat about an attack in Yemen. The lawsuit seeks to make sure the officials are not using the app to get around federal record-keeping requirements.    

“Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations,” the plaintiffs argue. 

Gabbard is one of the defendants in the case, and used the suit as argument for why she couldn't answer some questions about the group chat in today's House hearing. 

"As a result of that pending litigation, I'm limited in my ability to comment further" on the case, she testified.  

Boasberg is overseeing a separate civil case in which alleged Venezuelan gang members have sued to stop from being deported under Trump's invocation of the rarely used Alien Enemies Act. The administration has refused to answer some of the judge's questions about the initial March 15 deportations in the case and suggested in a filing it did not believe the court could be trusted with such sensitive information. 

Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly bashed the judge for issuing a temporary restraining order in the case.

The Espionage Act, the law that often has been used in criminal cases involving leaks or mishandling of classified information, contains a provision making it crime to disclose national defense secrets “through gross negligence.” 

The law does not require that the information be classified, because it was written before the classification system existed. The law refers simply to “national defense information.”

The specific provision reads: “(e) whoever, being entrusted with or having lawful possession or control of any document, writing, code book, signal book, sketch, photograph, photographic negative, blue print, plan, map, model, note, or information, relating to the national defense, through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be list, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.”

Brad Moss, an attorney whose practice is devoted to issues of security clearances and classified information, said that is “the most reasonably applicable provision from the Espionage Act both for Secretary Hegseth and for national security adviser Waltz,” referring to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and top Trump aide Mike Waltz, who took part in a high-level group chat onYemen strike plans that inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief.

This provision was cited by critics of the decision by the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton in connection with the classified information she and her aides discussed on an unsecure private email system.  

“In order to give Mrs. Clinton a pass, the FBI rewrote the statute, inserting an intent element that Congress did not require,” legal scholar Andrew McCarthy wrote for National Review, including bold type for emphasis. “The added intent element, moreover, makes no sense: The point of having a statute that criminalizes gross negligence is to underscore that government officials have a special obligation to safeguard national defense secrets; when they fail to carry out that obligation due to gross negligence, they are guilty of serious wrongdoing."

Moss said another law that seems to apply here is 18 USC 1924, which makes it a crime to remove classified information to retain it “at an unauthorized location.” While the law does require the material in question to be classified, Moss said there could be no doubt that the material disclosed in the Trump administration officials' group chat was classified.

“There's no way any reasonable person would think that military operational details or real time intelligence about military strikes is not classified, and if they do, they're not qualified to hold senior positions in the U.S. government,” he said.

Under normal circumstances, Moss said, the DNI would be conducting a damage assessment to figure out exactly information was shared in these chats on a non-government platform and to determine what information reached the reporter, and likely a criminal referral to the Justice Department would follow. 

Moss said he does not think that will happen under this administration. 

Trump officials have repeatedly said the messages in the Signal app chat included no classified information, and in testimony before the House Intelligence Committee this morning, Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, continued to insist on that point. Gabbard also said the National Security Council was conducting a review of the incident. 

There is precedent for high-level officials getting in trouble for leaks or mishandling secrets. When the name of an undercover CIA officer was leaked during the George W. Bush administration, a special prosecutor was appointed that resulted in criminal charges against the vice president's chief of staff, Scooter Libby. In recent times, former CIA Director John Deutsch and former national security adviser Sandy Berger were among those disciplined for mishandling incidents. And former CIA Director David Petraeus was prosecuted a decade ago after he gave notebooks containing military secrets to someone writing a book about him.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said it was a "lie" to say that information discussed in the Signal chat would not be considered classified.

Castro asked National Security Agency Director Timothy Haugh whether similar information intercepted from China or Russia would have been considered classified information.

"We would classify based off of our sources and methods," Haugh answered.

Earlier, Castro said that "the idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee, would not be classified, y'all know is a lie."

"That's ridiculous. I've seen things much less sensitive be presented to us with high classification, and to say that it isn't is a lie to the country," he continued.

The government has repeatedly said there was no classified information in the group chat.

The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., pressed National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard on her reposting of tweets from a known right-wing Russian state media personality despite representing the United States intelligence community on the world stage in her official capacity. 

“I have one last question for you, because I think people really listen to what you have to say,” Himes said. "You, on March 15, as DNI, retweeted a post from Ian Miles Cheong, who is listed on RT, that's Russia Today's website, as ‘a political and cultural commentator' who has contributed content to RT since at least 2022.” 

Russia Today is a known source of Russian state propaganda and has long been used as a tool of soft power to promote Russian interests on the world stage. The Department of Justice last year accused the platform of covertly paying pro-Trump influencers. 

“Do you think that it's responsible for you as head of the intelligence community and the principal presidential intelligence advisor, to retweet posts from individuals affiliated with Russian state media?” Himes asked. 

Gabbard, who was grilled by Senators during her confirmation hearing over past comments defending Russia's invasion of Ukraine,  argued that because the retweet came from her personal account, it presents no conflict of interest with her official role as intelligence director. 

“I maintain my First Amendment rights to be able to express my own personal views on different issues,” Gabbard said.

Cheong posted his reaction to the exchange on X, saying “DNI Tulsi Gabbard shared my post on the shutdown of the US Agency for Global Media, which operated the propaganda outfits Voice of America and RFERL.” 

Megan Lebowitz

Gabbard addressed the Signal controversy in her opening remarks before the House Intelligence Committee, referring to Waltz's previous comments and noting that he has “taken full responsibility.”

She said Trump's and Waltz's comments yesterday had a "clear message: It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal chat with high-level national security principles having a policy discussion about imminent strikes against the Houthis and the effects of the strike."

"National Security advisor has taken full responsibility for this, and the National Security Council is conducting an in-depth review, along with technical experts working to determine how this reporter was inadvertently added to this chat," she added.

Gabbard maintained that classified information was not shared, but called the conversation "candid and sensitive." 

"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared," she claimed. "This was a standard update to the national security cabinet that was provided alongside updates that were given to foreign partners in the region."

Gabbard also said that Signal is pre-installed on government devices. NBC News has not independently verified this. 

She referred to a pending lawsuit as a reason why she would be “limited” in commenting further on the issue.

A contentious Senate hearing yesterday raised questions about how Trump administration officials handle sensitive national security information and communications, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's decision to share a planned U.S. military operation in a group chat. 

Of the more than dozen senior U.S. officials on a Signal text chain that was inadvertently leaked to a journalist, Hegseth was the only one who shared details of the planned U.S. airstrikes in Yemen.

After welcoming a witness panel composed of some of the same U.S. intelligence officials who were involved in a Signal group chat that leaked military plans to a magazine editor, Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., used his opening remarks at the House Select Committee on Intelligence hearing this morning to slam his Senate colleagues for their focus on the incident in their own intelligence hearing yesterday. 

“Yesterday, our colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held their hearing on the annual threat assessment,” Crawford said. “And unfortunately, instead of exploring the real and existential threats that face our nation, which is the purpose of this hearing, this issue consumed most of their time, while I will address this topic further in my questions, it's my sincere hope that we use this hearing to discuss the many foreign threats facing our nation.”

Crawford added that the annual worldwide threats hearings in the House and Senate are intended to provide the American people with the opportunity to hear directly from U.S. intelligence leaders, and focusing too much on the Signal scandal will take away from that opportunity. 

“I have deep concerns about the state of our national security,” Crawford said, citing the involvement of North Korean troops in the Russia-Ukraine war, geopolitical tensions with China and the span of Iran-sponsored terrorist groups across the Middle East. 

Megan Lebowitz

The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Jim Himes, said that "everyone here knows" that Russian or Chinese officials could have obtained messages where details of a military operation were sent out in a Signal chat, saying it was "by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now."

Himes, D-Conn., said that people involved in the chat should "apologize," "own it," and figure out what went wrong and how to prevent it in the future.

"That's not what happened," he added.

Himes also said the U.S. now appears to be on "Team Kremlin," criticizing U.S. officials' perspectives toward the war in Ukraine. He criticized DOGE-related firings and argued that U.S. adversaries "cannot believe their luck."

The Trump administration says travelers' political beliefs are not influencing it to deny entry, deport or detain travelers from Western nations after a spate of incidents, including some searches of electronic devices.

"Allegations that political beliefs trigger inspections or removals are baseless and irresponsible,” Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

The French interior minister alleged that a French researcher had been turned away by U.S. border agents earlier this month after they found messages critical of the Trump administration on his phone. Another case this month involved a Rhode Island doctor, Rasha Alawieh, who was deported to Lebanon despite having a valid U.S. visa.

Both media searches "followed all policies and protocols," CBP Assistant Commissioner Hilton Beckham told NBC News in a statement. Claims that the agency is “searching more electronic media due to the administration change are false,” he added.

"In the cases of the French scientist and Dr. Alawieh, media searches followed all policies and protocols, leading to the discovery of proprietary information from Los Alamo National Laboratory — violating a non-disclosure agreement — and Hezbollah martyr content," Beckham said.

"These searches are conducted to detect digital contraband, terrorism-related content, and information relevant to visitor admissibility," he added.

The Atlantic released details this morning of the top Trump officials' chat that revealed military strike plans to the magazine's editor-in-chief.

The release of the messages in the chat follows repeated denials from the Trump administration that any war plans were discussed on the chat or that the information was classified.

The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg had previously declined to release parts of the conversation, saying that if the messages were read by an adversary, the information "could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel."

The messages released today showed that a text from Defense Secretary Pete  Hegseth about imminent military strikes in Yemen were highly detailed. In them, he laid out the exact timing of the pending strikes. The messages did not include specific targeting locations.

Lawmakers will have another chance to question Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe today about leaked military plans, this time at a House Intelligence Committee hearing. 

The hearing comes one day after the officials — both reportedly members of the Signal group chat reported by The Atlantic — faced pointed questions from Democrats over the group chat's contents and security.

The hearing has an open session beginning at 10 a.m. and a closed-door session for lawmakers at 2 p.m.

Committee Chairman Rick Crawford, R-Ark., has not yet weighed in publicly on The Atlantic's reporting. The top Democrat on the committee, Connecticut Rep. Jim Himes, said he was "horrified" by the report.

"These individuals know the calamitous risks of transmitting classified information across unclassified systems, and they also know that if a lower ranking official under their command did what is described here, they would likely lose their clearance and be subject to criminal investigation," Himes said. "The American people deserve answers, and I plan to get some on Wednesday at the Intelligence Committee's Worldwide Threats hearing."

Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said in an interview that he takes “full responsibility” for a group text that included a journalist while discussing military plans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and top Democrats on the national security committees, are issuing a letter to Trump asking for additional details regarding a text chain about military planning that inadvertently included The Atlantic's top editor.

“Our committees have serious questions about this incident, and members need a full accounting to ensure it never happens again,” the senators wrote.

They expressed their "extreme alarm about the astonishingly poor judgment shown by your Cabinet and national security advisors" following the report about leaked military plans for strikes in Yemen.

"You have long advocated for accountability and transparency in the government, particularly as it relates to the handling of classified information, national security, and the safety of American servicemembers," the senators said. "As such, it is imperative that you address this breach with the seriousness and diligence that it demands."

The senators said that they "expect" that Attorney General Pam Bondi will conduct an investigation "of the conduct of the government officials involved in improperly sharing or discussing such information."

The senators are also seeking the full unredacted transcript of the text chain for the committees to review, asking whether other White House officials are using Signal or other commercial platforms to discuss classified or sensitive information, and urging relevant agencies to preserve documents and correspondences regarding the incident.

In addition to Schumer, the letter was signed by the top Democrats on the Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee and the Appropriations subcommittee on defense.

The latest attempt by conservatives to undermine the federal bureaucracy reaches the Supreme Court today as the justices consider whether the Federal Communications Commission unlawfully wields power through a program that subsidizes telecommunications services in underserved regions.

The court has a 6-3 conservative majority that has in a series of recent decisions undercut the authority of government agencies and advanced a deregulatory agenda largely favored by business interests and Republicans.

The case concerns both whether Congress in a 1996 law exceeded its authority in setting up the Universal Service Fund, which requires telecommunications services to submit payments to subsidize “universal service” in low-income and rural areas.

The Atlantic on Wednesday published a transcript of text messages showing that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth detailed U.S. military attack plans in Yemen in a Signal group chat that inadvertently included the magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg.

In an article titled “Here Are the Attack Plans That Trump's Advisers Shared on Signal,” Goldberg quoted from texts in which Hegseth specified types of U.S. military aircraft and the timing of recent airstrikes against Houthi militias in Yemen. The texts did not include information about specific targets.

“1215et: F-18s LAUNCH (1st strike package),” one of the texts says, referring to a type of military aircraft. “1345: ‘Trigger Based' F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME) — also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s).”

Goldberg and Shane Harris, a national security and intelligence reporter at The Atlantic, published the latest article a day after President Donald Trump's administration attempted to downplay the magazine's first report about the Signal thread.

Trump, asked about the matter on Tuesday, said: “It wasn't classified information.” Hegseth, speaking to reporters Monday, said in part: “Nobody was texting war plans.” 

In testimony at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe both claimed no classified material was shared in the group chat. Ratcliffe said his “communications ... in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.”

The intelligence officials both testified Tuesday that Hegseth was the “original classifying authority” on the chat. 

Goldberg and Harris, in the article published Wednesday, wrote that “statements by Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, and Trump — combined with the assertions made by numerous administration officials that we are lying about the content of the Signal texts — have led us to believe that people should see the texts in order to reach their own conclusions.”

“There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,” Goldberg and Harris added.

Information about an upcoming U.S. military attack on an adversary is typically considered to be classified, according to at least four former national security and intelligence officials who handled legal matters. 

The former officials did not know anything specific about the status of the information in the Signal chat, but they said it would be difficult to imagine a scenario in which details of military operations would not be treated as secret and damaging if disclosed.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt forcefully pushed back against The Atlantic's latest report in a post on X, calling the story a “hoax” written by a “Trump-hater.”

When reached for comment, the White House referred NBC News to Leavitt's post.

Vice President JD Vance, one of the participants in the Signal chat, retweeted a post Wednesday showing The Atlantic called the messages “war plans” in its first report and “attack plans” in its latest report — a distinction the administration has repeatedly made as it suggests the revelations in the messages were not significant.

The National Security Council said Monday it was reviewing how Goldberg was accidentally added to a group text on Signal, an encrypted messaging platform that is widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications but traditionally isn't used for high-level government communications.

“At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,” the National Security Council said in a statement.

Goldberg reported that he had been added to a group chat called “Houthi PC small group” on March 13. He described his initial skepticism, recalling that he discussed with colleagues whether the texts were “part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service, or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization” seeking to embarrass journalists.

When the journalist came to believe the chat was authentic, he left. “No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left — or, more to the point, who I was,” Goldberg wrote.

The incident has provoked intense criticism from Democratic lawmakers, some of whom have called for the resignations of Hegseth and Trump's national security adviser, Michael Waltz. (Goldberg has said a Signal user named “Michael Waltz” added him to the chat in the first place.)

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday that he believes Gabbard and Ratcliffe “intentionally misled Congress yesterday in trying to make us believe that this was a casual conversation.”

“This is a serious life and death matter and should be treated as such," Durbin wrote in a statement posted on X.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said Wednesday he would request an “expedited” Inspector General report into the matter.

When asked directly whether he believes the information discussed in the chat is — or should be — classified, Wicker replied: “The information as published recently appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.”

Gabbard, testifying before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, said the leaked group text chat was a mistake but reiterated her claim that no classified information was shared on the chain.

“The president and national security adviser Waltz held a press conference yesterday with a clear message [that] it was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal chat with high-level national security principals having a policy discussion about imminent strikes against the Houthis and the effects of the strike,” Gabbard said.

She said the National Security Council was “conducting an in-depth review, along with technical experts working to determine how this reporter was inadvertently added to this chat.”

In a testy exchange with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insist that no classified information was shared in the group chat about U.S. war plans that was sent to a journalist.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Wednesday it was a “mistake” for national security officials to discuss sensitive military plans on a group text chain that also included a journalist — a leak that has roiled President Donald Trump's national security leadership.

Speaking before the House Intelligence Committee, Gabbard said the conversation included “candid and sensitive” information about military strikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen. But as she told senators during testimony on Tuesday, she said the texts did not contain any classified information.

“It was a mistake that a reporter was inadvertently added,” Gabbard said.

Wednesday's hearing was called to discuss an updated report on national security threats facing the U.S. Instead, much of the focus was on the text chain, which included Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance and other top officials.

Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, was also added, and on Wednesday his publication released more details from the chats, showing the level of detail they offered about the strikes.

Democrats have demanded an investigation into the sloppy communication, saying it may have exposed sensitive military information that could have jeopardized the mission or put U.S. service members at risk.

The National Security Council has said it will investigate the matter, which Trump on Tuesday downplayed as a “glitch.” Goldberg said he received the Signal invitation from Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser, who was in the group chat and has taken responsibility for the lapse.




Even though the texts contained detailed information on military actions, Gabbard, Ratcliffe and the White House have all said none of the information was classified — an assertion Democrats flatly rejected on Wednesday.

“You all know that's a lie,” Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, told Ratcliffe and Gabbard, who said that any decisions to classify or declassify military information falls to the secretary of defense.

Several Democrats on the panel said Hegseth should resign because of the leak.

“This is classified information. It's a weapon system, as well as a sequence of strikes, as well as details of the operations,” said Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat from Illinois. “He needs to resign immediately.”

Ratcliffe defended his use of Signal as “appropriate” and said questions over the Signal leak have overshadowed the military operation targeting the Houthis. 

“What is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,” he told lawmakers. “That's what did happen, not what possibly could have happened.”

The discussion at times grew heated as Ratcliffe and Democratic lawmakers spoke over one another. At one point, Rep. Jimmy Gomez, an Illinois Democrat, asked whether he knew whether Hegseth was drinking alcohol when he participated in the chat.

“I think that's an offensive line of questioning,” Ratcliffe angrily replied. “The answer is no.”

Ratcliffe and Gomez then began shouting over each other as Gomez sought to ask a follow-up question. “We want to know if his performance is compromised,” Gomez said.

Wednesday's hearing was called to discuss the intelligence community's annual report on threats to American national security. The report lists China, Russia, Iran and North Korea as strategic adversaries, and notes that drug cartels and transnational criminal organizations pose other threats to Americans.

The presentations from top Trump appointees reflect Trump's foreign policy priorities, including a focus on combating the flow of fentanyl, illegal immigration and human trafficking, and are taking place as Trump attempts to work out a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine three years after Russia's invasion.

Lunch Break: The Atlantic Has Receipts

National security adviser Michael Waltz, left, Vice President JD Vance, center, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in the Oval Office on March 13.

There's an old saying somewhere: ‘Don't poke the bear if the bear has the receipts.'

And after the Trump administration spent much of yesterday insisting the contents of the Signal group chat inadvertently leaked to an editor at The Atlantic were not classified, the outlet dropped the receipts, releasing a full, minimally redacted version of the messages this morning.

The release came just hours before Trump cabinet officials like Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and FBI Director Kash Patel began their testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.

Some Democrats have begun calling for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's resignation over Signalgate, and the rest of Washington – including President Donald Trump, who has a light public schedule again today – will be watching with bated breath to see what happens next.

Here's the lunchtime lowdown, which U.S. News will be publishing each weekday to keep track of the goings-on in Washington and beyond:

The Atlantic published the full text thread from the infamous group chat that detailed U.S. military strikes carried out against the Houthis in Yemen. In the newly public texts, Hegseth can be seen sharing extraordinary details like “Weather is FAVORABLE. Just CONFIRMED w/CENTCOM we are a GO for mission launch,” and “1415: Strike Drones on Target (THIS IS WHEN THE FIRST BOMBS WILL DEFINITELY DROP, pending earlier ‘Trigger Based' targets).” Read more.

Several members of Trump's national security team are facing the House Intelligence Committee today, including Gabbard, Patel and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, where they are being grilled on that group chat. Gabbard admitted that accidentally adding the reporter was a “mistake” but maintained that no classified information was compromised. Read more.

District Judge James Boasberg, who has drawn the Trump administration's ire for his handling of a lawsuit over deportation flights, was assigned a lawsuit over Signalgate this morning filed by watchdog group American Oversight. The organization's suit against Hegseth, Gabbard, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and others argues their use of Signal violated federal record-keeping laws, as some of the messages were reportedly set to auto-delete, among other violations. Read more.

Chief executives from NPR and PBS are defending their funding and pushing back against accusations of bias in a heated congressional hearing today. At it, NPR's CEO and President Katherine Maher admitted she regretted calling Trump a “racist” and “sociopath” on social media in 2020, while PBS chief Paula Kerger defended the outlet's handling of a presidential debate and other coverage. Meanwhile, the director of Voice of America – another federally funded media outlet – filed a lawsuit today over its intended shuttering. Read more.

Democrats in Pennsylvania won a special election in state House race to ensure they keep majority control of the chamber by a single representative, and appeared to flip a state Senate race in a deep red district.The latter result was cheered by high-profile Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who are eager for wins amid a Republican trifecta at the federal level. Read more.

Washington — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal that included sensitive details about military strikes in Yemen after more text messages came to light and revealed new details about what was shared.

The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.

Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.

Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic published additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used. 

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information "could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel." The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.

At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk. 

"Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships," Himes said. 

Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was "sensitive" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat. 

"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared," she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that "war plans" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.

Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, "information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification. 

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that "information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security." Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if "its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations."

"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information," Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts. 

Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.

"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success," Ratcliffe said.

Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been "much less sensitive" information presented to lawmakers that has "high classification."

"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous," he said. 

Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, "not necessarily based off the content." 

Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss "the real and existential threats that face our nation" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat. 

One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending the texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, "I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!" 

"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!" Gomez said during the heated back and forth. 

Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.

Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed. 

"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?" Kelly said. 

"I don't remember mention of specific targets," Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was "consistent with my recollection."

Gabbard also said she didn't recall "specific names of systems or weapons being used or named," which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used. 

Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would "look into" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak. 

This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. 

"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally," the assessment says. 

According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries. 

Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, "Russia has proven adaptable and resilient" and its air forces are "more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion," the assessment says. 

"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war," the report says. "This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned." 

It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power "probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule." 

China is viewed as "most capable" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses "the most comprehensive and robust" military threat to U.S. national security and the "most active and persistent" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being "more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive." 

The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island. 

Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran. 

The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, "though pressure has probably built on him to do so." 

In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un is increasing his stockpile of nuclear warheads and has "no intention of negotiating away his strategic weapons programs, which he perceives as a guarantor of regime security and national pride."

President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials — and inadvertently, one journalist — on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed. 

Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning. 

Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the "Houthi PC small group" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.

The National Security Council told CBS News on Monday that the group chat "appears to be authentic."

Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, or whether he had the device with him in Russia, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a social media post Wednesday that Witkoff, "was provided a secure line of communication by the U.S. Government, and it was the only phone he had in his possession while in Moscow."

Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he "had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip."

"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised," Witkoff said.

The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. Speaking Wednesday during a congressional hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said "the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices." 

On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying no "war plans" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had "provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible."

Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing on worldwide security threats  that was continuing on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.

U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own report for The Atlantic. 

During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.

Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin. The White House did not immediately reply to CBS News' questions about the meeting or whether Witkoff had his device at the Kremlin.

Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News. 

Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, "is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue."  

The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.

The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of "increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services."

Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the  phishing links being opened.

Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News. 

One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.

While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, "often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security." 

While the risk is minimal to members of the public, he said "the more secure those conversations are, or the sensitivity of them is greater, you have to increase the inconvenience, because the security has to be paramount."

            For Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and other House Republicans, today's DOGE subcommittee hearing is about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding.
    


            For the broadcasters, today is about defending their existence – and maybe, just maybe, educating people about how public media actually works.
    


            What will win the day? National political noise or local media impact?
    


            The hearing, titled “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,” started at 10 a.m. ET. NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger are both testifying. So are a local station operator and a conservative critic of taxpayer-funded media.
    


            The hearing is meant to advance long-held Republican arguments against PBS and NPR.
    


            Taylor-Greene opened Wednesday's DOGE subcommittee by branding PBS and NPR “radical left-wing echo chambers” before accusing the public broadcasters of “grooming and sexualizing” children, using DEI for news standards and listener demographics, and wasting taxpayer dollars.
    


            “For too long, taxpayers have been asked to fund biased news. this needs to end, and it needs to end now,” Taylor-Greene said as in her opening remarks.
    


            President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the networks are a “waste of money” and claimed “he would love to” defund them. And yet the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this month included $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations.
    


            Congress budgets money for CPB two years in advance, so the recent bill means public broadcasting is funded through 2027.
    


            So on one level, today's hearing is a theatrical performance. But PBS and NPR leaders are taking it seriously. They have been preparing for the Republican interrogation for weeks. And they want to use the opportunity to justify the federal funding.
    


            Local TV and radio stations are doing the same. From North Country Public Radio in upstate New York, to New Mexico PBS in Albuquerque, to Hawaiʻi Public Radio in Honolulu, publicly supported stations are using the right's political attacks to galvanize grassroots support and raise money from donors.
    


            This is a “a critical moment for KQED,” an email from the SF radio station said yesterday. DOGE has “set its sights on public media,” an article from Rocky Mountain PBS explained. “Our future is in peril,” a letter from WBUR in Boston exclaimed.
    


            WBUR CEO Margaret Low wrote that the political threats – including the FCC chair's probe of PBS and NPR sponsorship practices – compound the “business model challenges that just about every news organization faces.” It's fundraising drive season, so her letter understandably urged supporters to donate.
    


            The letters and Q&As have had common themes: Explaining how taxpayer money trickles down to broadcasters and emphasizing the local benefits. Hawaiʻi Public Radio CEO Meredith Artley, the former editor in chief of CNN Digital, wrote that her news and classical music stations are “94% community supported,” with the remaining 6% coming from CPB.
    


            If the federal funds were diminished, the Hawaii stations would survive, but “there would likely be damage to the nationwide system that provides programming and infrastructure that HPR and many other stations rely on,” she wrote.
    


            That's the key point: It's a system. And smaller stations tend to need more help from the system. At KTOO Public Media in Alaska, for example, fully 30% of the budget comes from CPB. “This federal funding is essential in ensuring that Juneau's only local-owned newsroom can continue to deliver you the news from our community,” the station said.
    


            Stations large and small are highlighting their local responsibilities.
    


            “Whatever happens in Washington, DC—WQED is not going anywhere,” Jason Jedlinski, CEO of Pittsburgh's PBS station, wrote on LinkedIn.

US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News on Tuesday that he takes "full responsibility" for a group chat in which US officials discussed air strikes in Yemen in the company of journalist Jeffrey Goldberg who was inadvertently added.

The White House said Monday the group chat "appears to be authentic."

The Trump administration is under scrutiny after The Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg said he was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat that included top national security officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, in which the officials discussed plans for a U.S. attack on Houthis in Yemen.

Goldberg revealed the mishap in a piece for the magazine on Monday and told ABC News that he was apparently added to the chat by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz.

Goldberg provided two screenshots in the magazine piece and did not provide details or quotes, only a description of the operational part of the Signal message chain.

Both the Trump administration and top officials involved have repeatedly denied that war plans or classified information were discussed, as Goldberg reported.

Below is a timeline spanning from the creation of the group chat to what has happened since.

In an interview with "ABC News Live" Monday evening, Goldberg told Linsey Davis he received a message request on the Signal app from White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, or someone "who's purporting to be Mike Waltz" on March 11.

He said the invitation was "not an unusual thing in Washington."

"I'm a journalist, I've met him in the past, so I accept it," he told ABC News.

Goldberg said he accepted the request, with nothing occurring until several days later, when he was added to a "group of seemingly very high national security officials of the United States" including Vice President JD Vance, with Waltz apparently creating this chat.

"Mike Waltz puts this group together and says it's a planning group for essentially upcoming action in Yemen," Goldberg said.

Goldberg told ABC News he initially thought it was a hoax since it would be "completely absurd to me that the national security leadership of the United States would be meeting on a messaging app to discuss forthcoming military action, and that then they would also invite the editor of The Atlantic magazine to that conversation."

Goldberg told ABC News a "long conversation" occurred between the group chat members on March 14, discussing "whether or not they should or shouldn't take action in Yemen."

The messages went back and forth with "a lot of resentment directed at European allies of the United States, which obviously enhanced the credibility of this chain," Goldberg said.

He told ABC News at this point the members of the chat sounded like people he knew within the administration, but still was not sure whether or not it was a hoax.

Goldberg told ABC News he continued to track the incoming messages from the group chat, to see "who was trying to entrap me or trick me." Then on March 15, he said it became "overwhelmingly clear" it was a legitimate group chat, he told ABC News.

At 11:44 a.m., he said he received a text in the chain from someone claiming to be Hegseth, or "somebody identified as Pete," providing what Goldberg characterized as a war plan. The message included a "sequencing of events related to an upcoming attack on Yemen" and promised results by 1:45 p.m. Eastern time.

Goldberg told ABC News he was in his car and waiting with his phone to "see if this was a real thing."

"Sure enough, around 1:50 [p.m.] Eastern time, I see that Yemen is under attack," he said.

When the attacks seemed to be "going well," Goldberg told ABC News that members of the chat began sending congratulatory messages along with fist, fire and American flag emojis.

"That was the day I realized this is possibly unbelievably the leaders of the United States discussing this on my messaging app," Goldberg told ABC News. "My reaction was, I think I've discovered a massive security breach in the United States national security system."

Goldberg told ABC News he removed himself from the group chat once the operation was completed.

"I watched this Yemen operation go from beginning to apparent end, and that was enough for me to learn that there's something wrong in the system here that would allow this information to come so dangerously close to the open wild," Goldberg said.

Waltz appeared on ABC's "This Week" the day after the strikes on Yemen and said the U.S. airstrikes "took out" multiple leaders of the Iranian-backed Houthis, which he said differed from the Biden administration's launches against the group.

"These were not kind of pinprick, back and forth — what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks," Waltz said. "This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted Houthi leaders and took them out. And the difference here is, one, going after the Houthi leadership, and two, holding Iran responsible."

Goldberg published a story in The Atlantic revealing the mishap, in a piece titled "The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans."

Shortly after the story's publication on Monday afternoon, White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes shared with ABC News the statement he provided to The Atlantic confirming the authenticity of the Signal group chat.

"At this time, the message thread that was reported appears to be authentic, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain. The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to our servicemembers or our national security," Hughes said in a statement.

Speaking to reporters Monday, Hegseth denied he sent war plans in the chat.

"I've heard how it was characterized. Nobody was texting war plans, and that's all I have to say about that," Hegseth told reporters in Honolulu while on a layover on his trip to Asia.

Hegseth called Goldberg a "deceitful and highly discredited, so-called journalist who's made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again."

"This is the guy that pedals in garbage. This is what he does," Hegseth said about Goldberg.

During an event at the White House on Monday, President Donald Trump was asked about Goldberg's article. "I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic," he said.

Top Democrats including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries voiced outrage at the administration after this mishap.

"It is yet another unprecedented example that our nation is increasingly more dangerous because of the elevation of reckless and mediocre individuals, including the Secretary of Defense," Jeffries said in a statement on Monday.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who faced scrutiny over her alleged use of a private email server while at the State Department, shared her reaction to the Signal group chat on X: "You have got to be kidding me."

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also criticized this apparent breach of military intelligence, urging Senate Republicans to work with Democrats in a "full investigation" to look into how this incident occurred.

"If you were up in arms over unsecure emails years ago, you should certainly be outraged by this amateurish behavior," Schumer said on the Senate floor, referencing the scandal over Clinton's emails.

On Tuesday morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Goldberg is "well-known for his sensationalist spin" and emphasized that "no 'war plans' were discussed."

"As the National Security Council stated, the White House is looking into how Goldberg's number was inadvertently added to the thread. Thanks to the strong and decisive leadership of President Trump, and everyone in the group, the Houthi strikes were successful and effective. Terrorists were killed and that's what matters most to President Trump," Leavitt shared on X.

Trump told NBC News he remains confident in Waltz even after the use of an unsecured group chat.

"Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man," Trump told NBC correspondent Garrett Haake.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe were grilled by Democratic Sen. Mark Warner on Tuesday regarding the mishap. Both officials said while testifying before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence there was no classified information on the chain.

Ratcliffe said he believed the "national security adviser intended this to be as it should have been, a mechanism for coordinating between senior level officials, but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications for anything that would be classified."

Speaker Mike Johnson continued to downplay the mishap but admitted the breach was a "serious" mistake on Tuesday.

"Look, they have acknowledged that there is an error, and they are correcting it. And I would've asked the same thing of the Biden administration," Johnson said during a news conference Tuesday morning.

During a White House meeting with ambassadors on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said this incident is "just something that can happen" and that there was "no classified information" in the group chat.

He added that Signal is "not a perfect technology."

"Sometimes somebody can get onto those things," Trump said. "That's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones on, which is always the best, frankly."

Waltz said the White House's tech and legal teams are looking into the mishap.

"No one in your national security team would ever put anyone in danger," Waltz said.

He also claimed to have never met Goldberg.

"We are looking into him, reviewing how the heck he got into this room," Waltz said.

A spokesperson for The Atlantic released a statement on Tuesday night following the comments from Trump and his aides.

"Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and other in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans," the magazine said.

The statement went on to say that "any responsible national security expert would consider the information contained in this Signal chat to be of the greatest sensitivity, and would agree that this information should never be shared on non-government messaging apps."

Schumer and other top Senate Democrats on national security committees wrote a letter to Trump seeking more information about the mishap, requesting a "complete and unredacted" transcript of the Signal group chat for the appropriate committees to review in a secure setting.

"We write to you with extreme alarm about the astonishingly poor judgment shown by your Cabinet and national security advisors," the Senators wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by ABC News. "You have long advocated for accountability and transparency in the government, particularly as it relates to the handling of classified information, national security and the safety of American servicemembers. As such, it is imperative that you address this breach with the seriousness and diligence that it demands."

The Atlantic on Wednesday published a new article detailing purported information about recent American strikes in Yemen it says was accidentally shared in the Signal group chat.

The article suggested that Hegseth updated members of the "Houthi PC small group" Signal chat on "favorable" weather conditions ahead of planned airstrikes on Houthi leaders and other targets in Yemen.

The article said Hegseth also notified the group of a planned timeline for flights of F-18 strike aircraft, MQ-9 Reaper drones and Tomahawk cruise missiles that were launched for the mission.

Shortly after the article was published, Leavitt said in a post on X "these were NOT 'war plans.'"

"This entire story was another hoax written by a Trump-hater who is well-known for his sensationalist spin," the White House press secretary said.

Waltz said Wednesday morning that the chat didn't include war plans or specific details about the strike.

"No locations. No sources & methods. NO WAR PLANS. Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent. BOTTOM LINE: President Trump is protecting America and our interests," Waltz posted on X.

Also on Wednesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg was assigned to a federal lawsuit against five Cabinet members over the administration's use of Signal. Boasberg is also handling the case against the Trump administration over its deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act.

The lawsuit — which names Hegseth, Gabbard, Ratcliffe, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the National Archives as defendants — asked a federal judge to declare the use of Signal unlawful and order the cabinet members to preserve the records immediately.

ABC News' Peter Charalambous, Fritz Farrow, Anne Flaherty, Luis Martinez, Isabella Murray, Allison Pecorin, Lauren Peller, Olivia Rubin, Michelle Stoddart, Selina Wang and Kelsey Walsh contributed to this report.

            Rep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene on Wednesday used a DOGE subcommittee hearing to call for the defunding and dismantling of the company that provides NPR and PBS with federal funds.
    


            For Taylor-Greene and other House Republicans, today's hearing was about tarnishing PBS and NPR with accusations of bias and targeting them for defunding. For the broadcasters, today was about defending their existence.
    


            The hearing, titled “Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,” started at 10 am ET, and featured testimony from NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS CEO Paula Kerger, as well as a local station operator and a conservative critic of taxpayer-funded media.
    


            The hearing, which was chaired by Taylor-Greene, was meant to advance long-held Republican arguments against PBS and NPR, including that their programming is “communist.”
    


            In the final minutes of the two-hour hearing that saw repeated conservative attacks on the public broadcasters, Taylor-Greene said that “we can look no further than the Corporation for Public Broadcasting” as the culprit for US debt.
    


            “After listening to what we've heard, today, we will be calling for the complete and total defund and dismantling of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” Taylor-Greene said.
    


            President Donald Trump on said Tuesday that the networks are a “waste of money” and claimed “he would love to” defund them. And yet the funding bill passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump earlier this month included $535 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity that disburses funds to 1,500 local radio and TV stations. Congress budgets money for CPB two years in advance, so the recent bill means public broadcasting is funded through 2027.
    


            Throughout the hearing, legislators pressed Maher and Kruger on their roles in allegedly circulating disinformation, accusing the pair of fostering newsrooms that cater to elite audiences.
    


            “NPR and PBS have increasingly become radical left-wing echo chambers for a narrow audience of mostly wealthy, white urban liberals and progressives who generally look down on and judge rural America,” Taylor-Greene said at the hearing's overture before accusing the pair of “grooming and sexualizing” children, using DEI for listener demographics, and wasting taxpayer dollars.
    


            Maher and Kruger also faced attacks from Rep. James Comer, who, in addition to accusing NPR and PBS of peddling “disinformation” and “propaganda,” claimed the public broadcasters are obsolete in an age marked by a “menu of media options” that includes podcasts and satellite radio.
    


            Congressional Republicans repeatedly peppered Maher and Kruger with accusations regarding their coverage of the COVID-19 origins lab leak theory, Russian collusion, and Hunter Biden's laptop.
    


            Maher said that the public broadcaster was “mistaken” in “failing” to cover the Hunter Biden laptop story sooner and more aggressively. When Cloud asked Maher about the lab leak theory, the NPR boss emphasized that the outlet's current editorial leadership recognizes that “the new CIA evidence is worthy of coverage,” stressing that it has reported just that.
    


            Maher and Kruger spent the two-hour hearing defending their respective organizations, pushing back against conservative claims by stressing that most Americans trust public broadcasters to service local communities and provide a wide variety of reporting and educational programming. To elucidate her point, Maher noted that more than 60% of all Americans — and more than half of Republicans — trust public broadcasting to deliver fact-based news. Kruger noted “there's nothing more American than PBS as a membership organization.”
    


            Local TV and radio stations also used the opportunity to justify their federal funding. From North Country Public Radio in upstate New York, to New Mexico PBS in Albuquerque, to Hawaiʻi Public Radio in Honolulu, publicly supported stations are using the right's political attacks to galvanize grassroots support and raise money from donors.
    


            Hawaiʻi Public Radio CEO Meredith Artley, the former editor in chief of CNN Digital, wrote that her news and classical music stations are “94% community supported,” with the remaining 6% coming from CPB. If the federal funds were diminished, the Hawaii stations would survive, but “there would likely be damage to the nationwide system that provides programming and infrastructure that HPR and many other stations rely on,” she wrote.
    


            That's the key point: It's a system. And smaller stations tend to need more help from the system. At KTOO Public Media in Alaska, for example, fully 30% of the budget comes from CPB. “This federal funding is essential in ensuring that Juneau's only local-owned newsroom can continue to deliver you the news from our community,” the station said.
    


            Congressional Democrats came to the public broadcasters' aid throughout the hearing, stressing that journalism and the free press are currently under attack by “extremists” and are needed “more than ever.”
    


            “Public broadcasting is a tool for education, for emergencies, and a cherished part of our national fabric,” Rep. Robert Garcia said. “The majority and our chairwoman should drop this attempt to silence media voices they don't like.”
    


            Rep. Greg Casar chastised the committee for focusing on defunding NPR and PBS instead of DOGE's head, Elon Musk, whose companies — which include X, SpaceX, Tesla, and Starlink — make billions each year while still taking home $3 billion per year in government contracts.
    


            “That's six times the money that goes to all of public broadcasting. Private insurers and Medicare Advantage overcharged taxpayers $83 billion,” Casar said. “Just last year, that could pay for public broadcasting 160 times over.”
    


            “To borrow a phrase from Sesame Street, the letter of the day is C and it stands for corruption,” he said.
    


            Press freedom groups have also defended the public broadcasters. Ahead of the hearing, the Center for Democracy & Technology's president and chief executive, Alexandra Reeve Givens, called the meeting an attempt by the Trump administration “to bully their perceived enemies and silence legitimate journalism.” Reporters Without Borders executive director Clayton Weimars said he was “deeply concerned the House hearing on bias in NPR and PBS is a political stunt that will create a slippery slope towards politicians dictating the programming of public news outlets.”
    


            Stations large and small also highlighted their local responsibilities.
    


            “Whatever happens in Washington, DC — WQED is not going anywhere,” Jason Jedlinski, CEO of Pittsburgh's PBS station, wrote on LinkedIn. His post listed recent features (segments about a local farm, a reading club, and so on) that, quite frankly, few other media outlets would spend time on.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., calls for pulling money away from colleges that 'coddle' left-wing protesters who target Jewish Americans on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

FIRST ON FOX – Sen. Josh Hawley asked FBI Director Kash Patel Wednesday to look into alleged Biden-era abuses against Christians, urging Patel in a new letter to crack down on what the Missouri Republican described as First Amendment violations he said were carried out under the Biden administration.

In the letter, previewed exclusively by Fox News Digital, the Missouri Republican asked Patel to investigate alleged abuses against pro-life activists and Christians. He also urged Patel to release by April 30 information compiled by the FBI's Richmond, Virginia, field office – including a memo that labeled certain traditionalist Catholics as potential "security risks" – and to address possible violations of the FACE Act, which Hawley said targeted pro-life protesters.

"I trust that, under your leadership, this misconduct will end. But those responsible must be held accountable," Hawley said in the letter.

"Transparency and accountability will be paramount in restoring Americans' faith in the Bureau," he added. "Getting to the bottom of the Biden Administration's violations of religious liberty is an excellent place to start."

The letter from Hawley, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, is not the first time he has used his post to urge Patel to protect against Christian persecution.

Hawley's letter calls on the FBI to share with his office by the end of April a list of 22 memos and documents compiled by the FBI Richmond Field Office and related to the alleged FACE Act abuses, including all emails, memoranda, directives and policy guidance, sent to or from the FBI director, deputy director, or any other senior official regarding the enforcement of the FACE Act under the Biden Administration. 

Hawley also urged Patel to share all documents – including communications with state and local law enforcement agencies – that discuss how the Richmond Field Office memorandum or similar FBI policies were implemented or considered for enforcement at the state or local level.

Hawley zeroed in on these issues during Patel's confirmation hearing earlier this year.

"Do you think it's appropriate for the FBI to single out and target people of faith in order to discourage the exercise of their First Amendment rights?" he asked Patel in January. 

Patel vowed in response that he would "fully utilize, if confirmed, the investigative powers of the FBI to give you the information you require and also to hold those accountable who violated the sacred trust placed upon the FBI."

US National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has taken responsibility for a group chat in which high-ranking officials planned military strikes in Yemen in the company of a  journalist who was inadvertently added.

"I take full responsibility. I built the group," Waltz told Fox News on Tuesday, adding it was "embarrassing". 

President Donald Trump and US intelligence chiefs have downplayed the security risks and said no classified material was shared.

But Democrats and some Republicans have called for an investigation into what several lawmakers have described as a major breach.

Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he was accidentally added to the Signal chat by a user named Mike Waltz.

In his article that broke the story he says he saw classified military plans for US strikes in Yemen, including weapons packages, targets and timing, two hours before the bombs struck. That content was held back from the piece.





Waltz was unable to explain in his Fox News interview how Goldberg came to be on the chat but - contradicting Trump - he said a member of his staff was not responsible and another, unnamed contact of his was supposed to be there in Goldberg's place.

"We've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened," Waltz continued, adding that Goldberg's number had not been on his phone.

"I can tell you for 100% I don't know this guy," Waltz said, adding that he had spoken to Elon Musk for help in finding out what happened.

When pressed further by show host Laura Ingraham on how the number got added, Waltz responded: "Well, if you have somebody else's contact, then somehow it … gets sucked in. It gets sucked in."

President Trump has played down the incident, calling it a "glitch" that had "no impact at all" operationally. 

Speaking to Newsmax, Trump said somebody who worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level had Goldberg's phone number.

US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe denied at a Senate hearing on Tuesday that any classified information was shared in the message chain.

But Democrats questioned that, given the reporting from Goldberg, and asked them to release all the information if it was not classified.

The Signal group chat also included accounts identified as being Vice-President JD Vance and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Mark Warner, Democratic vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: "This Signal chat situation sheds light on a sloppy and grossly incompetent national security strategy from the Trump administration."

In his reporting, Goldberg said the officials on the chat had discussed the potential for Europe to pay for US protection of key shipping lanes.

"Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes," the account associated with Waltz wrote on 14 March.

He added his team was working with the defence and state departments "to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans" - at Trump's request.

At one point in the thread the Vance account griped that the strikes would benefit the Europeans, because of their reliance on those shipping lanes, adding: "I just hate bailing Europe out again."

The user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: "VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC."



The revelation has sent shockwaves through Washington, prompting a lawsuit and questions about why high-ranking officials discussed such sensitive matters on a potentially vulnerable civilian app.

Some national security experts have argued that the leak was a major operational lapse, and archive experts warned that it violated laws on presidential record keeping.

American Oversight, non-partisan watchdog group, sued the officials who participated in the chat for alleged violations of the Federal Records Act and Administrative Procedure Act.

The group said that by setting the chat to automatically delete messages, the group violated a law requiring White House officials to submit their records to the National Archives.

The National Security Agency warned employees only last month of vulnerabilities in Signal, according to documents obtained by the BBC's US partner CBS.

National intelligence head Tusli Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe argue ‘no classified information' was leaked

US intelligence chiefs on Wednesday denied breaking the law or revealing classified information in a group chat where they discussed details of air strikes on Yemen in the presence of a journalist, despite allegations from Democrats that the leak was reckless and possibly illegal.

Director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe were giving their second day of congressional testimony on global threats facing the United States, which Democratic lawmakers seized on to condemn their use of the Signal app to discuss arrangements to bomb the Houthis in a group that included Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic.

The hearing before the House intelligence committee took place less than two hours after the Atlantic released a full transcript of the chat, which revealed that defense secretary Pete Hegseth had shared in the group timings of the air strikes and the weapons that would be used.

“Now we come to learn that people in the most dangerous and sensitive jobs on the planet put extremely specific predecisional discussions about a military attack on Signal, which could be intercepted by the Russians and the Chinese,” the committee's top Democrat Jim Himes said. “Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships.

“I think that it's by the awesome grace of God that we are not mourning dead pilots right now.”

In an appearance before the Senate the day prior, Gabbard had said that the chat did not contain details of the strikes' timing, targets or weapons used – an assertion that Himes said was contradicted by the Atlantic's transcript.

“My answer yesterday was based on my recollection, or the lack thereof, on the details that were posted there,” Gabbard said, adding that she was “not directly involved with that part of the Signal chat”.

She sought to downplay the severity of the leak, saying the Signal chat was “a policy discussion” to which Goldberg “was inadvertently added”.

“The conversation was candid and sensitive, but as the president [and] national security adviser stated, no classified information was shared. There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,” Gabbard said.

Ratcliffe argued that Signal was “an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information”, despite earlier warnings from the defense department that it could be targeted by Russian hackers.

“I didn't transfer any classified information. And at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,” the CIA director said.

Democrats countered that what was revealed in the group was classified. Raja Krishnamoorthi had an aide hold up the printed Signal messages in which Hegseth shared exact details of the strikes.

“This is classified information. It's a weapon system as well as sequence of strikes, as well as details about the operations,” Krishnamoorthi said. “This text message is clearly classified information. Secretary Hegseth has disclosed military plans as well as classified information. He needs to resign immediately.”

Republicans refuted the claims by having Ratcliffe and Gabbard note that details such as the names of the targets or specific locations were not revealed in the chat.

“The Democrats are obviously making the assertions that what was in the Signal chat was classified, and claiming that secretary Hegseth put this war plan out to the world, which he clearly did not,” the Florida Republican Greg Steube said.

Democrats have been reeling in the months since Donald Trump won the November election and Republicans clinched majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, but the emergence of the Signal chat has provided them with an opportunity to paint the new administration as reckless.

Democratic congressman Jimmy Gomez prompted fury from the witnesses when he asked Gabbard and Ratcliffe if they knew whether Hegseth, who pledged not to consume alcohol during his confirmation process after reports emerged that he had a history of excessive drinking, may have been under the influence when using the chat.

“I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no,” Ratcliffe replied.

When Ratcliffe and Gabbard appeared before a Senate intelligence committee hearing on Tuesday, Democrats questioned them extensively about the Signal group, while Republicans either avoided the topic or said they would ask about it in a private session. In the day since, some Republican senators said they would demand the Trump administration investigate the group chat, while others have restated their support for Trump's national security team.

“I think President Trump has handled this matter well,” Republican senator Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday. “Further, I believe that all the participants in the chat were under the impression they were using an appropriate and secure form of communication. This will also fall into the category of ‘lessons learned'.”

WASHINGTON – It's the kind of security breach – and screw-up – that even Hollywood producers wouldn't dare conjure: All the nation's top national security leaders gathering in a commercial messaging app to discuss active, highly classified military plans and operations, and they don't even notice that one of the nation's best investigative journalists has “inadvertently” been invited to join them. 

Welcome to Day Three of "SignalGate," the fast-growing political controversy over at least 18 Trump administration officials' use of an unsecured Signal chat to discuss real-time attacks on Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month – as journalist Jeffrey Goldberg took notes for a magazine article he later published.

And more questions are arising, seemingly by the hour, despite an administration scramble to tamp down what national security experts say is one of the most serious White House national security breaches in years, if not decades.

Speculation about what was discussed in the group chat that included Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Cabinet-level officials has exploded since the online publication of the bombshell article, “The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans.”

In it, Goldberg, the prize-winning editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, disclosed that “U.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen."

"I didn't think it could be real," he wrote. "Then the bombs started falling.”

Goldberg strongly hinted that he withheld classified information discussed in the chat, including messages from Hegseth that disclosed "precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing."  

In response, Trump and other White House officials insisted Tuesday that no classified information was shared in the chat.

Two of the participants, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, made similar denials during several hours of questioning Tuesday by Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Today, Gabbard and Ratcliffe expected to undergo a similar grilling by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee, which – like the Senate committee – long ago had scheduled its annual hearing on worldwide threats.

Here are some of the questions that are likely to come up:

It is a federal crime to discuss or release classified information in an unsecured and unapproved setting.

Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the committee, excoriated the two top intelligence officials for denying they discussed classified war planning while refusing to provide details.

“If it's not classified,” Warner said, “share the texts with the committee.”

Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff was even more direct in vowing to get to the bottom of whether the security breach violated laws like the Espionage Act, which prohibits gathering, transmitting or losing national defense information. 

“This is utterly unprofessional. There's been no apology; there has been no recognition of the gravity of this error,” Ossoff said. “And by the way, we will get the full transcript of this chain, and your testimony will be measured carefully against its content.”

Democratic lawmakers also noted that some in the chat were being hypocrites for having called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's prosecution for using a personal server to send government emails while they were now insisting they did nothing wrong.

That question cuts to the heart of the controversy of whether there was any damage to U.S. national security.

President Donald Trump and his supporters deny that and accused Democrats of unfairly politicizing a successful military strike against an Iran-backed group that has been attacking U.S. ships off the Yemen coast.

But some Democratic lawmakers attacked chat participants for discussing military operations ahead of time that could have gotten U.S. troops killed if those details fell into the wrong hands.

“Putting a reporter in a Signal chat where you're planning airstrikes, that's careless,” Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly said on X after the hearing. “Sharing information that puts our pilots' lives at risk − that's reckless.”

Also, because Signal uses only end-to-end encryption, or protecting messages in the process of being sent. That means the chat could have been accessed by Russia, China, Iran or any other U.S. adversary by hacking just one phone or laptop of the participants, former U.S. intelligence and national security officials tell USA TODAY.

That's one reason U.S. officials are required to use more secure government-approved communications channels when discussing military operations, former National Security Agency official Gavin Wilde and other experts told USA TODAY.

Russia's intelligence services in particular have been ramping up efforts to target Signal for intelligence collection, Google's Threat Intelligence Group warned last month.

And in a bulletin last month, the NSA itself warned its employees of vulnerabilities in using Signal that have made it "a high value target to intercept sensitive information" by spies and criminals, according to a CBS News report citing internal NSA documents. 

Compounding that concern is the fact that Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate tycoon and Trump golfing buddy and diplomatic envoy, was meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin while he was in the chat group, discussing a resolution of his country's war against Ukraine.

Was Ratcliffe aware of that Witkoff “was in Moscow on this thread while you were as director of the CIA participating in this thread?” Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., asked in Tuesday's hearing.

“I'm not aware of that today,” Ratcliffe responded.

“This sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies and the personnel who work for them is entirely unacceptable,” Bennet shot back. “It's an embarrassment. You need to do better.”

There appears to be plenty of blame to go around.National Security Adviser Mike Waltz was the one who invited Goldberg to connect on Signal, Goldberg said in his article. After that, the journalist was added to a “Houthi PC small group” chat where the military operation was discussed for days leading up to the March 15 strike, he said.

Waltz told Fox News Tuesday night that he took “full responsibility for inviting a reporter into the chat. "I built the group. It's embarrassing. We're going to get to the bottom of it."

But it was Hegseth who disclosed what was likely the most sensitive information in the chat, according to Goldberg's article and Tuesday's congressional testimony.

Gabbard and Ratcliffe appeared to pass the buck to Hegseth. But both also showed at least some lack of knowledge of basic U.S. security protocols.

Kelly asked both if they were aware of a Defense Department policy prohibiting discussion of “of even what is called controlled unclassified information or CUI on unsecured devices” using Signal.

“I haven't read that policy,” Gabbard said.

“I'm not familiar with the DOD policy,” Ratcliffe added.

In a new letter, Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and top Senate Democrats on national security committees asked Trump for answers to 10 questions about the chat, including a complete list of participants and whether any of them used personal communication devices.

Also, they wrote, “We are aware that the Director of National Intelligence, and possibly others, appears to have been overseas while this group chat was active, making the entire discussion more vulnerable to interception by foreign adversaries.

“Inexplicably, throughout the days-long chat conversation, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic remained in the group chat,” they wrote, “and his presence was never questioned.”

Trump officials had claimed nothing classified or risking harm to members of the military was shared in the chat

The disclosure by the Atlantic of further devastating messages from the Signal chat group used by the Trump administration's most senior security officials has nailed the lie that nothing that threatened the safety of US servicemen and women was shared on the group.

After the vague and evasive assertions by Trump officials at Monday's Senate intelligence committee hearing, from the White House, and from the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that no war plans or classified material was shared, readers can make up their own minds.

Despite Hegseth's angry denial, the exchanges in the leaked group chat did contain details of war planning, shared recklessly by him in advance of the attack on 15 March, on a messaging system and perhaps devices which he and others in the chat could not have been certain were secure.

Most damning is the fact that Hegseth sent details in advance of the F-18s and other aircraft that would take part in the attack, including the timing of their arrival at targets, and other assets that would be deployed.

As Ryan Goodman, a law professor who formerly worked at the Pentagon, put it after the latest release: “The Atlantic has now published the Signal texts with attack plans in response to administration denials. I worked at the Pentagon. If information like this is not classified, nothing is. If Hegseth is claiming he declassified this information, he should be shown the door for having done so.”

In attempting to cover up and diminish their culpability for a shocking breach of operational security – including the fact that two participants in the chat were overseas (including one in Moscow at the time) – the Trump administration has made the scandal immeasurably more serious than it was already.

At the most simple level, the pilots who flew on those strikes should rightly be furious that the most senior civilian defence official placed them in harm's way.

“If this text had been received by someone hostile to American interests – or someone merely indiscreet, and with access to social media – the Houthis would have had time to prepare for what was meant to be a surprise attack on their strongholds. The consequences for American pilots could have been catastrophic,” wrote Jeffrey Goldberg, the Atlantic editor who was accidentally added to the chat.

A question that now needs to be answered is precisely why a group of senior officials, including a number who have served in the US armed forces – including the director of National intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, the vice-president, JD Vance, and Hegseth – agreed to join a conversation on such a platform.

All of them will be aware of not just the stringent rules around operational security (Opsec in military jargon) but the absolute necessity to protect the lives of those you serve with.

The strong suspicion voiced by a number of commentators is that this group, like other senior officials in the Trump administration, have been using services like Signal to avoid oversight despite potentially being in breach of federal laws on record retention.

In other words, lives were casually put at risk to shirk another significant responsibility of the highest offices: accountability.

What happens next is key.

In any normal circumstances and in any previous era, Hegseth and Waltz would be expected to resign immediately: Hegseth for sharing what any reasonable observer would regard as details of war plans – and then lying about having done so – and Waltz for his shocking sloppiness around security.

But whether or not they will resign or be dismissed by a dysfunctional president, equally hostile to the notion he should be held accountable, is an open question.

What should be clear to already shocked allies of the US is that not only is intelligence and other sensitive material not safe in the hands of Trump's senior security officials, but that they cannot be counted on to be truthful individually or as a group.

President Donald Trump stood by his national security adviser, Michael Waltz, on Tuesday, calling him a “good man” a day after a report that he and other senior administration officials used a commercial messaging app to discuss secret military plans for Yemen and inadvertently included a journalist in the group chat. During a phone interview with NBC News, Trump also said Waltz had “learned a lesson.” The episode was discussed Tuesday at a previously scheduled Senate Intelligence Committee hearing at which at least two Cabinet members who participated in the chat testified.

Vice President JD Vance announced on social media Tuesday that he plans to travel to Greenland on Friday, joining a trip already scheduled for his wife, Usha Vance, and national security adviser Michael Waltz.

National security adviser Michael Waltz raised suspicions about how the contact information for Atlantic magazine editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg ended up on his phone, after the journalist was accidentally invited to a chat among senior administration officials on the messaging app Signal about a forthcoming U.S. military operation.

The White House withdrew President Donald Trump's pick to be chief executive of the U.S. Agency for Global Media, hours after Trump announced that he would name him as the ambassador to South Africa.

A notification to Congress on Tuesday showed the withdrawal of L. Brent Bozell III, a conservative media critic, to lead the USAGM. A separate notification showed that the president had nominated Bozell to serve as ambassador to South Africa. Both nominations required Senate confirmation.

The Senate confirmed President Donald Trump's pick to lead the National Institutes of Health, Jayanta “Jay” Bhattacharya, the Stanford University doctor and economist who rose to prominence as a vocal critic of the country's handling of the covid-19 pandemic.

When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth landed in Hawaii on Monday, making his first trip to the Pacific region as Pentagon chief, he brushed aside a journalist's questions about the blockbuster magazine article exposing how he and other top Trump administration officials had discussed sensitive military planning using an unclassified communication application, a major breach of government security norms.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Tuesday aimed at requiring people to prove they are U.S. citizens when they register to vote and blocking federal election funds to some states.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on election integrity Tuesday that would seek to strip federal funding from states that don't do enough to strengthen their election security.

The order includes a citizenship question on the federal voting form for the first time and calls on the U.S. Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute voting crimes.

Trump has consistently repeated without evidence the false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him amid massive voter fraud.

“Perhaps, some people think I shouldn't be complaining because we won in a landslide,” Trump said about the 2024 election. “But we've got to straighten out our elections. This country is so sick because of the election, the fake elections and the bad elections. We're going to straighten it out one way or the other.”

Mehmet Oz cleared a critical hurdle on his path to lead the agency that oversees millions of Americans' health insurance Tuesday, as he advanced out of the Senate Finance Committee along a 14-13 party line vote.

President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a memorandum that “requires the immediate declassification of all FBI files relating to the Crossfire Hurricane investigation,” according to the staff secretary.

President Donald Trump claimed no classified information had been discussed in the Signal group chat between senior administration officials that inadvertently included a journalist but said if there had been classified information contained in the chat, the situation would be “a little bit different.”

President Donald Trump claimed that Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, was given roughly $2 billion in government funding for environmental work, citing it as an example of wasteful government spending.

From March 2023 through 2024, Abrams served as senior counsel for Rewiring America, which aims to convert home energy systems from fossil fuels to electricity. The group was part of a green energy five-group coalition that was awarded a $1.9 billion EPA grant to help make homes across the country more energy efficient.

But Abrams did not lead the consortium, and group officials have repeatedly said she only served in an advisory role. There's also no evidence she directly received any of the money from the grant.

President Donald Trump said that his administration would investigate an incident in which the editor in chief of the Atlantic was invited to a Signal messaging chat in which senior administration officials discussed pending military action.

“Certainly we'll look at this,” Trump said during a meeting with ambassadors. He leaned into an argument that has been made by other members of the organization: that his adversaries are making a bigger deal out of the leak to blunt the success of his first two months.

“They had to find something,” he said. “Certainly we'll look at this. But the main thing was nothing happened. The attack was totally successful.”

President Donald Trump pardoned Devon Archer, a longtime personal and business associate of Hunter Biden's who was convicted of crimes that did not involve the son of the former president.

In 2019, Archer wrote to Hunter Biden, angry that the Biden family wasn't doing more to shield him from the Department of Justice.

“Buddy are you serious,” Hunter responded, going on to explain the role of an independent Justice Department and the need for checks and balances.

Trump officials knew their legal justification for terminating dozens of Environmental Protection Agency grants was flawed, according to documents and internal emails reviewed by The Washington Post.

An agency lawyer warned officials they had cited contractual language that did not apply to many of the grants the EPA had ended in recent weeks, advising that terminations could be reversed if recipients challenged them administratively or in court.

Trump administration officials say they will not give a judge any more information about controversial deportation flights carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members, citing a privilege that allows the executive branch to withhold sensitive national security information in civil litigation.

This is an excerpt from a full story.

Monday was arguably the most scandalous day of a controversy-ridden first two months of the second Trump administration. And administration officials and their allies are clearly still trying to figure out how to deal with it.

This is an excerpt from a full story.

Amid conservative calls to impeach a federal judge who blocked President Donald Trump over deportations, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said Tuesday that Republicans are considering legislation to limit the scope of federal injunctions — meaning Congress could move to curb the judiciary's power. Federal injunctions are put in place when judges believe a law or executive branch action may be unconstitutional.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, testifying before a Senate committee Tuesday, claimed not to recall whether specific timing and military targets were discussed in a Signal chat among administration officials about Yemen. According to The Atlantic's account of the conversation, they were.

“I believe there was discussion around targets in general,” Gabbard told Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The American Federation of Teachers and American Association of University Professors sued the Trump administration Tuesday for cutting access to funds and making unprecedented demands of Columbia University.

Asked by several Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee about whether he plans to privatize the Social Security system, Frank Bisignano, President Donald Trump's nominee to run the agency, said he did not.

“I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,” Bisignano said during a confirmation hearing. “I've never thought about privatizing. I don't see this institution as anything other than a government agency that works to the benefit of the American public.”

Frank Bisignano, a Wall Street veteran who is chairman of the board of the payment processing giant Fiserv, told members of the Senate Finance Committee that if confirmed as President Donald Trump's Social Security commissioner, he would “put the beneficiaries first,” whether they seek assistance from field offices, online or on the phone.

FBI Director Kash Patel sidestepped demands Tuesday to say whether the FBI had opened an investigation into how a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which Trump administration intelligence officials discussed military plans in Yemen.

“I was briefed about it late last night. I don't have an update,” Patel told Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Virginia) during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.

Warner insisted he expected an answer by the end of the day.

Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon and has not restarted a weapons program that the country suspended in 2003, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, reaffirming a longtime assessment by U.S. spy agencies.

While Iran's enrichment of uranium is at its highest level ever, approaching weapons grade, the Intelligence Committee “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader [Ali] Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003,” Gabbard said.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) said Tuesday that national security adviser Michael Waltz should remain on the job, despite using a commercial messaging app to discuss secret military plans for Yemen and inadvertently including a journalist in the group chat.

During Tuesday's Senate hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard refused to answer a question from Sen. Mark R. Warner (D-Virginia) as to whether she was the “TG” who participated in the Signal group chat about the administration's military plans in Yemen.

Gabbard said she didn't want to get into specifics. Warner kept pressing.

“Will you answer my question, ma'am?” he said. “Why aren't you going to get into specifics? Is it because it's all classified?”

As the administration's intelligence officials were testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday morning, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-South Dakota) told reporters that they would “hopefully be in a better position to answer” questions than he is about the leak of military plans in a Signal chat.

“Clearly there were errors in judgment,” Thune said.

Sen. Mark R. Warner (Virginia), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, used his opening remarks at the panel's annual threat hearing to lambaste the Trump administration and its security practices following revelations that senior administration officials discussed war plans for Yemen on a commercial messaging app and inadvertently included a journalist.

President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he remains supportive of national security adviser Michael Waltz after Waltz inadvertently added a journalist to a group chat in which administration officials discussed highly sensitive information regarding a U.S. attack in Yemen.

In an interview with NBC News, Trump said Waltz “has learned a lesson, and he's a good man.”

Top Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee warned Tuesday that the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency “will cost lives.”

“With nearly two months until the start of hurricane season, it is completely irresponsible and reckless for the Trump Administration to continue to call for the elimination of FEMA,” Reps. Bennie G. Thompson (Mississippi) and Tim Kennedy (New York) — the top Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee and its subcommittee on emergency management and technology, respectively — wrote in a statement.

The statement referenced comments by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem on Monday about closing FEMA.

Mike Huckabee, President Donald Trump's pick to serve as ambassador to Israel, faces a confirmation hearing Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If confirmed, Huckabee, a former governor of Arkansas, will become ambassador during an unstable time in the Middle East after Israeli forces broke the ceasefire agreement with Hamas and reignited the Gaza war last week.

The Senate Finance Committee is scheduled to consider two other Trump picks — Kevin Cabrera for ambassador to Panama and Reed Rubinstein to be legal adviser at the State Department — in the Tuesday hearing.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt sought Tuesday to dismiss the Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, as “well-known for his sensationalist spin” after his extraordinary report Monday revealed that top officials in the Trump administration had discussed highly sensitive military planning using an unclassified chat application and mistakenly included him in the conversation.

Leavitt downplayed the officials' actions in sharing war planning in an unclassified group chat. But in doing so, she acknowledged Goldberg was on the thread where top Trump officials were plotting a military operation targeting Yemen's Houthi militants.

The United States' top intelligence officials will deliver their annual global threat assessment to Congress on Tuesday, a day after a bombshell report that the vice president, secretary of defense, national security adviser and other top Cabinet members used a commercial messaging app to discuss secret war plans for Yemen and inadvertently included a journalist in the group chat.

This is an excerpt from a full story.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, voiced confidence in President Donald Trump's national security team Tuesday, a day after a media report revealed that they inadvertently included a journalist in a group chat to talk about secret military plans for Yemen.

“I agree with the president: I think [national security adviser] Mike Waltz and [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth and the whole national security team is doing a great job, as evidenced by the campaign against the outlaw rebels in Yemen over the last two weeks,” Cotton said on Fox News.

More than 300 wealthy Americans have signed a letter urging Congress to block further tax cuts for the ultra-rich, saying the GOP plan to pay for them “would dismantle necessary social programs, put millions of families at risk, and undermine our economy.”

Several countries have updated their travel advisories for the United States under the Trump administration, warning of strictly enforced entry policies and the risk of detention at U.S. border points and advising transgender and nonbinary travelers about the categorizations of sex outlined by an executive order.

Days after Donald Trump took office, Jonathan Kamens realized he couldn't speak freely in his two digital group chats with fellow government employees of the U.S. Digital Service. A friend cautioned that at least one of the group members might rat him out for warning the new administration would gut his agency.

So Kamens started inviting colleagues, one by one, to join him in a group chat on Signal, a messaging app known for its security and privacy.

As President Donald Trump's tariffs roil the U.S. and global economies, lawmakers returned to Washington late Monday under new pressure to pass tax laws and raise the country's borrowing limit to stave off a catastrophic debt default.

Some Republicans in Congress are pushing to enact tax cuts quickly before a potential recession, according to three GOP tax advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to have lunch Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance. In the afternoon, he is set to sign executive orders on unspecified subjects. The signings will be closed to the press, according to the White House schedule, but the president often changes course and uses signings as an opportunity to make comments to reporters.

Ryan Sloane had been working as a public affairs specialist for just over two months at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta when he was “DOGE'd” on Valentine's Day.

It had taken him eight months jumping through various hoops to join the CDC, leaving behind grueling night shifts at the Weather Channel for the promise of stability and health insurance to fund one last round of IVF with his wife.

A Columbia University student who came to the United States at the age of 7 from South Korea sued the Trump administration on Monday, seeking to avoid deportation.

The complaint from Yunseo Chung, 21, alleges that although she is a lawful U.S. permanent resident, the federal government is seeking to remove her from the country because of speech that is protected by the First Amendment.

The Social Security Administration website crashed four times in 10 days this month, blocking millions of retirees and disabled Americans from logging in to their online accounts because the servers were overloaded. In the field, office managers have resorted to answering phones at the front desk as receptionists because so many employees have been pushed out.

When federal civil rights attorneys launched investigations in February into whether universities properly responded to antisemitism on campuses, they noticed something unusual about the marching orders from their bosses at the Education Department.

An early step in civil rights investigations is always a letter to the university demanding certain information. Typically, the department asks how many discrimination complaints were received, and what school officials did in response.

President Donald Trump likes having his name and image on things, but there's one representation of his likeness that he wanted gone — a portrait that hangs in the Colorado Capitol. Trump took to Truth Social to complain about the painting Sunday night, blaming the state's Democratic governor for it and demanding that it be removed.

The Senate tonight confirmed Dr. Martin Makary, a pancreatic surgeon who has made controversial claims about Covid-19, as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.

Makary, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins and a former Fox News personality, was confirmed in a 56-44 vote.

As FDA commissioner, Makary will be tasked with regulation and oversight related to drugs, vaccines, food and other products.

During the Covid pandemic, Makary voiced support for natural immunity. He incorrectly predicted in February 2021 that the United States would hit herd immunity by that April.

Signal, the most secure widely available messaging app, has become a go-to resource for journalists, leakers and other people concerned about privacy. But it's not infallible. And its shortcomings and limitations are precisely why its use by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top Trump administration defense officials has rocked the worlds of politics and national security.

The app made headlines yesterday after Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg published the bombshell news that the Trump administration had accidentally added him to a Signal group chat this month to discuss military strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen.

At first glance, it might not seem a major problem. Cybersecurity experts widely consider Signal to be the leading easy-to-use encrypted messaging service, and there are no public reports of its ever having been compromised by hackers.

Signal's encryption protocol — the complicated algorithm that scrambles messages as they're sent, then descrambles them for recipients — is the basis for some of the most popular messaging apps, including WhatsApp and iMessage. In 2023, Signal began updating its encryption to address the hypothetical threat of a quantum computer that could break less complicated encryption codes.

But Signal can't protect people, even Cabinet members, if they accidentally tell it to message the wrong person.

Facing pressure from his right flank to take on judges who have ruled against Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., today floated the possibility of Congress eliminating some federal courts.

It's the latest attack from Republicans on the federal judiciary, as courts have blocked a series of actions taken by the Trump administration. In addition to funding threats, Trump and his conservative allies have called for the impeachment of certain federal judges who have ruled against him, most notably U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who tried to halt Trump's using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.

National security adviser Mike Waltz said in tonight's Fox News interview that he does not support releasing a chain of messages about military planning that inadvertently included The Atlantic's top editor.

"I certainly want our deliberations to stay confidential," Waltz told host Laura Ingraham. "Of course, I don't want it all out there, because these were conversations back and forth that you should be able to have confidentially."

Waltz was responding to a question about whether Waltz would object to the public release of the messages if the contents were not classified, as Trump and his allies have claimed.

The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, wrote in his article yesterday that plans in the group text “included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing,” but that he had not included those details because of national security concerns.

Earlier today, Trump diminished the seriousness of the leak, saying the chat included “no classified information, as I understand it.”

A super PAC tied to billionaire Elon Musk has started spending in two deeply Republican House seats in Florida ahead of next week's special elections, according to a new campaign finance report.

America PAC, which has not filed a financial disclosure yet this year but was almost entirely funded by Musk in 2024, is spending $20,000 on “texting services” to boost Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis in the 1st Congressional District and state Sen. Randy Fine in the 6th District, according to a report filed tonight with the Federal Election Commission, which was first reported by The New York Times.

America PAC's spending in the special elections is minimal so far compared with the millions of dollars that have already been spent there. But it is a sign that Musk may be paying attention to the contests, as he continues to ramp up his political engagement while serving as a key White House adviser. America PAC has also spent millions of dollars on next week's state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin.

Tuesday's special elections in Florida are taking place in deeply Republican territory. Trump carried the 1st District by 37 points in November and the 6th District by 30 points, according to election result calculations from the NBC News Decision Desk.

Pastor Eva Steege was one of the named plaintiffs in a lawsuit the National Treasury Employees Union filed last month against the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and acting CFPB Director Russell Vought. At the time, Steege was in hospice care with a terminal illness, according to court filings.

But she had been working with the student loan ombudsman of the CFPB to fulfill a dying wish: to secure a discharge of her student loans before she died through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program to avoid putting a financial burden on her surviving family.

“That important and time-sensitive work was immediately halted by Acting Director Vought's work-stoppage order of February 10, and his decision to summarily terminate the Student Loan Ombudsman, along with all other term employees of the Bureau, three days later,” attorneys for Steege wrote.

Steege died March 15. She was 83.

“The thing that she feared has thus come to pass: She died without securing the discharge of her student loan debt,” the filing says. “The plan to shutter the CFPB has thus permanently deprived Eva of the 'timely assistance' that the CFPB was required to provide.”

Attorneys asked U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson to include Steege's husband, Ted Steege, as a plaintiff in the lawsuit as the person responsible for administering his wife's estate.

The ombudsman who was working with Eva Steege, Julia Barnard, said she would love to help if she were still employed by the agency.

“If I were still able to perform the duties of the Student Loan Ombudsman, I would be able to meet with Ted to help him talk through his remaining options and fill out any remaining paperwork,” she wrote in a court filing. “I would also be able to meet with other partners, such as staff at the Office of Federal Student Aid and federal student loan servicers, to check on the status of Pastor Eva Steege's outstanding Public Service Loan Forgiveness application, explore the family's options, and escalate the case if necessary.”

Trump today signed a sweeping executive order attempting a major overhaul of American elections, requiring people to prove their citizenship when they register to vote.

The order — which also includes an array of other changes, from mail-in ballot deadlines to election equipment — could risk disenfranchising tens of millions of Americans. Election law experts questioned whether Trump had the authority to make the changes, saying the order is all but certain to be met with legal challenges.

Federal law currently requires that voters swear under penalty of perjury that they are citizens and eligible to vote when they register, and courts have prevented states from adding documentary proof-of-citizenship requirements for voters in federal races because of such laws.

Trump's order directs the Election Assistance Commission, an independent, bipartisan commission that supports election officials, to redo its voter registration form and require voters to show U.S. passports or other government ID that shows citizenship to register to vote.

National security adviser Mike Waltz said in a Fox News interview tonight that he takes "full responsibility" for organizing a text group on the messaging app Signal that accidentally leaked plans for U.S. airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen to the editor of The Atlantic.

"I take full responsibility. I built the — I built the group," Waltz told host Laura Ingraham. "My job is to make sure everything's coordinated."

Waltz's comments were in response to a question about whether a staffer was responsible for adding The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to the group.

Waltz also suggested, without evidence, that Goldberg might have "deliberately" appeared in the group, which included top administration officials.

"Now, whether he did it deliberately or it happened in some other technical means is something we're trying to figure out," Waltz said, adding that he had spoken with Elon Musk today and that "we've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened."

The Atlantic has pushed back against efforts by Trump and his allies to attack its reporting.

"Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor, and our reporting follow an obvious playbook by elected officials and others in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans. Our journalists are continuing to fearlessly and independently report the truth in the public interest," Anna Bross, a spokesperson for the publication, said in a statement today.

Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., is clashing with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., over her push to pass legislation that would allow lawmakers who are new parents to vote remotely.

In a closed-door meeting today, Johnson discouraged rank-and-file Republicans from supporting Luna's proxy voting bill, warning that it was unconstitutional, a source in the meeting said.

“We want to make it as easy as possible for young parents to be able to participate in the process,” Johnson told reporters after the meeting. “But proxy voting, in my view, is unconstitutional.”

Luna then took to X and posted a photo of three documents showing when Johnson had himself voted by proxy in 2022.

Government watchdog group American Oversight sued Trump administration officials involved in a group chat discussion of military plans that mistakenly included a journalist.

“Messages in the Signal chat about official government actions, including, but not limited to, national security deliberations, are federal records and must be preserved in accordance with federal statutes, and agency directives, rules, and regulations,” the lawsuit says.

“Defendants' use of Signal presents a substantial risk that they have used and continue to use Signal in other contexts, thereby creating records that are subject to the [Federal Records Act] and/or the [Freedom of Information Act], but are not being preserved as required by those statutes,” it adds.

American Oversight also noted that under State Department and Treasury Department recordkeeping rules, “officials do not forward Signal messages, including messages from the Signal chat, to their official email accounts, thereby barring American Oversight and other FOIA requesters from obtaining responsive records to which they are otherwise entitled under FOIA, particularly if such Signal messages are set to auto-delete.”

The lawsuit asks the judge to declare, among other things, that messages and communications sent via Signal in conducting official business are records subject to the Federal Records Act.

Trump signed an executive order today punishing a law firm that hired Andrew Weissmann, a Trump critic who was a prosecutor on former special counsel Robert Mueller's team that investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The order directs that employees of the firm Jenner & Block be stripped of security clearances and have their access to federal buildings limited and that federal agencies terminate any contracts with the firm. The order repeatedly singles out Weissmann, an NBC News & MSNBC legal analyst. "Andrew Weissmann is the main culprit with respect to this," Trump said as he signed the order in the White House. "He's a bad guy."

Weissmann declined to comment this evening.

“Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court," a spokesperson for the firm said in a statement. "We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.”

Trump has taken similar action against other law firms that hired prosecutors who worked on Trump cases or supported Democratic causes. He revoked an order involving the powerful firm Paul Weiss last week after it agreed to perform $40 million in free legal work for causes Trump supports and, according to a social media post from Trump, get rid of any internal diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., urged Trump in a short letter today to "immediately" fire Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, citing the military plans that were inadvertently shared with a journalist in a group text.

"Pete Hegseth is the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in American history. His continued presence in the top position of leadership at the Pentagon threatens the nation's security and puts our brave men and women in uniform throughout the world in danger," Jeffries wrote.

Referring to the leaked plans for U.S. airstrikes on Houthi militants in Yemen, Jeffries wrote that Hegseth had "recklessly and casually disclosed highly sensitive war plans."

"His behavior shocks the conscience, risked American lives and likely violated the law," Jeffries added.

Jeffries appealed to House Republicans in a statement yesterday to "join Democrats in a swift, serious and substantive investigation into this unacceptable and irresponsible national security breach."

Hegseth told reporters yesterday that "nobody was texting war plans."

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled today that a lower court's preliminary injunction on refugee admissions will remain in effect, but only for refugees who were conditionally approved as of Jan. 20, when Trump took office for his second term.

The appeals court ruled that Trump's executive order halting refugee admissions “does not purport to revoke the refugee status of individuals who received that status under the United States Refugee Admissions Program prior to January 20, 2025.”

U.S. District Judge Jamal Whitehead last month blocked the Trump administration from suspending refugee processing, decisions and admissions across the board. The appeals court today issued a partial stay of the order while it considers the government's appeal.

Whitehead issued a second preliminary injunction in the case yesterday, blocking the administration from terminating agreements with agencies that serve refugees and ordering the restoration of funding to those agencies. The administration announced today it's appealing that decision, as well.

Senate Armed Services Committee members are weighing how they intend to get more information from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth about the information he shared on the Signal chat with Jeffrey Goldberg, with Democrats urging Republicans to call Hegseth to testify before the committee.

“Well, I think it would be helpful, certainly,” Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the committee's ranking member, told NBC News today about whether he wants Hegseth to testify. “And also, it would reaffirm his assertions that there was nothing unusual or inappropriate about the conversation.”

The committee's chair, Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said no decision has been made on the path forward.

Wicker and Reed discussed having Hegseth testify before the committee before the worldwide threats hearing, and Wicker signaled openness, according to a Democratic source with knowledge of the discussions. But Wicker suggested he wants to get Hegseth on the phone or receive a copy of the full Signal chat. 

The Democratic source believes that could be an off-ramp to avoid having the spectacle of a hearing held by a Republican-controlled committee. 

Reed said getting a copy of the Signal chat was a priority for Democrats, saying, “There is no legitimate basis for him to withhold information from the committee that he claims is unclassified and has already been shared with a journalist.”

Sens. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., and John Cornyn, R-Texas, both members of the Intelligence Committee, said they would like to see copies of the Signal chat.

Trump is nominating Media Research Center founder L. Brent Bozell III to be the U.S. ambassador to South Africa, according to Congress' website.

Bozell must be confirmed by the Senate for the role.

Trump had picked Bozell — who wrote a letter last year defending his son, at the time a convicted Jan. 6 rioter — to run the U.S. Agency for Global Media, but his nomination was withdrawn. Bozell and his father were key architects of the American conservative movement.

Trump signed an executive order last month halting U.S. aid to South Africa and promoting the resettlement of Afrikaners who, the order said, faced "government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation."

Elon Musk, the de facto head of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, was born in South Africa and has repeatedly posted criticism about the South African government on social media.

Vice President JD Vance announced on X this afternoon that he will join his wife, second lady Usha Vance, as part of a U.S. delegation to Greenland this week as Trump escalates calls for a U.S. takeover of the Danish territory.

"You know, there was so much excitement around Usha's visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided I didn't want her to have all that fun by herself, and so I'm going to join her," Vance said in a video posted to his official X account. "I'm going to visit some of our guardians in the Space Force on the northwest coast of Greenland and also just check out what's going on with the security there."

Vance said the Trump administration believes leaders in the United States and Denmark have "ignored" the island, which is rich in coveted critical mineral resources and is along key North Atlantic shipping routes, for "far too long."

"Speaking for President Trump, we want to reinvigorate the security of the people of Greenland because we think it's important to protecting the security of the entire world," he said.

The Vances will be part of a larger U.S. delegation that includes Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Mike Waltz.

Outgoing Greenlandic Prime Minister Múte B. Egede has questioned the motives of the trip, arguing it could be a show of force by the Trump administration to intimidate local leaders.

There could be an additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths globally in the next four years if U.S. funding cuts are not reversed, the United Nations warned.

Almost all U.S. foreign aid has been put on hold since Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, though his administration says there is an exemption for the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief, which is estimated to have prevented 25 million early AIDS-related deaths since President George W. Bush launched it in 2003.

Still, the program has been affected by cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, which could lead to a “real surge” in HIV/AIDS cases, said Winnie Byanyima, executive director of the U.N. AIDS agency.

“This sudden withdrawal of U.S. funding has led [to the closure] of many clinics, laying off of thousands of health workers,” she told reporters in Geneva yesterday.

The world will see the disease “come back, and we see people dying the way we saw them in the '90s and in 2000s,” she added, saying that “we have not heard of other governments pledging to fill the gap.”

A federal appeals court today temporarily halted a lower court's order that the U.S. Agency for International Development reopen its headquarters.

The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay of U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang's order until Thursday, an indication it will decide in the next 48 hours on the administration's request for a stay while a full appeal is heard.

The Baltimore judge found last week that the efforts of Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to largely dismantle USAID “likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways."

The judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering the agency to reopen its headquarters and restore access to email, payment and other electronic systems for all USAID employees and contractors.

Speaking from the White House in a lengthy back-and-forth with reporters, Trump downplayed the events and said the chat contained “no classified information, as I understand it.” 

“They were using an app, as I understand it, that a lot of people in government use, a lot of people in the media use,” he said.

Trump said he didn't want Waltz to be “hurt” by the breach and saw no need for him to apologize, even as the president said aides would “probably” not use Signal any longer. 

“If it was up to me, everybody would be sitting in a room together,” Trump said. “The room would have solid lead walls and a lead ceiling and a lead floor. But you know, life doesn't always let you do that.”

Waltz, who was in the room for a meeting of ambassadors, defended himself amid repeated questions about when Trump learned of the chat and how. Waltz said they planned to look into how Goldberg got added to the chat and whether Signal is secure enough to use for high-level discussions.

“We are we have our technical experts looking at it,” he said. “We have our legal teams looking at it. And of course, we're going to keep everything as secure as possible.”

South Korea is hosting the governor of Alaska and other state representatives this week amid talk of a long-stalled $44 billion pipeline supported by Trump that would transport gas from Alaska to U.S. allies in Asia.

The delegation led by Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, which is visiting today and tomorrow, also includes representatives from the Glenfarne Group, the lead developer of the project, and the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation, according to the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea.

The chamber said Dunleavy was scheduled to meet with South Korean Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun; Joseph Yun, the acting U.S. ambassador to South Korea; and acting President Han Duck-soo, who was reinstated in the role yesterday after the Constitutional Court overturned his impeachment amid continuing political turmoil in the country over impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol's attempt in December to declare martial law.

A federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order this afternoon against the U.S. Agency for Global Media and its acting CEO, Kari Lake, blocking the Trump administration from canceling funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

“Congress has found that 'it is the policy of the United States to promote the right of freedom of opinion and expression' and that 'open communication of information and ideas among the peoples of the world contributes to international peace and stability,'” Judge Royce Lamberth wrote in his opinion. “The leadership of USAGM cannot, with one sentence of reasoning offering virtually no explanation, force RFE/RL to shut down—even if the President has told them to do so.”

The line Lamberth appeared to be referring to is “The award no longer effectuates agency priorities,” a sentence by Lake included in a notice of grant termination sent to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.

“The Court concludes, in keeping with Congress's longstanding determination, that the continued operation of RFE/RL is in the public interest,” Lamberth wrote.

Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, is coming under fire from Republicans for referring to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as “Governor Hot Wheels” at a Human Rights Campaign dinner in Los Angeles over the weekend. Abbott is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair.

“Y'all know we got Governor Hot Wheels down there, come on now. And the only thing hot about him is that he is a hot ass mess, honey," she said. 

Several Republicans, including the NRCC and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene. R-Ga., have amplified and criticized the remarks. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, is planning to introduce a resolution to censure Crockett over her remarks about Abbott, according to Weber's office.

In a post on X, Crockett denied that she was making a reference to Abbott's wheelchair use.

"I was thinking about the planes, trains, and automobiles he used to transfer migrants into communities led by Black mayors, deliberately stoking tension and fear among the most vulnerable," she said. "Literally, the next line I said was that he was a “Hot A** Mess,” referencing his terrible policies. At no point did I mention or allude to his condition."

Trump's nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, got an earful from Senate Democrats at his confirmation hearing Tuesday, in the wake of early actions by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency to downsize the agency.

Democratic senators pressed Bisignano on whether he was involved in discussions about DOGE operations regarding onboarding personnel, which he denied. They grilled him on whether he agrees with Musk's rhetorical attacks on the program, which he sidestepped. They asked him to reassure them that Trump is telling the truth when he says he doesn't want to slash benefits for seniors, and that he'd protect the program if confirmed.

States that successfully sued the Trump administration over its federal funding freeze say the government has yet to release some disaster relief money, and are asking a judge to force the Federal Emergency Management Agency to release the cash. 

"The parties remain at an impasse as to millions of dollars in obligated FEMA awards, which are and have remained frozen dating to as early as February 7," the coalition of states with Democratic attorneys general said in a court filing yesterday. 

"Plaintiff States will need to wind down important programmatic emergency services, including disaster relief to people and communities affected by the Maui wildfires, in short order if funding is not immediately unfrozen." 

The filing says 4,000 individual wildfire survivors could lose services soon if the funds aren't released, and that Oregon and Colorado are facing imminent major disruptions as well.

The states said that as of two weeks ago, “at least 215 FEMA grants to at least nineteen plaintiff states remain frozen or otherwise rendered inaccessible.” 

In a court filing earlier this month, the Justice Department contended the "vast majority" of the funding holds "relates to the manual review process that FEMA is utilizing," and that the agency is permitted to carry out such reviews.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed in an interview today with right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk that the reaction to the inadvertent leak of military plans to a magazine journalist has been "embellished," but added, "It's obviously not a great look."

Johnson said the inclusion of Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, on a high-level Trump administration chat about plans for a military strike against Houthis in Yemen was "a mistake," adding, "a mistake that I'm sure is being corrected — has been corrected immediately."

"It'll be up to the president to decide exactly what action to take," he said, adding that he believed the situation was being blown out of proportion by Democratic members of Congress.

Johnson has previously been critical of Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state during the Obama administration, which drew tremendous GOP criticism during her 2016 run for president. The Wisconsin senator continued to pursue that information even after Clinton lost the election.

China courted the executives of major U.S. businesses at an annual conference this week in a sign of how Beijing seeks to offset trade pressures, rather than retaliate forcefully.

China has long sought to attract foreign investment as a way to bolster growth, while tapping business interests for potential influence on the White House, particularly under U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.S. has twice increased tariffs across all Chinese goods since January, but Beijing has only announced targeted duties and restrictions on a handful of American companies.

Conversation on the sidelines of the state-organized China Development Forum this week in Beijing reinforced a more conciliatory stance than official rhetoric this month about how China is prepared to fight “any type of war” with the United States.

Trump's top intelligence officials claimed on Tuesday that they did not share any classified materials in a group text about U.S. military plans that inadvertently included a journalist.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe both downplayed the mishap during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing a day after The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he had been added to a text thread about U.S. military plans to strike Houthi militias in Yemen.

The incident has raised questions about the Trump administration's handling of classified information as well as its use of Signal and other electronic communications.

The White House said Tuesday that Russia and Ukraine had agreed to a ceasefire in the Black Sea and to implement a ban on attacks on energy facilities by the two neighbors, an apparent breakthrough after American negotiators held separate talks with both countries. 

Negotiators had agreed with both countries “to ensure safe navigation, eliminate the use of force, and prevent the use of commercial vessels for military purposes in the Black Sea,” the White House said in two separate but similar statements.

During morning testimony at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., repeatedly questioned Gabbard and Ratcliffe's denials that the military strike plans that were leaked in a Signal group chat were classified. 

“The idea somehow, ‘Well, none of this was classified but we can't talk about it here,' you can't have it both ways,” Warner told the officials. 

Gabbard and Ratcliffe had repeatedly deflected questions at the hearing about Signal group chat they were both reportedly part of, arguing the subject should not be discussed in a public forum. But central to their arguments on the gravity of the leak, they also denied that any of the information in the group chat was classified for security reasons.  

“It strains my mind to think, it strains my mind, if the shoe had been on the other foot, what my colleagues would be saying about this,” Warner said, referring to Republican senators. 

During the 2016 election, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton drew immense Republican backlash for her use of a private email server for communications when she was secretary of state in the Obama administration. National security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have both condemned the past mishandling of classified information by Democrats.

"If it's not classified, again, we'd ask you to give it to the public today," Warner said. "If you got it here it's not classified, stand by your position, or is this just one more example of a careless approach to how we keep our secrets in this administration?"

David Rohde

As the hearing continued, the role of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth became a primary focus. 

During questioning, Ratcliffe and Gabbard both said that Hegseth was the “original classifying authority” on the chat. That was a reference to the fact that, according to The Atlantic, Hegseth was the governmental official who shared the targeting information that Democrats argue was classified. 

While initial questions after the Atlantic story broke focused on why Waltz set up the chat, Hegseth is likely to face further scrutiny about why he chose to share military targeting information on the chat. 

As the investigation continues, Hegseth, as the person who posted the military information, may face the most intense criticism.

Rebecca Shabad

Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., asked Ratcliffe whether he remembered various details in The Atlantic's report on the Signal chat about the military plans to attack the Houthis in Yemen, including whether Vice President JD Vance initially disagreed with the strike plans, as the magazine had reported.

The CIA director answered that he did not recall those details.

Ossoff then asked, "Director, this was a huge mistake, right?"

"No," Ratcliffe said.

That prompted Ossoff to remark that a national political journalist had been privy to sensitive information and "there has been no apology." 

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., then chimed in, saying in his final remarks in the public portion of the hearing that putting the information out in the Signal chat could have allowed adversaries to reposition their defenses. 

"And the unwillingness of the individuals on this panel who were on the chat to even apologize for acknowledging what a colossal screw-up this is speaks volumes," Warner said.

Dan De Luce

Questioned by Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., at the hearing,  Gabbard refused to say whether she was using her personal or work phone in the Signal text chain on planned strikes against Houthi forces in Yemen.

“Were you using your private phone or public phone for the Signal discussions?” Reed asked.

Gabbard replied: “I won't speak to this because it's under review by the National Security Council. Once that review is complete, I'm sure we'll share the results with the committee."

Reed followed up: “What is under review? It's a very simple question, were you using a private phone or officially issued phone? What could be under review?"

Gabbard declined to answer directly. “The National Security Council is reviewing all aspects of how this came to be, how the journalist was inadvertently added to the group chat and what occurred within that chat across the board,” she said.

The public portion of the Senate Intelligence Committee oversight hearing on global threats has adjourned. The committee will move to a closed session, where several lawmakers have said they will question Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe in more detail about the leak of sensitive military information to journalist Jeffrey Goldberg during a high-level group chat on the messaging app Signal.

David Rohde

Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., posed the most pointed questions of the hearing so far, demanding that Ratcliffe answer whether Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Moscow during the group chat. Russia is widely known for its ability to gain access to electronic devices and eavesdrop in sophisticated ways.

“Did you know that the president's Middle East adviser was in Moscow on this thread while you were, as director of the CIA, participating in this thread, were you aware of that? Are you? Are you aware of that today?”

Ratcliffe replied, “I'm not aware of that.”

Bennet, shouting, said, “This sloppiness, this incompetence, this disrespect for our intelligence agencies and the personnel who work for him is entirely unacceptable. It's an embarrassment." He added, “You need to do better. You need to do better.”

Megan Lebowitz

Gabbard acknowledged under questioning from Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., that the administration officials in the Signal chat discussed targets, although she had previously declined to say whether she was in the group chat. 

"I believe there was discussion around targets in general," Gabbard testified after saying moments earlier that she did not "remember mention of specific targets."

"I think that's consistent with my recollection," Ratcliffe added when being asked the same question. 

In answer to a string of questions from Kelly on whether those on the chat discussed the timing of airstrikes, weapons systems or military units, Gabbard and Ratcliffe repeatedly answered that they did not recall.

Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, drilled down in his questioning on Russia's threats to Ukraine and Europe's response. 

Cornyn said the annual threat assessment says "Russia views its ongoing war with Ukraine as a proxy conflict with the West, and its objective to restore Russian strength and security," adding that Russia's perceptions on "U.S. and Western encroachment has increased the risks of unintended escalation between Russia and NATO. Do you agree with that statement?"

Gabbard said she agreed. 

Cornyn suggested that the perceptions of U.S. leadership receding on security matters in Europe could lead to nuclear proliferation. 

"I know the incoming chancellor of Germany has talked about the possibility that Germany might share its nuclear weapons with Ukraine, and suggested that the U.K. would be part of that," Cornyn said. "I know that Poland has talked about acquiring nuclear weapons and perhaps other European countries to make up for what they view as a receding of the American umbrella of protection."

Megan Lebowitz

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, asked Gabbard why global climate change was not included in this year's worldwide threats report, despite it being included in prior reports.

"Every single one of these reports that we have had has mentioned global climate change as a significant national security threat, except this one. Has something happened, has global climate change been solved?" King asked, noting that the effects of climate change include famine, mass migration and political conflicts.

"This annual threat assessment has been focused very directly on the threats that we deem most critical to the United States and our national security," Gabbard said. "Obviously, we're aware of occurrences within the environment and how they may impact operations, but we're focused on the direct threats to Americans' safety, well-being and security."

In answer to his question of who was responsible for leaving the subject out of the assessment, Gabbard said she did not recall instructing her team to not include climate change in it.

Rebecca Shabad

In response to questions from Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., Gabbard and Ratcliffe said they would be open to audits of their communications after they said that they haven't participated in classified discussions on Signal. 

"To be clear, I haven't participated in any Signal group messaging that relates to any classified information at all," Ratcliffe said.

"Senator, I have the same answer," Gabbard said. "I have not participated in any Signal group chat, or any other chat on another app that contained any classified information."

They said they would comply with an audit of their communications or other appropriate actions related to the issue.

Republican Sen. James Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he had spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio “at length” about how a reporter was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat in which the nation's top intelligence officials, Rubio reportedly included, shared classified plans for military action. 

“He is really aware of these kinds of things. We have leakage that happens from time to time,” Risch, of Idaho, said of Rubio, a former member of the committee, during his opening statement at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing this morning. "I can assure you that his knowledge is such and his commitment is such that he had no knowledge of there being the tap on that, that there was when he was communicating.”

The committee's top Democrat, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire,  expressed concern over the information leak and that no State Department personnel were aware of The Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg's accidental inclusion in the Signal group chat, or of the information that was leaked to him as a result. 

Risch called the incident a “serious leak,” and said, “I don't think there's anybody that wouldn't be concerned. …  We'll move on as best we can.”

Kyle Stewart

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said the addition of Goldberg to the White House officials' Signal chat was “incredibly sloppy” but added that “it was a mistake, and I am, I can say for certain, they're going to put protocols in place so that doesn't happen again.”

Rep. Maria Salazar, R-Fla., said “people make mistakes” and to give Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “a pass.”  

Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., called his former colleague Mike Waltz a “patriot.” 

These members were all going in and out of the weekly House Republican conference meeting.

David Rohde

The Republican strategy so far in the hearing appears to be to ignore, minimize and downplay the Signal chat. 

No Republican senator has asked about it so far. Instead, Republican senators have focused their questions on migrants, cartels and China. 

Gabbard did not mention the call in her opening statement. When Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the committee, asked her about the call, she downplayed its importance, saying, “There was no classified material shared." Ratcliffe gave a similar answer.

When Warner asked Gabbard if she planned to hand over the Signal exchange to the committee, she gave an unclear answer. When Warner asked FBI Director Kash Patel if he had launched an investigation into the call, he said he had only been briefed on it late last night.

Megan Lebowitz

Ratcliffe defended the use of Signal to discuss military plans, saying it was loaded onto his computer shortly after he was confirmed as CIA director.

Ratcliffe acknowledged that he was in the Signal group chat that was reported by The Atlantic, but said that he had been previously briefed about "the use of Signal as a permissible work use."  He said he was informed that any decisions made needed to be recorded in “formal channels.”

 "It is permissible to use to communicate and coordinate for work purposes, provided, senator, that any decisions that are made are also recorded through formal channels. So those were procedures that were implemented," Ratcliffe said.

Ratcliffe said that his communications on Signal did not include classified information.

Rebecca Shabad

Gabbard dodged a question from Warner about whether she was the user, reported as "TG," in the Signal chat with Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg in which senior Trump administration shared military plans. 

"Senator, I don't want to get into this," Gabbard said, who repeated the same response after Warner kept pressing her. 

Gabbard said that she didn't want to talk about the magazine's report because it's still under review. 

She later claimed in response to follow-up questions by Warner that, in the Signal chat, there was "no classified material that was shared."

Rebecca Shabad

In her opening statement, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard didn't address the Signal chat at the center of the story yesterday in which The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg revealed that he was invited to the discussion with her and other senior Trump administration officials. 

Gabbard delivered her opening statement on behalf of the other witnesses, including FBI Director Kash Patel and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. 

She listed the number of threats facing the U.S., including those from "several nonstate actors, cartels, gangs and other transnational criminal organizations" in their "illicit activity, from narcotics trafficking to money laundering, to smuggling of illegal immigrants and human trafficking." 

Gabbard said that Islamist extremists like ISIS and Al Qaeda continue to pursue and inspire attacks against the U.S. domestically and abroad. She said that China is the U.S.'s most “capable strategic competitor," and also said Russia has developed cyber capabilities that pose a threat to U.S. infrastructure. 

"Among Russia's most concerning developments is a new satellite intended to carry a nuclear weapon as an anti-satellite weapon, violating long-standing international activity and putting the U.S. and global economy at risk," Gabbard said. 

Gabbard also said that the U.S. intelligence community has assessed that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and that the country's supreme leader hasn't authorized the nuclear program. 

Megan Lebowitz

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., began his opening remarks at the Senate hearing on worldwide threats by slamming the White House officials whom The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg reported as having been involved in a Signal group chat discussing military plans that inadvertently included him.

Warner called the group chat mishap an example of "sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information."

"Putting aside for a moment that classified information should never be discussed over an unclassified system, it's also just mind-boggling to me that all these senior folks were on this line, and nobody bothered even to check," Warner said, referring to Goldberg having been included in the discussion. "Security hygiene 101: Who are all the names?"

Rebecca Shabad

Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., did not address the Signal group chat that inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, on plans for strikes against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. 

Cotton, however, did applaud Trump's “decisive action” against the Houthis  this month — which was discussed in the Signal chat — and said he commends White House national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others on the administration's national security team — some of whom the magazine reported were represented in the chat. 

Cotton also said in his opening statement that U.S. intelligence agencies are not fully capable of handling the threats facing the nation. 

"We have to ask, are our intelligence agencies well-postured against these threats? I'm afraid the answer is no, at least not yet," he said. "As the world became more dangerous in recent years, our intelligence agencies got more politicized, more bureaucratic, and more focused on promulgating opinions rather than gathering facts." 

He continued, "As a result of these misplaced priorities, we've been caught off guard and left in the dark too often. I know that all of you agree that the core mission of the intelligence community is to steal our adversaries' secrets and convey them to policymakers to protect the United States. At the same time, it's not the role of intelligence agencies to make policy, to justify presidential action or to operate like other federal agencies. After years of drip, the intelligence community must recommit to its core mission of collecting clandestine intelligence from adversaries, whose main objective is to destroy our nation and our way of life."

Kyle Stewart

Asked about the White House's claim that no military plans were shared on the Signal chat with Jeffrey Goldberg, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said, “That's baloney."

"That's baloney," he said to reporters this morning as he left the weekly House Republican conference meeting. "Just be honest and own up to it."

"How does ending foreign assistance make us safer?" Warner said in the op-ed published by Fox News. "How does firing our most experienced FBI agents make us safer?"

He also asked how America is made more secure by firing people who oversee the nation's nuclear stockpile, monitor cyberattacks and prevent disease from spreading to the U.S., as the administration has done, although some who held those critical positions were rehired. 

"Can anyone tell me how firing probationary officers — without cause, and apparently without regard for merit, accomplishment, expense already incurred by the taxpayer in vetting and training, or the difficulty posed in filling the intelligence gaps left behind — makes us safer, or is an efficient use of taxpayer dollars?" he wrote. 

"The instability of the last two months also undermines a critical component of our intelligence gathering capabilities: the trust of allies," Warner said. 

He suggested that he wants answers to these questions during the worldwide threats hearing this morning before the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Trump stood by his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief was accidentally added to a private, high-level chat on the messaging app Signal in which military plans were being discussed.

“Michael Waltz has learned a lesson, and he's a good man,” Trump said today in a phone interview with NBC News.

House and Senate Democrats sent letters to top Trump officials demanding answers after The Atlantic reported that its editor-in-chief was inadvertently added to a Signal group chat in which top officials discussed military plans.

Top Democrats on prominent House committees sent a letter to four White House officials whom The Atlantic identified as potentially being in the Signal chat, asking for answers about the information shared. 

"We are especially concerned that the reported deliberations may have constituted a security breach, because they relied upon an electronic messaging application that is not approved as a secure method for communicating classified information and because they inadvertently included at least one non-governmental party," read the letter, which was addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz.

Separately, a group of 14 Senate Democrats sent a letter to Trump, calling the situation "an astonishingly cavalier approach to national security."

"It does not take much imagination to consider the likely ramifications if this information had been made public prior to the strike — or worse, if it had been shared with or visible to an adversary rather than a reporter who seems to have a better grasp of how to handle classified information than your National Security Advisor," the senators wrote.

The lawmakers asked that Trump and the officials share other instances in which officials may have discussed sensitive information using Signal and what steps the White House is taking to ensure this does not happen again. 

"In how many instances has the National Security Council held discussions on national security matters involving Principals Committee members or any other relevant executive branch officials using the Signal messaging service or any other messaging service application that has not been approved for the transmission of classified information?" read the letter from the top Democrats on the Armed Services, Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees.

As the Department of Government Efficiency upends federal agencies, a report released today by the job listing website Indeed shows the number of workers looking for new jobs has spiked.

Job applications from workers at agencies targeted by DOGE are up 75% compared with 2022, according to the report's data. And while job applications among all workers increased after the Trump transition, the spike in applications from DOGE-targeted workers is especially pronounced.

The Senate Finance Committee will hold a confirmation hearing today on Frank Bisignano's nomination to be commissioner of the Social Security Administration.

The hearing is scheduled to start at 10:10 a.m. ET and last about two and a half hours.

Bisignano will likely face questions on the future of the SSA as talk of privatizing the agency have ramped up. The hearing also comes on the heels of threats from the acting commissioner to shut down the agency after a federal judge barred the Department of Government Efficiency from accessing sensitive personal data.

The top Democrat on the Finance Committee, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., sent a letter to Bisignano yesterday asking whether he supports privatizing Social Security, and whether he would be willing to undo recent changes made, such as the closure of dozens of Social Security offices, mass agency layoffs and new administrative requirements for beneficiaries.

“These new developments leave us deeply concerned that DOGE and the Trump Administration are setting up the SSA for failure — a failure that could cut off Social Security benefits for millions of Americans — and that will then be used to justify a 'private sector fix.' Republicans have flirted with the idea of privatizing Social Security for over two decades,” the senators wrote in the letter.

“The latest changes at the Social Security Administration leave us worried that Elon Musk — with his clear disdain for the program that provides financial security to millions of Americans — has taken up the mantle as the latest privatization crusader,” they added.

The hearing will likely get heated, as Democrats are expected to press Bisignano on whether he agrees with the approach DOGE and the acting commissioner have taken so far, as well as his thoughts on threats to customer service and timely benefits, and Elon Musk and Trump's claims about fraud in Social Security.

Warren told NBC News yesterday that she plans to press Bisignano on a wide range of topics.

“The Social Security administrator nominee needs to come clean with the American people. Is he in favor of the cuts that Elon Musk and his DOGE boys are trying to execute at the Social Security Administration? Or does he plan, once he has the power, to put a stop to it? Is he in favor of the privatization of Social Security that many Republicans are still advancing? Or does he plan to make a stand and put a stop to it? That's what I want to hear from him,” Warren said.

Bisignano is the chief executive officer of payments technology at Fiserv, which some Democrats have raised concerns since the company could benefit from any privatization of Social Security.

Trump is scheduled to sign more executive orders today at 2 p.m. ET, the White House said.

The Senate Intelligence Committee will meet today at 10 a.m. ET for its "Worldwide Threats" hearing, an annual intelligence community oversight hearing with testimony from the heads of the intel agencies.  

The open hearing, expected to run almost three hours, will be followed by a classified, closed session. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is the only official who will give an opening statement, but all officials participating will take questions from senators.

The hearing comes less than 24 hours after The Atlantic reported that Jeffrey Goldberg was added to a Signal group chat with Trump administration officials about U.S. military strikes against the Houthis in Yemen. The group chat reportedly included two of the officials scheduled to testify today: Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. Senators said they expect questions regarding The Atlantic's reporting. 

“I would expect it would, and I would expect our Democrat colleagues would raise it. And I suspect some of my Republican colleagues may raise it just as an issue to be very concerned about,” Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said yesterday.

Democrats are blasting national security officials in the Trump administration for texting war plans to a group chat that included a reporter, saying it demonstrates sloppy conduct that would often result in firings.

In a testy exchange with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insist that no classified information was shared in the group chat about U.S. war plans that was sent to a journalist.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration's top intelligence officials stressed to Congress the threat they said was posed by international criminal gangs, drug cartels and human smuggling, testifying in a hearing Tuesday that unfolded against the backdrop of a security breach involving the mistaken leak of attack plans to a journalist.

The annual hearing on worldwide threats before the Senate Intelligence Committee offered a glimpse of the new administration's reorienting of priorities at a time when President Donald Trump has opened a new line of communication with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and as his administration has focused national security attention closer to home to counter violent crime that officials link to cross-border drug trafficking.

“Criminal groups drive much of the unrest and lawlessness in the Western Hemisphere,” said Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence. Atop a long list of national security challenges, she cited the need to combat cartels that she said were “engaging in a wide array of illicit activity, from narcotics trafficking to money laundering to smuggling of illegal immigrants and human trafficking.”

In a testy exchange with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insist that no classified information was shared in the group chat about U.S. war plans that was sent to a journalist.

The hearing occurred as officials across multiple presidential administrations have described an increasingly complicated blizzard of threats. 

In the committee room, it unfolded in split-screen fashion: Republican senators hewed to the pre-scheduled topic by drilling down on China and the fentanyl scourge, while Democrat after Democrat offered sharp criticism over a security breach they called reckless and dangerous.




“If this information had gotten out, American lives could have been lost,” Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the intelligence committee said of the exposed Signal messages. Added Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon: “I am of the view that there ought to be resignations.” “An embarrassment,” said Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who shouted down CIA Director John Ratcliffe as he demanded answers.

Gabbard and other officials did note the U.S. government's longstanding national security concerns, including the threat she said was posed by countries including Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.

China, for one, has heavily invested in stealth aircraft, hypersonic weapons and nuclear arms and is looking to outcompete the U.S. when it comes to artificial intelligence, while Russia remains a “formidable competitor” and still maintains a large nuclear arsenal.

The hearing arrived against the backdrop of a starkly different approach toward Russia following years of Biden administration sanctions over its war against Ukraine. 

Last week, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during a lengthy call with Trump to an immediate pause in strikes against energy infrastructure in what the White House described as the first step in a “movement to peace.”

Terrorism, too, featured prominently in the hearing.

“The direction for the FBI is to track down any individuals with any terrorist ties whatsoever, whether it be ISIS or another foreign terrorist organization,” said FBI Director Kash Patel. “And now to include the new designations of the cartels, down south and elsewhere.”

But the elevation of international drug trafficking as a top-tier threat was a notable turnabout in focus given that the U.S. government over the past four years has been more likely to place a premium on concerns over sophisticated Chinese espionage plots, ransomware attacks that have crippled hospitals and international and domestic terrorism plots.

Tuesday's hearing took taking place one day after news broke that several top national security officials in the Republican administration, including Ratcliffe, Gabbard and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, texted attack plans for military strikes in Yemen to a group chat in a secure messaging app that included the editor-in-chief for The Atlantic.

The text chain “contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Iran-backed Houthi-rebels in Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing,” journalist Jeffrey Goldberg reported. The strikes began two hours after Goldberg received the details.

“Horrified” by the leak of what is historically strictly guarded information, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, said he will be demanding answers in a separate hearing Wednesday with his panel.

Oops, something went wrong

GameStop (GME) stock slid more than 8% in after-hours trading Wednesday as the company announced it's attempting to raise $1.3 billion to buy bitcoin (BTC-USD).

The company will attempt to raise the funds via convertible senior notes.

The news comes one day after GameStop shares rose more nearly 12% when the video game operator turned popular meme stock said in a release that its board "has unanimously approved an update to its investment policy to add Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset."

The planned bitcoin investment comes about a month after CNBC reported GameStop was exploring cryptocurrency investments. On Feb. 8, a social media post from GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen sparked speculation over GameStop's interest in cryptocurrency. Cohen posted a picture on X with Strategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor, who has famously hitched his company to bitcoin. It now holds more than 447,000 tokens, per a February filing.

The strategy has worked out well for Saylor's company, with the stock up over 84% in the past year amid a rise in the price of bitcoin. But Wall Street strategists are hesitant to conclude that GameStop investing in bitcoin would mean the video game retailer's stock has upside.

"The company's strategy, which has changed about six times in three years, is they're going to buy cryptocurrency and be just like MicroStrategy," Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter told Yahoo Finance on Monday ahead of the earnings release. 

He added, "The problem with that thinking is MicroStrategy trades at about two times their bitcoin holdings. If GameStop were to buy all bitcoin with their $4.6 billion in cash and trade at two times [their bitcoin holdings,] the stock would drop five bucks."

Also after the bell on Tuesday, GameStop reported fourth quarter earnings results. The company posted $1.28 billion in net sales for the quarter, marking a 28% decline from the year-earlier period. For the full year, GameStop reported an adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million, down from $64.7 million seen the year prior.

Oops, something went wrong

More than 9 million Americans could see “substantial declines” in their FICO scores in the coming months as delinquent student loans begin showing up on credit reports for the first time since the pandemic, according to a new analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The report finds that over 15% of all student loan holders are likely now behind on debts, slightly more than before the pandemic. Those affected could face a tougher time getting access to home or auto loans or see their credit card limits lowered.

Borrowers have been required to make normal monthly payments on their student loans for well over a year, since the Biden administration ended the COVID-era pause on the program. But they temporarily benefited from a so-called “onboarding” phase, during which loan servicers were not allowed to report late or missed payments to credit agencies.

That grace period ended in September. Since servicers cannot report a loan as delinquent until it is 90 days past due, late student loan payments are only just now showing up on Americans' credit scores.

For those who are behind, the impact on their creditworthiness could be significant. In its report, the New York Fed's researchers found that a student loan delinquency can knock more than 150 points from the FICO score of someone with around average credit. For subprime borrowers — those with scores below 660 — it can subtract 87 points.

The Biden administration took several steps aimed at helping student borrowers get current on their loans as repayment resumed. Those included the Fresh Start program, which allowed people who had defaulted on their debts to get current without facing penalties. But only about 900,000 individuals took advantage of the offer, according to the Department of Education, leaving millions more lingering in default.

Recent confusion around the state of the student loan program may not be helping matters. For the past month, for instance, the administration had blocked access to income-driven repayment plans, which cap what borrowers owe each month at a percentage of their earnings, in response to a court ruling, leaving many with fewer options to manage their debts. Those applications finally reopened on Wednesday.

The Trump administration is also widely expected to restart involuntary collections on defaulted student loans sometime this year, though it's unclear if they have a plan worked out for resuming that process, which can involve garnishing paychecks and government benefits like Social Security payments. The administration's recent announcement that the student loan program would be moved out of the Department of Education to the Small Business Administration has made things additionally murky.

The New York Fed has traditionally tracked the number of delinquent student loans based on credit bureau data. But that was effectively made impossible during the pandemic payment pause and onboarding period, since late payments were no longer being reported to the agencies. For its new estimate, it combined information on delinquencies on loans not owned by the government as well as the Department of Education's own data on its student debt portfolio. The credit modeling company VantageScore similarly estimated that there are about 9 million delinquent loans outstanding.

Chandler has long been known as a hub of innovation in Arizona, but today that reputation extends around the globe. Our city stands at the forefront of the semiconductor revolution, with industry leaders like Intel investing billions in our community and a thriving supply chain of high-tech manufacturers choosing Chandler as their home. Our future is brighter than ever.  

But for Chandler to maintain its competitive edge, businesses—both large and small—need access to reliable, affordable energy. That's why the Chandler Chamber of Commerce supports the agreement between Southwest Gas and the staff of the Arizona Corporation Commission, the state's utility regulator, in the company's pending rate request.   

Chandler's growth in the semiconductor sector has been nothing short of remarkable. Intel's massive investment in our city has solidified our position as a leader in advanced manufacturing. The businesses that support semiconductor production—from suppliers to logistics companies—are expanding here, bringing jobs and economic prosperity. These companies depend on stable, predictable energy rates to make long-term investments in Chandler, and natural gas plays a crucial role in keeping operations running efficiently and affordably.   

With Chandler's growth, though, comes the expectation that we offer amenities families want and a quality of life that brings folks here. Take Chandler's downtown, which has become one of the Valley's most exciting destinations. Our restaurants are bustling with guests, serving up world-class meals that wouldn't be possible without natural gas cooktops. For these businesses, reliable access to natural gas isn't a luxury, it's a necessity. From fast and casual to fine dining establishments, our culinary scene thrives thanks to affordable energy and access to natural gas.    

Southwest Gas has been a trusted partner to the Chandler business community. The company works closely with businesses of all sizes, ensuring that natural gas remains an accessible, cost-effective energy source. Small businesses, in particular, rely on natural gas to keep costs manageable while delivering high-quality products and services to customers. In an era of economic uncertainty, our small businesses need energy stability, and Southwest Gas provides just that.   

As a chamber of commerce leader, what has impressed me most is Southwest Gas' commitment to open communication. The company has maintained an open-door policy with the Chandler Chamber of Commerce and its members, engaging in a transparent and constructive dialogue about the potential for a rate increase, which today is smaller than in our initial meetings. They have taken the time to explain the need to attract the capital that will make possible the infrastructure investments necessary to maintain safety and reliability and to meet the demands of Chandler's growth, all while ensuring rates remain competitive for businesses. This kind of engagement and fair and balanced approach is exactly what we expect from a responsible corporate partner.  

Chandler is growing, and the demand for energy is growing with it. If we want to continue attracting world-class companies, creating jobs, and supporting our local businesses, we must ensure that reliable, affordable natural gas remains part of our energy mix.  

We've looked closely at the agreement between Southwest Gas and the Corporation Commission staff. Rate increases—even modest ones like this one—are rarely popular, but this proposal has been vetted with community stakeholders, it makes sense for our community, and it is consistent with recent outcomes for other regulated utilities. We urge the Arizona Corporation Commission to grant its approval so that Chandler's business community can continue to thrive with the help of affordable and reliable natural gas.  

Terri Kimble is the president and CEO of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce.

            Dollar Tree is ending its short-lived and ill-fated Family Dollar experiment, offloading the discount brand for $1 billion – just a fraction of its purchase price from a decade ago.
    


            Family Dollar will be sold to private equity groups Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management, pending regulatory approval that is expected to clear next quarter. Dollar Tree bought Family dollar in 2015 for $9 billion.
    


            “The Dollar Tree leadership team and Board of Directors determined that a sale of Family Dollar to Brigade and Macellum best unlocks value for Dollar Tree shareholders and positions Family Dollar for future success,” the company said in a statement.
    


            Family Dollar has around 8,000 US stores, catering to low-income customers predominantly in cities with prices typically ranging from $1 to $10. The chain has struggled in recent years. Last year, Family Dollar announced plans to close more than 900 stores and was put up for sale.
    


            Messy stores, high prices and over-expansion have plagued Family Dollar, analysts say. The chain has also faced steep competition from larger retailers, such as Walmart.
    


            The sale of Family Dollar “closes the book on a sad and troubled chapter for Dollar Tree,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Wednesday. “Dollar Tree bit off far more than it could chew.”
    


            The sale comes at a difficult moment for Family Dollar and other dollar store chains. Inflation in recent years has increased Family Dollar's operating costs and squeezed its lower-income customers. President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported goods put a further put further pressure on dollar stores.
    


            “We continue to see value seeking behavior across all customer groups,” Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said on a call with analysts Wednesday. Dollar Tree caters to more middle-income customers than Family Dollar.
    


            Tariffs have introduced “uncertainty and volatility,” Creedon said, but Dollar Tree is shifting its suppliers to try to mitigate the impact and considering raising prices.
    


            Dollar Tree believed acquiring Family Dollar would help it compete against bigger rivals. The combined company hoped that by joining forces it could grow its customer base, reduce costs and fend off Dollar General, which is located primarily in rural areas. Dollar General had also bid for Family Dollar.
    


            But Dollar Tree misjudged the deal. The match between the two different chains was a poor fit, Wall Street analysts have said, and Dollar Tree has struggled to manage the larger Family Dollar store base.
    


            Family Dollar stores were in worse condition than Dollar Tree management expected, and early strategies to improve sales, such as selling beer, fell short. Many Family Dollar stores were located too close to each other and cannibalized each other's own sales.
    


            A year later, an activist investor pushed for a sale of the “underperforming” Family Dollar business, and Family Dollar announced it would close hundreds of stores.
    


            Even though Family Dollar has renovated thousands of stores in recent years, many are still poorly maintained, analysts say.
    


            Family Dollar was hit with a record $41.6 million fine by the Justice Department last year for violating product safety standards after selling items that were stocked in a rat-infested warehouse in West Memphis filled with live, dead and decaying rodents.
    


            It's not just Family Dollar that has struggled — the entire dollar store industry has been under pressure in recent years.
    


            Dollar Tree and Dollar General have hit trouble as low-income customers struggle to afford basic necessities and dial back their spending and competition from Walmart and other chains increases. 99 Cents Only filed for bankruptcy last year.
    


            “Our customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on an earnings call Thursday. “Many of our customers report they only have enough money for basic essentials, with some noting that they have had to sacrifice even on the necessities.”
    


            Many companies are noting a consumer slowdown across income levels because of inflation, tariffs and a wobbly stock market.
    


            Dollar Tree said last year that tariffs may lead it to alter some product specifications, change sizes or remove them from stores altogether if they become too costly. Dollar Tree may also raise prices from their current level of $1.25.
    


            An estimated 40% of Dollar Tree's sales are reliant on imported goods, leaving the retailer highly exposed to tariffs, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets analysis.
    


            Dollar Tree may also raise prices to combat tariffs, joining a growing list of chains from Walmart to Best Buy that say that will hike prices to offset any impact.
    


            In 2021, Dollar Tree raised base prices to $1.25 after 30 years of selling items for just a dollar. Dollar Tree also sells some products for up to $7.

Salt Lake City has become a thriving metropolis with a booming population and plenty of job opportunities in banking and tech.

Many residents, like former Gov. Michael Leavitt, point to the 2002 Winter Olympics as the catalyst for the city's transformation.  

"A lot of good things came together at the right time. We had a growing population. Tech was becoming — it was in its infancy and was expanding. A startup culture was important," Leavitt said. "We were in the position to be able to educate a lot of engineers at the right time, and then to be able to close that in the art, in the brand of the Olympics, that was a good combination."

Salt Lake City is also a major draw for finance, with one of the highest concentrations of industrial banks in the U.S.; 15 of the nation's 23 industrial banks are located in the county.

The metro's snow economy sets it apart from other cities and will once again help boost Salt Lake City's profile on an international stage when it hosts the Winter Olympic Games in 2034. 

Yet some real challenges are ahead. Climate change and a lack of diversity, for example, could affect the city's future.

A month ago, City Council approved an ordinance allowing cars with expired tags to be towed. Monday night, the sponsors of that earlier plan pitched another proposal, this time aimed at cracking down business owners that don't pay pay their property taxes. After a contentious debate, council opted to take a different route, referring the proposal to a committee to review, delaying a vote on implementing the plan.

The proposal was another piece of public safety legislation authored by Mayor Ken McClure, who is less than a month away from leaving the post he's held for the past eight years, and Councilman Craig Hosmer. The pair co-sponsored the ordinance, which would require applicants seeking occupational licenses to be up to date on their personal property taxes.

The amendments to the current ordinance would require that an applicant include paid receipts for "all personal property taxes due Greene County for property held in the name of the applicant for the previous calendar year." For those who might not owe taxes that year, a statement of non-assessment would have to be included.

City Attorney Jordan Paul said such a requirement has been found to be allowable under state and federal laws and that a similar requirement is already in place in St. Louis and Kansas City.

Greene County Assessor Brent Johnson addressed council and noted that while the city has issued roughly 11,000 business licenses, he has only received a little more than 4,000 business assessment lists from within city limits for the year. He said business assessment lists are similar to personal property assessment — owners list their assets, which for businesses include any equipment, furniture, vehicles, and any other tangible property that is used for the business.

If that list is never filled out and returned, taxes cannot be billed. Johnson also noted it is a matter of education — some business owners do not know that they are required to fill out assessments or what assets would have to be assessed.

Unlike the requirement of an individual property tax receipt for vehicle registration, Greene County Collector Allen Icet said the county has no effective mechanism to crack down on businesses that are not declaring the property they own nor paying their taxes. While collections from property taxes do not make up a large portion of the city's budget, these tax revenues do fund Springfield Public Schools, Springfield-Greene County Library District, and other tax entities.

Hosmer and McClure's proposed change would require those who want to renew or receive a new business license to show they have paid their business' property taxes. Hosmer said this would be a similar process to what the state already uses for vehicle registration, ensuring all business owners are held to the same standards. He highlighted SPS' need for the revenue, particularly as discussions of job cuts have surfaced more recently.

Councilman Abe McGull was the one to suggest referring the proposal to the Plans and Policies Committee prior to voting on it. He emphasized that he was not against the goal of the ordinance and ensuring everyone pays their fair share but rather wanted the details to be more fleshed out and allow time for public feedback.

"When you send things through committee, all those things are hashed out, everybody in the community is aware of it," he said. "But you're asking us, in two weeks, to pass this major piece of legislation that's going to affect a lot of people, the small businesses and stuff like that, and they may not even know about it. Not everybody watches the city council meetings."

The towing ordinance passed by council Feb. 24 in a 5-3 vote also had not gone through committees prior to being presented to council for a vote. Hosmer questioned why committee work was brought up for an ordinance specifically dealing with businesses and not for the general public.

"It's a privilege to do business in the city of Springfield, and we should make people pay their fair share, businesses and individuals both," Hosmer said. "So, I think it's imperative that we go ahead and do this, and I don't think it should be sent to committee, because the last time my bills got sent to committee, they never seem to come back."

Councilwoman Monica Horton and Councilman Brandon Jenson, both of whom voted against the towing ordinance, noted that the discussion was not about showing favoritism to businesses but ensuring all questions are answered prior to making legislative decisions. Horton noted there is no rush to put the issue to a vote.

"We might have had a unanimous vote on the towing amendment, if it had went to committee and we had fleshed out some of the issues that came before us to the public," she said. "I think that, you know, because we're having this type of tug of war here, I think that there is some value-add and some benefit to flesh this out a little bit better, instead of doing this sloppily."

Jenson said that when he was onboarded, he was told that there should be no ordinance that comes before council without going to committee prior. He recently referred Right to Counsel to committee. While there is nothing that requires ordinances to go before committee, City Code does state that it is council policy "to encourage the referral of council bills involving policy issues and substantive changes to the appropriate city council committee." Likewise, there is no legislation or strict rules about how long an ordinance, program or topic can remain in committee or what must come out of the process.

"I am surprised that the sponsors of this bill, who gave me that instruction, now have brought two ordinances forward that have a substantial impact on people in our community without following the process that I was told is critically important to good policy," he said.

Ultimately, the referral passed 7-2 with McClure and Hosmer opposed. Hosmer said he does not have another future ordinance planned regarding property tax enforcement. With upcoming April 8 election, the issue will be taken up by a new mayor and possibly new council members.

When the towing ordinance was passed last month, Springfield Police Department declared there would be an educational period before enforcement began. With that period over, SPD may begin towing vehicles with inadequate registration starting Wednesday, March 26. Police Chief Paul Williams had previously said initially officers will go after cars that are a year or more expired.

Both Johnson and Icet said they have noticed effects already since the ordinance passed. Johnson said the assessment office is seeing large lines, which are not typical for this time of year, particularly with individuals getting their assessments for the past several past years.

Icet said over the few weeks that the new towing ordinance has been in place but not yet enforced, the collector's office has seen roughly a 30% increase in the taxes collected from the same period last year, totaling roughly $230,000 more. He said this increase is more than what he would anticipate in a normal year and attributed the change to council's action.

TPG, a global alternative asset management firm, has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy's wind turbine generator businesses in India and Sri Lanka. Siemens Gamesa is a wind power subsidiary of Germany's Siemens Energy AG.

In a statement on Wednesday, TPG said the transaction was subject to closing conditions and regulatory approvals, but didn't disclose the financial details of the investment.

Mint reported in May last year that Siemens Energy had put up for sale Siemens Gamesa's India wind turbine unit to cut losses and return its global wind turbine business to profitability by 2026.

TPG Rise Climate, the global asset management firm's climate investing platform, will invest in Siemens Gamesa's India and Sri Lanka businesses through its Global South Initiative, launched with climate fund Alterra to scale climate solutions in the region.

MAVCO Investments, backed by some Murugappa group family members, and former JSW Energy chief executive Prashant Jain will also make minority investments in Siemens Gamesa's India and Sri Lanka businesses.

Following the closing of the transaction, a new independent company will be created.

Siemens Gamesa will hold a minority stake in this new company and transfer to it about 1,000 employees and its manufacturing infrastructure in India. It will also exclusively license its intellectual property and technology while developing products for the new company, TPG said in the statement.

Vinod Philip, Siemens Energy board member overseeing Siemens Gamesa, said India remains an attractive wind energy market with significant growth potential.

“The new company will serve the Indian market more effectively while also offering a long-term perspective for the employees and customers. This ensures continued support and development in this vibrant market, while Siemens Gamesa can concentrate on other core markets,” Philip said in the statement.

The new company's board will be chaired by Vellayan Subbiah, who was recently appointed as a whole-time director and designated as executive chairman of Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Company, Murugappa Group's non-banking financial company. Jain will serve as executive vice chairman of the new entity and Philip will operate as Siemens Gamesa representative on its board.

“We believe onshore wind will continue to play an increasing role in India's green energy mix and this new platform, with Siemens Gamesa's world-class product manufacturing and service offering, and the backing of TPG and MAVCO will continue to accelerate the delivery of gigawatts of clean power to millions of Indians across the socio-economic spectrum,” said Ankur Thadani, partner and head of climate, Asia, at TPG.

Morgan Stanley, Kearney, Deloitte, Alvarez & Marsal, Khaitan & Co., Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton jointly advised TPG, MAVCO and Jain on the transaction.

Theodora's Pizzeria sat empty on a recent Saturday afternoon. Sussex Meat Packing has seen its weekday lunch crowd all but disappear. And Rocky's Pasties ― a 100-year-old business selling Cornish meat pies ― is down 30%.

“Customers come in and say it used to take them 10 to 15 minutes to get here," said Tom “Rocky” Rodkewitz, the manager of Rocky's. "Now it takes them an hour.”

Blame the sinkholes.

Wharton, an old mining community that long ago became a suburban homestead with a thriving North Jersey downtown, has become a victim of its legacy as a collapsed section of Route 80 ― built over the Mount Pleasant mine ― has choked the borough's streets with detours and squeezed local businesses to the breaking point.

And there is little relief in sight.

The eastbound closure of Route 80 began on Feb. 10 as a sinkhole appeared by Exit 34. That void is located just a few feet from another sinkhole that closed the same area of the highway over four days in December.

Since the discovery of the sinkhole last month, the state Transportation Department announced repairs will take longer than expected due to the possibility of additional voids in the area.

And, as if fulfilling that prediction, an additional void opened on March 19, resulting in the shutdown of westbound lanes.

The entirety of Route 80 at Exit 34 is now closed. And DOT officials have "identified 90 locations to be assessed and mitigate potential instability or possible voids."

Gov. Phil Murphy said on March 22 that repairs could take another two months.

The cause of the Morris County sinkholes are abandoned mines that once drove the region's economy, but have been inactive and unattended since the 1960s. Morris County is home to more than 100 such abandoned mines, a 2020 geographical report on the area shows.

The sinkhole saga in Morris County is not only a headache for commuters, but for owners of local businesses ― particularly in Wharton ― who are finding fewer customers entering their shops as drivers avoid the area because of the bumper-to-bumper traffic.

Theodora's Pizzeria in Wharton saw a 50% to 70% decline in customers on some weekdays since the sinkholes shut down I-80 in early February.

"No one wants to sit because they are sitting forever in traffic, it has impacted us a lot,” said owner Theodora Tzouvaras. "If this takes longer, is it really worth being in business anymore? And we are one of the smaller businesses. It is really difficult to say. They say six to eight weeks but is it really that long? They keep finding new holes."

St. Patrick's Day weekend was supposed to be one of the best days of the spring for Knotty Pine Pub in Wharton. Not so this year, said its owner, Jimmy Hill. The restaurant, which serves burgers, sandwiches, fries and, of course, alcoholic beverages, was down $1,500 from last St. Patrick's Day, Hill said. 

Warehouse and factory workers would typically take the five minute drive to Townsquare Diner for lunch, said owner Pete Sederas. But that has dried up because the drive is now taking up to 30 minutes each way.

“Their one-hour lunchtime is all on the road,” he said. 

Wharton Mayor Bill Chegwidden has likened the situation to when businesses were struggling during the COVID pandemic five years ago. But some say it's even more difficult.

“It's worse than COVID," said Rodkewitz of Rocky's Pasties. "At least there we had our takeout option,”

Tzouvaras of Theodora's Pizzeria, a staple in the Wharton community since 1996, said for her business "it feels like COVID again."

But this time, she said, it seems even more intense.

"COVID we did a lot of takeout, and takeout was always good, so that was not affected, but we didn't have this traffic," she said. "Delivery guys didn't take an extra 20 minutes to get to where they have to be, customers didn't have to sit in traffic. It's a different situation overall.”

Sussex Meat Market, a community shop that has been in business for more than 40 years, has experienced a 30% to 40% drop in businesses, owner Dirk Peereboom said.

"We used to get a big crowd for lunch, but now people don't have time to get here," he said.

Major League Barbers on South Main Street is another Wharton business that has been struggling since the sinkhole swallowed Route 80. Owner Nancy De La Cruz said most of her customers are from neighboring towns such as Dover, Lake Hopatcong, Sparta, Parsippany and Budd Lake. But they have stopped traveling to her shop over the last few weeks.

"This was supposed to be our busy season, in the spring," she said. "No one is showing up because they don't want to sit in traffic for hours.”

The barbershop has seen about a 40% decline in customers since the start of the sinkhole repairs, she said.

Still, shop owners work to endure the hardship.

“My grandparents dealth with the Great Depression, we'll be able to endure this," Rodkewitz said. "But it will be tough."

Chris Flores, a spokesperson for the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, said businesses in Morris or Sussex counties that have taken a hit from local sinkhole traffic could apply for grants or loans under the COVID-era Main Street Recovery Program.

To date, the state has awarded more than $167 million to 5,000 New Jersey businesses under the program, Flores said.

Strictly speaking, the Main Street Recovery Program is not specifically for businesses affected by sinkhole traffic, but it's a means for the state to inject cash into these businesses in the short term. 

Here's a breakdown of some of the programs: 

Meanwhile, state Assemblywoman Aura Dunn, who represents Wharton in the New Jersey Legislature, along with Senator Anthony M. Bucco (R-Morris) introduced two “Road to Relief” bills this week meant to take some of the pressure off businesses affected by the sinkhole. 

“The only way to turn this around for [businesses] is to do a 180 and focus on getting them the support they need while the engineers and other experts tend to the sinkholes,” Dunn said in a Monday evening statement. 

Gov. Phil Murphy's office declined to comment Tuesday afternoon on the moves being made by the Legislature.

But Yazan Muheisen, co-owner of Pop's Bagel Shop, said the sales tax exemption would be of little help to the business, since the sales tax is often passed on to the consumer. 

“It's not the assistance that's going to make or break the business,” he said. 

As far as federal relief, Murphy would have to request a federal emergency declaration, which would open the way for business assistance, said Barbara Nitis, a spokesperson for the U.S Small Business Administration.

Typically, a governor has to request an emergency declaration from the president of the United States, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. 

Then the SBA will provide low-interest loans to businesses impacted by the disaster; in this case the sinkhole. 

On Saturday, Murphy said the relief that will be distributed to businesses will be determined later.

Murphy issued an emergency declaration on March 8 for Morris County to begin that process, but the potential relief is still in discussions between the SBA and governor's office.

WILLIAMSTOWN — Misti Sims, a Parkersburg South High School graduate and founder, owner and lead planner of Little Black Dress Events, signed documents Monday at Williamstown Elementary becoming their new Partner In Education.

Partners In Education is a program started by the Chamber of Commerce of the Mid-Ohio Valley that aims for partnerships that support students' growth, fosters achievement and deepens community connections

“This opportunity came up with the elementary and I was like, my heart is always going to still be with the littles, just because this is the groundbreaking part of showing them things that they may not be shown in everyday life, at their home or whatever,” Sims said. “All walks of life, all financial backgrounds come through the school as well as others.”

Sims said her son attended Williamstown Elementary and is now in sixth grade at the middle/high school. She said while he was at the elementary level she was heavily involved with the PTA and other events. She said Principal Lee Ann Cumpston approached her last year about becoming a Partner In Education. Sims said she wasn't very knowledgeable about the program and assumed schools could only have one partner and that they wrote big checks.

“The things that I can bring to the table, it's not necessarily that,” Sims said. “I'm not some big company.”

She said Cumston informed her that the program isn't just about writing checks.

“The more community we can bring into the school, the more things that we can expose kids to,” Cumpston said Monday. “And like she alluded, there are kids that come in here from all financial backgrounds and partnerships like this allow us to do special events for our students that they wouldn't otherwise be able to do.”

Sims said this was all she needed to know to make the decision to become a partner in education.

“We talked a lot about STEM during last year, and I just wanted to kind of circle back to that and just because my kid isn't here, and I just have the one, doesn't mean that I can't still be involved in some capacity. So it just means a lot to me.”

Jill Parsons, CEO of the Chamber of Commerce of the Mid-Ohio Valley, said the chamber tries to match potential partners with schools that will fit their individual level of participation in the program. 

“She (Sims) thought maybe being a partner was out of the ballpark for her, because she couldn't write a big check like a bigger company could do,” Parsons said. “But she's got passion, and she has ideas, and she has manpower that can come into a school that is different from some of the partners that can help more on a financial basis, who maybe aren't able to come into the school and help with the events.”

Parsons said the chamber uses artificial intelligence to make better connections with local businesses that will lead to longer lasting relationships. 

“We're the only county using AI to match schools and businesses,” Parsons said. “We want to create long-term relationships that extend beyond just having a child in the school.”

She said both potential partners and schools will fill out a three-minute survey listing the levels of interest and needs both are looking for.

“It might generate two or three ideas of schools and two or three businesses,” Parsons said. “Just so that relationships in the partner in education program are long term.”

Businesses interested in participating in the Partners In Education program can contact the chamber at info@movchamber.org or call 304-422-3588. 

“At the end of the day, it's about supporting our community's children and showing them what's possible,” Sims said.

According to Ai 姨, the term 'preferential pricing' used by bwenews may indicate humor or sarcasm, suggesting a potential perception of the current cryptocurrency prices as perhaps inflated or manipulated. This sentiment could influence traders to be cautious and critically evaluate market pricing strategies. The humorous tone implies skepticism, which might affect market confidence and trading volumes.

GameStop GME shares are up some 15% on Wednesday, March 26 after the gaming merchandise retailer announced plans of using its corporate cash to buy Bitcoin BTCUSD. 

In its press release, the firm did not set a limit on how much it may invest in the world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap. 

Investors are cheering the announcement because putting BTC on the balance sheet has worked wonders for MicroStrategy MSTR stock over the past year. 

Including today's surge, GME shares are up nearly 35% versus their year-to-date low.  

What a Bitcoin Strategy May Mean for GameStop Stock

MicroStrategy has transitioned from a business intelligence software company into a Bitcoin proxy in recent years. It started buying BTC in August 2020, when MSTR traded for roughly $15. 

Today, the Virginia-headquartered firm owns more than 500,000 BTC in total, while its share price sits at about $33. That's a well over twenty-fold increase in less than five years. 

In 2024, the company now known as Strategy achieved a “BTC Yield” of 74.3%, indicating its Bitcoin acquisition strategy has been immensely successful in improving shareholder value. 

So, if GME succeeds in replicating MicroStrategy with its Bitcoin strategy, it's reasonable to believe that its stock price will rally in the medium to long term as well. 

That is what's driving GameStop stock price up at the time of writing. 

GME More Than Doubled Net Income in its Q4

GameStop shares may be worth buying at current levels because the retailer's earnings release also showed signed of improvement on Wednesday. 

For its Q4, the gaming merchandise company reported about $131 million in net income. That translates to a more than 100% growth from $63.1 million in the same quarter last year. 

More importantly, the NYSE-listed firm has sharply improved its overall liquidity in the trailing 12 months, from $1.19 billion only to $4.775 billion. 

Wall Street Remains Bearish on GameStop Shares

While things seem to be picking up for GameStop, investors should note that Wall Street remains bearish as ever on GME shares. 

The consensus rating on GameStop currently sits at “Strong Sell” with the mean target of $10 indicating potential downside of about 65% from current levels. However, investors should note that Barchart is only tracking one analyst in coverage of GME.

Bitwise Asset Management chief investment officer Matthew Hougan says the firm is "extraordinarily bullish" on Bitcoin BTC/USD as the cryptocurrency gains widespread acceptance from governments, corporations and traditional asset managers. 

What To Know: Hougan sat down with Benzinga at the Future Proof Citywide event in Miami Beach, FL last week and talked about the importance of a crypto-friendly administration and President Donald Trump's recent announcement of a strategic bitcoin reserve. 

The last existential threat to bitcoin was removed when governments began accepting and adopting the cryptocurrency as an asset, Hougan said.

"We see governments around the world buying it. Do you wanna wait til it's too late to get in, or do you want to build your position now? The reason it's important for crypto investors is the biggest existential risk to crypto has always been that governments wouldn't like it, right?," Hougan told Benzinga. 

The chief investment officer said that the bitcoin of today has matured and become legitimized and accepted in a way it was not even five or 10 years ago. He pointed to institutional investors, hedge funds, ETFs and more than 70 corporations that now keep bitcoin as part of their holdings. 

Bitwise designed the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF OWNB that provides exposure to corporations with at least 1,000 bitcoin on their balance sheets.

"BlackRock is in the space. Fidelity is in the space. Stan Druckenmiller owns bitcoin. Ray Dalio owns bitcoin. The United States owns bitcoin," Hougan said. 

Hougan said that though the short-term outlook for bitcoin is risky, he sees the influx of capital eventually pushing bitcoin to $200,000 in the long run. 

"Short term: risky. Long term: extraordinarily bullish," Hougan said, sharing Bitwise's current outlook for bitcoin.

GameStop shares jumped over 14% over the past 24 hours after the company's board approved a plan to buy Bitcoin.

The video game retailer and meme stock darling has $4.8 billion in cash reserves, but it's unclear how much it wants to allocate to the number one cryptocurrency.

While the announcement has caused a stock price uptick, some market observers say it's a double-edged sword.

“In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company's stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility,” analysts at crypto business payment company B2BINPay told DL News.

“Stablecoins, of course, won't carry those risks, but Bitcoin can go both ways ― offering potential for growth but also for a drop.”

Bitcoin dropped on Wednesday, to $86,858 in afternoon trading UK time, and is still almost 20% off its January peak.

Still, the move would put GameStop in the swelling company of public firms that have added Bitcoin to their corporate balance sheets ― most famously Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, which holds the largest Bitcoin hoard worth more than $44 billion.

Championed by its laser-eyed founder Michael Saylor, Strategy's Bitcoin bet has turned the software company into a de facto Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.

Bitcoin adoption has been a stock booster for some companies. 

Strategy's stock price has soared 84% in the last 12 months, and it's up 23-fold since it began acquiring Bitcoin in 2020. 

The shares of Metaplanet, a Japanese investment firm, have skyrocketed 1,600% since it started buying Bitcoin last April.

But not every Strategy copycat has done so well. The swoon in Bitcoin's price in the first quarter, along with stocks and other cryptocurrencies, has punished newer entrants to the Bitcoin treasury play with significant losses.

If Strategy is any guide, GameStop might need its own Bitcoin-maxi. CEO Ryan Cohen was seen with Saylor last month, which stoked speculations that GameStop could join the 170 entities with Bitcoin treasuries.

Matt Cole, CEO of asset management firm Strive Asset Management, also urged Cohen in an open letter to convert some of GameStop's cash holdings into Bitcoin ― to which Cohen responded, “Letter received.”

Co-founded by entrepreneur and Donald Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy, Strive filed for a Bitcoin Bond ETF earlier in the year. The proposed ETF invests in bonds that are issued by public companies with Bitcoin treasury holdings.

Oops, something went wrong

MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR), recently rebranded to Strategy, co-founder and executive chair Michael Saylor said that he may burn his own private keys to Bitcoin instead of donating the cryptocurrency before he dies.

It would be an “ethically proper, ethically sound form of charity” that would grant “economic immortality,” added Saylor.

Saylor made these remarks while speaking to Christine Lee in an interview on March 25.

Strategy co-founder explained that burning his Bitcoin would reduce its supply, making the asset more valuable. The step would make “everyone in the network much richer and more powerful.”

Saylor added, “We're all in it together, from now to eternity. So yeah, that's my legacy.” He personally holds more than 17,000 Bitcoin.

Strategy itself would “never sell” its Bitcoin holdings the way the U.S. government has vowed not to, Saylor clarified.

The Bitcoin evangelist predicted Bitcoin's market capitalization to reach $200 trillion by 2045. As of March 26, it stands at $1.7 trillion. Saylor believes that in 2045, artificial intelligence (AI) agents will interact millions of times a second and use Bitcoin as a base currency.

Thanks to Saylor's highly bullish outlook towards Bitcoin, Strategy is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The company currently holds 506,137 Bitcoin, worth approximately $44.3 billion at current prices.

As GameStop joined the list of select companies that add Bitcoin to their corporate holdings on March 25, Saylor welcomed the move on X (formerly Twitter).

As per Kraken's price feeds, Bitcoin was trading at $87,818.80 at press time. Meanwhile, MSTR was exchanging hands at $341.81 at press time.

According to Miles Deutscher, ChatGPT has become the fastest application to reach 1 million users, highlighting its untapped potential in the AI sector. This rapid growth could influence cryptocurrency markets by increasing demand for AI-related tokens and projects, as investors seek to capitalize on emerging technologies. Traders should monitor AI sector developments and related cryptocurrencies for potential investment opportunities. (Source: Miles Deutscher on Twitter)

The current stock market correction has been difficult not just for equity investors, but also for crypto investors. Across the board, nearly every major cryptocurrency is down for the year.

And, right now, the one cryptocurrency on everyone's mind is Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which has historically been the bellwether for the crypto market. So just how much of an impact has the stock market correction had on Bitcoin?

The answer to that question should have been "not much." That's because Bitcoin has historically been uncorrelated with any major asset class, including both the S&P 500 and tech stocks. In other words, Bitcoin could zig when stocks zagged. Due to Bitcoin's wild volatility, which led to huge market swings up and down, it was pretty much impossible to say that it was correlated with anything.

But that no longer seems to be the case. Bitcoin is now down 10% for the year, and nearly 25% since it hit an all-time high of $109,000 back on Jan. 20. So you could say that the stock market correction has had a very obvious and direct impact on Bitcoin, which is also in correction mode right now.

It's important here to keep an eye on Bitcoin's correlation with the overall stock market. This correlation is a mathematical measurement telling you how connected Bitcoin's moves (up or down) are with the broader market. Historically, this number has been very low, or even negative, suggesting a possible inverse relationship between Bitcoin and stocks.

But, in early January, Bitcoin's correlation with the S&P 500 surged to 0.88, suggesting a nearly 1-to-1 correlation with the stock market. This correlation has remained stubbornly high, suggesting that Bitcoin will likely continue to feel the impact of stock market moves to a much greater degree than in the past.

From a portfolio diversification perspective, a relatively high correlation with the stock market makes Bitcoin much less attractive to investors. It's getting harder and harder to make the point that Bitcoin should be a stand-alone asset class when it is behaving more and more like a highly risky tech stock.

It is also possible to measure the shift in investor sentiment. This, too, we can measure with some mathematical precision, thanks to the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Measured between 0 and 100, this metric tells you what investors are thinking at any point in time. If they are deeply fearful, the number is close to 0. If they are ebullient and euphoric, the number is closer to 100.

When Bitcoin briefly dipped below $80,000, that number fell below 20, reflecting intense fear in the marketplace. Back in December, when Bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time, that number was closer to 80, reflecting intense euphoria in the marketplace. That makes sense, given that Bitcoin hit the $100,000 mark approximately a month after the presidential election, when investors were feeling very bullish about the prospects of crypto headed into 2025.

These days, crypto sentiment can swing wildly between fear and greed, depending on the day of the week. When the White House is talking about creating a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, sentiment tends to move positive. However, discussions of trade tariffs and economic tightening measures from the White House often lead to a negative shift in sentiment.

This change in sentiment is having an immediate impact on investor inflows and outflows into the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have become a popular tool for adjusting one's overall exposure to Bitcoin. For five straight weeks, there were massive outflows, with investors moving their money out of the Bitcoin ETFs.

That makes sense, right? If investors wake up each day feeling fearful, they are going to find ways to act on that fear. And that means shifting money out of the Bitcoin ETFs. That money has to go somewhere, and it now appears that it is shifting into gold ETFs. In the 30-day period ended March 14, $5 billion flowed out of the Bitcoin ETFs, while $10 billion flowed into gold ETFs.

If you are trying to predict where Bitcoin is headed next, there are three different pieces to the puzzle: Bitcoin's correlation with the stock market, investor sentiment, and investor inflows (or outflows) to the Bitcoin ETFs. The good news is all of these can be measured mathematically, and can be tracked on a regular, recurring basis.

2025 is shaping up to be an important test for Bitcoin. If it can zig when the stock market zags, investors will know that the "old Bitcoin" is back. They will become more positive about its long-term price prospects, and more willing to pump additional money into the Bitcoin ETFs. And that steady buying pressure over time should help to put Bitcoin on the path to hitting a new all-time high.

03/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25

Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher.

Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a “big catalyst” for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday's market close—potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor's Strategy.

Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the "premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector."

Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he “has an incredible opportunity."

“Letter received,” Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy.

03/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor's Strategy that's built up the world's biggest corporate stash of bitcoin—with self-styled “bitcoin historian” Pete Rizzo telling traders to “buckle up.”

While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy.

GameStop's "investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively," the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read.

GameStop's stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin.

Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020.

"Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen," Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair.

That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies.

“Overall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements," analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments. 

“In the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company's stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won't carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways — offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop's financial standing.”

Strategy, until recently known as MicroStrategy, now holds around 500,000 bitcoin worth $42 billion after it began aggressively buying bitcoin in 2020.

Saylor was one of a handful of bitcoin and crypto company executives that attended the White House digital asset summit hosted by U.S. president Donald Trump earlier this month.

Last week, Saylor predicted there's about to be a “Cambrian explosion” of companies and countries buying bitcoin during a Blockworks podcast.

Key Takeaways:

Fold Holdings Inc. and Bitdeer Technologies Group have been included in the holdings of the Bitwise Investments Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF (OWNB). This was announced on March 25, 2025, via the company's X account.

Founded in 2019, and headquartered in Phoenix, Fold Holdings develops Bitcoin financial services, allowing consumers to earn Bitcoin rewards through the Fold app. Bitdeer Technologies is a Nasdaq-listed Bitcoin mining company which has operations in the well-known locations such as the United States, as well as more obscure countries such as Norway and Bhutan and thus a significant player in the setup behind the Bitcoin network itself. This follows the launch of the Bitwise fund, highlighting the ETF's rapid expansion and appeal to companies with significant Bitcoin exposure.

The addition of Fold Holdings and Bitdeer Technologies to the OWNB ETF fits with Bitwise's strategy of broadening its holdings with companies that encompass multiple dimensions of the Bitcoin ecosystem.

With the addition of these two new companies, the ETF now consists of 22 companies holding at least 1,000 BTC in their treasuries. The fund is passively managed, offering exposure to publicly traded Bitcoin companies.

Note that the fund does not own Bitcoin outright or through derivatives linked to Bitcoin, so it avoids some of the direct volatility of the cryptocurrency itself. It is not, however, a measure of Bitcoin's price itself, but rather the price of companies associated with Bitcoin. As a result, the performance of the ETF is influenced by the financial health, market positioning, and strategic decisions of the included companies, rather than Bitcoin's day-to-day fluctuations.

The OWNB ETF is based on the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations Index, which includes significant Bitcoin holders like Strategy (MSTR) (previously called MicroStrategy), MARA Holdings (MARA), and Tesla (TSLA), which is run by Elon Musk.

The OWNB ETF's other major companies include Riot Platforms, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific. Like Strategy, Metaplanet has also been aggressively accumulating Bitcoin.

As of March 21, 2025, Strategy (MSTR) holds the largest share in the Bitwise Standard Corporations Index, accounting for 21.98%. The company owns 506,137 BTC, valued at over $42 billion. Second and third after these are MARA and Riot Platforms, with respective weightings of 10.07% and 9.85%.

Metaplanet, which has been very active in acquiring Bitcoin, has a weight of 4.81% in the index as the fourth largest holding and clearly values Bitcoin as a treasury asset.



The expanded OWNB ETF now holds a cumulative 648,000 BTC, worth over $54 billion USD. This represents approximately 3.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. In other words, the OWNB ETF is a barometer for the growing trend of corporations allocating to Bitcoin.

Fold Holdings currently owns 1,485 BTC worth nearly $124 million according to the Bitwise OWNB site, while Bitdeer holds 1,090 BTC that has an estimated value of about $91 million. According to analysts, ETFs offer a distinctive way to gain exposure to Bitcoin's growth story via the stock market.

Bitwise's move reflects heightened corporate interest in Bitcoin and allows investors to ride this growing trend with exposure through the OWNB ETF.

I called my dad the other night, and we found ourselves discussing investments, as we often do. He surprised me by confidently declaring, “You should've invested in gold instead of Bitcoin.” His comment wasn't just casual financial advice; it echoed a broader sentiment that's growing among investors lately.

Why are gold and Bitcoin, both once seen as safe-haven assets, now moving in distinctly different directions? This divergence is becoming more pronounced and meaningful, affecting investor decisions, regulatory outlooks, and market strategies.

Gold, long revered as a safe-haven asset, typically moves inversely to economic optimism. When geopolitical tensions rise, inflation fears spike, or market confidence dwindles, investors rush to gold. This behavior has been consistent throughout economic downturns, including the financial crisis of 2008, where gold prices soared in response to uncertainty. ​​During the 2008 financial crisis, gold prices surged nearly 25% from $870 per ounce in January 2008 to over $1,080 per ounce by December 2009.

Bitcoin, while also touted as an inflation hedge, behaves differently. Its movements are heavily influenced by market sentiment, regulatory developments, technological adoption, and liquidity flows, rather than solely economic indicators. Recently, the cryptocurrency market has been particularly impacted by regulatory crackdowns, advancements in blockchain technology, and growing institutional adoption. These factors often drive Bitcoin's volatility independent of traditional market pressures.

One of the primary reasons gold and Bitcoin are diverging lies in investor perception and asset functionality. Gold maintains a consistent perception as a stable store of value, underpinned by centuries of human consensus. Central banks hold significant gold reserves, reinforcing its global monetary role. Gold's limited use cases—primarily jewelry, investment, and limited industrial applications—protect its demand profile from rapid technological or regulatory shifts.

In contrast, BTC had a 42% annualized volatility of daily price movements in 2023 alone, influenced by regulatory shifts and technological updates. For instance, regulatory decisions in major economies, such as the United States, China, and Europe, can trigger sudden and dramatic price swings. Additionally, technological advancements, blockchain scalability issues, or innovations in competing cryptocurrencies can significantly affect Bitcoin's value.

The recent divergence can also be attributed to differing investor behaviors in response to macroeconomic environments. Amid rising interest rates and fluctuating inflation rates, investors looking for stability lean towards gold. Gold's tangible nature and its long-standing role in monetary policy provide psychological comfort and confidence.

Bitcoin investors often represent a different demographic and risk profile, typically younger investors and tech-savvy institutions drawn to innovation and higher risk-return potentials. The digital asset appeals as both a speculative instrument and a future-oriented investment tied to blockchain innovation. Thus, in periods of uncertainty or technological optimism, Bitcoin can experience swings contrary to gold.

The institutional narrative around Bitcoin has evolved rapidly, adding another layer of complexity. Institutional investors, hedge funds, and even some conservative asset managers have increasingly added Bitcoin to their portfolios.

Institutional investors now hold approximately 7% of Bitcoin's total circulating supply, up from under 1% just three years ago. While this adds legitimacy, it also makes Bitcoin susceptible to large-scale liquidity shifts driven by institutional buying or selling.

Gold, by contrast, has long been embedded within institutional investment frameworks, offering a predictable and less volatile profile. Regulatory clarity in gold trading, storage, and investment is well-established, ensuring consistent institutional participation without sudden disruptions.

Furthermore, recent regulatory moves have uniquely impacted Bitcoin. Regulatory actions in the United States in 2023 alone caused short-term declines of up to 15% in Bitcoin's market value following announcements by the SEC. Authorities worldwide have begun defining clearer frameworks around cryptocurrencies. Regulatory tightening in the U.S., outright bans in certain jurisdictions, or favorable regulatory environments elsewhere can all influence Bitcoin drastically, reinforcing its divergence from gold.

In chatting with Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, during his livestream, he commented, "The divergence we're witnessing between gold and Bitcoin reflects deeper shifts in investor psychology and market structure. While gold continues to offer predictability during uncertain economic times, Bitcoin's volatility highlights its role as both a speculative asset and a bet on digital transformation. Investors must recognize these distinct characteristics to effectively navigate and diversify their portfolios."

Understanding the divergence between gold and Bitcoin matters significantly for investors, policymakers, and the broader market for several reasons.

Firstly, this divergence underscores the reality that Bitcoin, despite comparisons, is fundamentally different from traditional commodities like gold. Investors relying on Bitcoin purely as an inflation hedge may misjudge the asset's behavior, resulting in unanticipated risks. Thus, portfolio diversification strategies must account for Bitcoin's unique characteristics rather than treating it as a direct substitute for gold.

Secondly, regulators must recognize that traditional regulatory frameworks suitable for gold and other commodities may not directly apply to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Regulatory clarity tailored to crypto-specific characteristics is essential to stabilize market dynamics and protect investor interests.

Lastly, from a market standpoint, the divergence highlights shifts in global economic and investment paradigms. As markets transition towards digitalization and decentralization, assets like Bitcoin may increasingly decouple from traditional market behaviors, driven instead by technology adoption cycles and digital infrastructure developments. This trend could redefine the benchmarks and metrics investors use to evaluate asset performance.

Looking ahead, the relationship between gold and Bitcoin is likely to remain complex and divergent. While gold will continue to offer stability, predictability, and traditional safe-haven characteristics, Bitcoin will likely embody risk, innovation, and digital transformation. Both assets will likely coexist, serving different investor needs and preferences.

As digital assets become increasingly mainstream, Bitcoin's correlation with technology sectors, particularly blockchain and fintech, might strengthen, further distancing itself from gold. Meanwhile, gold may become even more appealing during periods of intense technological disruption or geopolitical instability.

The current divergence between gold and Bitcoin serves as a critical reminder to investors, regulators, and the financial market about the importance of clearly understanding the distinct roles and behaviors of diverse asset classes. Rather than seeing Bitcoin purely as digital gold, recognizing its unique dynamics can guide better investment strategies, regulatory policies, and market analysis.

Ultimately, embracing these differences between Bitcoin and Gold rather than oversimplifying them could help investors harness both assets more effectively, achieving balanced portfolios that thrive across traditional stability and innovative volatility.

            After GameStop closed about a quarter of its locations within the past year, shuttering 1,000 stores across the world, the company said it's not close to done. And as the struggling company closes stores, it will invest cash in cryptocurrencies.
    


            GameStop revealed in a regulatory filing Tuesday that it expects to close a “significant number” of additional locations in the coming months, although the “specific set of stores has not been identified for closure.”
    


            A majority of the closures occurred in its biggest market, the United States, with 590 locations shutting down and reducing its store count to 2,325 as of February 1. More than 330 locations closed across Europe, plus nearly 50 stores in Canada and Australia.
    


            Globally, 3,203 GameStops remain — down drastically from its peak of about 6,000 a decade ago.
    


            GameStop has closed hundreds of stores over the past several years because it has struggled to adapt to customers' changing habits of buying games online and streaming. The company was also center of the “meme stock” craze in 2021, which briefly boosted its stock.
    


            GameStop joins a number of other well-known retailers closing stores or completely disappearing, including Joann, Forever 21, Kohl's and Macy's. Among the reasons contributing to the retail exodus is continuing inflationary pressure on consumers' wallets, pressure from private equity and retailers not quickly adapting to changing shopping habits.
    


            As part of GameStop's pivot away from retail, the company also said that it's getting into bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset, announcing that a “portion of our cash or future debt and equity issuances” might be invested in the digital currency.
    


            “The pivot to bitcoin is really a defense against irrelevance,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail told CNN, adding that it's “an odd thing as it's basically saying the strategy isn't retail but to act as some kind of cryptocurrency investment vehicle.”
    


            Nevertheless, the crypto announcement helped juice the stock: GameStop (GME) shares soared 16% in premarket trading Wednesday.

Bitcoin remained steady above $87,000 in Asian afternoon hours Wednesday as traders continued to monitor U.S. data releases and how the levy of U.S. tariffs will play out starting April 2, with most in wait-and-watch mode.

Majors were little-changed in the past 24 hours as Solana's SOL, xrp (XRP), BNB Chain's BNB, and ether (ETH) rose under 3%, while memecoin dogecoin (DOGE) outperformed with a 5.5% jump.

That was the second-straight day for gains for DOGE, alongside continued bumps in pepe (PEPE) and mog (MOG), as a tendency among these tokens to act as a “beta bet” on ether's strength showed no signs of reverting.

Elsewhere, shiba inu (SHIB) zoomed 11%, buoyed by a rotation to riskier memes and a 228% jump in its native ShibaSwap exchange in the last 30 days. Open interest on SHIB-tracked futures has risen upward of 20% since Sunday, data shows, indicative of expectations of further volatility.

Concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown remain, however, while a rapid unwinding of momentum trades in equities has led to money managers retreating to full defensive mode, some day.

“We expect markets to continue their soft rebound from last week into month-end, with the next major catalyst being the 'liberation day' reciprocal tariff announcement from Trump scheduled for April 2nd,” Augustine Fan, Head of Insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Rumors of a softer tariff response will go a long way to recover some of the recent technical damage in US stocks, helping to spark a global rally along with the recent jump in EU/China stocks.”

“Crypto will remain a close proxy of equities in the foreseeable future as we don't see a unique catalyst in the meantime, though the recent M&A announcements with Coinbase/Kraken give us faith that the long-term bull market remains alive and well,” Fan added.

Meanwhile, traders at QCP Capital said in a Tuesday broadcast that the upcoming quarter and April in particular, have historically been one of the best periods for risk assets, second only to the festive December rally.

“The S&P 500 has delivered an average annualized return of 19.6% in Q2, while Bitcoin has also recorded its second-best median performance during this stretch - again, trailing only Q4, QCP said, pointing out caution among options traders.

“Options markets remain cautious. Call skew hasn't meaningfully shifted toward calls, with call skew only emerging from June onwards, suggesting traders are waiting to see how the tariff situation develops,” they said, adding that attention is turning to the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data, which could become the “next key catalyst.”

The PCE index captures inflation (or deflation) across a wide range of consumer expenses and reflects changes in consumer behavior.

Released monthly, the PCE is said to influence Fed interest rate decisions. High PCE readings signal rising inflation, potentially prompting rate hikes to cool the economy, which can reduce risk appetite and pressure bitcoin prices downward as investors favor safer assets. Conversely, low PCE data suggests tame inflation, possibly leading to rate cuts or steady policy, boosting liquidity and supporting Bitcoin's price as a speculative asset or inflation hedge.

The next release is on March 28 and could sway market sentiment, with bitcoin's reaction tied to how the data shapes Fed expectations — volatility often follows as traders adjust positions.

Bitcoin, the digital currency and virtual payment system, has grown increasingly popular in recent years. The top cryptocurrency token holders have made billions of dollars off the digital asset.

Getting into the crypto space can be simple or complicated, and creating your own coin is possible, but not everything has to be performed digitally. Physical tools like cryptocurrency ATMs are within reach nationwide.

Here's what to know about Bitcoin ATMs and how to locate them in Ohio.

Like traditional ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs are kiosks that allow you to purchase or sell crypto by using cash or your own credit/debit card. Also known as BTMs, you can cash out your Bitcoin at a Bitcoin ATM, according to the personal finance website Bankrate.

Unlike traditional banking methods, however, cash withdrawals are made through a QR code that the machine provides. You then send your Bitcoin via the QR code before receiving your cash minutes after.

Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that can be bought, sold, and mined. It acts as a form of payment that's not governed by a single entity, according to Investopedia. It's run on the Blockchain, a record-keeping system of computers that tracks crypto transactions.

Bitcoin has a limited supply, and because it's a decentralized system, it's not issued by central banks or authorities, USA TODAY reports. While known for its price volatility, some investors have become rich by investing in the coin at the right time.

Planning to use a Bitcoin ATM? The rise of BTMs doesn't come without risk, as Bitcoin ATM fraud is on the rise.

The Federal Trade Commission found that during the first six months of 2024 alone, consumers lost around $65 million to Bitcoin ATM kiosks; older adults over 60 were the most vulnerable. Scammers will impersonate a government official, tech support, or business and urge victims to remove cash out of their bank accounts and instead deposit it into a Bitcoin ATM for added "protection."

The FTC notes that the scammers will give victims a QR code. Once scanned at the machine, their cash is deposited straight into the scammers' crypto account. The agency also cautions against clicking on suspicious links, responding to unexpected calls or messages, or swiftly moving funds if rushed.

"Don't believe anyone who says you need to use a Bitcoin ATM, buy gift cards, or move money to protect it or fix a problem. Real businesses and government agencies will never do that – and anyone who asks is a scammer," the FTC writes.

According to AARP, there are more than 49,000 crypto ATMs in the U.S., with over 100 Bitcoin ATMs in Ohio, including several kiosks located in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, and Akron.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hovers around $87,000 on Wednesday after recovering 4% in the last three days. Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) find support around their key level, suggesting a recovery on the cards. Traders should keep an eye on Trump's upcoming “Liberation Day” on April 2, with significant tariff announcements, which could trigger increased volatility in the cryptocurrency market due to the potential impact of reciprocal tariffs.

Bitcoin price broke above its 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at around $85,556 on Sunday and rose 4.45% until Monday. However, it hovered around the $87,000 level on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, BTC still hovers around $87,000.

If BTC finds support around its 200-day EMA, it could extend the recovery to retest the key psychological level of $90,000. A successful close above this level could extend an additional rally toward its March 2 high of $95,000.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart reads 51, above its neutral level of 50, indicating increasing bullish momentum. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.





BTC/USDT daily chart

However, if BTC fails to find support around its 200-day EMA and closes below $85,000, it could extend the decline to retest its next support level at $78,258.

Ethereum price retested and found support around its daily level of $1,861 for the last two weeks, and it recovered nearly 7% last week. ETH continued its recovery on Monday and closed above $2,081. However, it faced a mild decline on Tuesday. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $2,056.

If the daily support around $1,861 holds, the ETH price could extend the recovery to retest its March 7 high of $2,258.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 39, facing rejection from its neutral level of 50 on Monday, indicating bearish momentum. However, the RSI must move above its neutral level of 50 for the recovery rally to be sustained. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead. Additionally, it shows rising green histogram levels above its neutral level of zero, indicating strength in upward momentum.



ETH/USDT daily chart

Conversely, if ETH breaks and closes below the daily support at $1,861, it could extend the decline to retest the next support level at $1,700.

Ripple price broke above its 100-day EMA at $2.32 last week and recovered almost 7%. However, XRP consolidated around its $2.44 level in the last two days. At the time of writing on Wednesday, it hovers around $2.44.

If the 100-day EMA around $2.32 continues to hold, it could extend the recovery to retest its next resistance level at $2.72.

The RSI on the daily chart reads 52, hovering around the neutral level of 50, indicating indecisiveness among the traders. The RSI must point upward and move above its neutral level of 50 to sustain the bullish momentum. The MACD indicator showed a bullish crossover on the daily chart last week, giving a buy signal and suggesting a bullish trend ahead.



XRP/USDT daily chart

On the other hand, if XRP fails to find support around its 100-day EMA and closes below, it could extend an additional decline to test its next support level at $1.96.

Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, a virtual currency designed to serve as money. This form of payment cannot be controlled by any one person, group, or entity, which eliminates the need for third-party participation during financial transactions.

Altcoins are any cryptocurrency apart from Bitcoin, but some also regard Ethereum as a non-altcoin because it is from these two cryptocurrencies that forking happens. If this is true, then Litecoin is the first altcoin, forked from the Bitcoin protocol and, therefore, an “improved” version of it.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to have a stable price, with their value backed by a reserve of the asset it represents. To achieve this, the value of any one stablecoin is pegged to a commodity or financial instrument, such as the US Dollar (USD), with its supply regulated by an algorithm or demand. The main goal of stablecoins is to provide an on/off-ramp for investors willing to trade and invest in cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins also allow investors to store value since cryptocurrencies, in general, are subject to volatility.

Bitcoin dominance is the ratio of Bitcoin's market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined. It provides a clear picture of Bitcoin's interest among investors. A high BTC dominance typically happens before and during a bull run, in which investors resort to investing in relatively stable and high market capitalization cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. A drop in BTC dominance usually means that investors are moving their capital and/or profits to altcoins in a quest for higher returns, which usually triggers an explosion of altcoin rallies.

Scientists may have just found a canal the Romans built 2,100 years ago while battling the Celts.

Scientists in France may be hot on the trail of a long-lost canal that the Romans built over two millennia ago while battling the Celts.

The waterway, known as the Marius Canal, was built around 2,100 years ago within the Rhône River delta. It was the first major Roman water hydraulic feature in what was then Gaul, preceding dams, watermills and aqueducts. According to historical accounts, it was built between 104 and 102 B.C. by the troops of Julius Caesar's uncle, the general Gaius Marius. Its construction was meant to aid efforts in the Cimbrian Wars, a series of conflicts between the Roman Republic and Celtic tribes, the Cimbri and Teutones, that were migrating south from Jutland, present-day Denmark.

At that time, the Roman Republic was protecting its new province in Gaul, a region that covered what is now France, Belgium and parts of western Germany. But the encroachment of the Celts put that land, as well as the rest of the Roman Republic, at risk.

"The Roman general Marius came to southern Gaul in 104 B.C. to head off the risk that the Cimbri and Teutones ravaging Gaul and Spain would reach Italy," Simon Loseby, an honorary lecturer in medieval history and an expert on southern Gaul at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. who was not involved in the study, told Live Science. "He headed a very large force, and urgently needed to supply it by sea from Rome."

So, Marius ordered the canal be built so it could supply his troops. It bypassed the treacherous Rhône River mouths and connected the city of Arles to the Mediterranean, enabling the safe passage of large supply boats. Ultimately, the canal was a success, and the Romans defeated the Cimbri and Teutones in 101 B.C. The canal was subsequently gifted to Rome's ally in the region, the Greek settlement of Massalia, now Marseille, which is said to have gained significant revenue from its commercial use before the canal vanished from the historical record a few centuries later.

"Despite all the research carried out in recent centuries, the Marius Canal hasn't been found," study lead author Joé Juncker, a geoarchaeologist at the University of Strasbourg in France, told Live Science in an email. It was last mentioned by the Roman author Pliny the Elder in the first century A.D., but its traces have all but disappeared.

In 2013, a geophysical survey of a delta in the Vigueirat marshes just south of Arles revealed an underwater feature that scientists hypothesized could be an ancient canal. Subsequent excavations around the site unearthed 69 pieces of Roman ceramics, two ancient wooden stakes and two extensive cobblestone platforms. Radiocarbon dating of the stakes placed them within the first to fourth century A.D., while organic materials within the platforms dated between the first century B.C. and third century A.D. when the Marius Canal would have been used.

Since the site's discovery 12 years ago, researchers have been trying to gather evidence to confirm whether this area really hosts the long-lost Marius Canal.

In the new study, Juncker and his team drilled sediment cores from the ancient canal and its banks and took physical measurements to compare with the geophysical surveys conducted in 2013.

"The canal length, width, orientation, sediment content and the measured radiocarbon dates confirm that it was a navigable canal in Roman times, partially excavated in a former branch of the Rhône and an ancient lagoon," Juncker said.

Natural tributaries in river channels are usually around 360 to 590 feet (110 to 180 meters) wide, while the new analysis shows the putative Marius Canal is much narrower at around 98 feet (30 m) wide. This aligns with other Roman canals. This width would have enabled large Roman ships to navigate the area, the authors reported in the study, published in the April issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.

The new research strengthens the case that there was a canal here, Loseby said. "It's yet another indication of the Roman capacity to conceive of and undertake large infrastructural projects at speed, despite relative technological limitations."

Both Loseby and Juncker hope future archaeological discoveries will further establish whether the canal is the Marius Canal. Specifically, they hope excavations could lead to the discovery of quays (landing platforms for ships) or towpaths (waterways where draft animals would tow boats), which could help confirm the use of the canal and the duration of its use.

"Geoarchaeology is a science full of potential, but we must bear in mind that, without confirmation from archaeological studies, it is not possible to attribute this canal to Marius for the moment," said Juncker. Research there is ongoing.

Scientists in France may be hot on the trail of a long-lost canal that the Romans built over two millennia ago while battling the Celts.

The waterway, known as the Marius Canal, was built around 2,100 years ago within the Rhône River delta. It was the first major Roman water hydraulic feature in what was then Gaul, preceding dams, watermills and aqueducts. According to historical accounts, it was built between 104 and 102 B.C. by the troops of Julius Caesar's uncle, the general Gaius Marius. Its construction was meant to aid efforts in the Cimbrian Wars, a series of conflicts between the Roman Republic and Celtic tribes, the Cimbri and Teutones, that were migrating south from Jutland, present-day Denmark.

At that time, the Roman Republic was protecting its new province in Gaul, a region that covered what is now France, Belgium and parts of western Germany. But the encroachment of the Celts put that land, as well as the rest of the Roman Republic, at risk.

"The Roman general Marius came to southern Gaul in 104 B.C. to head off the risk that the Cimbri and Teutones ravaging Gaul and Spain would reach Italy," Simon Loseby, an honorary lecturer in medieval history and an expert on southern Gaul at the University of Sheffield in the U.K. who was not involved in the study, told Live Science. "He headed a very large force, and urgently needed to supply it by sea from Rome."

So, Marius ordered the canal be built so it could supply his troops. It bypassed the treacherous Rhône River mouths and connected the city of Arles to the Mediterranean, enabling the safe passage of large supply boats. Ultimately, the canal was a success, and the Romans defeated the Cimbri and Teutones in 101 B.C. The canal was subsequently gifted to Rome's ally in the region, the Greek settlement of Massalia, now Marseille, which is said to have gained significant revenue from its commercial use before the canal vanished from the historical record a few centuries later.

"Despite all the research carried out in recent centuries, the Marius Canal hasn't been found," study lead author Joé Juncker, a geoarchaeologist at the University of Strasbourg in France, told Live Science in an email. It was last mentioned by the Roman author Pliny the Elder in the first century A.D., but its traces have all but disappeared.

In 2013, a geophysical survey of a delta in the Vigueirat marshes just south of Arles revealed an underwater feature that scientists hypothesized could be an ancient canal. Subsequent excavations around the site unearthed 69 pieces of Roman ceramics, two ancient wooden stakes and two extensive cobblestone platforms. Radiocarbon dating of the stakes placed them within the first to fourth century A.D., while organic materials within the platforms dated between the first century B.C. and third century A.D. when the Marius Canal would have been used.

Since the site's discovery 12 years ago, researchers have been trying to gather evidence to confirm whether this area really hosts the long-lost Marius Canal.

In the new study, Juncker and his team drilled sediment cores from the ancient canal and its banks and took physical measurements to compare with the geophysical surveys conducted in 2013.

"The canal length, width, orientation, sediment content and the measured radiocarbon dates confirm that it was a navigable canal in Roman times, partially excavated in a former branch of the Rhône and an ancient lagoon," Juncker said.

Natural tributaries in river channels are usually around 360 to 590 feet (110 to 180 meters) wide, while the new analysis shows the putative Marius Canal is much narrower at around 98 feet (30 m) wide. This aligns with other Roman canals. This width would have enabled large Roman ships to navigate the area, the authors reported in the study, published in the April issue of the Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports.

The new research strengthens the case that there was a canal here, Loseby said. "It's yet another indication of the Roman capacity to conceive of and undertake large infrastructural projects at speed, despite relative technological limitations."

Both Loseby and Juncker hope future archaeological discoveries will further establish whether the canal is the Marius Canal. Specifically, they hope excavations could lead to the discovery of quays (landing platforms for ships) or towpaths (waterways where draft animals would tow boats), which could help confirm the use of the canal and the duration of its use.

"Geoarchaeology is a science full of potential, but we must bear in mind that, without confirmation from archaeological studies, it is not possible to attribute this canal to Marius for the moment," said Juncker. Research there is ongoing.

The latest time crystal innovation may expand the known boundaries of quantum mechanics.

Physicists have created a new type of time crystal that may help confirm some fundamental theories about quantum interactions.

A standard time crystal is a new phase of matter that features perpetual motion without expending energy. According to Chong Zu, an assistant professor of physics at Washington University in St. Louis and one of the team's lead researchers, a time crystal resembles a traditional crystal.

However, unlike a traditional crystal, which repeats a pattern across the physical dimension of space, a time crystal repeats a pattern of motion, rearranging its atoms in the same way over time, Zu said. This causes the time crystal to vibrate at a set frequency.

A time crystal is theoretically capable of cycling through the same pattern infinitely without requiring any additional power — like a watch that never needs to be wound. The reality, however, is that time crystals are incredibly fragile and thus succumb to environmental pressures fairly easily.

Although time crystals have been around since 2016, a team has achieved something unprecedented: They've created a novel type of time crystal called a time quasicrystal. A quasicrystal is a solid that, like a regular crystal, has atoms arranged in a specific, nonrandom way, but without a repeating pattern.

This means that, unlike a standard time crystal that repeats the same pattern over and over, a time quasicrystal never repeats the way it arranges its atoms. Because there's no repetition, the crystal vibrates at different frequencies. As the researchers state in their findings, published in the journal Physical Review X, time quasicrystals "are ordered but apparently not periodic."

To create these new time quasicrystals, the researchers started with a millimeter-sized piece of diamond. Then, they created spaces inside the diamond's structure by bombarding it with powerful beams of nitrogen. The nitrogen displaced carbon atoms within the diamond's interior, leaving behind empty atomic chambers.

Nature abhors a vacuum, so electrons quickly flowed into these empty spaces and immediately began to interact with neighboring particles on a quantum level. Each time quasicrystal represents a network of more than a million of these empty spaces inside the diamond, though each measures just one micrometer (one-millionth of a meter).

"We used microwave pulses to start the rhythms in the time quasicrystals," Bingtian Ye, a researcher at MIT and a co-author of the paper, said in a statement. "The microwaves help create order in time."

One of the most important outcomes of the team's research is that it confirms some basic theories of quantum mechanics, according to Zu. However, time quasicrystals may have practical applications in fields such as precision timekeeping, quantum computing, and quantum sensor technology.

For sensors, the crystal's fragility and sensitivity are actually a boon; because they're so sensitive to environmental factors like magnetism, they can be used to create extremely precise sensors.

For quantum computing, the material's potential perpetual motion quality is the key.

"They could store quantum memory over long periods of time, essentially like a quantum analog of RAM," Zu said. "We're a long way from that sort of technology, but creating a time quasicrystal is a crucial first step."

	The marker is an unexpected bubble that could signal cosmic reionization earlier than thought

The extremely distant galaxy JADES-GS-z13-1 is the small red dot in the center of this image from the James Webb Space Telescope. New observations show the galaxy is emitting a surprising amount of ultraviolet light, indicating it is radically reshaping the cosmic landscape around it.

1 hour ago

The James Webb Space Telescope has caught a distant galaxy blowing an unexpected bubble in the gas around it, just 330 million years after the Big Bang.

The galaxy, dubbed JADES-GS-z13-1, marks the earliest sign yet spotted of the era of cosmic reionization, a transformative period in the universe's history when the first stars and galaxies began to reshape their environment, astronomers report in the March 27 Nature.

“It definitely puts a pin in the map of the first point where [reionization] very likely has already started,” says astrophysicist Joris Witstok at the University of Copenhagen. “No one had predicted that it would be this early” in the universe's history.

For millions of years before JADES-GS-z13-1 and others like it began to shine, the universe was filled with cold, neutral gas, mostly hydrogen and helium. This gas absorbed short-wavelength light from any stars that shone before about 200 million years after the Big Bang. But as more and more stars began to burn and gather into galaxies, they produced enough ultraviolet light to knock electrons off the neutral gas atoms, ionizing them and making the gas transparent to short-wavelength light.

One clear signal of this ionization comes in a particular UV wavelength of light called Lyman-α, which is produced by excited hydrogen atoms returning to their lowest energy states. Seeing Lyman-α photons emanating from a galaxy means the galaxy must have blown a bubble of ionized gas around it big enough to let the particles of light reach our telescopes today.

“You can think of galaxies as little Lyman-α flashlights,” says astrophysicist Steven Finkelstein of the University of Texas at Austin, who was not involved in the new study. “If you can see the Lyman-α, it means they're sitting in an ionized part of the universe.” If you can't see Lyman-α, the galaxies are shrouded in neutral hydrogen fog.

Previous observations showed that the universe was completely ionized about one billion years after the Big Bang. But it's hard to tell when the process began, or what exactly produced the light.

Witstok and colleagues used JWST to observe JADES-GS-z13-1, one of the clearest of these early galaxies, for almost 19 hours, splitting its light into a spectrum of wavelengths to seek details of the galaxy's makeup.

JWST was designed to seek out these brilliant, ancient galaxies. As the universe expands, the ultraviolet light that these galaxies originally emitted gets stretched to longer, infrared wavelengths. Since starting operations in 2022, JWST's sensitive infrared detectors have turned up a growing gaggle of galaxies whose light comes from as early as less than 300 million years after the Big Bang.

To their surprise, the researchers found a clear, bright signal of Lyman-α photons coming from JADES-GS-z13-1. If you were standing next to the galaxy, this light alone would shine as bright as 10 billion suns.

“We suddenly saw this huge, booming emission line” that makes all the other distant galaxies JWST has found “look a bit boring,” Witstock says. “Just the pure strength of it tells us whatever this source is has to be really, really powerful and unlike anything we've seen before.”

The finding is “both surprising and exciting,” says cosmologist Michele Trenti of the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the study and wrote a perspective article that accompanied the paper in Nature. “I would not have expected the ultraviolet light that is emitted from this galaxy as Lyman-α to be able to reach the JWST,” she says. “This suggests that early forming galaxies are more efficient than previously thought at reheating the universe.”

It's still not clear exactly what the light's source is. The light could come from matter that was heated as it fell onto a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center. The galaxy's compact size supports this idea — it looks like it's only about 230 light-years across, compared with 32,000 light-years for the Milky Way.

The light could also have come from extremely hot, massive stars, about 100 to 300 times the mass of the sun and more than 15 times hotter. More observations are required to figure out which it is, but either one has implications for the conditions in the early universe.

“Both possibilities are stimulating for innovation,” Trenti says. “I expect theorists will be on the drawing board, developing new models for galaxy and black hole evolution during the dawn of the universe, while observers will certainly try to discover additional similar galaxies to solve the puzzle.”

Auroras are possible over the U.S. tonight (March 25) as a "moderate" geomagnetic storm hits Earth.

UPDATE: The Northern Lights could be visible in the U.S. tonight (March 26), appearing as far south as New York and Idaho due to a "coronal hole" sending streams of charged particles toward Earth.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) initally issued a G2 geomagnetic storm warning for Tuesday, March 25, which has now been extended into Wednesday (March 26).

Like hurricanes, geomagnetic storms follow a 5-point severity scale. G2 storms are considered "moderate" in strength and could cause minor technological disruptions such as radio blackouts, GPS malfunctions, and an increased chance of spotting auroras at lower latitudes than usual.

"Watches of this level are not uncommon," according to NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center; G2-strength geomagnetic storms hit Earth about 360 days in each 11-year solar cycle. These storms can affect spacecraft orbits and cause weak power grid fluctuations at high latitudes, but they mostly cause "manageable effects to some technological infrastructure," according to NOAA.

The Space Weather Prediction Center issued the extended storm warning because a "coronal hole" on the sun is facing Earth. Coronal holes are cooler, darker regions of the sun's outermost atmosphere (the corona) that are less dense than normal, allowing high-speed solar winds — streams of charged particles — to escape from the sun and gush outward into space. Currently, one of these escaped high-speed streams is pointed directly at Earth.

Earth's magnetic field deflects most of the solar wind, but some charged particles make it through into the upper layers of the atmosphere. When the solar wind hits Earth's atmosphere, charged particles shoot toward Earth's poles, agitating atmospheric molecules along the way and forcing them to emit energy in the form of colorful auroras.

In October 2024, the sun reached its solar maximum period, the most active part of its 11-year cycle. During this period, the sun's magnetic poles flip, and space weather events like geomagnetic storms and solar flares occur more frequently. Scientists predict that the solar maximum will continue for at least a few more months if not longer, providing additional opportunities to spot the Northern Lights.

On Wednesday night, "the aurora may become visible over some northern and upper Midwest states from New York to Idaho," according to a statement from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.

The best chances of spotting an aurora are on dark, clear nights between 10pm and 2am, far from artificial lights. You can see auroras with the naked eye, but their colors might look even more vivid through a smartphone screen.

After suspecting the presence of a series of underwater volcanoes near the Cook Islands, researchers have now mapped out the newly discovered structures.

A series of relatively young underwater volcanoes has been discovered under the waves of the Pacific Ocean, some of which may even be active.

The volcanoes were found during an expedition to map the seafloor near the Cook Islands in the Central Pacific, about 2,900 miles (4,700 kilometers) south of Hawaii. If these structures are volcanically active, the heat that they generate may have spawned a unique and exciting marine habitat nearby, the researchers said.

"So far, we have not seen any clear signs of volcanic activity, but then again, no one has yet had the chance to look carefully at the seabed and sample it," representatives from the Seabed Minerals Authority (SBMA), which co-led the research, said in a statement. "Once fully processed and interpreted, our new seabed map should help any future scientists quickly go directly to the best points for this sampling."

The Cook Islands are a group of 15 islands in the South Pacific Ocean, located between French Polynesia and American Samoa. This archipelago was created millions of years ago as the Pacific plate moved over a magma hotspot in the Earth's mantle — similar to the way the Hawaiian Islands were formed. A magma hotspot is a localized area in Earth's mantle where unusually hot rock rises toward the surface, causing volcanic activity. Unlike volcanoes at tectonic plate boundaries, hotspots occur in the middle of tectonic plates and remain stationary, while the plate above moves over time.



A hot mantle plume from the hotspot brings heat and magma toward Earth's crust, which can cause magma from the mantle to erupt onto the seafloor and then cool rapidly in the water. Over time, repeated eruptions build up a volcanic structure, forming an underwater volcano. If the eruptions continue, the volcano grows large enough to break the ocean surface, forming a volcanic island.

Most of the volcanoes in the Cook Islands are ancient, with their rocks dating back tens or even hundreds of millions of years. However, the islands of Rarotonga and Aitutaki are made of a combination of older and younger rocks, because they are among the most recent islands to form over the hotspot — the youngest rock on Rarotonga dates back only around 1.2 million years.

These newly mapped underwater volcanoes were first theorized in 2024 after researchers discovered that the rocks of one submerged volcano were only 670,000 years old. The rocks were discovered roughly 37 miles (60 km) southeast of Rarotonga, on a volcano called Tama, and they mark the youngest volcanic rocks discovered in the Cook Islands to date.

The team also theorized that, going southeast from Rarotonga through Tama, there may be several other underwater volcanoes lurking on the seafloor, which may also be much younger than the other Cook Islands.

To investigate these structures further, the ARTEX 2025 expedition was launched to map the ocean floor in the area surrounding Rarotonga. The team discovered that there was indeed a series of smaller structures dotted along the seafloor to the southeast of Rarotonga, including a 0.6-mile-high (1 km) volcano named "Pepe". The team's data is yet to be fully processed, however, and the structures have not yet been confirmed as volcanically active.

The researchers hope to return to the area to learn more about the seamounts, or underwater volcanoes, and to collect samples of the rocks to figure out exactly how old they are.

No DSLR comes close to the Nikon D850, a camera that many photographers still choose over mirrorless. And with a huge $1,000 saving, now's the time to take the leap. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Fancy saving a massive $1,000 on what we think is the best DSLR money can buy? The Nikon D850 has been reduced from $2996.95 to $1,996.95, which is an unmissable discount if you're in the market for a leading DSLR. It's the first time we've seen the D850 come in at under $2,000, even beating out the Black Friday price (which was $2,200).

Editor's note: Walmart has a cheaper price at $1,859, although it's sold through a third party and strictly speaking, is not a deal as there is no previous RRP. But it's still live and better than Amazon.

Our resident camera expert James Artaius calls the D850 the best DSLR ever made, and as a result it's featured in our best camera for wildlife photography guide and we've chosen it as the best DSLR in our best astrophotography cameras guide. This is an all-singing, all-dancing camera packed with incredible features, and no matter what type of photography you're into, this camera won't disappoint.

Our sister site Space calls the Nikon D850 the best DSLR in their best camera buyers guide.

Save $1,000 on the Nikon D850, which we think is the best DLSR camera on the market. This superb and versatile camera delivers pro-level results with ease. You'll need to provide your own lens as this deal is for the body only, but with a massive 33% discount off the Amazon RRP, you'll have some cash left over to buy an equally nice Nikon camera lens .

Price check: Walmart $1,859 | Best Buy $1,999.95

There's a long, long list of accolades to throw at the Nikon D850, but perhaps one of the most important is its high resolution compared to other DSLRs on the market. It's capable of capturing gorgeous imagery with a stunning level of detail, largely thanks to its back-illuminated sensor which works incredibly well in low-light conditions. Incidentally, that makes the D850 a great choice for astrophotography.

The Nikon D850 has a fantastic ISO ranging from 320 to 102400, and its 9fps continuous shooting range means it's capable of capturing fast-moving subjects — great if you like to photograph wildlife. We also think the autofocus detection is second-to-none on this camera: it goes as low as -4EV, which also helps when capturing the perfect wildlife action shot.

This DLSR camera deal is US-only. If you're not in the US, you'll find Nikon D850 deals for your region at the bottom of this post.

Key features: 45.7MP full-frame CMOS sensor, 9fps burst rate, 8K UHD video, ISO range from 32-25,600 (extendable to 32-102,400) and superb auto-focus.

Product launched: September 2017.

Price history: This is the cheapest we've seen, and beats last year's Black Friday/Cyber Monday price of $2,196.95.

Price comparison: The Nikon D850 is even cheaper at Walmart and a third-party seller at Walmart for $1,859 and at Best Buy for $1,999.95.

Reviews consensus: The D850 features in our best camera for wildlife photography buyers guide and buyers guide for astrophotography. It gets top marks across our sister sites thanks to its versatile performance. It's an incredibly powerful tool for almost every kind of photography and video. At this current price, the D850 is terrific value for such a highly-rated camera.

	“We have still not figured out policies that are protective for people”

Millions of people have used DNA testing kits from 23andMe to trace family ties and to learn more about health conditions they may be susceptible to. The company filed for bankruptcy leaving customers wondering what to do about genetic data.

A genetic data giant is falling, and it's unclear what will happen to millions of people's most intimate personal information in the aftermath.

On March 23, DNA testing company 23andMe announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, a move intended to facilitate its sale — along with the genetic data of over 15 million customers worldwide. A bankruptcy court hearing is set to begin March 26.

The San Francisco–based company has been reeling since a 2023 data breach exposed ancestry information — and, in some cases, health data — of about 7 million users. Bankruptcy documents made public by 404 Media show that more than 50 class-action lawsuits followed.

The situation reignites long-standing concerns about genetic privacy. The 2018 arrest of the Golden State Killer, identified through a public ancestry database, first raised alarms about the safety of genetic data. With a patchwork of state-level legislation and no clear federal oversight beyond a rule prohibiting genetic discrimination by employers and health insurance companies — but not life insurance or other entities — genetic testing companies have been free to create their own rules, says sociologist of science Alondra Nelson of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.

“We have gotten 20 years into this industry, and we are about to have a major exchange of 15 million sets of people's data, and we have still not figured out policies that are protective for people,” Nelson says.

23andMe has assured customers that bankruptcy “does not change how we store, manage, or protect customer data.” Any future buyer, the company says, will adhere to those data standards. But California Attorney General Rob Bonta has urged Californians to instruct 23andMe to delete their data and destroy any biological samples stored at the company. Other attorney generals across the country are echoing that call and making residents aware of their rights.

The stakes go beyond privacy. Genetic researchers have used 23andMe data in studies of human ancestry and disease causation. If customers scrub their data, this cache of genetic information could be lost. Moreover, the company collects approximately 2 million survey responses a week about lifestyle, health and traits, legal health privacy scholar Anya Prince of the University of Iowa and bioethicist Kayte Spector-Bagdady of the University of Michigan wrote in the Feb. 25 JAMA. These data, they note, could drive a range of applications from pharmaceutical research to targeted marketing campaigns.

To unpack what's at stake, Science News spoke with Nelson, a former acting director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Prince, who studies the ethical, legal and social implications of genetic testing. The conversations have been edited for length and clarity.

SN: Why is 23andMe declaring bankruptcy such a big deal?

Prince: It's such a big deal because, if you think about why 23andMe was valued as high as $6 billion, it's because of the promise of the monetary value of the data that they hold. If John Deere went into bankruptcy, it would be selling the tractor parts, selling the factories. That is easier than having the asset be millions of people's data, and not just millions of people's data, but millions of people's very sensitive genetic and health data.

Nelson: By 23andMe's own accounting, 15 million customers counted on them to stay in business and to be able to keep their data safe. Part of the service that 23andMe provided was saying that they could tell people things about themselves and their families, intimate details to which they might not otherwise have access. You expect a company or relationship that's going to claim to tell you such things about yourself to stick around.

We didn't exactly know what to do when the data breach occurred, and it's not quite clear what's going to happen with the data vis-à-vis the bankruptcy. We've had a legislative and policy failure around what to do about direct-to-consumer genetic testing. What we know about genetic testing is that it can be used for forensic applications, it can be used for health care applications. The laws that we have around privacy and protection of health care data like HIPAA or the regulations and norms that we have around forensic data don't apply to consumer genetic testing.

There were a lot of companies that started doing similar tests that went out of business or got acquired by other companies. So there has been a pattern in the industry in which we don't know exactly what was happening with these data as the companies get acquired or as they're traded.

SN: Should people delete their data from 23andMe, or should they keep it so researchers can use it?

Prince: I, for example, am a very, very private person, and so if my data was in a company like 23andMe, I would want to delete it because I'm less comfortable with sharing my data and I'm more controlled about it. I know plenty of other people who are just as rational actors who say, “No, I would love my data to be used for research.”

It makes sense for some people to say, “I understand the risks. I understand that I can't control who buys my data and how it's used because of gaps in our federal privacy laws.” If somebody is OK with that, then maybe they don't need to delete it.

But if people say, “No, I'm worried about accessing insurance. I'm worried about just having my data out there. I'm worried how law enforcement could gain access to it,” — whatever it is that people could be tangibly concerned about — or just wanting their data to be private and know who it's being shared with, then I think deleting the data is a good step. There are other ways to provide data to help research that might align more with people's goals or comfort level.

Nelson: We have to open up a broad aperture of things that we can do — and we need to do it quickly — to help people secure their data. If they want to use it for research, great.

The bigger problem is how do you know that your data has been deleted? Is it deleted from everything? Are there collaborations ongoing with other partners, where the data might get circulated into laboratories, research labs and other places? So, sure, ask for the data to be deleted, but I think we also want to have a forensic accounting of the data.

This is not just somebody's Facebook profile. If you want to delete it, you want to be sure that it's deleted. How can we create a protocol or a norm, or really call upon 23andMe to act nobly and provide assurances to people that the data is actually deleted out of every database, every hard drive, every collaborator's research computer?

SN: What worries you most about 23andMe being sold to another entity?

Prince: This whole thing just highlights how little people know about how their data can be shared.

[For instance, 23andMe's] privacy policy says in the event of bankruptcy, the genetic data can be sold. It says that the new company would have to comply with the existing privacy policy. But the existing privacy policy also says that it can be changed at any time.

It just really leaves consumers with little recourse. The one power that we do have is deleting the data. The challenge of that is that it is a rich resource for research, so that's a shame.

Nelson: I worry about the 15 million customers, many of whom, if they're not following the news, may not know that this is happening. They might not have known about the breach in 2023.

I worry in particular about marginalized and vulnerable communities that have histories of repression and oppression [based on] ideas about genetics, and what that means for communities of African descent and communities of Jewish descent.

In 2019, the Department of Defense wrote to all of its employees, particularly those that worked in sensitive areas, and said, “You know what? We're going to suggest that you not get for Christmas or for Hanukkah these direct-to-consumer genetic tests, because we are worried about the ability of this information to leak, and we're worried about the ability of this information to be used by malign foreign actors.” It's dangerous to have people's personal data circulating in the world.

One would not be foolish to be skeptical of 23andMe offering assurances that they're going to abide by whatever rules they have. The company is under distress and is seeking to be sold. What are the trade-offs that are going to be made in the negotiation for this sale? Will data privacy of 15 million people be one of those trade-offs?

Anecdotal reports suggest drugs like Ozempic may curb not just appetite but also impulsive or addictive behaviour, hinting at links between metabolic health and our brains

By David Robson


                                    26 March 2025

“I just cannot believe how I don't crave alcohol anymore!” writes one person. Others declare: “Took my first shot… have not had a drink or cigarette since,” and “I love coffee but I've noticed that I cannot finish a cup anymore.”

These quotes were all collected in a recent study led by Davide Arillotta at the University of Florence, Italy, from Reddit's weight-loss forums. Here, you will find many people rhapsodising about the benefits of drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. That these treatments are helping people curb their eating should be no surprise: that is exactly what they are meant to do, by mimicking the satiety hormone GLP-1 (see “How they work”, below).

Among the comments, however, you will frequently find reports of other – wholly unexpected – behavioural changes. According to these accounts, when taking these drugs, the urge to drink alcohol, smoke and even shop compulsively plummets (but not libido, though anecdotal reports on this subject elsewhere online are mixed). Such tales are becoming familiar to prescribing physicians.

If this anecdotal data can be supported by controlled clinical trials, it may tell us a lot about how the brain processes anticipation and reward – and could also suggest whole new ways of dealing with addiction. By targeting areas of the brain responsible for reward signals from food, GLP-1 drugs might also reduce the rewards people get from other things, such as addictive substances. But what does the current evidence show about these complex behavioural processes?

First, we need to understand how drugs…

GLP-1 drugs have revolutionised the treatment of obesity, but the very reason they are effective is also why it's vital to prioritise exercise when taking them

By Grace Wade


                                    26 March 2025

For decades, conventional wisdom held that, to lose weight, you must eat less and move more. Of course, that is easier said than done, which is why drugs like Wegovy are so revolutionary. By suppressing appetite, they help tackle the first part of that equation, typically leading to dramatic weight loss. But what about the second? Do we still need to hit the gym if weight-loss drugs are causing the number on the scales to drop? And what impact do these drugs have on our ability to exercise?

What is becoming clear is that exercise may be even more crucial for people who are on these medications than it is for those who aren't. The ability of semaglutide to induce rapid weight loss (see “How they work”, below) also leads to notable declines in muscle mass. For instance, a 2021 study of 95 people who were overweight or had obesity and were taking semaglutide found that lean body mass decreased by almost 10 per cent, on average, after 68 weeks.

Lean body mass encompasses body tissues like muscle and bone. So, these results suggest that both deteriorate when taking weight-loss drugs, says Signe Sørensen Torekov at the University of Copenhagen. Because these drugs lead people to consume fewer calories, the body must break down fat, muscle and even bone for nutrients.

“Our understanding is that up to about 40 per cent of the overall weight loss that is seen from semaglutide is thought to be potentially from the loss of muscle mass,” says …

Drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy have the power to block the forces driving obesity, but the knock-on societal effects may not necessarily be so positive

By Alexandra Thompson


                                    26 March 2025

Oprah Winfrey's TV special Shame, Blame and the Weight Loss Revolution has been streamed more than 4 million times since it aired in March 2024. In it, the talk show host described Ozempic as being “the relief and support and freedom” that some people have been waiting for their whole lives.

This might have been easy for a billionaire like Winfrey to say. Weight-loss drugs can be game-changing for people who are obese, but getting hold of them is far from a level playing field, with knock-on effects for the obesity levels of the rich versus the poor. But this inequality is just one of many societal issues on the horizon. Ultra-slim beauty norms may be re-emerging, and some analysts predict changes to our collective appetite for junk food. In the era of Wegovy, we could also see an increase in the stigma around obesity that exists in some countries.

In the UK, only those with a body mass index of more than 35 (within the obesity range) and at least one weight-related health complication are generally eligible to receive Wegovy or Mounjaro on the National Health Service (see “How they work”, below). In the US, the use of these drugs for weight loss often isn't covered by insurers, which means many people are paying out of pocket. With costs of roughly $1000 a month in the US and between £150 and £200 a month in the UK, “better-off people will have access and poor people won't,” says Margaret Steele at…

	When handled, a small crustacean-munching shark from New Zealand clacked its teeth together

This small shark, called a rig or smoothhound, could be the first shark documented to make deliberate sounds.

Sharks may not be the sharp-toothed silent type after all.

The clicking of flattened teeth, discovered by accident, could be “the first documented case of deliberate sound production in sharks,” evolutionary biologist Carolin Nieder, of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, and colleagues propose March 26 in Royal Society Open Science.

Humankind has been slow in picking up on sound communication among fishes, and many of their squeaks and rumbles have come to the attention of science in captive animals. For the many bony fishes, it's no longer a surprise to detect various chirps, hums or growls. Yet the evolutionary sister-branch, sharks and rays, built with cartilage, have been slower to get recognized for sounding off. They have remarkable senses, such as detecting slight electric fields. In 1971, however, clicking was reported among cownose rays, and has since turned up in other rays.

Nieder, who had studied dolphin hearing, was at the University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Lab in New Zealand, dangling an underwater microphone into a tank as part of her setup to explore hearing in a small shark species called a rig (Mustelus leucticulates). Reaching into the tank to grasp one, she heard “click…click….” After a week or so of tests, the rig still squirmed but didn't click. Perhaps the sound was voluntary, a response to stress, she mused.

She worked with 10 sharks and recorded multiple clickity bouts, averaging about nine clicks during a 20-second grasp. The sounds may come from clacking together the flattened teeth with cusps, great for cracking crustaceans shells. Rows of these teeth emerge from gum tissue, reminding her of stones set in a mosaic.

In a first, researchers have recorded what could be a shark making deliberate sounds. A small shark from New Zealand, called a rig or spotted estuary smoothhound, grows rows of flattened teeth (image below) that can crack crustaceans for food and, perhaps, make communicative sounds. Evolutionary biologist Carolin Nieder discovered the sounds accidentally when she was handling a rig in a tank. Listen closely as the shark first splashes, then clicks its teeth.

Wiggling doesn't seem important: She heard the sounds when a test shark writhed in her grasp and when it held still. She suggests that sharks click by “forceful snapping.”

The idea still needs formal testing, she cautions. What she actually measured was the hearing range of the sharks, which is restricted to below 1,000 hertz. Human hearing, in comparison, ranges up to 20,000 Hz.

Sharks are sensitive to their watery world though and can detect the tickles of changing electric fields. Yet “if you were a shark, I would need to talk a lot louder to you than to a goldfish,” she says. “The goldfish would pick up if I whisper … and the shark was like, can you speak up please?”

New research suggests that dark energy, the unknown force driving the accelerated expansion of the universe, may not be behaving as previously believed. Observations from a large-scale 3D map indicate that this force could be evolving over time, contradicting long-standing models of cosmology. The data, derived from extensive observations of millions of galaxies, provides fresh insights into the fundamental workings of the universe. Scientists are now questioning whether the standard model, which assumes a constant dark energy force, remains valid in explaining the cosmos.

According to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), which operates from the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-Meter Telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory, findings suggest that dark energy may not be a fixed force. The analysis is based on data collected over three years, covering nearly 15 million galaxies and quasars. DESI's ability to simultaneously capture light from 5,000 galaxies allows researchers to examine large-scale cosmic structures and measure how the universe's expansion rate has changed over time.

As reported, inconsistencies arise when DESI's findings are compared with measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type Ia supernovae. The CMB consists of fossil light from the early universe, has been used to track the expansion history of the cosmos. Similar to thaf type Ia supernovae, often called "standard candles" for their uniform brightness, have provided key distance measurements. The DESI data suggests that dark energy's influence may have weakened over time, a deviation from the accepted cosmological model that assumes it remains unchanged.

Speaking in an official press release, DESI Project Scientist Arjun Dey stated that these findings could redefine humanity's understanding of the universe. The instrument's ongoing observations will continue to refine knowledge of dark energy's role. Scientists anticipate that by the project's conclusion, further data will offer a clearer picture of whether dark energy fluctuates, potentially reshaping existing theories of cosmic evolution.

Signal is at the centre of a fierce debate over its use by US government officials, bringing the encrypted messaging app's limitations into sharp focus.

In a shocking debacle, The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, became privy to highly sensitive discussions among top national security officials in the US after he was mistakenly added to a group chat on the Signal app comprising US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other top defence officials in the Trump administration

The group members reportedly discussed upcoming military strikes targeting locations of Houthi terrorists in conflict-ridden Yemen. The discussions continued for six days before Goldberg left the group on his own while other members still seemed to be unaware of his presence in the chat, according to the report by The Atlantic.

Beyond the security breach, the incident raised questions over whether it is safe to share classified information such as plans for a bombing mission on platforms like Signal.

Signal is a pioneer of encrypted communications and is regarded as one of the most secure messaging apps currently available on the market.

It is widely considered to be a leading easy-to-use, encrypted messaging service among cybersecurity experts, since there are no public reports of hackers intercepting users' messages in-transit by cracking the platform's end-to-end encryption protocol.

The app is also a favourite of privacy and digital rights activists as it collects minimal user data and offers robust privacy features such as the option to hide your phone number and display a username instead.

Unlike Telegram, end-to-end encryption is enabled by default for all messages and voice calls on Signal. In January 2025, Signal announced a new feature that would give users the choice to transfer their chat history and media from to other Android and iOS devices or start fresh.

Signal's end-to-end encryption technology is open-source, meaning that developers can take a look under the hood and verify its security. In addition, the encryption protocol forms the basis of the security offered by other messaging apps like WhatsApp.

Since 2023, Signal has been upgrading its encryption technology to remain secure against the future, hypothetical threat of quantum computers.

When a user sends a text message on Signal, the information is encrypted and only the recipient of the message can decrypt it with specific cryptographic keys stored locally on the devices of the sender and receiver. This ensures that not even the service provider has access to the encrypted data.

It is impossible for law enforcement authorities or hackers to intercept a Signal message in-transit. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended that American citizens use encrypted messaging apps like Signal to keep their messages private. The recommendation was made after Chinese hackers reportedly compromised US-based telecom networks to access conventional SMS text messages.

However, Signal is only as secure as the device security. Encrypted messages can be leaked if an attacker gains access to an unlocked device, installs spyware, or tricks a user into linking their account to a malicious device.

Similarly, a participant in your group chat can take screenshots of your conversation and share it elsewhere. They could also potentially hand over their device to another person who will be able to simply read your decrypted messages.

The bottom line is that Signal is not infallible against human error. Experts noted that the recent US national security leak happened because someone — whether intentionally or by mistake — added an outsider to the chat.
In its response to the ‘Signalgate' scandal, the non-profit entity behind the app said that the claim that there are ‘vulnerabilities' in Signal isn't accurate.

No, Signal does not offer ironclad protection from all forms of snooping. For instance, users on the platform could still fall for scams or phishing attacks.

Last month, Google's cybersecurity arm Mandiant released a report stating that Russian intelligence officials were trying to trick Ukrainian users on Signal into sharing their personal information and handing over access to their accounts on the platform.

However, the report did not mention whether any Signal accounts were actually compromised.

“In order to help protect people from falling victim to sophisticated phishing attacks, Signal introduced new user flows and in-app warnings. This work has been completed for some time and is unrelated to any current events,” the organisation said in a post on X.

“We also constantly monitor security@signal.org for any new reports, and we act on them with quickness while also working to protect the people who rely on us from outside threats like phishing with warnings and safeguards,” it added.

End-to-end encryption is also useless if a device has been infected with spyware like Pegasus, as threat actors can directly access the messages and files on the device without the user knowing.

While it is not possible to fully remove the risks associated with encrypted chat apps like Signal, here are a few ways you can minimise them:

– Use audio and video calls over Signal to avoid written records of what you discussed.
– Enable Relay for calls on Signals so that your IP address remains private while making phone calls to others
– Use your personal phone or laptop while communicating through Signal, as opposed to using work devices.
– Avoid connecting your personal device to work networks to prevent monitoring.
– Enable disappearing messages in Settings &gt; Privacy > Disappearing Messages to automatically delete chats after a set time.

News and sports programming, which are the biggest drivers for broadcast revenue and audiences, were also the central topic of the first panel at the TV Tech Summit, where executives at stations and networks discussed newer technologies that are helping them engage viewers and streamline operations.

When asked about the future of technologies for news and sports, panelists were particularly bullish on advances in virtual sets, remote production, standardized interoperable solutions, hybrid cloud archives and infrastructures that help streamline the delivery to multiple platforms.

During the panel, “New Tech for the Next Generation of News and Sports” Tim Hinson vice president, technology, at ABC13 KTRK in Houston Texas at the ABC Owned Television Stations, stressed that a key tech priority at the station group has been to standardize and centralize technologies. This, he said, has helped them improve quality and more efficiently produce massive amount of local news each week.

That effort, he added, also produced a number of important benefits during the L.A. wildfires.

“Over the past few years, we've been really focusing on technology and operations, centralization and standardization,” he said, adding that he wasn't “necessarily referring to just a people or a hub, for example, even though we do some of that. Really what we're talking about is centralization of technology [in terms of] reducing costs and also workflow optimization. And we're also hyper focused on making sure our common systems and workflows are standardized across the group, especially from a technology perspective, because that really, really promotes the sharing of data, content and personnel.”

Covering Wildfires with Better Tech

During the wildfires, he explained, “a lot of our other stations sent reporters, photographers and other support staff to L.A. to help out with the coverage….Because of our standardization efforts mentioned earlier, people were able to jump right in and begin working…We were able to easily provide live shots to any station around the country from any bonded cell packing unit with just a touch of a button.”

They were also able to get them working without having to “learn the station systems first…They were just able to go straight out in the field and start contributing right away,” he said.

Hinson and the other panelists also stressed the importance of engaging viewers with new ways of telling stories that can help them stand out from a crowded news and sports landscape.

One example of that is virtual sets or augmented reality technologies.

Jason Wormser, senior vice president, CW Sports noted that their production partner NASCAR Productions has recently unveiled a new virtual set in Studio 43, their state-of-the-art production facility that NASCAR uses to produce the CW NASCAR coverage.

“They've invested in a 57 foot LED wall,” he said. “They are using AR camera tracking technology with a [ARRI] Alexa 35 studio camera system…We really think this is kind of the next stage, the next step of these virtual systems" that will provide enormous flexibility and quality for the studio production.”

During the panel, Scott Warren, president and general manager, CBS Bay Area (KPIX/KPIX+) discussed a ground-breaking case study of how the CBS-owned stations were able to deploy virtual sets, which until relatively recently, required the kind of large budgets and engineering staff that only large networks could afford.

Warren said the project began in 2023 as part of a push to find better ways to tell stories and provide better, more engaging weather coverage. “We wanted to make an immersive experience, because weather is more than two dimensional,” he explained. “It's more than a person in front of a map, it's cloud stacks, it's elevation, it's wind, it's rain, it's precipitation…We felt like we could tell the weather story in a better way in an immersive environment, and that's where this all started.”

In the development process of the system, they worked with Myreze, a branding and virtual production company from Norway. Other vendors included Zero Density's virtual solution, rendering from the Unreal Engine, camera tracking from stYpe and Baron Weather for integrated weather data.

The Secret Sauce for Immersive Local News

A key component, however, was their inhouse tech talent, Warren stressed. “We had to challenge them [all the vendors], as well as ourselves, because we couldn't add bodies…We really had to do it with the existing team…We had to do something different and bring all of this in house and have it hook up into an automated control room with just one director.”

And…that was the where the secret sauce comes in, [the station's inhouse tech talent],” he added. “Our coders and our engineers have worked feverishly to pull all the pieces and parts [together] and to get inside all of the third party vendors' engines and reconfigure things to make it work.”

The result, he adds, is “TV in a box. We've created a system that does work with just one director driving the whole thing, and one operator, and that's it.”

The system is so streamlined they've been able to since install it at other CBS owned stations in New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Colorado and Miami. It has also been expanded for additional types of coverage, including breaking news and sports, with the CBS stations using it for their March Madness Coverage.

In San Francisco, they've become so comfortable with the solution that they've discarded all the hard sets.

The system is particularly appealing for breaking news. “The magic of the weather system is that everything is in real time and real time data,” Warren said. “The big challenge at the very beginning of building this was, how do we bring all that weather data from the National Weather Service and other partners into our system at every single elevation in the atmosphere, to show every different kind of condition, pressure, wind, precipitation and temperature, all the things that factor into what makes weather. How do we bring that digital information into the system in real time and create the visual representations of what that is doing?”

The resulting system “does exactly that,” he explained. “It builds graphics in real time.”

This has also been important for breaking news like wildfires. “We're able to watch fires and fire lines develop with these virtual maps,” he said, adding that it has also been a great tool for covering “earthquakes...We're able to locate and show the magnitude as it ripples out across an area, and all of this is driven by the meteorologists in real time who have an iPad.”

The Remote Production Game

During the panel, CW's Wormser also highlighted the growing importance of remote production tech advances in cutting the costs of sports production.

“Our system is a little bit different than everybody else's, because we are using third parties,” that are producing events for us,” Wormser explained, using remote production technologies. “With REMI, with COVID…it just accelerated so many things in our business [so that remote production]...is kind of the next step” in sports production.

Wormser noted that remote productions have given them more flexibility in the way they've produced events, while reducing costs and freeing up money to improve the productions.

“It just saves so much, and it also gives you flexibility in the future of trying new things, trying different ideas, spending more time on pre-produced or post-produced elements,” he said. “It gives you a little bit more flexibility at a lower cost.”

“All the networks are doing it,” he added. “ESPN has been doing it with basketball. Fox has been doing this for years…It goes back into the early 2000s basically, they were bringing games in from across the world, and they were voicing and doing all the graphics in their studios in Los Angeles, and calling him off the monitor because they don't have the money to go around the world. So it's only going to get better. The technology is unbelievable, and will enable networks to put the money into rights and yet still have high quality, innovative production and content for the viewers.”

The TV Tech Summit had a full separate panel on remote productions discussing those developments in more detail.

Starlink is on the verge of launching its satellite broadband service in India, with regulatory approval from the government expected soon. Recently, the company has teamed up with Jio and Airtel to distribute its equipment throughout the country. In addition to India, Starlink is gearing up to expand its reach in various other nations. Currently, its broadband service operates in 125 countries and boasts over 7 million users.

However, Starlink might encounter fierce competition from Chinese satellite broadband providers like SpaceSail in the foreseeable future. The company is preparing to make its entry into markets such as Brazil, Malaysia, and Kazakhstan.

Elon Musk's goal for Starlink is to acquire at least 1 million new users each year, a target that could gain significant momentum following its launch in India. That said, there are concerns that the arrival of these Chinese companies could pose challenges for Starlink.

In India, Starlink will also face competition from local providers like Airtel and Jio, as well as Amazon Kuiper. The telecom regulator is poised to allocate spectrum for satellite services, with consultations from stakeholders and experts nearly complete.

Starlink has been waiting since 2022 to roll out its services in India. This high-speed internet service operates through SpaceX satellites orbiting close to the Earth. Once the necessary regulatory approval and spectrum allocation from the Government of India are secured, Starlink is set to officially begin its operations, especially now that it has partnered with Jio and Airtel, which bodes well for a timely approval.

Meanwhile, the government's efforts to tackle cyber fraud are intensifying and show no signs of slowing down. As of February this year, authorities have blocked over 780,000 SIM cards, more than 3,000 Skype IDs, and upwards of 83,000 WhatsApp accounts.

BANGKOK (AP) — China protested Wednesday after the U.S. added dozens of companies to its export control list, including more than 50 based in China that it says sought advanced knowhow in supercomputing, artificial intelligence and quantum technology for military purposes. 

Companies from Taiwan, Iran, Pakistan, South Africa and United Arab Emirates also were included in the roughly 80 companies added to the “entity list” of the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. 

Six are subsidiaries of the Inspur Group, China's leading cloud computing and big data service provider. It was listed in the U.S. government's entity list in 2023. 

The update also includes the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, which objected vehemently.

“We are shocked that a private non-profit scientific research institution has been added to the entity list. We strongly oppose this wrong decision without any factual basis and ask the relevant U.S. departments to withdraw it,” the research institute said in a statement.

A review committee said the BAAI and another company, the Beijing Innovation Wisdom Technology Co. were judged to have developed large AI models and advanced computer chips for military purposes. 

China's Foreign Ministry also lashed back, saying the entity list and other export controls were an abuse meant to “unjustly suppress Chinese enterprises.”




“It seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations, severely damages the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises, and undermines the security and stability of global supply chains. China firmly opposes and strongly condemns this,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a routine news briefing Wednesday. 

The aim is to restrict China's capacity to acquire and develop ultra fast, or “exascale” supercomputers, to develop hypersonic weapons and other sensitive technologies, the bureau said in a notice on its website. It also is intended to prevent South Africa's Test Flying Academy from using U.S. goods to train Chinese troops, disrupt Iran's access to unmanned aerial vehicles and other military items and hinder development of insecure nuclear and ballistic missile programs, it said. 

The companies on the list are subject to the “foreign direct product rule” of the BIS which allows it to control reexports and transfers of foreign-made products containing technology that the U.S. government deems vital for national security. 

The tightening of controls comes as the Trump administration prepares for another round of tariff hikes due next week, an escalation of the trade war that President Donald Trump launched during his first term in office. 

Trump has already raised tariffs on imports of Chinese goods to 20%. On Monday he said he would impose a 25% tariff on all imports from any country that buys oil or gas from Venezuela. China buys a large share of the oil exported by Venezuela. 

China has retaliated with its own countermeasures, including sweeping new duties on a variety of American goods and an anti-monopoly investigation into Google.

It also has moved to tighten its own sanctions regime, meanwhile, with a law enabling it to freeze assets of companies subject to Chinese sanctions.

iOS 19 is expected to appear very different but feel very familiar

Apple's iOS 19 is turning out to be an interesting software update for iPhone users because it is said to bring along a massive visual overhaul; something that's not changed with the mobile operating system for a really long time. While iOS 18 was supposed to usher in an era of Apple Intelligence (or artificial intelligence) for its iPhone, Apple has been struggling to deliver said features as per previously promised timelines. Indeed, iOS 19 is also expected to add to the existing bugs and problems that are just starting to get ironed out in recent iOS 18 updates.

Right after Apple announced the dates for its Worldwide Developers Conference 2025 (WWDC 25, famed tipster John Prosser who previously released a mockup video showcasing the iOS 19 camera app, has now uploaded a new video giving iPhone fans a better idea of what's expected from the yet to be announced iOS 19 update.

In the video, Prosser claims that the 3D visuals in his video are based on actual footage of the iOS 19 he saw in action. However, it is advised to take the below information with a pinch of salt as this could be based on an early build. And as far as early or even beta builds go, things do change until the final release candidate arrives.

The tipster claims that iOS 19 is more about a visual overhaul and less about adding new features. One can almost call it a new theme, which brings a more rounded design, styling and glossy or glass-like transparent visual elements. Prosser, in his video, states that this visual overhaul was expected last year, but thanks to Apple's focus on Apple Intelligence, it was pushed to the following year (2025).

 



 

The visual overhaul also lines up with the design overhaul (at least by Apple's standards) for its upcoming iPhone 17 series, which has been leaked time and again. The new visionOS-inspired design applies not just to the OS but will also be applied to all native apps. In fact, some of these future design elements have already started showing up in the Apple Sports and Apple Invites apps, in form of tiny menus.

The keyboard, which the tipster claims to almost seems to “float”, appears like your regular iOS keys that are now laid out on transparent glass. The same applies to buttons and other UI elements in most native apps. The shiny edges also make elements pop up from the screen. This surely seems like a good break from the regular and mostly flat user interface that iOS has grown into compared to its skeuomorphic past.

However, Mark Gurman, whose predictions have been accurate so far was quick to point out that most of the mockups “floating” online are based on very old builds of iOS 19. In his post on X, Gurman added that they are missing several key features, which he expects Apple to reveal in June at its WWDC 25 developer event.

WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) -The best-known member of Elon Musk's U.S. DOGE Service team of technologists once provided support to a cybercrime gang that bragged about trafficking in stolen data and cyberstalking an FBI agent, according to digital records reviewed by Reuters.

Edward Coristine is among the most visible members of the DOGE effort that has been given sweeping access to official networks as it attempts to radically downsize the U.S. government.

Past reporting had focused on his youth - he is 19 - and his chosen nickname of "bigballs," which became a pop culture punchline. Musk has championed the teen on his social media site X, telling his followers last month that "Big Balls is awesome."

Beginning around 2022, while still in high school, Coristine ran a company called DiamondCDN that provided network services, according to corporate and digital records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with half a dozen former associates. Among its users was a website run by a ring of cybercriminals operating under the name "EGodly," according to digital records preserved by the internet intelligence firm DomainTools and the online cybersecurity tool Any.Run.

The details of Coristine's connection to EGodly have not been previously reported.

On Feb. 15, 2023, EGodly thanked Coristine's company for its assistance in a post on the Telegram messaging app.

"We extend our gratitude to our valued partners DiamondCDN for generously providing us with their amazing DDoS protection and caching systems, which allow us to securely host and safeguard our website," the message said.

The digital records reviewed by Reuters showed the EGodly website, dataleak.fun, was tied to internet protocol addresses registered to DiamondCDN and other Coristine-owned entities between October 2022 and June 2023, and that some users attempting to access the site around that time would hit a DiamondCDN "Security check."

Coristine did not return messages seeking comment. Musk's team, which has adopted the name "Department of Government Efficiency" though it is not an official government department, did not respond to emails about Coristine. He is listed as a "senior adviser" at the State Department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, according to one official at each agency who told Reuters they had seen his name in their respective agencies' staff directory.

On LinkedIn, Coristine describes himself as a "Volunteer (Intern) Plumber" with the U.S. government.

The State Department did not return messages asking about Coristine. CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.

EGodly's Telegram channel has been inactive for the past year; attempts to elicit comment from eight people who participated in or interacted with EGodly were unsuccessful.

'THESE ARE BAD FOLKS'

DiamondCDN's website - CDN typically stands for "content delivery network" - was registered in mid-2022, according to records collected by DomainTools. It pitched itself as offering "excellent security tools" that would help "lower your infrastructure costs," according to copies of the site maintained by the Internet Archive. The site said the company "has no business inspecting user content."

In 2023, EGodly boasted on its Telegram channel of hijacking phone numbers, breaking into unspecified law enforcement email accounts in Latin America and Eastern Europe, and cryptocurrency theft. Early that year, the group distributed the personal details of an FBI agent who they said was investigating them, circulating his phone number, photographs of his house, and other private details on Telegram.

EGodly also posted an audio recording of an obscene prank call made to the agent's phone and a video, shot from the inside of a car, of an unknown party driving by the agent's house in Wilmington, Delaware at night and screaming out the window, "EGodly says you're a bitch!"

Reuters could not independently verify EGodly's boasts of cybercriminal activity, including its claims to have hijacked phone numbers or infiltrated law enforcement emails. But it was able to authenticate the video by visiting the same Wilmington address and comparing the building to the one in the footage.

The FBI agent targeted by EGodly, who is now retired, told Reuters that the group had drawn law enforcement attention because of its connection to swatting, the dangerous practice of making hoax emergency calls to send armed officers swarming targeted addresses. The agent didn't go into detail. Reuters is not identifying him out of concern for further harassment.

"These are bad folks," the former agent said. "They're not a pleasant group."

He declined to comment further about the harassment or whether EGodly had been or still was the subject of an FBI investigation. The FBI didn't return messages seeking comment on EGodly.

Reuters was not able to ascertain how long EGodly used DiamondCDN, or whether EGodly paid Coristine's company. Archived copies of DiamondCDN's website said the firm envisioned having both paying and nonpaying customers.

Another individual who has been subject to abuse from EGodly and a cybercrime researcher who has followed the group said it was composed of hardened fraudsters, citing the group's makeup and the credibility of its claims. Both asked not to be identified, citing fears of retaliation.

Even if the connection between Coristine and EGodly were fleeting, Nitin Natarajan, who served as the deputy director of CISA under former President Joe Biden, told Reuters it was worrying that someone who provided services to EGodly only two years ago was part of a group that has gained wide access to government networks.

"This stuff was not in the distant past," he said. "The recency of the activity and the types of groups he was associated would definitely be concerning."

          March 26, 2025
        



NASHVILLE, TENN. – Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. today showcased a bold array of new and refreshed models, along with next-generation technologies set to debut in the U.S. and Canada from FY25 through FY27. Loaded with innovative features, the new products will play a crucial role in elevating the company's performance, boosting customer loyalty, attracting new buyers, increasing profitability, and promoting sustainable growth.

To meet the rising demand for diverse powertrain options, the upcoming lineup will include hybrid technologies (including e-POWER and plug-in hybrids), next-generation electric vehicles (EVs), and advanced internal combustion engines (ICE).

Guillaume Cartier, chief performance officer, stated: "Today, we unveil our redefined market approach and tailored product strategy designed to better meet customer needs and drive top-line growth. Through powertrain diversification and new models, we will provide a broader range of options that cater to diverse customer preferences, further distinguishing Nissan and INFINITI brands." 

Ivan Espinosa, chief planning officer, said: "Over the next two years, we are excited to roll out an impressive lineup that will redefine the road! This includes the reimagined Nissan LEAF, and a daring new Micra EV. But that's not all – we're refreshing our range of SUVs to elevate the driving experience, and our next-generation e-POWER promises new levels of refinement and efficiency. We are committed to investing in products that embody the very best of Nissan. To our passionate fans and loyal owners around the world, I can assure you, this is just the beginning of an exciting journey ahead."

Christian Meunier, chairman, Nissan Americas, said: "North America is a key market, and we are taking quick actions to get us back to growth and set the stage for the exciting products to come.

We're strengthening our retail partnerships to deliver high customer satisfaction and hear the voice of the market. Our dealers are fully engaged and enthusiastic for the future.

We're simplifying our operations and retail programs so that we can attack our cost structures, allowing us to deliver the right products to our customers, when they want them, where they need them, and for the right price.

With these actions, and continued investments in our business, we expect an accelerated recovery, supported by strong sales of the fantastic new products already in market, and future models on the way. Full speed ahead!"

The U.S. and Canada will see more than 10 new and refreshed products in key segments, including next-gen EV and hybrid technology and INFINITI models.

In FY25, the U.S. and Canada will be the first markets to launch the all-new Nissan LEAF, joining Ariya in the brand's EV portfolio. 



Reimagined as a sleek and spacious family-friendly crossover, the third-generation all-new Nissan LEAF pairs substantial improvements in aerodynamics with a more advanced EV architecture. 

As a first for the iconic EV nameplate, the all-new LEAF will be available with 19-inch alloy wheels and a panoramic moonroof. For the North American market, a NACS charging port is also integrated – the first time for a Nissan EV – enabling convenient access to the Tesla Supercharger network.

The all-new LEAF sits on Nissan's modular CMF-EV platform (which debuted with the Ariya). Efficient energy management, streamlined packaging and enhanced driving performance from Nissan's new 3-in-1 EV powertrain, are expected to help deliver significant range improvements over the previous generation. Today's announcement provides a first glimpse at this new model, with further details to be shared mid-year.

Additionally, Nissan will commence sales of the brand's first plug-in hybrid in North America, in a PHEV version of the compact Rogue SUV.

A new generation of Nissan's top-selling Sentra compact sedan will be introduced later this year, alongside a refreshed mid-size Pathfinder SUV.

For INFINITI, a refreshed three-row luxury QX60 SUV will be offered, alongside a new SPORT package for the full-size QX80 SUV.  

In FY26, production of the all-new, fourth-generation Rogue will begin. The model will be the first to offer Nissan's innovative e-POWER technology to consumers in the U.S. and Canada. Nissan will also offer Rogue with a powerful and efficient internal combustion engine, as well as a plug-in hybrid model, providing a diverse range of powertrains to shine in the market's most popular vehicle segment. 

INFINITI will launch the all-new QX65 crossover coupe. Channeling inspiration from the pioneering INFINITI FX, INFINITI QX65 promises buyers a stylish two-row alternative in the very popular mid-size crossover segment. 

Then from late FY27, an all-new Nissan EV is scheduled to commence production at Nissan's Canton, Mississippi plant in the U.S. The all-new model will be an adventure-focused SUV. It will be joined in FY28 by a luxury INFINITI EV SUV (inspired by the Vision QXe concept) that pairs the brand's latest Artistry in Motion design language with a suite of technology features.

Under the recent agreement with SK On, both of these future models will feature U.S.-manufactured batteries, supporting 1,700 U.S. jobs at SK On, and involving a total investment of $661 million, including equipment purchases. This is in addition to Nissan's $500 million in investments for EV production at the Canton Assembly Plant.

For customers seeking a sophisticated hybrid powertrain, Nissan's third-generation e-POWER will benefit from the learnings of over 1.6 million produced units since the technology was first introduced in 2016.

The third-generation e-POWER system delivers notable improvements in efficiency where it is targeted to provide up to 15% enhancement in economy at high speeds compared to the current, second-generation system. It will also deliver lower emissions and enhanced refinement through reduced noise and vibration.

A unique Nissan technology, e-POWER uses a small capacity gasoline engine and lithium-ion battery to power an electric motor. As the electric motor alone drives the wheels, the result is an EV-like driving experience, characterized by powerful and responsive acceleration paired with quiet operation.

Central to the advancement is the adoption of a new 1.5-liter e-POWER dedicated engine and the new 5-in-1 system, which shares core components with Nissan's latest EV powertrain.

The third-generation e‐POWER system will debut in North America in FY26 in the next-generation Rogue.

Nissan is committed to delivering the highest customer satisfaction, sustainability, and enhanced business performance. More details on each new product, as well as news on additional models that the company plans to launch, will be shared closer to the start of sales in each respective market.

*Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. financial years are from April through March.

News Corp's chief technology officer David Kline is resigning from his role to accept an undisclosed position “outside the organisation.”

Kline will remain with News Corp until the end of June as a search for his successor is underway.

“After more than five incredibly productive and exciting years as CTO of News Corp, I am resigning with mixed emotions. It's been a remarkable journey, and while it's bittersweet to step away, I do so knowing that the technology organisation is stronger than ever, with a high-performing, forward-looking team firmly in place. I'm deeply grateful to Rupert, Lachlan, Robert and the entire News Corp leadership team for their trust, partnership and support throughout this chapter,” Kline said in his exit statement.

Kline joined News Corp in January 2020 and over the last five years has driven a rapid period of legacy system overhaul and global implementations of new technology solutions. He moved to News Corp from Viacom Global where he had served as executive VP of technology, CTO and CIO since 2010. His technology career is steeped in media experience, with earlier senior leadership roles at Discovery Communications and AMC Networks.

News Corp CEO Robert Thompson said Kline's contribution, “at a time of profound transformation,” was a crucial element to the media giant's success.

“Dave's drive and leadership have been crucial to our success as other media companies have floundered and foundered. His contribution to our company will resonate for many years to come, both in his enduring positive influence and through the strong and talented tech team that he has assembled,” said Thomson.

Financial advisers face mounting pressure to improve efficiency, driven by both regulatory demands and commercial realities.

Demand for advice continues to grow – particularly in tax planning, as frozen allowances and upcoming changes to pension inheritance tax relief reshape financial strategies. And clients – and the regulator are increasingly expecting advisers to provide better value for money.

In the meantime, capacity isn't growing to meet the growing demand because adviser numbers stay stubbornly static.

One answer is that advisers need to get more efficient so that they can look after more clients and also provide a better customer experience.

The movement towards more productivity is painfully slow

So the rising demand is presenting advisers with opportunities, but only for those who adapt. The danger is that the tax changes will create more work for advisers but it won't necessarily boost their profits and maybe not even their revenues. The movement towards more productivity is painfully slow.

It is true that advisers are turning to technology to improve their efficiency, according to our latest report, UK Financial Advisers: Planning and Technology. But the pace of their adoption of technology is slow overall and there are big differences in the speed of progress for different parts of the advice process, as we've outlined below.

Technology has transformed some areas of financial planning in recent years. Risk profiling tools are used by nearly all advisers and they have mostly been integrated into advice firms' centralised investment processes. That wasn't the case just a few years ago.

The regulator's retirement income advice review may prompted some advisers to use of cash flow planning for clients approaching or in retirement, but many advisers now see commercial benefits from using the tool to engage clients in a rich experience of thinking hard about their finances.

Yet many manual processes persist in the advice process, notably fact-finding and letters of authority. Advisers' use of manual paper-based fact-finding has only dropped from three-quarters of advisers to two-thirds in five years, so progress here remains horribly slow.

Client portals aim to streamline workflows, but relatively few clients use them and they often complain about their poor useability. And still the advice process beset by fragmented digital experiences and multiple logins.

However, AI-driven transcription is gaining traction in fact-finding, improving efficiency and accuracy of recording. Currently, only one in six (16%) advisers use these facilities but numbers are growing.

Many advisers consider letter of authority (LoA) process the least efficient aspect of their service. Providers dictate the various LoA methods they're willing to accept, which complicates advisers' administration.

Providers and platforms have a great opportunity to offer innovative solutions

But innovative solutions from tech providers like Pension Lab, Re:LoA and Unipass are gaining traction with some advice firms.

With the growing impact of tax on clients' finances for providers we would expect to see lots of helpful tax calculators and other programmes, but advisers report that there are few tax tools in their financial planning suites.

Roughly two-thirds of advisers say they use calculators for income, capital gains and inheritance tax liabilities but often they are mostly free but clunky online tools or the ancillary to their cash flow modellers or their platforms.

Advisers' adoption of technology is progressing, but the pace is slow many advice processes remain manual and fragmented. Providers and platforms have a great opportunity to offer innovative solutions.

Artificial intelligence company Anthropic convinced a California federal judge on Tuesday to reject a preliminary bid to block it from using lyrics owned by Universal Music Group tab and other music publishers to train its AI-powered chatbot Claude.

U.S. District Judge Eumi Lee said that the publishers' request was too broad and that they failed to show Anthropic's conduct caused them “irreparable harm.”

The publishers said in a statement that they “remain very confident in our case against Anthropic more broadly.” An Anthropic spokesperson said the company was pleased that the court did not grant the publishers' “disruptive and amorphous request.”

Music publishers UMG, Concord and ABKCO sued Anthropic in 2023, alleging that it infringed their copyrights in lyrics from at least 500 songs by musicians including Beyoncé, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys.

The publishers claimed Anthropic used the lyrics without permission to train Claude to respond to human prompts.

The lawsuit is one of several arguing that copyrighted works by authors, news outlets, visual artists and others have been misused without consent or payment to develop AI products.

Tech companies including OpenAI, Microsoft tab and Meta Platforms have said that their systems make “fair use” of copyrighted material under U.S. copyright law by studying it to learn to create new, transformative content.

Fair use is likely to be the determinative question in the lawsuits, though Lee's opinion did not specifically address the issue.

Lee rejected the publishers' argument that Anthropic's use of their lyrics caused them irreparable harm by diminishing their licensing market.

“Publishers are essentially asking the Court to define the contours of a licensing market for AI training where the threshold question of fair use remains unsettled,” Lee said.

Mews, the industry leading hospitality cloud, has been chosen by Pelham Hospitality to centralize operations, enhance the guest experience and unlock new levels of efficiency across their hotels and event spaces.

Pelham Hospitality runs a collection of three boutique properties in Cape Cod. Pelham House Resort is its flagship property, which also hosts large weddings every weekend, alongside Pelham on Main and Pelham on Earl. The brand is known for its fresh, bright aesthetic and highly personalized service. For General Manager Heather McCarthy, switching to Mews was a long time coming.

“The second I saw Mews, I was obsessed,” said McCarthy. “It's like my hotel brain created an ideal system that's super flexible with lots of open interfaces, incredibly user-friendly, and complete with built-in guest messaging. It checked all the boxes.”

By moving to Mews, Pelham Hospitality will streamline reservations, upsells, and sales and catering, bringing everything under one roof. Their previous property management system and sales and catering software operated independently, creating manual workarounds and data silos. Now, with Mews as the central hub, their systems will be fully integrated, saving time, reducing admin and improving reporting.

Pelham Hospitality is also onboarding Thynk for sales and catering at the same time, connected seamlessly via Mews Marketplace. This hotel tech app store allows the team to easily integrate to pre-approved solutions without additional connection fees. “Mews is the hub of our operations but having that flexibility to choose specialist partners is huge,” McCarthy said. “Once I attached to the idea of picking the expert system in that area and making sure they connect really well, it made a ton of sense.”

Because of the brand's focus on providing memorable experiences, it was important to choose a system that puts guests at its center. In addition to providing user-friendly guest communication tools like direct messaging, Mews automates manual tasks so that staff have more time to spend directly with guests.

“The onboarding has been so refreshing,” added McCarthy. “It's great to meet like-minded hospitality folks who all speak the same language. It feels fresh, but also very personal. And all this smart automation will let us focus on our ultimate priority: being able to tailor the guest journey to the individual guest, which is fundamental to who we are.”

Matt Welle, Mews CEO, commented: “Pelham Hospitality is a perfect example of how great hospitality stems from being open minded. They truly thought about their brand's needs and what they wanted to get out of a new system, which in turn will help them to create even more exceptional guest experiences. Their commitment to flexibility and seamless operations aligns perfectly with Mews, and we're thrilled to support their vision for modern hospitality.”

Pelham Hospitality joins several other hotels on Cape Cod powered by Mews, such as AWOL Provincetown and The Coonamessett, both managed by Lark Hotels, as well as independents like Emerald Resort, Anchor Inn Beach House and Gifford House. Mews is also the first ever PMS to be an active member of the Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce, cementing its commitment to the area.

OpenAI has significantly upgraded its ChatGPT chatbot, expanding its capabilities beyond text-based conversations to advanced image generation. The company unveiled the latest update on Tuesday, integrating new technology that enables ChatGPT to create highly detailed and complex images based on user prompts.

The new version, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model, can generate intricate visuals, including multi-panel comic strips with custom characters and dialogue. This marks a major leap from previous versions, which, while capable of image generation, struggled with blending multiple complex concepts into a single output.

The development reflects a broader shift in artificial intelligence, where chatbots are evolving into multifunctional tools. Originally designed for text-based tasks such as answering questions, writing poetry, and generating code, ChatGPT now supports voice commands, images, and even video interactions.

OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT in late 2022, training it on vast amounts of text data from across the internet. While the chatbot initially lacked image-generation capabilities, OpenAI later released DALL-E, a separate tool designed for that purpose. The latest iteration of ChatGPT, however, merges these functionalities into a single, more powerful system that learns from both text and visual data.

Historically, AI image generators have struggled with creating visuals that deviate significantly from existing examples. However, OpenAI claims the new ChatGPT can now handle requests for unconventional images—such as a bicycle with triangular wheels—more effectively.

Starting Tuesday, the enhanced ChatGPT will be available to both free and paid users. Subscribers to ChatGPT Plus ($20 per month) and ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month) will also gain access to OpenAI's latest AI tools.

As a health IT company, Wise Hospice Options integrates with many different systems, particularly electronic health records. The company has integrated with more than 15 EHRs throughout the 21 years it has operated. The only constant it has found is that each system has its own standard and way of doing things.

In hospice care, Health Level 7 and Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources specification standards are not tightly followed, and fields may be used in different ways by the different EHRs. When the company started implementing e-prescribing in its system in 2013, these differences became apparent very quickly.

Each system sends different levels of detail with identifiers from different drug compendia. The lack of universal standardization left the Wise Hospice system and IT team unable to completely fill the gaps that interoperability promised it would fill.

Over the years, Wise staff have tried many different solutions to improve the accuracy and user experience of the integrations. They have worked with various EHRs to improve the data they receive; however, the EHR companies have their own IT priorities and capacities, so Wise staff often were unable to get the full data needed for complete resolution of the data gaps.

This led to unrecognized drugs and instructions (sigs) that the e-prescribing system could not parse or handle. Even with NCPDP working toward a Structured and Codified Sig Standard, adoption by EHRs would be difficult as medications are not their sole focus. The NIH has RxNorm APIs available to assist with drug database standardization, but the adoption in the hospice space has been slow and is not regularly used.

Out of the 15 EHR systems Wise has integrated with, only one was willing and able to work with the vendor to send the detailed and specific data for a truly functional medication integration that supports near-seamless e-prescribing – unfortunately, this lone system was acquired and is now being sunset, said Brett Faubion, director of operations and finance at Wise Hospice Options.

"With the available standards not being adopted and the difficulty in getting a multitude of organizations together to work toward a medication message standard, we had to look at what options were in our control to improve the experience of our users and fulfill the promise of interoperability: reducing duplicate entry and the risks associated," he explained.

"One method that other systems have taken is to simply accept and load whatever free-text entries are received from the EHR," he continued. "While doing this streamlines the users' e-prescribing flow, it comes with significant risks and reduced functionality. Free-text sig entries are not able to be checked for dosing in our e-prescribing tool since dosing and frequency are not in their own distinct fields."

Allergy checks could also be compromised by abbreviations, misspellings or typos of the allergy (for example, Penicillin is often misspelled) and could directly lead to patient harm. Not every EHR offers these checks on the orders and medications entered into their system, making the e-prescribing system the only place these risks might be mitigated.

"We do not believe the simplified e-prescribing workflow justifies the increased risk to our users and the hospice patients and our clients resoundingly agreed," Faubion said. "With reducing functionality not being an option, we needed to look for more innovative solutions.

"Our goals coming out of this situational review were to improve the user experience of e-prescribing in our system, improve the effectiveness of medication and allergy interfaces without requiring EHR-side updates, and to streamline the channels and number of contacts involved in the system," he continued.

Too much energy was being wasted on 10 different fronts, and Wise staff needed to compile that energy into a single source as a solution, either as internal development or using a single-source external tool, he added. This led staff to look at AI technologies for the various types and structures of data Wise receives for medications, sigs and allergies. The company needed a tool that could codify medications and allergies, and parse free-text sigs into codified fields.

Wise Hospice Options decided to work with health IT vendor DrFirst to offer integrated e-prescribing to hospices. Wise has worked together to improve the user experience and data flow, and minimize many issues over the years, but the data is only as good as what it gets from the data source, the EHR. As Wise pivoted from trying to collaborate with more than 10 different organizations to one, it discussed the issue with DrFirst staff.

"This is when their clinical-grade AI tool first came up," Faubion noted. "This tool was built to codify medications from medication names, strengths and forms, codify allergies from free-text entries, and parse sigs into individual fields used by the DrFirst e-prescribing system. This seemed like a perfect fit for our needs with a trusted partner that demanded less development time from our IT team.

"After seeing a demonstration of the AI and the data backing its results, we discussed prior use cases, reviewed test data and finalized the data flow," he continued. "This would be the first application of the clinical-grade AI tool in a real-time setting, processing the data as we receive from the EHRs. To accommodate the differences in each EHR's data formatting, the AI model would need to be segmented and trained separately for each integration."

While the coding infrastructure to be implemented would be standardized and toggled on or off for each account, handling each integration uniquely allowed for greater accuracy and better results. This decision did increase the work for both the Wise and DrFirst teams, but they determined it was worth the improved performance for clients.

"The goal of simplifying the collaboration needed for improvement was met, and while an AI tool will not provide 100% conversions, an 80% conversion rate for sigs and even higher for medications and allergies was a major improvement for our users," Faubion reported. "Even if the EHRs enhanced their medication interfaces, there would still be a portion of medications that would be complex and not transfer well, such as compounds or complex sigs with multi-part instructions.

"While using an AI tool does not fully eliminate duplicate entry or the risk of mistranslation, it significantly reduced the amount of manual entry or correction needed," he continued. "E-prescriptions would still need to be reviewed for accuracy, but the majority would no longer need to be adjusted or edited. This improvement occurs completely behind the scenes and does not require any manual activation or intervention by a user."

Wise Hospice Options worked with the DrFirst team to adapt their AI tool to the majority of EHRs Wise has integrated with and is continuing to expand the supported systems. Expanding service to an integration involves analyzing the data received, processing a significant load of batch data, and reviewing the results for potential pitfalls, improvements and unique patterns for a client.

"For example, some EHRs split the strength of a medication from the name while others lump them together," Faubion explained. "Some of the differences occur at the client level, such as one client selecting multiple routes for a medication. Treating each structure differently allows the AI to be even more accurate for each client and system. The downside is that initially, we have had to limit our onboarding of this tool to an EHR basis.

"We open the offering to each applicable client as we support a specific EHR with this tool," he continued. "The additional accuracy is absolutely worth the slower rollout time. This also allows us to take a more individualized approach and identify the gaps the AI might have for a client's specific data or ordering practices that may not be currently supported by the AI tool. We can then work directly with the client to find a resolution and ensure all parties are satisfied with the data flow."

The way Wise built the process and data flow allows for the AI to be used without any additional user entry or intervention. It is a tool in the background that enhances the data received from the EHR to make it more compatible with the e-prescribing system.

"This changes the workflow from a 'fix then prescribe,' with various clicks and potentially multiple screens to manually match a medication, to 'review then prescribe,'" Faubion said. "Users still need to pay attention to what is being prescribed and to what alerts may occur, such as an allergy interaction or overdosing."

In Wise Hospice Options' initial pre-live test batches of medication and allergy data, it saw the AI codify 92% of medications, fully parse 80% of sigs and codify 95% of allergies. The company did not expect 100% for any of these categories as there are instances that are complex or custom and need specific attention. For medications, there are compounds that will not easily translate or items that might be entered as a medication that do not have a codified identifier, like oxygen.

"Complex sigs exist that the e-prescribing system is not designed to handle by default, such as non-standard frequencies," he explained. "Allergies can't always be codified and may not be relevant to prescribing medications, such as 'dust' or 'seasonal allergies.' Given these nuances, we were excited about the potential performance.

"Once we implemented the DrFirst AI with several accounts, we saw even better performance metrics than expected," he continued. "The AI tool has codified 99% of medications, 85% of sigs and 96% of allergies. The almost complete prevention of unmatched or invalid medications has been a great result and major improvement to the user experience."

Before, any medication that was received with old or outdated NDCs, drug identifiers from a compendium Wise does not use, or OTC medications that may not be in the drug database yet, would require a user to find and manually select the correct medication in the e-prescribing system to ensure the correct medication was prescribed. This workflow would take roughly 15 seconds for an experienced user and several clicks to work through, which adds up quickly when each patient has an average of seven medications.

"Add the time needed to rewrite the sigs for each medication compared to simply reviewing the sig, and we reduced the time to e-prescribe from 20 seconds per e-prescription to two to three seconds," Faubion reported. "We have been very happy with these results and the improvement this AI tool has made to our users' experience, workflow and data accuracy.

"While we have seen very positive results, there were still some bumps and improvements that we've worked through since implementation," he added. "Early during implementation, our clients reported a handful of AI errors and we quickly implemented an escalation system with our users and the DrFirst team to ensure these errors were corrected quickly and did not become reoccurring."

Wise also has seen data variance at the hospice level as some organizations use manual entry or create their own drug entries compared with others that stick to a prepopulated list. The DrFirst team also has worked on improving the processing of the Reasons section of an e-prescription, as this was a field that was rarely used in prior use cases and its utilization varies significantly even among Wise's client pool.

"This has led to many improvements, including handling multiple reasons being listed," Faubion noted. "As we work together to improve data processing, we are excited to see the results continue to improve over time and as more data is fed through the AI."

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Recently Put These 10 Stocks Under Spotlight. In this article, we are going to take a look at where HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently.

On Monday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on how the government's approach to tariffs could play a crucial role in sustaining the stock market rally. Cramer expressed satisfaction with the current direction of policy.

“There's what happened two weeks ago, two Thursdays ago, more accurately when the stock market official went into correction mode. Until the market broke down like that, I think the president was perfectly willing to hammer anybody just to get his way.”

“I don't think he (President Donald Trump) wants to punish good American companies that make things here.”

Cramer explained that he no longer thinks the president wants to harm American companies that manufacture goods domestically. He suggested that the shift in attitude is a relatively new development, and it may signal a more nuanced approach going forward. He noted that with the market's recovery, it is possible that the conversation around protectionist tariffs will surface once again, but the context might have changed.

Cramer speculated that when the market entered correction mode, President Trump may have been influenced by the pleas from various observers about the damaging effects on stocks of good American companies.

“Here's the bottom line: At the end of the day, America's the only country on earth that's played fair on trade. Everybody else breaks the rules to protect their domestic businesses. That's hollowed out our industrial heartland. And that dynamic can only change if our government takes a more carrot-and-stick approach. Assuming Trump doesn't go overboard, that might just be what we've got and it means stocks can finally stage a real rally again.”

For this article, we compiled a list of 10 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 24. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey's database of over 1,000 hedge funds.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81

A caller asked Cramer's thoughts on HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) and he replied:

“Okay, HCA I think has been punished enough. It's time to buy and I do think that your, your depiction of what happens every day is absolutely right and I feel it's just, it's not manipulation, but it's a pain in, a pain in the butt.”

HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) owns and operates hospitals and healthcare facilities across the United States, offering a wide range of medical, surgical, outpatient, and behavioral health services, including specialized care like cardiac, diagnostic, and rehabilitation treatments, as well as addiction and psychiatric services.

Diamond Hill Capital stated the following regarding HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:

“Among our bottom individual contributors in Q4 were HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) and Freeport-McMoRan. Health care facilities operator HCA Healthcare was negatively impacted in a couple of its markets by recent hurricanes. Further, shares have been pressured since the US election amid growing negative sentiment toward hospitals as investors anticipate potential reductions to safety-net programs such as Medicaid.”

Overall, HCA ranks 6th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. While we acknowledge the potential of HCA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than HCA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

GE HealthCare and private hospital group Swiss Medical Network have agreed to establish a molecular imaging and theranostics center of excellence at Clinique de Genolier, located 25 km from Geneva and 35 km from Lausanne.

The vendor and network have signed an agreement under which GE will provide equipment, access to proprietary tools and technologies, and support for research projects at Clinique de Genolier. The deal follows a strategic cooperation agreement signed in 2022 and will advance precision medicine and theranostics, a cornerstone of precision oncology, the firm said.

"The agility of the Swiss Medical Network enables us to rapidly validate and adopt innovative technologies, including AI-driven capabilities, and advance the future of healthcare," stated GE HealthCare President and CEO Peter Arduini in the announcement.

Swiss Medical Network has transformed its nuclear medicine platform, relocating to a new facility at Genolier and a new facility in Clinique Générale Beaulieu, Lake Geneva Area, the firm added. This includes the adoption of GE HealthCare's imaging and analysis technologies, including Omni Legend 32 PET/CT system, StarGuide advanced SPECT/CT system, and 870DR general purpose SPECT/CT unit.

Oops, something went wrong

Internet healthcare solutions provider Fangzhou has entered a partnership with Tencent Health and Tencent Cloud, aiming to expedite AI-driven healthcare solutions with the integration of the DeepSeek open-source AI model into its platform.

This move is expected to bolster the capabilities of Fangzhou's AI Agent 2.0 platform to enhance pharmaceutical logistics along with online healthcare services.

Fangzhou's recent deployment of the DeepSeek open-source large language model in February has set the stage for this partnership, which utilises Tencent Cloud's infrastructure to power the AI Agent 2.0 platform.

The platform is now equipped with DeepSeek's analytical prowess and Tencent's Hunyuan model, focusing on improving the efficiency of the healthcare sector.

DeepSeek's model is chosen for its performance, cost-effectiveness, and security features.

Its scalable efficiency is attributed to the mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, and its private deployment model aligns with stringent data privacy regulations by avoiding the transmission of customer data to third parties.

Fangzhou's AI platform is adept at rapid local deployment of various large language models, which facilitated the swift integration of DeepSeek's technology.

The support from Tencent Cloud's infrastructure has enabled Fangzhou to improve its platform's capabilities, offering improved services to patients and healthcare providers.

The AI Agent 2.0 deployment marks a significant development in the strategic partnership between Fangzhou, Tencent Health and Tencent Cloud.

This upgraded system is now better positioned to address patient services, physician workflows, and the development of new functionalities and data-driven improvements.

In December last year, Fangzhou announced a collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb.

This partnership focused on fostering innovation in internet healthcare, particularly in the development of digital platforms and models for internet-based chronic disease care.

Bishop John Sherrington is the Lead Bishop for Life Issues in England and Wales.

As the United Kingdom's Parliament fast approaches the final vote on a law for legalizing “assisted dying” – which critics points out is allowing doctors to help patients commit suicide, Sherrington called on the British people to contact their representatives in Parliament to oppose the Bill.

When the Bill was first voted on, it included a promise of several supposed “safeguards” – including limiting it for those suffering great pain and requiring a judge to approve it. However, most of these have been removed from the Bill as it reaches its final stage.

Sherrington replied to Crux about the Bill, saying there are “too many unanswered questions” about the Bill even for supporters of assisted suicide, and it shouldn't be passed.

The bishop also said the Church supports palliative care for those approaching death, and that is where the government should be improving peoples' lives in their final stages.

What follows is the full interview with Sherrington.

Crux: During the discussions on the proposal for “assisted death” it looks like the ultimate High Court Judge safeguard will be removed. What is your reaction to this?

Sherrington: I am interested that you use the term ‘assisted death' which you rightly place in inverted commas. During the present debate, the bishops have used the term ‘assisted suicide' for very good reasons. ‘Assisted death' or ‘assisted dying' are words used by the proponents of this Bill. They are euphemistic and try to obscure the reality of the Bill, which will permit a medic to assist the suicide of a person when they desire it under specific conditions. This is presently prohibited in the law which protects the most vulnerable.

There is an amendment before Parliament which removes the role of the High Court Judge. The amendment talks of review by a psychiatrist, a social worker and a lawyer. How adequately can this review be made? The facts that need to be considered are the medical condition, the freedom from coercion, and compliance with the law. I am fearful that the removal of the so-called safeguard of the High Court Judge further erodes the safety of the Bill. How can we be sure that this “panel of experts” has the knowledge particular to each person who is requesting assisted suicide? Will there be an appeal against a view of the panel? What are the costs of such a policy and how will it be funded? I am fearful that this proposal will divert resources from an already stretched NHS [UK's National Health Service] and further limit scarce resources for good palliative care.

This panel will not take decisions in the same way as a judge. It is highly likely that the “experts” will favor assisted suicide as a matter of principle so that they can participate. There are too many unanswered questions for a matter as important as this. I therefore stand firm in my belief that the Bill is unsafe and that there is a danger of coercion and control of vulnerable people.

The Assisted Suicide Committee voted against pain being added as a qualifying criteria – for many supporters, this was the chief reason to back the Bill. How would this – being assisted in suicide for depression, anxiety, or even for fearing the financial burden it might place on your family – affect things in Britain?

Regardless of the initial criteria under which assisted suicide is permissible, evidence from other jurisdictions strongly suggests that they will be rapidly loosened. We can think for example of the widened application in Canada and Belgium. In Canada, one in twenty deaths are from assisted suicide.

Your question raises concerns about a number of mental health issues which might lead people to request assisted suicide. The knowledge and treatment of mental health issues has increased rapidly in recent years and we are now more sensitive to the reality of these illnesses. Slowly the stigma associated with them is breaking down. Such challenges call for help in life, treatment and care rather than death. The Bill has promised that freedom will be needed to end one's life. These mental health issues reduce human freedom and make me more fearful about the danger of coercion of highly vulnerable people. We need to help people live with these illnesses in the best possible way.

You mention the fear of being a financial burden to the family. There are wider questions of how health and social care is funded at the end of life which go far beyond this present debate. These are questions for further political and social debate which not be short-circuited by this particular Bill. Catholic social teaching can help in this future debate.

It is important to distinguish between pain and suffering. Palliative care has led to major advances in the pain control of symptoms. This care needs to be more widely available to people. Experts in palliative care also speak of emotional pain, and spiritual or ‘soul' pain. These can be relieved by holistic professional and spiritual care. Often listening and allowing a person to tell their story leads to healing and reconciliation with the past. People carry within their hearts and bodies the pain of unresolved conflicts, relationship breakdowns and trauma. Good holistic care can assist a person live with and through these challenges.

Suffering is a complex theme which is part of the human condition. It is idealistic to think of life without suffering. The question of why the innocent suffer has been at the heart of philosophical and theological debate over the centuries. This becomes even more crucial when we deal with assisted suicide because what is proposed here is the termination of human life. If we do that, we deny ourselves the chance to respond to suffering in a truly humane way, in the fullness of freedom and love. Suffering needs to be addressed compassionately in a safe and loving environment. This is the project Dame Cecily Saunders began with the modern hospice movement, inspired by Christian values. A holistic palliative care approach, which incorporates not only the alleviation of physical pain, but also personal accompaniment, spiritual and physical guidance, friendship and care is the right and humane answer to pain.

As a Catholic bishop, I recognize the resources that the Catholic Church brings to sick people; the sacrament of the sick, viaticum, and the importance of prayer for the dying. Catholic chaplains and other chaplains and faith advisors help people in hospitals and hospices and their contribution to the debate cannot be underestimated.

How does the Church deal with people suffering, and with painful deaths? Shouldn't people avoid it if they are given the opportunity?

The Church continues the mission of Jesus Christ who healed the sick and freed people from the burden of sin. The Lord Jesus healed, performed miracles, and sent His disciples to do the same. This approach to care has been driving the Church's mission since its foundations and has seen the Church striving to found hospitals and clinics, alleviate suffering in the world and to be close to those who are vulnerable, suffering, and sick. Medicine treats illness and alleviates pain. The Church is the largest non-government provider of healthcare worldwide and Christian hospices in Britain are widely admired.

In her wisdom, in a tradition forged since medical advances in the sixteenth centuries, the Church recognizes there are “limits to treatment,” which we can accept. We do not suggest that people should be kept alive at all costs by what we describe as “extraordinary means.” There comes a point when a person, because of their underlying condition, may refuse further treatment and accept care which respects the dignity of the human person. This is the alleviation of suffering in its true meaning, not its elimination, which is what assisted suicide seeks to obtain. A person may exercise his or her autonomy about treatment but not intend to end their life prematurely and deliberately.

Recently, the press had a lot of news about the use of “buffer zones” around abortion clinics in the UK. Does the move to legalize assisted suicide show a different attitude towards life-and-death in Britain?

There is always a danger in conflating issues but what links these two subjects is the high value placed on personal autonomy and the need to protect personal choice.

While autonomy is an important value, it is only part of the understanding of the human person who has dignity and is relational. It is impossible to assert personal autonomy without first recognizing the unique value and dignity of human life, which begins at conception and ends with natural death. That is why it is wrong that personal autonomy overrides the life of the child in the womb whose dignity is not respected. This approach also fails to recognize the reality that humans are relational beings who live in the world through their relationships with others, with emotions, affections and love. These bond them to other human beings and the whole of creation. Every action of a person touches and affects others, often in unknown ways.

Both these laws overly value personal autonomy and do not consider the wider implications on other human lives. The use of buffer-zones was considered necessary by parliamentarians to protect women who chose to seek an abortion. Women were already protected by laws against harassment and coercion. The presence of others praying or handing out leaflets to offer an alternative was rejected. I fear that the assisted suicide legislation will not adequately protect the right to conscientious objection or freedom from referral to another doctor which further erodes a view which rejects such legislation. While some protection is given for doctors, what about all the other healthcare professionals who work in multidisciplinary teams caring for people at the end of life. They too deserve freedom of conscience.

How would assisted suicide affect the relationship between doctors and patients?

Doctors commit themselves to healing and saving lives. The Greek foundations of medicine led to the Hippocratic Oath which promised to heal and not do harm to a patient. This principle has governed medical practice until the last sixty years when the focus becomes autonomy and choice, especially about the future of the life of the unborn child. Christian healthcare professionals take inspiration from the life of Jesus Christ who healed the sick.

Good communication between the patient and the doctor requires the building of trust. In fact, recent cases of medical mismanagement and doing harm show the vulnerability of the patient who entrusts himself or herself to the professionalism of the physician. Language challenges, and the pressure under which the health service operates, can weaken the relationship which is needed between the doctor and the patient. The danger of this Bill is that people may be anxious about whether the doctor really cares for their healing and whether they can trust the physician.

This radical change in law, which crosses a watershed, will fundamentally alter the relationship between doctors and patients which could, in turn, have a detrimental impact on the whole of healthcare provision. This might cause some people to fear using healthcare – especially the elderly and vulnerable. The possibility for doctors to suggest assisted suicide as well as the duty of referral, which infringes the right to conscientiously object, would put a strain even on the relationship between doctors who oppose assisted suicide, and their patients. Instead, patients deserve access to safe healthcare, and doctors who are able to perform their role as caregivers and guardians of human dignity.

Thank you for the opportunity to answer these questions, As a final point, it is the duty of every MP to ensure that any proposed change in legislation has sufficient time for debate and full examination of its implications. I do not consider that this Bill has had sufficient time for debate and scrutiny, as it has been a Private Members' Bill, and so I believe it should be rejected outright.

Walgreens has agreed to pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed in federal court for the Northern District of Illinois more than 10 years ago.

Walgreens was accused of engaging in a "systematic and routine waiver of patient copayments." This was to induce all patients at the Cook County Health and Hospitals System CORE center, an ambulatory healthcare center in Illinois, to fill prescriptions at a specialty pharmacy called Walgreens C&M, according to the lawsuit. This allegedly constituted kickbacks. 

WHY THIS MATTERS

The case began in 2014 when plaintiff whistleblowers Sarah Castillo Baier and Rita Svendsen Baier sued Walgreens and a retail pharmacy branch manager alleging violation of the False Claims Act. The federal government and state of Illinois intervened.

The court on Monday dismissed the case after the parties filed for a Joint Stipulation of Dismissal.

In the civil action settlement, Walgreens agreed to pay $5,075,000 to be divided among the United States, state of Illinois and the whistleblowers.
The whistleblowers get $1.3 million, according to the settlement.

THE LARGER TREND

Earlier this month, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity affiliated with private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at $23.7 billion. 

Walgreens has suffered losses due in large part to VillageMD. The company said it was evaluating a variety of options with respect to the $3.4 billion debt owed to WBA by VillageMD.

The Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday advanced Dr. Mehmet Oz's nomination to become administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The 14 to 13 vote was along party lines. Oz next faces a vote for confirmation before the full Senate

Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said by statement, "Dr. Oz's years of experience as an acclaimed physician and public health advocate have prepared him well to manage the intricacies of CMS.  He will work tirelessly to deliver on the promise of much-needed change at CMS that ensures Americans receive the best care possible."

Ranking member Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he could not support the nomination.

"During his confirmation hearing, Dr. Oz was given the chance to assure the American people that he would not be a rubber stamp for Republicans' plans to gut Medicaid and hike ACA premiums," Wyden said by statement. "At every turn he failed the test. When I asked him a 'yes or no' question about whether he would protect Medicaid, he dodged and weaved and refused to answer."

Oz appeared before the committee earlier this month. 

When Wyden pressed him for a "yes" or "no" answer on whether he would cut Medicaid, the nominee replied, "The way you protect Medicaid is making sure it is viable at every level, which includes having enough practitioners to afford the services, paying them enough to do what you request of them, and making sure that patients are able to actually use Medicaid."

Some Republicans have proposed reducing spending by making cuts to Medicaid. 

In 2018, Trump appointed Oz to the Presidential Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, reappointing him to the position in 2020.

In 2022, Oz ran unsuccessfully for Senate in Pennsylvania, losing to Democrat John Fetterman.

Oz is best known for daytime talk show "The Dr. Oz Show," that ran for 13 seasons from 2009 through 2022, winning multiple Daytime Emmy Awards.

A new survey from Athenahealth and the Harris Poll shows physicians are thinking less about quitting their jobs and are more favorable toward AI.

Athenahealth, an electronic health record vendor that sells patient engagement tools and healthcare AI products, and the Harris Poll surveyed more than a thousand primary care and specialist physicians nationwide in January to understand physician attitudes about the state of their profession and the adoption of emergent technologies.

The team reported a decrease in physician burnout rates and intentions to quit in 2025 relative to 2024 — a welcome finding after multiple years of high physician turnover following the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a blog post accompanying the survey, the team said technology improvements, especially the use of AI to address administrative burdens, was a “main driver” of physicians' changing sentiments.

“For years EHRs were cited as one of the major contributors to physician burnout, so it stands to reason that as the technology improves, we'll hopefully start to see sentiments improve as well,” the team said in the blog.

While previous independent research has linked frustrations with EHRs to turnover, those studies have cautioned against attributing discontent to a single factor. Researchers note burnout is complex and can stem from frustrations with pay, difficult patients, volume and intensity of work, and advancement opportunities.

In Athenahealth's survey, 3 in 10 physicians said AI has the potential to reduce burnout. The same number reported they are currently using AI in their practice, while the majority have yet to adopt the technology. This year was the first time researchers queried physicians about their AI use, so a spokesperson couldn't comment on whether AI adoption had ramped up among physicians.

The survey did find an increase in “resources and tools” available to physicians in 2025 relative to 2023. Physicians also reported spending more time with patients relative to 2023, which could partially explain the shift in burnout and quit intentions, according to the survey.

Fifty-one percent of physicians report having adequate time with patients, up from 43% in 2023. While 35% of respondents said patient volumes and costs negatively impact their ability to provide quality care at least once a week, that's down from the 50% of respondents who said volumes and costs impacted care at least once a week in 2023.

Still, physicians report more optimism about potential use cases of AI. They said the greatest possible benefits to using AI in healthcare will be improved clinical documentation and transcription services, identifying patterns in patient data and reduced administrative burdens. 

However, there is a gender gap forming between male and female physicians in how comfortable they feel using the technology to treat patients. 

While 66% of male physicians would use AI for diagnosis support and 54% would use the technology for treatment planning, only 46% of female physicians would leverage the technology for diagnostics and just 36% would use it for treatment planning.

Across genders, physicians said their top concerns with using AI include the loss of a human touch in healthcare, an overreliance on the tools to diagnose patients and improper diagnoses.

Reproductive Freedom for All Georgia Condemns HB 441 as a Cruel and Dangerous Attack on Reproductive Healthcare

Atlanta, GA—Today, Reproductive Freedom for All Georgia strongly condemned House Bill 441, an extreme and politically motivated measure that would criminalize abortion at all stages of pregnancy by establishing legal personhood at fertilization. If passed, HB 441 would make Georgia one of only 13 states with a total abortion ban, imposing severe penalties, including loss of medical licenses, imprisonment, and even capital punishment.

Ahead of a hearing today at the state capitol, reproductive advocates will rally and testify against this dangerous legislation in the fight to protect reproductive rights in Georgia. Lawmakers will debate a measure that escalates previous abortion restrictions, putting more lives at risk while ignoring Georgia's ongoing healthcare crisis.

HB 441 follows a series of increasingly restrictive abortion measures in Georgia, including the 2019 LIFE Act that banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. That law took effect in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Instead of addressing Georgia's urgent healthcare crisis, including the state's ranking as the worst in the nation for maternal mortality and the highest rate of rural hospital closures, lawmakers are pushing an agenda that makes reproductive healthcare even more dangerous, costly, and inaccessible.

Alicia Stallworth, Georgia Campaigns Director for Reproductive Freedom for All, issued the following statement:

“This bill isn't about saving lives — it's about control. It would turn pregnancy into a crime scene and force doctors and nurses to choose between risking their livelihoods or providing necessary care. Black and Brown women, low-income families, rural communities, and young people will bear the brunt of this reckless legislation, and Georgia's healthcare crisis will only deepen. We deserve leaders who will address real healthcare needs, not lawmakers who criminalize care and strip away our freedoms.”

“We cannot allow Georgia to become a surveillance state where every pregnancy is scrutinized and every healthcare decision is subject to prosecution. Enough is enough. Lawmakers should be focused on expanding access to healthcare and reducing our maternal mortality rate — not criminalizing reproductive healthcare and endangering lives.”

###

For over 50 years, Reproductive Freedom for All (formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America) has fought to protect and advance reproductive freedom at the federal and state levels—including access to abortion care, birth control, pregnancy and post-partum care, and paid family leave—for everybody. Reproductive Freedom for All is powered by its more than 4 million members from every state and congressional district in the country, representing the 8 in 10 Americans who support legal abortion.

ALBANY, N.Y. — A new initiative, the Caring Gene program, is offering full coverage of tuition, books, and fees for New York State residents entering certain healthcare fields. This federally funded program, supported by a Medicaid waiver from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, promises $694 million to New York through March 2027.

Dr. Wendy Trevor, Vice President of Strategic Innovation and Partnerships at Maria College, emphasized the financial challenges faced by aspiring nurses. "A lot of times nursing students come with family members they've taken care of or family member who's been sick or they're taking care of an elderly relative," she said. "And then they look at tuition and they say, maybe I can't afford that, maybe not now, maybe later."

Maria College is among approximately 20 institutions participating in the program, which aims to address workforce shortages in healthcare. Students who benefit from the program commit to working in New York for three years, serving populations at or above the 30-percent Medicaid threshold.

Kevin Kerwin, Acting President and CEO of the Iroquois Healthcare Association, noted the program's timely introduction. "And that's where we're bringing people into the pipeline and getting them to stay for a little while and discover kind of their career by doing that," he said. "So this program has come along at exactly the right time."

To date, the 'Caring Gene' program has received over 1,800 requests for information, with 713 potential students in the pipeline and 276 students already enrolled. Dr. Trevor highlighted the program's broader impact, stating, "We all will at some time face needing access to healthcare and to have really competent caring individuals and staffing levels that are appropriate. I think it's gonna, everyone's gonna benefit from this."

In addition to Maria College, other participating institutions include Russell Sage, Schenectady County Community College, Saint Peter's Hospital School of Nursing, and Good Samaritan Hospital School of Nursing.

Virginia's UVA Health is one of five health systems nationwide selected to join a mobile care collaborative to share lessons learned and discover how to enhance the services provided by its mobile care unit.UVA Health is receiving a $10,000 grant from the Lowenstein Foundation to participate in the collaborative, which runs through October. The selected health systems will work with research and education group Essential Hospitals Institute to cover key topics that include building trust, increasing care capacity, financing and staffing.UVA Health's mobile care unit, which formally launched in January, can provide initial care and then help a patient establish care at a brick-and-mortar outpatient clinic; provide non-emergency care that can't wait for a scheduled visit; or serve as a patient's primary care provider.The mobile care unit's services include:• general health check-ups• chronic disease management• pediatric care• care for minor illnesses and injuries• women's health • lab tests

“There are very few of these mobile care units in the United States that provide primary care services,” said Novella W. Thompson, M.B.A., administrator of UVA Health's Population Health Department, in a statement. “Through the collaborative, we hope to share our lessons learned and best practices, as well as see how other health systems are focusing their services and measuring healthy outcomes for all.”

Besides UVA Health, the following hospitals are participating in the learning collaborative:• Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Va.: Primary Care Mobile Health Enhancement Project supports patients with transportation challenges or post-hospital care needs at home via its Family and Community Medicine Mobile Health team.• East Alabama Medical Center, Opelika, Ala.: Opelika Neighborhood Mobile Wellness Clinic provides free screenings and resources to underserved rural areas.• Huntsville Hospital Health System, Huntsville, Ala.: Vámonos: Making Healthcare Accessible to Non-English Speakers in Madison County Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) offers free preventive care in underserved Madison County communities.• WVU Medicine, Morgantown, W.Va.: Mobile Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Treatment (COAT) program ensures access to quality care in the state's rural areas.

The decision could throw cold water on potential copycat suits seeking to hold large, self-funded employers responsible if they overpay for prescription drugs.

The litigation against Wells Fargo is the second lawsuit accusing a large, self-funded employer of failing to bring down drug costs for their workers and acting as a poor steward of their healthcare dollars in violation of ERISA.

The first, filed against pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson in February 2024, sent shockwaves through the health benefits industry as it represented a new and potentially powerful legal argument that, if successful, could force companies to take a much more active role in controlling drug costs.

However, employee plaintiffs have yet to persuade the courts. A New Jersey judge dismissed the case against J&J in January, also determining the plaintiffs lacked standing. Now, the dismissal of the Wells Fargo case throws more cold water on the possibility of other copycat suits against employers in the future.

The lawsuit against Wells Fargo claimed that the international bank mismanaged its health plan, including by paying excessive administrative fees to Express Scripts, one of the “Big Three” U.S. PBMs.

In 2022, the plan paid over $25 million in administrative fees to Express Scripts, up from $9 million in 2019 — well above fees paid by other large Express Scripts clients, and despite Express Scripts' services remaining the same and enrollment in Wells Fargo's plan actually decreasing over that time, according to the complaint.

Wells Fargo also allowed Express Scripts to retain savings it negotiated with drugmakers, and agreed to require employees to fill some prescriptions at Accredo, a specialty mail pharmacy owned by Express Scripts, despite Accredo's higher prices, the complaint alleges.

As a result, Wells Fargo members paid higher costs for drugs that they could have gotten for much lower prices. In one example laid out in the complaint, Wells Fargo employees in its plan paid almost $10,000 for a 90-unit prescription for the generic multiple sclerosis drug fingolimod — even though the same prescription could be filled without insurance for about $650 to $900 at various retail pharmacies.

However, Judge Laura Provinzino agreed with Wells Fargo that the plaintiff's alleged harm was insufficient to confer standing.

The connection between Wells Fargo's administrative fees and what plan members had to pay for drugs is “tenuous at best,” Provinzino wrote in her order dismissing the case. In addition, examples of high costs for specific drugs are an unrepresentative subset of the thousands of drugs covered in the plans' full formulary, she said.

And, the plaintiffs' entitlement to their benefits was unchanged, regardless of any mismanagement on the part of Wells Fargo.

“While compelling and detailed, Plaintiffs' allegations are simply too speculative to show concrete individual harm, too tenuous to show causation, and too conjectural to show redressability,” Provinzino wrote, though she added later that “the Court is not unsympathetic to Plaintiff's concerns” and called their frustration with prescription drug costs “understandable.”

Wells Fargo did not take issue with the facts of the case. A spokesperson for Wells Fargo declined to comment on the case's dismissal and whether the bank's relationship with Express Scripts has changed since it was filed.

Provinzino dismissed the lawsuit without prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs can replead the case if they choose. The legal team for the plaintiffs did not respond to a request for comment by time of publication.

OAG Rejected Initial $1 Sale Proposal and Negotiated New Terms to Support Healthcare Services in DC, Including Plans for Potential Ward 5 Urgent Care Center & Millions of Dollars in Medical Equipment


Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb today announced that the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has negotiated and secured a revised proposal to sell the Providence Hospital campus — approximately 22 acres of Ward 5 property with buildings that have been mostly vacant for six years. The purchaser, Vision PH Associates (Vision PH), plans to develop hundreds of new housing units, including affordable units, on the campus which will help address the District's housing shortage. OAG's approval of the sale required the preservation of significant public health resources for the District, including $5 million in health services funding, plans for a new Ward 5 urgent care center on the Providence campus, and renewed use of millions of dollars in medical equipment. The deal will not affect health services currently offered in several campus buildings operated by providers other than Providence.

“Ward 5 residents made clear that this deal must balance the need for additional housing and community development with continued access to healthcare services. Today's agreement does exactly that — providing millions of dollars in public health resources and paving the way for significant residential and commercial expansion,” said Attorney General Schwalb. “As the District's independent Attorney General charged with protecting charitable assets, I am proud of the work we do with the business and nonprofit communities to secure the best possible outcomes for all Washingtonians. I want to thank the dozens of community members who came forward to make their voices heard, as well as the teams at Providence and Vision PH, whose cooperation in our review helped achieve a universally beneficial resolution.”

“Since taking office, I have focused on moving the Providence Redevelopment forward. I appreciate Attorney General Schwalb's partnership in these efforts by securing a deal that minimizes risks to the immediate Michigan Park community, maximizes benefits to the District, and creates a pathway for an inclusive development at this Ward 5 hub,” said Ward 5 Councilmember Zachary Parker. “I have heard loud and clear from residents that they want access to healthcare as part of the development, and I greatly appreciate that this deal includes plans for a new family urgent care center and maintaining healthcare facilities at the site. I look forward to working with community partners and city leaders to ensure the Providence Redevelopment delivers for Ward 5 neighbors.”

In 2023, Providence, a DC nonprofit healthcare entity, agreed to sell the Providence campus to Vision PH for $1 as part of a plan to redevelop the site with townhomes and multifamily apartments. Vision PH is a joint venture of real estate developers formed by EYA, LLC and Aroli Group LLC (known as the Menkiti Group).

The District's State Health Planning and Development Agency (SHPDA) asked OAG to review the proposed sale under DC's Healthcare Entity Conversion Act (HECA), which requires any conversion of a nonprofit healthcare entity's charitable assets to for-profit purposes to be adequately valued, protected, and preserved consistent with the nonprofit's stated public-interest mission. While HECA does not require that Providence continue to provide healthcare services on the campus, or that the campus be used to provide healthcare, it does require that the assets Providence uses to advance its nonprofit purpose—providing and supporting healthcare services—be protected and preserved for the benefit of the District and its residents. 

The OAG review process was especially critical for Providence's proposed conversion given that Ward 5 residents have frequently expressed the continuing need for healthcare services in the community. These concerns were reiterated by many residents during a public comment period that was part of the review process.

OAG's independent experts determined that the $1 purchase price that Providence initially agreed to sell the campus for did not reflect the true value of the campus — even accounting for the extensive, value-depleting demolition and remediation costs necessary to clear the campus for residential housing development. As a result, OAG concluded that the originally proposed sale would not adequately preserve Providence's charitable assets, which DC taxpayer dollars have supported for decades.

Following its evaluation, OAG informed Providence and Vision PH that it would only approve the proposed sale on certain conditions. Under these conditions, Providence and Vision PH have agreed to:

During redevelopment, Vision PH will facilitate continued operation of the healthcare services that remain on the campus. These services, which Providence does not provide, include a senior assisted living facility, a first responder clinic, and two medical office buildings offering a wide range of specialty and general practitioner care.

This matter was handled by Estefania Torres Paez, Cara Spencer, and Adam Gitlin, of the Antitrust and Nonprofit Section, and Alexandra Cain and Maximilian Tondro, of the Equitable Land Use Section, with the substantial support of paralegal, Leland Held, multiple legal interns, and other support staff.

Nurses from across North Carolina gathered in downtown Raleigh to push for changes to health care legislation Wednesday.Gov. Josh Stein kicked off the day with a speech to nurses gathered at the Raleigh Convention Center. He said many of the policy changes they're asking legislators to approve — such as better working conditions — are well-deserved, and he noted that his recent budget proposal suggested that lawmakers put more money into efforts to train nurses and create more jobs in health care."You provide critical medical expertise and build meaningful relationships with people who need them," Stein said. "You work day and night to care for North Carolinians who are scared, in pain and at one of the most vulnerable moments of their lives. The work that you do is so important. We want you to succeed. We need you to succeed."But not all of the asks nurses are putting to lawmakers enjoy broad political support inside the state legislature. Lobbying groups for nurses, doctors and hospitals are often at odds with one another — since changes that could help one group might come at the expense of the others.Following Stein's remarks, dozens of nurses flooded the state legislature to speak with state lawmakers, with plans to gather at Halifax Mall at 1 p.m. to advocate for legislation that would give advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) more authority to treat patients, a move supporters say would save on health care costs by cutting down on needless red tape.That suggestion has long been a top issue for nursing groups, and one that's deeply opposed by doctors' groups, who have succeeded in shooting it down in recent years.Intense lobbying, broad support, no votes: NC nursing bill in limboCurrently APRNs, who have a master's degree and, in some cases, a doctorate, need a supervising doctor before they can offer patients some services in North Carolina. House Bill 514 would allow APRNs, including certified registered nurse anesthetists, to handle everything they're licensed to do without supervision from doctors that, they say, is often supervision on paper alone.Nurses have to pay doctors for supervision under the current rules, and lobbying groups for doctors have spent years fighting against any proposal to undo those rules. Some doctors make tens of thousands of dollars a year from the fees.The push to undo those rules is backed by the North Carolina Nurses Association and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, including Sen. Gale Adcock, D-Wake, a nurse. The legislation has been introduced previously under the name the SAVE Act.The Nurses Association says undoing the rules could save North Carolinians more than $650 million annually on health care spending, while increasing patient access to high quality care — particularly in rural parts of the state, where there are few to no doctors.“I cannot think of many other bills that could save North Carolina this kind of money while actually improving the healthcare system," said Sen. Ralph Hise, R-Mitchell. "More than 25 other states have already passed APRN full practice authority – and it's been at least 20 years in some of those states – so I'm tired of hearing all these disingenuous arguments suggesting we need to study the issue a little longer."Groups that lobby on behalf of doctors, however, say they're concerned about risks to patient safety by letting people be treated by nurses instead of doctors."This General Assembly decided to require physician supervision of nurse practitioners so that people who are experiencing illness can be sure they have the best-trained and most-experienced health care team," North Carolina Medical Society CEO Steve Keene said Wednesday. "To dismantle that the way HB 514 does is not a good idea ... we support healthcare teams that include all providers practicing to the full extent of their training and experience, with physician leadership. "Nurses are also expected to meet with state lawmakers and attend committee hearings about several health care bills that passed through various committees Wednesday in the state Senate, including proposed bills on pricing transparency, practicing licenses and more psychiatric beds.Some of the health care policy changes advancing closer to a vote Wednesday included:Senate Bill 177, to add psychiatric hosptials to HASP, a program that gives additional funding to hospitals that are under-billed by Medicaid, if they agree to take efforts to forgive medical debt held by former patients.Senate Bill 316, a wide-ranging bill that would upend many laws governing hospitals and their billing practices to require more transparency, more protections from patients against being put into collections for unpaid medical debt, a repeal of some certificate-of-need laws, and more.Senate Bill 190, which would streamline the state's rules for physician assisstants to get permission to practice in North Carolina, which supporters say will make it easier for PAs in other states to move here for work.NC Senate looks to crack down on AI in health insurance, 'surprise billing' by hospitals

A special unit that began as a cold case task force recently helped secure a murder indictment against an active-duty airman accused of killing a missing Native American woman.

Quinterius Chappelle, 24, an aircraft inspection journeyman stationed at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, was indicted by a federal grand jury Thursday for the alleged murder of 21-year-old Sahela "Shy" Toka Win Sangrait, who friends and family told Fox News Digital was his girlfriend of about one year.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Missing and Murdered Unit (MMU) became involved in the case March 10, when a state lab confirmed a DNA sample from the body matched Sangrait, a registered tribal member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.

"At that point in time, our criminal investigators were notified and were brought online with it," MMU Regional Agent In Charge Robert Schoeberl told Fox News Digital in an interview Friday.

The unit originated as a cold case task force, part of operation "Lady Justice," a multi-agency initiative established by the Trump administration in 2019 to improve the functioning of the criminal justice system and address the staggering number of missing and murdered Native Americans in tribal communities, according to Schoeberl.

In February, the BIA announced the Office of Justice Services launched "Operation Spirit Return" in conjunction with MMU.

Homicide was among the top three most frequent causes of death among American Indian and Alaska Native females aged 15 to 24, as of 2019, according to data provided by the National Congress of American Indians. More than four in five indigenous women experience sexual violence in their lifetime.

The Not Invisible Act was also passed by Congress during Trump's first term in 2020, aimed at addressing the rampant number of missing persons and murder and trafficking of American Indian and Alaska Native peoples.

"President Trump is the president of law and order, and he is always working to deliver justice for victims of violent crime," White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

According to a redacted indictment, Chappelle, an airman basic who has been in the service since 2019, allegedly "unlawfully, and with premeditation and with malice aforethought" killed Sangrait at Ellsworth Air Force Base on or about Aug. 11, 2024.

The Pennington County Sheriff's Office said Sangrait, of Box Elder, was reported missing Aug. 10, just one day prior to when authorities claim she was killed.

Isabela Arroyo, Sangrait's sister, told Fox News Digital Chappelle was verbally abusive toward Sangrait, who had a one-way plane ticket to move in with Arroyo and her husband in Colorado Sept. 6.

Sangrait told Chappelle she was going to go to Colorado for the birth of Arroyo's son Sept. 27, her sister said. However, it is unclear if Chappelle found out about her plan to remain in Colorado.

"She never got on the plane," Arroyo said. "It was really hard. I had assumed that she had just chosen not to come anymore, and, unfortunately, that wasn't the case."

Sangrait's body, discarded in a wooded area near the Pennington and Custer County line, was discovered by a hiker March 4, about seven months after her disappearance.

The sheriff's office said the body was "badly decomposed" and there was "no identifying information available."

The cause of death has not yet been released.

Tayagonique McGloghlon, who met Sangrait in 2021 while participating in a program for young adults who recently aged out of foster care, told Fox News Digital the prospective nurse would call her every week, but, similar to Arroyo, the last she heard from Sangrait was Aug. 10.

"The last message I got from her was on Aug. 10, and she asked me if I was OK," McGloghlon said. "The day before that, I called her about three times. The third time I called, it went straight to voicemail — like her phone had been turned off for me, which I thought was really weird. … It put me off in a weird way."

McGloghlon said she tried sending Sangrait messages on social media, thinking maybe she had been blocked.

"I was like, 'That's not like her, especially when she always kept in contact with me,'" she said.

McGloghlon, who met Chappelle while he was dating one of her friends prior to Sangrait, said she always found him "a little bit weird" and "never liked him," but Sangrait only told her good things.

"I was devastated [when her remains were found]," McGloghlon said. "Honestly, I've never been more heartbroken. She's the light in this world. She didn't deserve that. … She was very spirited and such a good friend. She was a kind soul, just beautiful. I miss her so much. She was one of my best friends."

Cassidy Wimble, another one of Sangrait's friends, told Fox News Digital she had yet to meet Chappelle in person, but he was one of the first people she reached out to after the disappearance.

"He told me, 'I don't know anything. I wish we [could] find her,'" Wimble said. "He said the same thing to a few people."

MMU investigators collaborate with the federal National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) database and Othram, a Texas-based company that specializes in forensic genetic genealogy, to identify human remains.

"It's more advanced forensic testing, which a lot of the evidence from this case will run through," Schoeberl said."[Othram] tests relatives, basically identifying you through your family members' DNA. It's been very beneficial in solving and helping solve cases recently."

As part of the Sangrait investigation, the unit also interviewed witnesses, conducted searches and notified family of the death.

The MMU's Victim Services Program continues to provide the family with daily updates as the investigation continues, and the unit remains in close contact with the FBI and other agencies assisting with the case.

U.S. Attorney for the District of South Dakota Alison J. Ramsdell said prosecutors will pursue justice "relentlessly."

"The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of South Dakota will now proceed with the prosecution of this tragic case and relentlessly pursue justice on behalf of the victim," Ramsdell wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Arroyo said it helps to know her sister will get justice and Chappelle is now in custody, unable to harm anyone else.

"It's just how long he was able to walk around like nothing happened," Arroyo said. "He has already denied even knowing my sister. When they initially arrested him, he didn't say a word. He didn't even ask why he was being arrested."

Chappelle is being held by the U.S. Marshals Service at the Pennington County Jail in Rapid City, South Dakota.

Fox News Digital obtained a scheduling and case management order signed by U.S. District Judge Camela C. Theeler, noting a jury trial is set for May 27.

Attorney Gina Ruggieri, who filed a notice stating she would be representing Chappelle instead of his previously appointed public defender, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fort Ellsworth said it is working closely with area law enforcement agencies.

"First and foremost, our thoughts and prayers are with the friends and family of Sahela," Col. Derek Oakley, 28th Bomb Wing commander, previously told Fox News Digital when Chappelle was initially charged with second-degree murder in a federal criminal complaint. "We hold Airmen accountable for their actions, and if service members are found in violation of military or civilian law, they will be punished."

After the indictment, Fort Ellsworth officials, in response to a request for comment, referred Fox News Digital to the U.S. Attorney's Office of South Dakota, citing the jurisdiction change.

Wimble, who said she spoke with Sangrait every day, described her as one of the strongest people she knew.

"She was one of the most resilient people that I knew," Wimble said. "You could knock her down, and like bowling pins, she'd stand up every single time. … She was very strong, and she knew herself more than anybody. She was the kindest person I knew. Especially with all the things that she's gone through. … She's everything to me. … She really deserved a life."

The Air Force and Pennington County Sheriff's Office declined Fox News Digital's requests for comment.

The FBI and U.S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations did not immediately respond to inquiries from Fox News Digital.

A partnership bringing on-site healthcare services to senior living communities is focused on resident wellness, efficient care practices and less time in the hospital.

American House Senior Living Communities is partnering with senior living primary care provider Curana Health to bring on-site healthcare services to residents in 11 of its Tennessee communities. American House has more than 60 senior living communities throughout the Midwest, New England and the Southeast.

Through the arrangement, Curana will offer residents a wide range of concierge-style medical services, including routine preventive primary care, appointments for illness, around-the-clock clinical support access, care coordination and special care appointments, ongoing management of chronic conditions, medication management, and coordination of on-site phlebotomy and imaging services.

An American House spokesperson said the partnership enhances care collaboration with its team and outside providers, with quality as the main objective. The pivot allows American House caregivers to partner with providers focused on improving resident wellness, promoting efficient care practices, and keeping residents out of the hospital and in their homes.

“By partnering with Curana Health, American House is taking a transformative step toward enhancing the quality of care and support we provide to our residents,” Alex Germain-Robin, American House chief operations officer, said in a statement. “Together, we are dedicated to fostering a caring environment that prioritizes the well-being of each individual, ensuring better outcomes, improved health and a more compassionate approach to senior living.” 

After conducting its own internal due diligence, American House said that Curana was a good match for its mission and culture, according to the American House spokesperson. 

The program allows residents to use Curana Health's care team for primary or secondary care, allowing residents to continue seeing their established primary care provider for routine healthcare needs. Visits and services are covered by residents' health insurance and billed by Curana. 

American House also will participate in Curana Health's Medicare Shared Savings Program accountable care organization. American House said this action reinforces the mutual goal of improving outcomes and helping residents maintain their health and independence. American House said that the ACO enables its care team to partner with providers focused on resident wellness and outcomes.

According to Curana, its partners have experienced a 39% reduction in hospital readmissions, a 30% reduction in falls, 39% fewer instances of polypharmacy and 95% resident satisfaction.

Although the program rollout is confined to American House's Tennessee communities for now, the operator's spokesperson said that expanding to other markets “is not off the table.” The decision to launch in Tennessee was a strategic one, the spokesperson said, and American House said it is “thrilled” about the value the partnership will bring to residents and families.

INDIANAPOLIS (WPTA) - A bill aimed at lowering healthcare costs in Indiana has passed through the Health Committee.

BACKGROUND: New proposed bill to drop Indiana healthcare costs by as much as 40%

HB1004 could cause hospitals to lose their nonprofit status and the benefits that come with it unless they lower their prices.

It has called for the state's five big nonprofit hospitals to lower prices as much as 40%.

‘This isn't about hospital systems, this is about people': Indiana House bill aimed at lowering healthcare costs moves to Senate

Bill co-author Rep. Ben Smaltz (R – Auburn) has said it isn't about hospitals systems, “this is about people.”

Mirra Andreeva, the 11th seed, was aiming to complete the Sunshine Double after winning in Indian Wells but lost in the third round to Anisimova, who was later knocked out by Raducanu.

Serena Williams and Patrick Mouratoglou enjoyed real success together as the former won ten Grand Slam titles with the Frenchman by her side.

The American WTA legend won a record 23 Grand Slam titles during her tennis career, dominating the sport for almost 20 years.

Ten of those titles came under the guidance of French coach Mouratoglou, who joined her team in September, 2012.

Williams was never afraid to voice her opinions during her time on tour, once sharing her thoughts on the differences between men's and women's tennis.

43-year-old Williams said she would lose 6-0, 6-0 to Andy Murray if they ever played a match, as Mouratoglou now reveals what happened when the 23-time Grand Slam winner trained with ATP stars.

Mouratoglou recently took to Instagram, reacting to Williams' past comments on men's and women's tennis.

A post shared by THE COACH (@patrickmouratoglou)

“It's funny that it's coming from Serena [Williams] and that she says that men's and women's tennis are two different sports,” he said.

“That's true for mainly one reason: It's the fact that men are so much faster than women, movement-wise.

“Serena is talking about the power of men, but Serena was hitting with guys you know.

“When I was coaching her, she played many times with Grigor Dimitrov and [Stefanos] Tsitsipas; there was zero problem.

“Hitting from the centre of the court, hitting cross court, no problem, they were impressed by the way.

“When the movement was involved, then it was different and this I agree with her.”

Mouratoglou coached Williams, Dimitrov, and Tsitsipas, leading all three players to success on the ATP and WTA Tours.

The Frenchman then reflected on the potential match with Murray, as he hinted at an idea he has for mixed gender competition.

“We had the idea with Serena to play a match against Andy Murray and then we had also an idea on how to reduce the difference between men and women to make this match extremely competitive,” said Mouratoglou.

“I'm not saying what because I want to do it one day.”

Mouratoglou is keeping his cards close to his chest when discussing his mixed gender tennis competition idea, but there's plenty of evidence to suggest the 54-year-old knows how to innovate.

In 2020, Mouratoglou helped launch Ultimate Tennis Showdown [UTS], a modern ‘reinvention' of tennis that has since attracted some of the sport's biggest names.

The format is hardly recognizable for traditional fans of the ATP Tour, as players compete in ‘quarters' rather than ‘sets.'

Australia's Alex de Minaur won the UTS Grand Final in 2024, beating Holger Rune in the final, 3-0 [13-8] [14-11] [16-10].

12,500 fans are set to watch the next UTS event in Nimes on April 4, as three top ten players head to France.

It's fair to say Mouratoglou's UTS has been successful since its launch five years ago, as many will no doubt be interested to see what his ideas for a mixed gender competition look like.

World No. 2 Iga Swiatek has been granted extra security after an incident in which an unruly fan verbally abused her during a practice session at the Miami Open last weekend, according to a report by the BBC. The increase in security comes ahead of Swiatek's match on Wednesday, where the five-time world champion is set to face Alexandra Eala in the quarterfinals.

The spectator, who was characterized as "aggressive and taunting," allegedly shouted personal insults about Swiatek's family after previously having sent her abusive messages online. The BBC reports that Swiatek's team reported the incident, leading tournament organizers and the WTA to put extra security in place ahead of her match on Wednesday.

"Security is a top priority. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues," a spokesperson for Swiatek said. "Constructive  criticism is one thing, and threats, hate speech or even disturbance  during training is another -- this cannot be condoned."

The matter involving Swiatek comes on the heels of another incident in which fan behavior proved disturbing for a women's tennis star. At the Dubai Championships, a stoppage in play occurred after Emma Raducanu was frightened by the presence of a man who had been stalking her during her second round match, leading to enhanced security being put in place for her. The man in question has since been banned from all WTA tournaments.

ASICS is launching its most robust tennis capsule ever to commemorate the start of this year's European Tennis Tour. In collaboration with French fashion label A.P.C., the two parties have crafted a whopping fifty-piece collection comprised of on and off-court styles.

The exhaustive apparel lineup skews toward preppy 1970s tennis aesthetics, blending A.P.C.'s signature white/blue palette with ASICS' performance and lifestyle attire. ASICS athletes Alex de Minaur, Borna Coric, Lorenzo Musetti, Belinda Bencic, Harriet Dart and Jasmine Paolini will flaunt the collection throughout the European Tennis Tour.

Turning focus to the sneakers, the ubiquitous GEL-Kayano 14 is the lone off-court proposition. One colorway opts for white and metallic silver with brown gum soles, while the other features a navy/metallic silver upper, jointly echoing the apparel balance. On the performance side, A.P.C. touches up two of the foremost ASICS tennis models in the GEL-Resolution X and Solution Speed FF 3.

“We're excited to introduce our first-ever head-to-toe tennis collaboration and partnering with A.P.C. was the perfect match for this launch,” says Camille Eberhard, Director of Apparel at ASICS. “Our teams collaborated closely to bring this vision to life, balancing style and performance to inspire confidence on the court. For the on-court collection, our goal was to design apparel that helps players feel their best, ready to experience the powerful uplift of movement on the mind. It seamlessly blends timeless aesthetics with our industry-leading performance technology. The off-court range, designed by A.P.C., extends this philosophy beyond the game, embracing an active lifestyle in everyday life.”

The ASICS x A.P.C. tennis collaboration releases April 5th via asics.com, apcstore.com and select ASICS and A.P.C. stores worldwide. See detailed images of the footwear below and visit our Sneaker Release Dates page to preview more upcoming ASICS.

MIAMI — Scour the records. Sift through the score sheets from matches the past few months all over the world, in Trnava, Slovakia, or Bengaluru, India, or Takasaki, Japan.

Other than five consecutive wins in January at a minor tournament in Canberra, Australia, there is little to suggest the immediacy of what has been a breakout week for Alexandra Eala. Yet here she is to take on Iga Swiatek, the most mercilessly dominant women's player of the last three years, in the quarterfinals of the Miami Open — a WTA 1,000 event, just below the level of a Grand Slam.

Advertisement

Eala, 19, is in a place no player from the Philippines has ever been. No wonder her parents are flying in for the match.

The trailblazing, though, might be the easiest thing for Eala to deal with. She's been breaking ground for tennis players from her country — an archipelago of 7,641 islands and more than 110 million people — for a while now.

Eala was the first to win the Les Petits As, the premier international tournament for kids aged between 12 and 14. She was the first to win a junior Grand Slam, at the 2022 U.S. Open. She's the first to get to the cusp of the top 100.

“It's prepared me to take this in, step by step,” Eala said during an interview underneath Hard Rock Stadium on Monday evening.

Minutes before, Eala had heard the news that Paula Badosa had withdrawn from their round-of-16 match with a back injury. She had to figure out whether she was going to watch Swiatek play Elina Svitolina later in the evening.

She was on the fence. It was the second match of the evening session, and would likely finish after midnight. Perhaps getting some rest might serve her better. She'd never done this sort of thing before.

“A lot of new experiences,” she said.

Eala began her stay in Miami with a solid win over the American Katie Volynets, a scrambler with a sneaky hard knockout punch when she needs it. Then she beat the mercurial 2017 French Open champion, Jelena Ostapenko, in two tight sets. That was her first win over a top-30 player. It was also the first win over a top-30 player for a Filipino player since WTA rankings were first published in 1975.

Then she backed it up by beating Madison Keys, the reigning Australian Open champion and world No. 5, 6-4, 6-2. Two top-30 wins and one top-5 win for Eala; the same for the Philippines.

Keys makes her home in Florida and hits something close to the biggest ball in women's tennis. Her forehand was too big for top-10 men's player Casper Ruud to handle at times during a mixed-doubles exhibition before the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif.

Eala used her legs to get her feet behind Keys' shots. She absorbed the power, took aim at the lines and sent Keys on the run in the style of Mirra Andreeva, another teenager who has toppled bigger and more powerful foes lately.

“I knew that she was a great player, I knew that she was a big hitter,” Eala said after the match. “I had to keep my legs on and take the opportunities that I could find.”

Eala owes this Miami Open opportunity to one of the quirks of her sport: the wildcard entry, which allows the owners of tournaments to give a handful of spots at each event to players who would otherwise have to get in through a qualifying competition, if they can even qualify for it.

IMG, the sports and entertainment conglomerate, owns the Miami Open and represents Eala. The company usually awards spots in the tournament's main draw to some of its promising young players. This year, Eala got one of the golden tickets.

But then she actually had to do something with it, just as she had before. She was born with athletic genes and financial resources. Her mother was a top swimmer in the Philippines and an executive with a leading telecommunications company there. There are plenty of children born with that sort of pedigree. Few of them take the chance to become a top tennis player like Eala has done now, especially in a country where basketball rules the sporting roost.

She has won several medals at the Asian Games, earning bronze in 2023 after losing out in the semifinals to Zheng Qinwen, who would win gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

“Growing up, it was tough,” Eala said after beating Keys. “You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course, you had many people to look up to around the world, but I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step.”

It was her family that brought her to the court. Eala's grandfather, a tennis buff, introduced all his grandchildren to the sport at his local club. Alexandra and her older brother, Miko, who went to play at Pennsylvania State University, took to it most.

“I never saw myself doing anything else that wasn't tennis,” Eala said. “I saw as I grew that I was getting better and better, and I saw that I always had the potential to make it.”

The first hint arrived when she was 12, with the win at Les Petits As. It earned her a scholarship to the Rafael Nadal Academy in Spain. Her brother got a spot, too, which helped her adjust to leaving her parents at 13 to live in a dormitory on the other side of the world.

“To be there on a scholarship was something that I was not thinking about at all,” she said. “I knew that this is what I wanted to do, so that was a good step towards becoming a professional.”

Nadal has been posting his congratulations to her on social media the past week.

Even after she won the junior U.S. Open title, though, Eala knew she had a long road ahead.

Things can change fast in the career of a tennis player. Sometimes, the door cracks open and a new big thing storms through it, but Eala pushed back against any sort of radical transformation taking place. She knows that there are few overnight sensations these days. Andreeva is the youngest player in the top 100 and she only has one more teenager for company, Australia's Maya Joint. Eala, at No. 102 in the live rankings thanks to her Miami run, will be hoping to join them soon.

“I'm the same person that I was two weeks ago,” she said. “It's a big step definitely, but I cannot assume that it's solidified. I just have to keep my head down, keep working, and results will come if I continue on this path.”

The path has suddenly become a lot more fun, which is plenty important, but not entirely the point, especially with Swiatek on the horizon. She's seen her close-up before: the five-time Grand Slam champion was the guest of honor when Eala graduated from Nadal's academy. Now she is a rival like all the rest, in unfamiliar territory for Eala.

“I've never been in a major tournament this long, so I'm definitely enjoying that,” she said. “But I'm still hungry, and I'm still motivated.”

            Gaby Dabrowski enjoyed some of the most memorable victories of her tennis career last year, and did it all while quietly navigating a personal health crisis.
    


            It was only on New Year's Eve that Dabrowski, one of the world's top doubles players, revealed that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer in April. Suddenly, everything she had achieved throughout 2024 – an Olympic bronze medal in mixed doubles and her victory at the season-ending WTA Finals – was cast in a new light, instantly more remarkable than it first appeared.
    


            At one point in her recovery, just two weeks before the start of the grass-court season, Dabrowski couldn't even toss the ball into the air for a serve. Unable to lift her left arm high enough, she instead got her coach to throw it up for her during practice sessions.
    


            But fast-forward a couple of months and the Canadian was in Paris with an Olympic bronze medal around her neck, finally celebrating a childhood dream fulfilled.
    


            Arguably more impressive was that Dabrowski and partner Erin Routliffe had been runners-up in the mixed doubles at Wimbledon just a few weeks before, all while the 32-year-old had put further cancer treatment on hold to continue competing.
    


            The success, Dabrowski thinks, came alongside a change in perspective brought about by her cancer diagnosis – a new and welcome appreciation for the life she was leading.
    


            “I really felt like it was such a cool thing to be able to play tennis as my profession, and I felt very grateful for the opportunity to be able to do that,” she tells CNN Sports.
    


            “What I noticed is the results that I had last year didn't come because I wanted them, they came because I was enjoying what I was doing … really finding this joy in an achievement that came not from dreaming about it at night necessarily, but from sticking to my process of how I wanted to improve my tennis.”
    


            This was especially true during the Paris Olympics, when Dabrowski endured a period of bad health on her way to winning bronze in the mixed doubles alongside Félix Auger-Aliassime.
    


            That tournament was never centered around getting a medal; it was about simply getting through “a couple of really tough days,” Dabrowski says.
    


            “Honestly, I went to sleep thinking about how I was going to survive the next day,” she adds. “What I was going to try to eat, hopefully I would sleep well, and if I didn't, how I would manage that. I broke things down into very small, achievable wins … And then a good result came.”
    


            Dabrowski's cancer journey really began in the spring of 2023 when she noticed a lump in her left breast. A doctor around that time told her not to worry about it, so she didn't.
    


            However, during a physical provided by the WTA, the governing body of women's tennis, the following year, another doctor encouraged Dabrowski to get the lump scanned. What came next felt like a whirlwind: a mammogram, an ultrasound, then a call from the radiologist urging her to get a biopsy immediately.
    


            “It turned grim very quickly,” says Dabrowski. But it equally didn't take long for things to become more positive.
    


            “I eventually got good news after good news after good news in terms of my staging, the size of the tumor, my Oncotype DX scoring which determines if you need chemo or not,” she adds.
    


            “I didn't need chemo because my score was low enough and I didn't have any spread through my lymph nodes. So I kind of was just in this mode of: ‘Okay, this was scary, but I'm also super grateful that I'm handling this quickly and I'm still at an early stage.'”
    


            The WTA, backed by medical technology company Hologic, offers annual health screenings for players on the Tour, which this year took place at the ongoing Miami Open. They examine, among other things, body composition, bone density, pelvic health, mental health, and Ob-Gyn issues like fertility and postpartum recovery.
    


            Players are also offered blood work, skin checks, cardiology tests and internal medicine with Mayo Clinic physicians.
    


            “We have not a lot of time when we're traveling – let alone being able to see our doctors, being able to get checkups,” world No. 4 Jessica Pegula told CNN en Español's Elizabeth Pérez at the Miami Open. “Our schedule's so all over the place so being able to come here and to do that before a tournament is great.”
    


            Pegula also said that she had spoken to women's health specialists through the WTA about the option to freeze her eggs. “I'm 31,” she explained, “so that's something that interested me, knowing that I don't really know what I'm going to do, but the window of having a kid gets smaller and smaller as you get older.”
    


            As for Dabrowski, she feels grateful to have such resources at her disposal, ultimately leading to her early-stage diagnosis. Now, she wants to help spread awareness for breast cancer – a big reason for sharing her story when she did.
    


            “I really wanted women to be able to know that, even though something like cancer is scary, if you get whatever you have checked out early, and you can handle it, breast cancer has a 99% chance of survival,” says Dabrowski.
    


            “And that was the first messaging that I saw on the flyer when I walked into the office for my mammogram: breast cancer is 99% survivable.”
    


            The past year in Dabrowski's life also demonstrates how it is possible to thrive, and not just survive, during intense treatment for health issues. Cancer became curiously intertwined with her tennis career, providing added motivation to get back on the court with a new appreciation for the sport
    


            “In the beginning, I wasn't sure what my future would hold, not just in tennis, but my life in general,” she says. “I didn't know if I was able to play again, when that would be, what my schedule might look like; would I have to play fewer tournaments? What would that mean for my ranking, my position financially?
    


            “But then over time, I would say probably a month and a half after my diagnosis when I'd had a lot of answers to a lot of the questions I had about coming back to play, I really had this itch to want to return.”
    


            The cancer diagnosis has forced Dabrowski to take care of her body with meticulous attention to detail. That means making incremental improvements to her diet – avoiding sugar, processed foods, and anything that might cause inflammation – her sleep, and her physiotherapy.
    


            Dabrowski has always taken tennis seriously and always will for the duration of her career. But while dialing in on how she treats her body, she's noticed a new, almost liberating, mindset appear – one that allows her to approach the game in a more positive and forgiving way.
    


            Now, winning still feels good but the losses don't hurt quite as much as they used to.
    


            “Although tennis has been all-encompassing from a very young age for me, I don't feel like it's the number one thing about who I am as a person, and I no longer attach my identity to my performance,” Dabrowski says to CNN.
    


            “I'm able to take this life a little bit lighter, I feel like that's where good results come; and even if they don't come, I'm okay with them.”
    


            That's a special position to be in, especially when you consider that Dabrowski, around about this time last year, thought that she might never be able to play tennis again. But she's back on the court now, appreciating the life of a professional athlete more than ever before.

With the BNP Paribas Open underway in Palm Desert less than two months after devastating fires swept through Los Angeles, the WTA and WTA Foundation mobilized quickly to support affected tennis communities -- with WTA Legends Alexandra Stevenson and Gigi Fernandez leading the charge.

When Palisades Charter High School burned down, Stevenson, who coaches six of the school's players, knew immediately how badly the girls' and boys' varsity teams had been impacted, many without home courts, and some without homes.

Working with Palisades coach Bud Kling and WTA Foundation Executive Director Ann Austin, Stevenson organized a trip for both teams to attend the BNP Paribas Open on March 7. World No. 5 Madison Keys stopped by for photos and autographs, while Maria Sakkari and Austin, on behalf of the WTA Foundation, presented a $10,000 donation to support the displaced students.

“It was so important for these players to receive positive support after nearly two months without any normalcy in their lives,” Stevenson said. “Seeing the best players in the world compete at the BNP Paribas Open was uplifting and energizing.”

Meanwhile, Gigi Fernandez partnered with the WTA Foundation to raise $50,000 -- including a $10,000 pledge from USTA Southern California -- to help rebuild the Palisades Tennis Center and assist the fire-ravaged Altadena community.

“When I learned what had happened in the Los Angeles area, I was compelled to act,” Fernandez said. “Less than six months ago, my house was flooded and my car lost in back-to-back hurricanes. Ironically, just before that I'd started planning a nonprofit,  so I followed through and created one to help disaster victims.”

While filing for 501(c)(3) status for her new nonprofit, "Tennis for Hope," Fernandez partnered with the WTA Foundation as a fiscal sponsor to begin raising funds.

At a ceremony in the WTA suite at Indian Wells, Fernandez -- joined by Hall of Famer Pam Shriver -- presented Palisades Tennis Center Director Mike Tomas with a check for $25,000 to support the rebuild. She also announced a second $25,000 commitment to aid the Altadena tennis community.

“The WTA Foundation's mission is to change lives,” Austin said. “We responded immediately to provide both financial and emotional support to those whose lives have been changed forever by these fires.”

Iga Swiatek has gone on to reach the Miami Open quarter-finals following the incident

Five-time major champion Iga Swiatek is being protected by increased security after an "aggressive and taunting" fan verbally abused her at the Miami Open.

Swiatek, 23, was targeted by the man in a practice session on Saturday.

It is believed the man shouted personal insults about Swiatek's family.

The world number two's representatives told BBC Sport the man had previously sent abusive online messages to her through social media.

"The Miami incident appears to be a direct transition from verbal aggression online to harassment in the real world," the Polish player's team said.

"He was aggressive and taunting."

Swiatek's representatives added the incident was immediately reported to tournament organisers.

Her experience comes a month after Britain's Emma Raducanu was targeted by a stalker at the Dubai Tennis Championships.

'Every woman has fear' - why risks facing female athletes remain

Swiatek recently spoke out about the emotional toll she has faced in recent months, having served a one-month ban for a doping offence and not wanting to "step on the court".

Since the incident at the weekend, the second seed has gone on to reach the Miami Open quarter-finals, where she faces Filipino teenager Alexandra Eala on Wednesday.

"Security is a top priority. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues," her spokesperson said.

"Constructive criticism is one thing, and threats, hate speech or even disturbance during training is another - this cannot be condoned."

Tournament organisers and the WTA are said to have reacted quickly, putting extra security measures in place around the former long-time world number one.

Miami Open organisers told BBC Sport the safety and security of everyone at the tournament is treated "extremely seriously".

"We constantly evaluate any potential threats and take every measure to respond appropriately," they said in a statement.

Those comments were echoed by the WTA, who said "comprehensive" security protocols are in place to ensure any incidents are dealt with "promptly and effectively".

"The details of these are not something we discuss publicly, but we are steadfast in our commitment to maintaining a safe environment for players and everyone attending one of our events," said the WTA.

Swiatek's experience is the latest incident involving a WTA player, providing a stark reminder of the dangers faced by female athletes on a regular basis.

Raducanu, 22, recoiled in horror when she saw a man - who she had already reported for what was described as "exhibiting fixated behaviour" - in the stands of her match in Dubai last month.

Stephanie Hilborne, the chief executive of the Women in Sport charity, told BBC Sport that "every single woman has a level of fear".

Emma Raducanu is back in Grand Slam-winning form and is aiming for a spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open on Wednesday 11pm when she takes on home favourite Jessica Pegula; watch all the action from Miami on Sky Sports Tennis, Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Wednesday 26 March 2025 10:41, UK

Emma Raducanu will take on Jessica Pegula in the quarter-finals of the Miami Open in arguably the biggest match of her career since winning the 2021 US Open.

Her best run since being crowned US Open champion at the age of 18 continued as she brushed aside American 17th seed Amanda Anisimova in straight sets.

Raducanu did not drop a point on her serve in the first set, which underpinned an impressive performance that saw her move into the top 50 of the world rankings.

"I've come a long way in the last week since Indian Wells [where Raducanu lost in the first round]," she told Sky Sports Tennis.

"I wasn't necessarily feeling great about my tennis, about everything, but this week I have some really good people around me who I trust and who I have fun with off the court, and that is extremely important.

"When I play my best I am definitely authentic, true to myself and creative. I feel when I am boxed into a regimented way then I am not able to express myself in the same way. So I'm happy with how I realised that this week."

Earlier this month, Raducanu ended her coaching trial with Vladimir Platenik after just two weeks following her first-round exit from Indian Wells, saying it "wasn't quite heading in the right direction".

Currently looking for a permanent presence in her box alongside fitness trainer Yutaka Nakamura, Raducanu has found a short-term solution in working alongside Jane O'Donoghue, her childhood mentor and former LTA coach, and Mark Petchey, a former coach of Andy Murray and commentator and broadcaster on the Tennis Channel.

The 22-year-old admits feeling "comfortable" and "relaxed" in her new environment where she is able to express herself on and off the court.

She said: "I think I'm playing better than in Australia this year. Circumstances change all the time, but for me the biggest thing I'm proud of is just finding the competitive spirit and being there for every ball and drawing that out of myself. I think that's kind of been missing in the last few months and even few years at times.

"I think that's the biggest win for me, just feeling a lot of hunger, feeling on the court competitive, wanting to run down every ball, and that's the biggest win I would say from this week."

For the second time in her career, Emma Raducanu has won four matches at a WTA level tournament:
2021 US Open
2025 Miami Open

Raducanu has now won four matches in a row for the first time since that incredible victory in New York and it is the first time she has reached the last-eight of a WTA 1000 event.

Petchey is a former Davis Cup player for Great Britain who was involved in Raducanu's development as a teenager in the years before her US Open victory.

"There's more switching on and off, rather than be 'on' the entire time," explained Raducanu.

"I'm someone who works really hard and can be really intense, but sometimes too intense. It's harder to be extremely focused when you need to be on the match court because you're focused from the first minute to the last.

"So I think just being able to switch off and have fun with them and play Spikeball before the match, and we just create certain routines. They bring small doses of happiness that I guess just keep you going, the small things."

Raducanu also explained her reasons why there is a sense of trust and synergy in the team following the exit of Platenik after a brief stint.

She said: "He is a great coach. He's so experienced. He's worked with so many players and brought them up to the top and developed players. I respect him a lot as a coach.

"It just wasn't right at the time and I'm not sure going forward, but I think this week was a great eye-opener to when I'm happy and expressive and myself.

"Just having people that I've known for a very long time, since before the US Open, and just those familiar faces is the most valuable thing, for this week at least.

"It's difficult because I just met him and it's difficult to kind of build many years of connection straight away."

Raducanu added: "I wasn't feeling great after Indian Wells, but to come to Miami - and then after I stopped with Vlado - to just have familiar faces, people that I knew, people that have really gone through the trenches with me, but also can kind of lift me up at the same time, I think made a big difference.

"Just having them around, people that I really trust, I think that's probably when I started feeling a bit better off the court. That translated on the court. I was freer."

Raducanu explained the differences in her warm-up routine, which her team have adjusted in Miami, to help make the Bromley star more relaxed ahead of her matches.

"I think before even the first half of the first section of this year, I would be so locked in," said Raducanu, who is on the brink of becoming British No 1 again should she reach the semi-finals in Miami.

"Every warm-up would be an hour long. It would just be not much talking, just so focused. A lot of long tennis sessions, long gym sessions and just long days all the time. Then by the time I played the match, I was quite tired.

"I think that's something that we adjusted this week, bringing more fun elements into it, shortening certain things in warm-ups and just adding things that are outside the box.

"To warm up, for example, not just running up and down in a straight line, which can be a bit more tedious, and just playing a game and playing three different sports before we warm-up, getting a good sweat on, laughing. Then you go onto the court feeling a lot more relaxed and every part of you is just looser.

"I think it's worked so far this week. It's definitely a note to take home for me."

Tim Henman says Raducanu has shown "some really positive signs" ahead of her crunch meeting with last year's US Open finalist, Pegula.

The former world No 4 told Sky Sports: "First and foremost we're a results-based industry here and it's the fact that she's been on court competing and winning. I think that second match against [Emma] Navarro, to come through in those circumstances, she played some brilliant tennis. Navarro served for the match but Emma kept digging deep and found a way to get the job done.

"You reflect on the tournament schedule this year. She's played a lot of tournaments and I think that's a big positive. She hasn't had the results but just the fact that she's out there competing, she doesn't seem to be picking up those little injuries that have set her back so I think she's reaping the rewards for a lot of hard work on the court, in the gym, working on that fitness."

Physical trainer Yutaka Nakamura, who has previously worked with Maria Sharapova and Naomi Osaka, was added to the team to help improve Raducanu's physical robustness and athletic potential and the signs are looking positive.

"In the big picture, it's still very early days," said Henman. "They've only been working a matter of months. Normally you're talking a matter of years for a relationship to build. That foundation of the physical work but also the trust and understanding of Emma's body so I think there are some really positive signs. I really think Emma's in a good place."

Raducanu and Pegula have split their two previous meetings. Pegula won in straight sets on the hard courts of Cincinnati in 2022, but Raducanu posted an upset win on grass at Eastbourne last year.

Novak Djokovic cruises into the Miami Open quarter-finals with a 6-2 6-2 win over Italy's Lorenzo Musetti; watch all the action from the ATP and WTA Tours on Sky Sports Tennis and Sky Sports+, NOW and the Sky Sports app

Novak Djokovic won 12 of the last 14 games of his match against Lorenzo Musetti to crush the Italian 6-2 6-2 and move into the quarter-finals of the Miami Open in his best performance since the Australian Open.

The momentum in the rain-delayed match seemed to swing in Djokovic's favour when he complained to the chair umpire in the opening set over a serve-clock warning.

That frustration seemed to spark the Serbian, who broke the next game for a 4-2 lead and never looked back in the presence of an adoring crowd that included tennis greats Serena Williams and Juan Martin del Potro.

"I was star-struck. It was amazing to see first DelPo, obviously a long-time friend and a rival, so happy to have him around and get his support from the box," Djokovic said.

"It was amazing, it was (the) first time to have DelPo in the box, so I want to thank him really for coming. And Serena, that was a surprise."

Six-time Miami champion Djokovic crushed an exquisite backhand winner for a 5-2 second-set lead and sealed the win when Musetti double-faulted on match point.

"Actually, when I had that down-the-line passing shot, I pointed to her (Williams) and asked her whether it was OK," he added.

"She said, 'yeah, it was fine'. If Serena says it was fine, then it was amazing by everyone else's standards."

Fresh off a record 411th ATP Masters 1000 victory in his last match, Djokovic was slow out of the gates against Musetti as the Italian went up 2-0 in the first set.

A hold of serve was all the Serbian fourth seed needed to turn the match around, rattling off six straight games to claim the first set in 40 minutes.

The second set provided much of the same as Musetti was simply outmatched by his 37-year-old opponent, Djokovic wrapping up the win in one hour and 23 minutes.

Speaking to Sky Sports' Gigi Salmon, Djokovic said: "I think the level is really good. It's my best match of the tournament and for me what I like to see as I progress through a tournament is raising the level of tennis and that's what's happening.

"Overall it was a great performance, phenomenal to have Serena courtside. I think it was the first time, maybe the second time she's watched me live so I was a bit nervous. Del Potro as well, long-time rival and friend in the box, so I had to deliver."

The 37-year-old also gave an interesting insight into the working environment alongside Andy Murray, saying: "We don't know each other as people that well.

"We shared the same stage on the tour for a very long time - we've known each other maybe 25 years since the junior days, but when you're rivals you don't interact as much and actually before the match today we sat down waiting for matches to restart because of the rain delay, so we had a very interesting talk.

"I always had tremendous respect for Andy as a player but now even more so as a person. Such a nice guy and I'm really grateful he cares about me, that he cares about me doing well on the court.

"It's still surreal in some sense that one of my biggest rivals is my coach. He's pumping and jumping around the box, sometimes I kind of pinch myself and think, 'is this real? Is this a dream?' So it's great.

"We're trying to get the most out of this relationship as a player-coach and also spend some quality time together. I think Miami has been really good. We were here early - a week before the tournament started - so we played some golf, we enjoyed some dinners together and we're having fun."

Djokovic will take on Sebastian Korda in the next round after the American beat Gael Monfils 6-4 2-6 6-4.

Musetti's compatriot Matteo Berrettini had a better day on Tuesday, eclipsing Australian 10th seed Alex de Minaur 6-3 7-6 (11-9) to set up a clash with home favourite Taylor Fritz.

Meanwhile, top seed Aryna Sabalenka battled past China's Qinwen Zheng 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals of the women's tournament.

"Always tough battles against her," Sabalenka said after extending her head-to-head record against Zheng to 6-0. "Today I had to work really hard, especially in that second set. I'm really proud of the way I handled my emotions.

"Even when something didn't work well, I was there and I was fighting for every point."

She will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in the next round, after the sixth seed conquered Magda Linette of Poland in straight sets.

Miami is filled with players who are shaking off slow starts to 2025. You can add Djokovic and Korda, who will play the last match of the night session on Wednesday, to that list. Coming into this tournament, neither had won a match since the Australian Open in January.Now here they are in the quarterfinals. Korda has beaten a Top 10 opponent in Stefanos Tsitsipas, and survived a three-setter, and a long rain delay, against Gael Monfils. Djokovic has yet to drop a set, and on Tuesday he was in vintage cruise control in a 6-2, 6-2 win over Lorenzo Musetti, a player who has pushed him to the limit on a couple of occasions before.

Djokovic and Korda have played once, in the Adelaide final in 2023, and it was good one. The Serb escaped 6-4 in the third, but Korda used that performance to launch himself into the second week at the Australian Open soon after.In this meeting, Djokovic is the steadier rally player, which means that Korda will likely have to take chances and be the aggressor to win. Korda has a penetrating forehand and an excellent two-handed backhand; how much damage can he do, and how well can he combine pace with consistency, over the course of two or three sets? A win is there for the taking for Korda, but I'll say Djokovic will make it a little too high a hill to climb. Winner: Djokovic—Steve Tignor👉 Click here for more news on the Miami Open.

It isn't often we see someone ranked 140th in the world in the quarterfinals of a WTA 1000. But Eala is a pathbreaker in more ways than one.The 19-year-old is also, already, the highest-ranked player ever from the Philippines, and one of the only ones currently on tour. The lefty has spent most of her brief career on the ITF circuit, but a wild card got her in the door in Miami, and she has made the most of it, upsetting two of the WTA's biggest hitters, Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys, back to back. Beating Ostapenko is something that Swiatek can't claim to have done yet.

Can Eala make it three power-player victims in a row? She has some of the traits of her fellow lefty—and half-Filipino—Leylah Fernandez. Neither is tall, but they make up for it by playing close to the baseline and taking every ball they can on the rise. That's not an easy way to win, especially against Swiatek, who is No. 2 in the world, a past champion in Miami, and who hits with a heavy, bouncy topspin that can be hard to time.Swiatek has played some tight sets in her three matches in Miami, but hasn't lost any of them so far. She should be able to attack Eala's serve, but she may have to deal with Eala doing the same to her second serve. I'll just finish by saying that Swiatek and Fernandez have played twice, and Iga has lost a total of five games. Winner: Swiatek—Steve Tignor

The Serbian went on a nine-game run and booked a quarterfinal spot with a 6-2, 6-2 rout of Lorenzo Musetti.ByTENNIS.comPublished Mar 26, 2025 copy_link

Published Mar 26, 2025

Six-time Miami Open champion Novak Djokovic soared into the quarterfinals on Tuesday evening, with a fellow GOAT watching in the stands and a beloved champion sitting in his box.Facing Lorenzo Musetti on a Tuesday plagued by rain, Djokovic picked apart the 15th seed, 6-2, 6-2, to secure his eighth last eight appearance in the Magic City and first since the event relocated to Hard Rock Stadium. Serena Williams was among those in attendance, with Juan Martin del Potro enjoying the atmosphere directly behind the Serbian's current coach and fellow major winner Andy Murray.“It was great to have Serena courtside, and Del Potro in my box, and Andy as my coach,” Djokovic told journalists afterward with a grin. “It was a bit star-studded, to be honest!“When I saw Serena in particular, I was like, oof! I'm very happy, but I'm also nervous. I gotta come up with my best performance.”

I'm very happy, but I'm also nervous. I gotta come up with my best performance.”

Down 0-2 to start, Djokovic grabbed full control by reeling off the next nine games—in part by turning a time violation issued by chair umpire Fergus Murphy during the fifth game into significantly increased speeds on his first serve and forehand.As clean as a backhand crosscourt pass one can hit secured a 4-2 advantage and the 37-year-old poured it on by building a strong rhythm on his serve.Musetti lifted his arms in the second set after saving a pair of break points to stop the bleeding at 0-3. Up 4-1, 0-15, Djokovic put his iconic jets on full display via north and south movement and after Musetti netted the open put-away, looked at Williams with a point to his knees.Two games later, Djokovic locked up the victory when Musetti double-faulted. He paid tribute to del Potro by imitating his takeback forehand in celebration.

"I'm very happy with my performance, my attitude on the court," Djokovic said. "I always try to be aggressive, didn't want to really give him a chance to come back. He's a very dangerous player if you give him time. A very talented player on all surfaces, he's proven that over the last few years..."I had a slightly slower start in the first two or three games. (I needed to) get the engines going, but once I won that close fourth game to break back, I never looked back. I won from 0-2 down, I think, nine games in a row."A round earlier, Djokovic set the record for most wins at the 1000 level when he surpassed Rafael Nadal with 411. The Belgrade native is bidding to lift his 100th career trophy and can move within two wins of achieving that milestone if he advances past Sebastian Korda.The No. 24 seed fended off Gael Monfils, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4, to avenge his Indian Wells defeat to the Frenchman. In January 2023, Korda held a championship point on Djokovic before the legend battled back to clinch the Adelaide crown.

Briton is looking a tougher athlete but can still learn lessons from her quarter-final opponent, Jessica Pegula

Jessica Pegula began her professional tennis journey with a head start on most of her peers. In a sport as prohibitively expensive as elite tennis, her family wealth – her billionaire parents own several sports franchises, including the NFL's Buffalo Bills – afforded her unfettered access to equipment and knowledge. Her career, however, has come to signify something else altogether.

At the age of 22, Pegula was still fluttering in and out of the top 150, stuck on the lower rungs of the ITF circuit and simply trying to figure things out. Pegula did not break into the top 100 until a couple of weeks before her 25th birthday in February 2019 and even then it seemed as if she was light years away from ever becoming a top player. She failed countless times before she began to soar.

Today, Pegula has established herself as a veteran top 10 player and one of the most reliable members of the sport's elite. Her success was not the result of a dramatic overnight shift – she built her confidence and convictions through her daily work and resilience over a significant period of time.

On Wednesday in Miami, Pegula will face Emma Raducanu in what is now undoubtedly the best tournament of Raducanu's career outside her fateful US Open title run in 2021. After defeating one top-10 American player in Emma Navarro, Raducanu now has the opportunity to measure herself against one of the best in the world in her first WTA 1000 quarter-final.

Although she remains a clear underdog, the Briton should not be afraid. Their two previous matches have both been tight. Pegula won their first and only hard-court meeting in two tough sets at the Cincinnati Open in 2022, but last summer Raducanu defeated Pegula in three gruelling sets on home soil in Eastbourne to finally clinch her first top‑10 win.

The pair share some similarities. Both possess smooth, compact strokes off each wing, effortless two-handed backhands and excellent timing, which they use to take the ball early and take time away from their opponent. Both relish smothering rivals with vicious early service returns. Only one of them, however, has come close to directing those assets into consistent winning tennis over a long period.

Pegula particularly thrives in fast conditions and few players are as adept at deflecting the power generated by her foes. One of the biggest ­challenges for Raducanu will be to find the right balance between imposing herself by ­playing ­offensive tennis and also keeping Pegula uncomfortable by mixing up the speed and trajectory of her ball.

The 22-year-old has done a great job this week of frustrating opponents with her backhand slice and defence, but Pegula is a level above them all.

Alongside improvements to her serve, forehand and movement, Raducanu's three months of work with her new fitness coach, Yutaka Nakamura, the one person who has accompanied her throughout the year, appear to be paying off. She looks like a considerably stronger and more durable athlete.

Good fortune has certainly played a role in this run, with Amanda Anisimova and McCartney Kessler ­struggling against her with physical issues in consecutive matches. For so long, Raducanu was always the player breaking down on the court. She now looks physically prepared for all possibilities and she recovered well from a gruelling, attritional second-round win over Navarro. Against those struggling opponents, she made her own luck by refusing to allow them back into the matches.

As she faces off against Pegula, there are also lessons that Raducanu, at 22 years old, can learn from her. Successful tennis careers are a marathon and each is completely different. Some players fulfil their potential at a young age but others must reckon with a far longer journey.

While the past three and a half years have at times been brutal for Raducanu, mere match wins often hard to come by, players who work hard each day will always have opportunities to turn their fortunes around. With that in mind, it is notable that Raducanu has competed more frequently this year than ever before. Even as she struggled through numerous bitter losses in recent months, to her credit she kept on ­rolling with the punches and showing up. This week at least, she is finally landing some of her own.

On Tuesday Novak Djokovic – a six-time tournament winner in Miami – stormed into the men's quarter-finals after thrashing Italy's 15th seed Lorenzo Musetti 6-2, 6-2 on a rain-affected day of play. Next up he will play Sebastian Korda of the US, seeded 24th, on Thursday.

Andy Cohen revealed that he spoke to Garcelle Beauvais before she announced her exit from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.

“We had a serious conversation before she was on Watch What Happens Live,” Cohen, 56, said during the Wednesday, March 26, episode of SiriusXM's Andy Cohen Live. “She had a reunion that you will see play out and I'm not gonna [speak on it], you'll just watch it, but … she ended in a not good place.”

Cohen added that he had been “texting” with Beauvais, 58, and she told him, “I will speak to you in New York.”

“So we got together about an hour before her live show and she and I really hashed things out and she let me into where her head was at,” he admitted. “And there was not only stuff with the show, but .. the kids are entering their senior year.”



Beauvais is mother to son Oliver Saunders, 32, whom she shares with ex Daniel Saunders, and twins Jax and Jaid, 17, whom she welcomed with ex Mike Nilon. Cohen confessed that he had a lot of “respect” for Beauvais being so candid with him.

“It was one of the most real conversations that ended where it ended,” he recalled. “But I would say it ended with her saying, ‘I've got to choose kind of my life.'”

Cohen revealed that while Beauvais has said goodbye for now, the door will always be open for her if she wants to return.

“I was like, ‘Look, call us in a year, by the way, if you feel like it. See where you're at,'” he said.

On Tuesday, March 25, Beauvais announced that she was leaving RHOBH after five years.

“Hey, guys, so I have some news. I've decided to leave Beverly Hills,” she said in a video posted via Instagram. “It's been a wild ride. I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless.”

In her video, Beauvais shared that her family played a role in her decision.

“Their last year of high school is next year, and I want to be a part of that, and Jaid is starting a new career, and I want to be a part of that too,” she continued. “Secondly, I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing and acting in. I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon.”

Beauvais thanked Cohen and Bravo for their support on her decision. She also teased that she “might pop in some time” since Cohen told her she can “come back any time, the door will always be open.”

Garcelle Beauvais promises to keep shining — even without a Bravo diamond.

Hours before The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills aired its season 14 finale, Garcelle, 58, announced she was leaving the series after five years.

“I've decided to leave Beverly Hills,” she said in a video posted via Instagram on Tuesday, March 25. “It's been a wild ride. I mean, some amazing things have happened, and some hard things have also happened, but it's been a ride nevertheless.”

While she wants to spend more time with her youngest sons Jaid and Jax, both 17, as they begin their final year of high school, Garcelle also has her hands full with other opportunities.



“I have the most exciting projects that I am developing, producing and acting in,” she said. “I can't tell you anything right now, but you'll know soon.”

As viewers prepare to say farewell to Garcelle in a shocking three-part reunion special, keep reading to see how the cast is reacting to her exit:

After making their debuts on RHOBH in 2020 during season 10, Sutton, 53, and Garcelle developed a strong friendship that lasted through four seasons.

“Congratulations to your next chapter,” Sutton wrote in the comments section of her costar's announcement post. “Can't wait to see what's up your sleeve. Nothing but greatness. This I know. 😽💗💗💗.”

Although season 14 was her first year working with Garcelle, Jennifer, 66, couldn't hide her sadness that her new friend was leaving the show.

“Oh my God! Garcelle, we will really miss you!” she wrote in the comments section. “You brought so much integrity and warmth and humor to the franchise.”

While appearing on the March 25 episode of Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Boz, 48, alluded to tension between Garcelle and her costars at the RHOBH season 14 reunion.

“I am disappointed that she is departing like this,” she told Andy Cohen. “I wish that she would have stuck around to work [it] out another season.”

During her appearance on WWHL with Boz, Erika, 53, said she wasn't surprised by Garcelle's announcement.

“We've known that she's quit for two weeks. We knew this,” the “Pretty Mess” singer said. “She did not take the cast photo with us [at the reunion], which is a clear indication that, ‘I am leaving.'”

Kathy, 66, seemingly addressed Garcelle's announcement when she shared a fan site's reaction to the news.

Kyle Richards' sister reposted @BravoHousewives' Instagram Story that said, “You'll be missed Garcelle.” For emotional impact, Kathy added Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's “See You Again” song to the background.

After helping launch RHOBH in 2010, Camille, 56, has remained a frequent guest of the show. She expressed support for Garcelle's decision on social media.

“The show will not be the same without you,” she wrote in the comments section. “You are beautiful inside and out. A class act always. You will be missed. Congrats on your new venture! Wishing you so much success.”

Taylor Swift fans are ready for a brand-new musical era — but what and when?

Swift, of course, uses the term “era” to refer to each of her past and present albums from her self-titled debut in 2006 to 2024's The Tortured Poets Department. As she embarked on her 21-month, three-hour concert tour starting in 2023, she wanted to pay homage to each record.

“Every part of you that you've ever been, every phase you've ever gone through, was you working it out in that moment with the information you had available to you at the time,” Swift told TIME in December 2023. “You should celebrate who you are now, where you're going, and where you've been.”

By the end of Eras, Swift was seemingly ready to move on. In the introduction to her Eras Tour companion book released in November 2024, Swift signed off a prologue: “See you next era … Taylor.”



Since concluding Eras the next month, Swift has been enjoying a break from the spotlight that included vacations with boyfriend Travis Kelce.

Without sharing specifics about her now-elusive 12th album — or whether the re-recordings of Taylor Swift or reputation will be released first — Swift might be leaving Us clues about what to expect (or not). Keep scrolling for a full breakdown of what some obsessive Swifties think are Easter eggs for her next original LP:

After a 100-day social media hiatus, Swift returned to Instagram on March 22, 2025, to congratulate BFF Selena Gomez and her fiancé, Benny Blanco, on their I Said I Love You First album release.

“@selenagomez & @bennyblanco I LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH,” Swift gushed via Instagram Story, sharing the Spotify cover of the LP. “OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDD.”

For what it's worth, Swift used 12 D's in the last word that had fans wondering if it directly corresponds to the next LP.

Swift's outfit for the February 2025 ceremony also proved that exact numbers could be important. As Swift stepped out in a crimson Vivienne Westwood minidress with Lorraine Schwartz drop earrings, each earring featured 12 ruby stones.

During a January 2025 appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, Swift's boyfriend was asked if the new record will have any love songs. (Swift and Kelce have been dating since summer 2023, which inspired TTPD's “The Alchemy” and “So High School.”)

“There might be a few, I don't know,” Kelce teased that January. “There might be a few.”

While the Kansas City Chiefs tight end noted that he couldn't say whether he's “heard any” of the new tracks, he did reveal his excitement.

“I'll never chime in, but I'm here to support it,” Kelce gushed. “I'm here to see where it can go, you know what I mean?”

During an outing with pal Gigi Hadid in September 2024, Swift sported a gold chain necklace with a “12” pendant in the center. While some fans presumed it was an upside-down “TS” for her initials, the overall Swiftie consensus was that it was the double-digit numeral.

Grant Ellis found his happily ever after in fiancée Juliana Pasquarosa — but not before seemingly blindsiding runner-up Litia Garr.

While Grant broke things off with Litia in the Monday, March 24, finale of The Bachelor, she claimed Juliana should have “a lot of questions” based on what the lead had promised her. Fast-forward to the live portion of the episode and Litia reunited with Grant on stage for the first time — and claimed he previously told her he could “stop the show” early because she was his No. 1.

Grant, for his part, exclusively told Us Weekly that he and Juliana — who said she hadn't watched the finale — had spoken about Litia's reaction to him ending things. While he apologized to Litia at the finale, Grant told Us there was “a lot” she said that he “didn't align with.”

“But I let her speak her truth and her piece. I'm not gonna sit up there and argue with her on stage about what she thought I said,” he told Us. “But I think that having a little more clarity — when you are the Bachelor, you do see your final two contestants as somebody that could be your wife. That's where some confusion came into play. There's room for interpretation when things are said, ‘off camera.' At that point in time, I can't really say much. I'm not gonna argue, I just have to accept whatever the conditions are and apologize and let her feel how she feels because she's in a tough situation and she's hurt. I understand.”



Scroll down to see what Grant and Juliana have said about Litia after the finale:

Juliana told Entertainment Weekly that Grant shared “everything” with her about his indecision when it came to popping the question.

“Nothing that I saw was a surprise. Nothing shocked me,” she told the outlet. “I felt really prepared about the fact that he had a relationship and a connection with somebody else on there, and a couple other ladies. It made it easier to watch back because I knew even seeing the relationship that you had with Litia, it is just a different relationship than we have, and that's OK. You had to make the best decision for yourself. But nothing shook me or made me nervous. I was prepared.”

Watching it back, Grant said it's “very emotional.” He added, “ I'll continue to reiterate this, being in the position I'm in, there's an opportunity for Litia to speak her truth and what she felt like happened. The difference between it is a lot of those things are not on camera, so there's a lot of room for interpretation. Me being being a lead, I just have to own it, and I just have to apologize. It's a unique situation where you're dating multiple people and if you have feelings for somebody, you're going to tell them how you feel or you're going to tell them that you do see a future — because at that point in time, you do. It's just coming down to what fits you best, and with the combination of the limited time, it is a recipe for some turmoil.”

Juliana — who chose not to watch Grant and Litia's live conversation — said that even if she did, she's “sure” that nothing Litia said would come as a surprise since the couple had “so much conversation” before the episode.

“I trust him and I choose him and I think he handled himself the best that he could in that really tough situation,” Juliana said.

Grant exclusively told Us why he chose to have a conversation with Juliana about Litia. “We definitely talked about it,” Grant said. “It's always a situation where it's uncomfortable, but I think not being able to sit there and watch it, we went into our moment just thinking about the weight of our moment. Looking back, it might have been a benefit — it may have not been — but it's definitely hard to go from an extreme low to an extreme high and to not wear it on your face. I just was happy that we were able to express our relationship and do it in a way that everybody saw.”

While reflecting on his journey with Litia, Grant told Parade, “Looking back at some of the things she said that she chose that time to get really personal, that's OK. I hope this isn't a detriment, [but] me being in a lead [role], whatever darts are thrown my way, I kind of just gotta take it. I understand that she is hurt. I understand that it's a situation or opportunity to express how she feels and to garner maybe an audience to back her up. I feel sorry for hurting her. And yeah, I just apologize. What more can I do?”

When asked about Litia's remark that she would have “questions” if she were Juliana, the winner said that she and the runner-up are “two different people.”

“We tried to go through this process as true to ourselves as we could,” she said. “And I think at the end of the day, I didn't have to ask any questions because I was provided with all the information I needed before the season started airing. Nothing shocked me at all.”

Juliana reiterated that she made a “choice” not to watch Litia on stage. “I decided not to listen,” she told Glamour. “We've done so good this far watching it all back that there was no point in trying to taint that by listening and hearing it. I wanted him to be able to go in with a clear mind and give Litia some grace and compassion, and I didn't need to hear it.”

“[Litia] is so deserving of love and I hope that she gets that,” Juliana told E! News.

Juliana told Us that she and Litia “have to go through this process very uniquely and very true to who we are,” adding, “And I wish her well.”

Jonah Platt is speaking out in defense of his father!

The 38-year-old actor, older brother to Ben Platt and son of producer Marc Platt, recently reacted to the latest news of his dad flying to New York to talk to Snow White star Rachel Zegler about her social media comment, "and always remember, free palestine.”

In a reported since deleted comment that is going viral on X/Twitter, Jonah defended his father, saying what he did is "called adult responsibility and accountability," and blasted Rachel's actions, calling her a narcissist.

In a screenshot making its rounds on social media, under a post on Instagram, someone commented to Jonah, saying, "Your dad flew to NYC to reprimand a young actress? Any words on this? Cuz that's creepy as hell and uncalled for. People have the right to free speech, no? Shame on your father"

Jonah responded, "You really want to do this? Yeah, my dad, the producer of enormous piece of Disney IP with hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, had to leave his family to to fly across the country to reprimand his 20 year old employee for dragging her personal politics into the middle of promoting the movie for which she signed a multi-million dollar contract to get paid and do publicity for."

"This is called adult responsibility and accountability. And her actions clearly hurt the film's box office," he continued. "Free speech does not mean you're allowed to say whatever you want in your private employment without repercussions. Tens of thousands of people worked on that film and she hijacked the conversation for her own immature desires at the risk of all the colleagues and crew and blue collar workers who depend on that movie to be successful. Narcissism is not something to be coddled or encouraged."

A recently published article said that Rachel's free Palestine tweet under a post about Snow White "shocked" Disney execs, with the company reportedly having to pay for extra security for her co-star Gal Gadot, who has been outspoken in support of Israel, her home country amid the Israel-Palestine conflict. 

The story says Marc flew to NYC to confront Rachel and get her to take down the post, but she refused and the post remains up on her X/Twitter account to this day. 

Earlier this year, Rachel and Marc's son Ben Platt both performed as part of Trisha Payta's Big Broadway Dream show. 

Last year, Rachel joined Ben for a duet during his Palace Theatre concert residency on Broadway.

Jennifer Lopez made a hefty purchase following her divorce from Ben Affleck.

According to property records obtained by People, the 55-year-old A-lister purchased an $18 million home in California "near Los Angeles."

In July 2024, the "Jenny From the Block" singer and the 52-year-old actorput their shared Beverly Hills mansion on the market for $68 million — which, per People, has yet to sell. The former power couple originally purchased the property for $60.8 million in 2023.

Also in July, one month before their divorce, Affleck purchased a $20.5 million five-bedroom, six-bathroom residence in Los Angeles, which he has lived in since. Meanwhile, the Monster in Law actress sold her New York City penthouse for $23 million that month.

Lopez's big move comes about three months after her divorce from the Good Will Hunting star was finalized. After splitting up in the early 2000s, the duo reconciled their romance in 2021 and had a whirlwind romance as they tied the knot in a Las Vegas ceremony in July 2022. Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck in August 2024, the same day of the two-year anniversary of their second wedding ceremony in Georgia.

Affleck opened up about his divorce from the"Let's Get Loud" singer in an interview with GQ published earlier this week. The Gone Girl actor explained that no big event led to the marriage's demise.

"There's no scandal, no soap opera, no intrigue. The truth is, when you talk to somebody, 'Hey, what happened?' Well, there is no: 'This is what happened,'" the three-time Golden Globe winner revealed. "It's just a story about people trying to figure out their lives and relationships in ways that we all sort of normally do."

Affleck praised the Grammy-nominated singer and noted that he would not share the reasoning behind their breakup.

"There is no 'So-and-so did this' or 'This was the big event.' It sounds more like a couple's therapy session, which — you would tune out of someone else's couple's therapy after a while," he remarked. "For one thing, you start going, 'Okay, clearly this person has got these issues. Clearly they have these issues.' And the reason I don't want to share that is just sort of embarrassing. It feels vulnerable."

Rachael Kirkconnell has officially received an apology from her ex Matt James. 

Just days after their shocking and sudden split, the 28-year-old former Bachelor winner went on "Call Her Daddy" and shared the exact reason why they split up.

She then shared they spoke after the podcast.

“We did have a conversation after the podcast and, again, I think if he ever wants to share his side of it and his story then he's more than able to, of course. I think that hearing certain things come from him helped me a lot. I think that, you know, not only did he apologize for things, but he took a lot of things back," she said on "The Squeeze" podcast.

“Of course, that was really hard to hear and it was really sad and it hurts — I don't know. Sometimes I tell myself it was so nice to hear the things I had been wanting to hear for weeks and I finally got that apology and that closure and that honesty that I needed from him. But it still didn't change anything for me. It still happened. He still did what he did and we still had to navigate everything after that," she added.

Daisy Edgar-Jones is collecting internet boyfriends like infinity stones.

The actress told Elle in a recent cover story that she just happens to have worked with many actors that the internet loves — including Paul Mescal, Jacob Elordi, Harris Dickinson, Andrew Garfield, Sebastian Stan and Glen Powell.

“Just Timothée Chalamet and Austin Butler left!” Edgar-Jones said. “I have worked with basically all of the internet's boyfriends."

Edgar-Jones said she feels lucky to have worked with actors who are secure enough in themselves to let her be the first-billed actor.

“I'm lucky that every actor I've worked with has been incredibly supportive of me being the lead. Glen, Sebastian, Paul, all of them. I think that's why they're so successful and so loved and so good: that they are so generous, and they really serve the story and are not serving themselves," Edgar-Jones said.

In particular, she described acting alongside Mescal in Normal People as being "like playing tennis with your best friend."

This good luck seems to have Edgar-Jones pinching herself in anticipation it one day runs out.

"I'm nervous for the point that it comes to working with someone who might not be so chill with it," Edgar-Jones said. "Because there's so much ego that can exist in this industry.”

Carol Alt explained her "Paper Empire" co-star, Denise Richards, and her husband played a major role in her decision to launch an OnlyFans account.

Denise Richards' husband plays a key role in the behind-the-scenes work of her OnlyFans page.

During the latest episode of her reality show, "Denise Richards & Her Wild Things," the OnlyFans model revealed how her account has revitalized her acting career, with the help of her husband, Aaron Phypers.

"I will say that I'm in the top 1% of creators on OnlyFans, so I am very grateful," she said, via People. "It's very empowering, especially for someone my age, that people still want to see me that way."

OnlyFans is a subscription-based platform that allows creators to share and monetize their content, which can be explicit.

Richards credited her husband for helping curate her risqué content, explaining, "He's so supportive. He knows what men love, and he'll go through all the photos and say, ‘This is good. Do this. This is what guys like.'"

She admitted that she had previous reservations about the adult content site. But once she dived into OnlyFans, she found the platform to be "quite lucrative."

"When I joined OnlyFans, I was very concerned that I possibly could lose some jobs, but it was the opposite. I got more offers. I get roles where I'm like, the trophy wife or the sexy one."

Richards continued to debunk any misconceptions of OnlyFans and added that she enjoys engaging with her fans in a different way.

"People think that I'm just doing whatever — that's not true," she explained. "I actually look at it as a way of communicating with fans, and not the way that you're thinking."

Meanwhile, Richards' daughter has recently had the opposite experience.

Sami, the daughter of Richards and Charlie Sheen, slammed Hollywood's "double standard" as she confessed that OnlyFans had hurt her modeling career. 

"I really want to get headshots done to transition into modeling," the 21-year-old OnlyFans model explained later in the episode. 

"I've met with a couple agencies, and they don't like that I do OnlyFans. It's so frustrating because it's like, that's how I pay my rent. If you'll take me seriously, I won't have to do it anymore."

Her mother shared the same sentiments as her daughter and applauded Sami for breaking into a bold industry. 

"That's the shame of it," Richards said. "Why judge based on them trying to make a living while they're trying to pursue their career?"

"I really am so proud of Sami. I wish I had her f---ing balls when I was her age."

Sami replied, "Well, look who my f---ing family is. You guys are crazy. In a good way!"

"Denise Richards & Her Wild Things," sheds light on Richards' life as a mom of three. Richards shares daughters, Sami, 20, and Lola, 19, with Sheen. She adopted her youngest daughter, Eloise, 13, on her own in 2011 after her divorce from Sheen.

Remi Bader is opening up about her weight.

The 30-year-old influencer and outspoken advocate for body inclusivity recently spoke out about her weight loss journey, and revealed she went under a medical procedure.

In the fall of 2023, Remi chose to have gastric bypass surgery (SADI-S), which she decided to do based on a history of binge eating, weight-loss drugs and gastrointestinal issues.

"I loved being curvy my whole life; I just did. It was who I was...I will always believe that you could be a bigger size and be healthy and happy," she told Self.

"I was for a while, that wasn't a lie. But there was a point when it shifted, and I became really unhappy."

After speaking with her doctor, she underwent the surgery on December 11, 2023. 

"I need to say that it was the most brutal thing," she admitted.

"I get the surgery. I was in recovery hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up. It was not normal. I was supposed to leave [the hospital] in one day."

"I could not stop projectile vomiting, and I couldn't drink water. They won't let you leave if you can't drink water,” she added. 

"I actually can't explain how horrible it was."

Remi revealed that she didn't leave the hospital until three days later, and the negative effects that came with recovery lasted six weeks. 

In the months that followed the surgery, Remi said she was "not f--king okay" from December to mid-February 2024. 

"I'd gotten into a very, very deep depression, and it was truly the scariest time of my life,” she said. “I couldn't tell people. I really — I wanted to die."

Remi noted "it happened very subtly" and she "never went off of the anxiety or depression medicine" because it made her feel "so much better."

As far as the weight loss itself, Remi said she "never thought it would be this quick," and she's still "healing and figuring it out."

"I was lost with my identity before...I wasn't big enough at first and plus-size enough at first for the plus-size community. Then I became too big...for some brands even to work with. Now I'm too small? I actually don't know where I'm supposed to be," she admitted.

"I'm going to continue to be online and cry and share and not share and be me, and that's not changing."

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, has written a new book, "My Mother and I." It details the monarch's upbringing and his relationship with Queen Elizabeth II.

Prince Harry is parting ways with Sentebale, an African charity he co-founded in honor of his mother, Princess Diana, nearly two decades ago. 

On Monday, the Duke of Sussex, his co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and fellow trustees resigned amid tensions with Dr. Sophie Chandauka, the chair of the charity's board.

"Nearly 20 years ago, we founded Sentebale in honour of our mothers. Sentebale means ‘forget-me-not' in Sesotho, the local language of Lesotho, and it's what we've always promised for the young people we've served through this charity," Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, who co-founded the charity in April 2006, said in a joint statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

"Today is no different. With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as patrons of the organization until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same. It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation."

The Duke of Sussex co-founded the charity with Seeiso, whose mother died in 2003, after visiting Lesotho during his gap year in 2004. Sentebale was created to help people in Lesotho and Botswana living in poverty and those suffering from HIV and AIDS.

According to The Times, the charity had carried out a "restructuring" of its board as "confirmation of its strategy to redeploy senior roles to be proximate to most of the team and programs in southern Africa." The outlet reported that Chandauka is believed to be suing the charity's trustees after they voiced concerned over her leadership.

Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso shared that the trustees "acted in the best interest of the charity," despite ongoing tensions with Chandauka. 

"These trustees acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down, while keeping the well-being of staff in mind. In turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship."

"We thank all the trustees for their service over the years and are truly heartbroken they've had to follow through with this act," the statement continued. "What's transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale's beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about."

"Although we may no longer be patrons, we will always be its founders, and we will never forget what this charity is capable of achieving when it is in the right care," the statement concluded.

Former trustees Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Dr Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West also explained why they chose to unanimously resign from the charity. 

"As a group of British and African trustees, we have made the difficult decision to unanimously resign as board members of Sentebale," the former trustees said in a statement to Fox News Digital. "We are deeply proud to have supported the visionary work of the Founding Patrons Prince Seeiso and Prince Harry, who founded Sentebale in memory of their mothers. For two decades, Sentebale has championed hundreds of thousands of children and young people, providing them with care, training and life skills, which not only benefit each individual child they support, but their families and their communities as a whole.  

"Today's decision is nothing short of devastating for all of us, but we see no other path forward as the result of our loss in trust and confidence in the Chair of the board," the statement continued. "Our priority has always been, and will always be, what's in the best interest of the charity, and it's desperately sad the breakdown in relationship escalated to a lawsuit by the Chair against the charity, to block us from voting her out after our request for her resignation was rejected. We could not in good conscience allow Sentebale to undertake that legal and financial burden and have been left with no other option but to vacate our positions. This was not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity."

"Our sincere hope is that with this decision, the road ahead steadies for the sake of our staff and the communities we serve," the statement concluded. "Sentebale is simply too important to us."

Chandauka has reportedly filed a lawsuit against Sentebale in the High Court, and accused both princes of playing the "victim card," CBS reported. 

"I chose to join Sentebale first and foremost as a proud African who understands that – in the spirit of Ubuntu [interconnectedness] – to whom much is given, much is expected," she said in a statement to CBS. "Everything I do at Sentebale is in pursuit of the integrity of the organization, its mission, and the young people we serve. My actions are guided by the principles of fairness and equitable treatment for all, regardless of social status or financial means."

"There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct," the statement continued. "Discerning readers will ask themselves: why would the chair of the board report her own trustees to the Charity Commission? Why would the High Court of England and Wales accept her application to hear the matter at all if the case had no merit?

"Well, because beneath all the victim narrative and fiction that has been syndicated to press is the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir [misogyny directed towards Black women] and the cover-up that ensued. I could be anyone."

Even hours after the latest Daredevil Born Again two-part premiere dropped on Tuesday (Wednesday in India), Episodes 5 and 6 continued climbing trends on social media. With some Ms Marvel and The Champions teases being sprinkled in the latest episodes and the fifth episode being hailed as one of the best “filler” episodes “in a minute,” fans couldn't stop raving about the renewed Marvel TV brilliance. On top of that, Daredevil Born Again Episode 6 fleshed out an explosive and savage instance of “cross-cutting” between Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock and Vincent D'Onofrio's Wilson Fisk / Kingpin. 

While the March 26 (India) two-episode schedule witnessed viewers blowing up social media trends, Daredevil's brand-new and refurbished journey on Marvel TV is far from over. After the successful ride of Daredevil Born Again Episodes 5 and 6 (“Sic Semper Sysema” and “Isle of Joy”), we're still left with three more offerings before the season wraps up, presumably on a dark and bloody note, and Season 2 gives way. 

Next time, the action-packed saga returns to its usual weekly schedule. Here's what lies ahead.

A post shared by Matt Murdock (@daredevil)

As a revival and continuation of the original Netflix series, the Daredevil TV saga was reborn earlier this month. The crime drama adventure commenced with Daredevil Born Again's two-episode premiere on Disney Plus on Tuesday, March 4, in the US. Fans were treated to episodes titled “Heaven's Half Hour” and “With Interest.” 

The following week on March 11, Episode 3 “The Hollow of His Hand” dropped. Thereafter, Episode 4 “Straight to Hell” brought fans back to their Marvel haven on March 18. Finally, this week, the show again resorted to a two-episode release with Episodes 5 and 6.

Titled “Excessive Force,” the upcoming episode will be out on Tuesday, April 1. Fans in the US are advised to tune in to Disney Plus at 9 pm ET / 6 pm PT. Meanwhile, Indian fans may redirect their attention to JioHotstar on Wednesday, April 2, at 6:30 am IST.

The final two episodes of the season will follow the same Tuesday/Wednesday release pattern. Episode 8 “Art for Art's Sake” will be out on Tuesday, April 8 (ET/PT), or Wednesday, April 9 (IST). Similarly, the Daredevil Born Again Season finale will start streaming on April 15 (ET/PT) or April 16 (IST).

The official synopsis of the latest Marvel Television offering reads, “Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox), a blind lawyer with heightened abilities is fighting for justice through his bustling law firm, while former mob boss Wilson Fisk (Vincent D'Onofrio) pursues his own political endeavours in New York. When their past identities begin to emerge, both men find themselves on an inevitable collision course.”

The new series Dope Thief is currently streaming on Apple TV+. The show follows longtime friends Ray and Manny, who met while incarcerated as teens. They become low-level grifters upon release, posing as DEA agents and robbing small-time drug dealers until things go left and they find themselves on the run.

Brian Tyree Henry, who portrays Ray, tells ABC Audio that people like Ray and Manny who get caught up in a cycle of violence while trying to survive should receive support from those around them. 

"What we tend to do sometimes is that we see people in those situations and we immediately come up with our own prejudices about how they got there," he shares. "Here you have these two men who've been incarcerated, whatever their circumstances were, since they were 15 years old. And usually you have a system that keeps you there and wants to keep you trapped into that dynamic for the rest of your life."

"And it's like, well, how do we embrace them? How do you see a future when the system is telling you you don't deserve?" Brian continues. "And so for me, it's really about the people who are there to embrace them when they come out. When you see them on the street, when you see them trying to make it ... you have to in some way open yourself up in a way to understand them, to listen to them [and] allow them to be vulnerable instead of keeping them trapped within this system that told them that they couldn't be anything." 

Wagner Moura portrays Manny in the show.

The teaser of Akshay Kumar's much-awaited film Kesari Chapter 2 was released on Monday and the actor is receiving rave reviews for his presence. The 2019 film Kesari was inspired by the historic Battle of Saragarhi, while the latest installment Kesari Chapter 2 depicts the brutal Jallianwala Bagh massacre of 1919 and its aftermath. For those who don't know, the upcoming film is adapted from the book 'The Case That Shook the Empire' written by Pushpa Palat and Raghu Palat and the film also stars R Madhavan and Ananya Panday. But do you know, the role that Akshay Kumar is playing in Kesari Chapter 2 has already been played by OTT actor Taaruk Raina? Moreover, know who was Sir Chettur Sankaran Nair, whose life story has made it to films and series. 


Waking Of A Nation was also based on the similar incident

SonyLIV's last release Waking Of A Nation is also based on a similar foreground, where a lawyer looks deep into the aftermath and events leading to the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The show is headed by Taaruk Raina and it also features Bhawsheel Singh, Nikita Dutta and Sahil Mehta in pivotal roles. While the series was not much appreciated due to its overdramatic and sloppy. However, people have a lot of expectations from Kesari Chapter 2. 

In the film, Akshay Kumar plays the role of the famous lawyer Sir Chettur Sankaran Nair, who not only raised his voice against the killings but also shook the British Empire. He not only resigned from his prestigious position in the Viceroy's Executive Council but also raised his voice against British atrocities. 

Sir CS Nair, first Indian to be appointed as Advocate General

Born in an aristocratic family in Manakara village of Palakkad, Kerala in 1857, he received his schooling in an English medium school in his hometown. After his schooling, he joined Presidency College, Madras. In the 1870s, Nair earned a law degree from Madras Law College and began his career in the Madras High Court. In 1887, he was elected President of the Indian National Congress. He became the first Indian to be appointed Advocate General of the Madras Government in 1907 and later became a judge in the same court.

CS Nair had resigned from the post of Viceroy's Executive Council

At the time of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, CS Nair was serving as the Education Minister and the only Indian representative in the Viceroy's Executive Council, a great honour for any Indian. When the massacre took place, press freedom was curtailed in Punjab. The British distorted many facts about the events. But when the news reached CS Nair, he was deeply upset. Angered by this act, CS Nair decided to resign from the Executive Council as a protest. In his letter, he wrote, 'If a country is to be governed, it is necessary to massacre innocent people…and if any civil official can call in the army at any time and together they can massacre people like Jallianwala Bagh, the country is not worth living in.'

CS Nair refused to apologise to Michael O'Dwyer

CS Nair's resignation shocked the British, which led to the lifting of martial law in Punjab. In 1922, CS Nair wrote a book called Gandhi and Anarchy, in which he accused Michael O'Dwyer of promoting atrocities during the massacre. Michael O'Dwyer was a lieutenant of the Punjab government, and by that time he had been dismissed and returned to England.

Nair's accusation led to Michael O'Dwyer suing him for defamation, which was heard in the High Court of London. The judge hearing the case was biased against the Indian defendant. The case lasted for five weeks and was the longest in the history of the court. Since there was no unanimous verdict in the case, Nair was faced with two options: apologise to O'Dwyer or pay a sum of 7,500 pounds, and he chose the second option. The film Kesari Chapter 2 is based on this case.

Though the case did not go in CS Nair's favour, his efforts to bring the massacre to light had an immediate impact. From the abolition of press censorship and martial law to the investigation of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, the fight of lawyer CS Nair made him a poignant figure in our history books.

We might feel like we know Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash already. We have seen them live off rice and beans in the Australian rainforest in I'm a Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! We have watched Joe learn to ice skate in Dancing on Ice and Stacey declutter homes in Sort Your Life Out.

But now the couple are going one step further and allowing viewers inside Pickle Cottage, their family home in Essex, in a new reality series for BBC One.

It is a fly-on-the-wall series - and Stacey says she only realised in the thick of the filming that viewers can see everything, "and then you panic a bit", she tells the BBC.

But ultimately, they are just a normal family "doing our best in every aspect of our lives", she says.

"So in the end, you sort of relax with that, and you think, 'Oh well, so they saw us get the hump with each other, or they saw us do something wrong'.

"That is probably the best thing we could show the world, because everything isn't perfect."

There was no point in doing a reality show, says Joe, if they were not going to be honest.

"We don't want to glamourise anything," says Joe. "Our biggest discussions at the beginning of this were, 'how much are people going to want to watch us take the kids to school and change nappies?' Our lives are not that exciting."

Joe, 43, a former EastEnders actor, and Stacey, 35, a former X Factor contestant, met on the set of I'm a Celebrity in 2010 and have been in a relationship since 2016. 

They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.

"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven," says Stacey, "so they were little."

When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. "To be honest, we're just a family."

Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.

"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids," he says. "There's no distinction."

When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.

"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister," says Stacey. "And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other."

As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.

"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other," says Joe. "It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that."

Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.

Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a "mother lion".

"Don't go near her cubs, she'll have you," he says.

"She's just the most wonderful person," he says. "She's kind, she's loving. I mean there's nothing about Stacey I would change. People love her in the streets and, imagine me, I'm so lucky, I get to spend the rest of my life with her."

Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is "so magic" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.

Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are "polar opposite" she says.

"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that'," says Joe. "So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way."

Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.

"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be… fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories," she says.

For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.

Stacey says the teenage boys can revert to being younger again which is important because they grow up so quickly in the modern world. They have the chance to still play, with the excuse being "oh, I'm only doing it because it's with my little brother or little sister", she says.

It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.

Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.

"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known," says Stacey. "When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider."

She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.

Stacey relied on Zach and "asked a lot of him", she says, needing him to help her.

"I haven't done that with the younger ones, because I've had Joe," she says, "and that's just the reality of my situation. It's been different through the years."

But Zach, now 17 himself, is "probably one of the most empathetic, caring, emotionally intelligent young teenagers that I know," says Stacey.

"I feel like that has a lot to do with how we grew up together, and how life was for us in the beginning."

Having more children is not currently on Stacey's radar, she says, as her body is still recovering from having three children in five years.

"My pelvic floor is dying," she laughs. Although Joe would love to have more.

Stacey still has plans to increase their brood - but this time it is their animals. 

"I literally walked into a conversation the other day and I heard 'cow'," says Joe, "and I was like, 'No way, we can't have a cow'."

"We were just throwing a few ideas around," says Stacey. "I would love to have animals and make our own milk and collect our own eggs and grow our own vegetables.

"That's a dream of mine - but in the future. At the moment, we're still rearing children."

Stacey & Joe starts on Tuesday 1 April at 20:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer.
