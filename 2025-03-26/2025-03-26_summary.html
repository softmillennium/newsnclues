<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-places-25-tariff-imported-214121353.html'>Trump places 25% tariff on imported cars, aiming to raise £77bn in tax revenues</a></h2><b>Source:</b> Yahoo News UK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-26 21:41:21 <p>
Ford's stock was up slightly, but shares in Stellantis, the owner of Jeep and Chrysler, dropped nearly 4%. “We are going to be doing automobiles, which you've known about for a long time,” Mr Trump said on Monday. The tariffs are part of a broader reshaping of global relations by Mr Trump, who plans to impose what he calls “reciprocal” taxes on April 2 that would match the tariffs and sales taxes charged by other nations. He has already placed a 20% tax on all imports from China for its role in the production of fentanyl. His taxes risk igniting a broader global trade war with escalating retaliations that could crush global trade, potentially damaging economic growth while raising prices for families and businesses as some of the costs of the taxes get passed along by importers.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy leaves the room after his briefing in Kyiv, Ukraine, Tuesday, March 25, 2025. In this photo provided by Ukraine's 93rd Kholodnyi Yar Separate Mechanized Brigade press service, a view of Pokrovsk, the site of heavy battles with Russian troops, in the Donetsk region, Ukraine, Tuesday, March 25, 2025. Russia also conditioned its part in opening Black Sea shipping on the U.S. lifting sanctions, which Kyiv dismissed. That's because Ukraine took matters into its own hands after Russia backed out of the grain deal in July 2023. At the same time, Ukrainian forces launched a campaign of sea drone attacks to further push back Russia's fleet.</p>

“This is very exciting,” he said, suggesting the move would spur economic growth. In February, Trump floated the idea of a 25% tariff on imported vehicles but had offered no other details. However, he has delayed or watered down his tariff plans on several occasions. !” Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this month, claiming that tariffs were already “pouring money” into the country. “This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever.”</p>

Macron spoke after talks with Ukraine's president and ahead of a summit in Paris of some 30 nations on Thursday that will discuss the proposed force for Ukraine that Macron suggested could be deployed in “important towns” and elsewhere. “If there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it's our usual framework of engagement,” Macron said. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has shown no public enthusiasm for the coalition's discussions about potentially sending troops into Ukraine after an eventual ceasefire to help make peace stick. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Macron both suggest that a foreign contingent in Ukraine could also provide military training, something allies already have been doing outside Ukraine, preparing more than 75,000 Ukrainian troops for battle against Russia's larger and expanding military and helping to make up for some of Ukraine's losses from more than three years of intense fighting. The 27-nation European Union is pressing ahead with a so-called steel “porcupine strategy” aimed at making Ukraine an even tougher nut for Russia to crack, by strengthening its armed forces and defense industry.</p>

“It seems that there is something personal against me,” Bolsonaro told journalists after the panel's decision. Bolsonaro, a former military officer who was known to express nostalgia for the country's past dictatorship, openly defied Brazil's judicial system during his 2019-2022 term in office. He has sought to shore up political support before the possible trial, including with a protest in Rio de Janeiro earlier this month. Local media said around 18,000 people attended, based on figures from a monitoring project linked to the University of Sao Paulo. Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo, said he didn't expect Wednesday's decision to have much impact on next year's presidential election.</p>

On Tuesday, videos and photographs shared on social media, which appeared to be authentic, showed hundreds of people, mostly men, chanting: “Hamas out” and: “Hamas terrorists” in Beit Lahiya. Some protesters were seen carrying banners emblazoned with slogans including: “Stop the war” and: “We want to live in peace”. “I don't know who organised the protest,” one man told Agence France-Press. A statement released by family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's offensive and its tightened blockade. They also said the community fully supported armed resistance against Israel and rejected “any attempt to exploit legitimate popular demands by a fifth column”, apparently referring to opponents of Hamas.</p>

South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, told reporters on Tuesday he would appoint a “top-class” replacement for Rasool. He added that US funding cuts were “entirely within their own right … and in many ways a wake-up call … [to be] more self-reliant.” Meanwhile, land and wealth remain concentrated among white South Africans, who make up 7% of the population (about half Afrikaans), while black people represent 81%.</p>

Critics say industry threatens the endangered Maugean skate and laws were rushed through with 'no proper process' An environment department opinion released under freedom of information laws suggested the review could lead to salmon farming having to stop in the harbour while an environmental impact statement was prepared. It would apply when the development was already under way and had been ongoing or recurring for at least five years. The government said the bill was “a very specific amendment” to address a flaw in national environment legislation and that “existing laws apply to everything else, including all new proposals for coal, gas, and land clearing”.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/26/hikers-rescued-california'>Two stranded hikers rescued after one slid 100ft down cliff in California</a></h2><b>Source:</b> The Guardian US&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-26 18:54:00 <p>
Two hikers were rescued from California's rugged and remote north coast over the weekend after one of them slid more than 100ft (30 metres) down a steep cliff and was clinging to a “near vertical” bluff with hiking poles, authorities said. The Shelter Cove fire department and a US Coast Guard team responded to a call on Saturday afternoon for a hiker stranded on a cliff near the Lost Coast Trail, which traces more than 50 miles (80km) of the wild and undeveloped coast in far northern California, in the King Range national conservation area. The two hikers were off trail, along a deer or game trail, on Saturday when one of them fell more than 100ft, causing injuries that left him unable to move and preventing rescuers from accessing him by land, according to the Shelter Cove fire department. The helicopter had just 15 minutes left of fuel, the Coast Guard statement said, and waited at a nearby airport until a Cal Fire truck brought additional fuel. Experts say hikers should not attempt the challenging coastal trail – sections of which are inaccessible during high tide – without experience.</p>

Two of the officers will also be required to attend de-escalation training, Sullivan said. The third officer has been identified in media reports as Jorge Acosta. Last October, McAlpin's attorneys released video footage of his violent arrest which occurred on 19 August outside a Circle K convenience store in Phoenix. In the police incident report, Harris wrote: “His hands raised to deliver targeted punches at my face/head, and multiple swings with closed fists at my head.” Harris also claimed that McAlpin had a “fighting stance with his legs planted for stability and force delivery” and that McAlpin “made it clear to me in the moment that he was not simply assaulting me in order to get away but engaging in assaults to cause me harm and injury”. A situation that was previously reviewed internally by subject matter experts of the force evaluation and review unit and deemed to be within policy has suddenly been reversed due to public pressure, based on biased media reporting.”</p>

CAIRO — Sudan's army said Wednesday it had recaptured Khartoum's international airport and a key base of the rival Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, bringing it closer to regaining full control of the capital for the first time in nearly two years of war . “This is a pivotal and decisive moment in the history of Sudan,” Information Minister Khalid Aleiser, spokesman of the military-controlled government, declared on social media. At least 28,000 people have been killed, though the number is likely far higher. The RSF is still believed to hold scattered positions in Khartoum. Their battles around Khartoum quickly spread across much of the country.</p>

He told reporters during a trip to Warsaw it was still early news and there were no details.

US President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed a sweeping executive order to overhaul the American election system, including requiring proof of citizenship for voter registration. “Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional republic. Among other things, the order requires proof of citizenship for voters to be registered in federal elections. Trump has long been critical of the US voting system, arguing that it is very susceptible to irregularities and fraud. The move has already faced criticism from various parties that have vowed to challenge it in court.</p>

Research suggests those who push themselves when working out perceive time to move more slowly If your sessions at the gym seem to drag on for hours, you are in good company. Adults who took part in 4km cycling trials on exercise bikes perceived time to have slowed down, scientists said, with the cyclists overestimating how long they had been pedalling for by about 10%. Before, during and after the trial, they were asked to estimate a time period of 30 seconds. Writing in Brain and Behaviour, the researchers described how time appeared to run slow when people were exercising but not before or after.</p>

The chamber's judges were installed after Bukele's party won a congressional majority in 2021.

Tributes are pouring in for a veteran Zimbabwean journalist who rose to prominence by exposing government corruption HARARE, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe is mourning Geoffrey Nyarota, one of the country's most prominent journalists best known for exposing government corruption and launching what became the country's most popular and critical independent newspaper. Government spokesman Nick Mangwana said Nyarota had “left an indelible mark on the country's journalism landscape.” Nyarota had resigned from the paper earlier in 2002 due to differences with its new management. He later returned to Zimbabwe and chaired a government-supported panel of inquiry into media ethics in 2014.</p>

After 17 months, Israeli reserve soldiers are questioning their leaders' decision to restart the war against Hamas. It's a shift that could complicate plans, now under consideration by Israel's political and military leaders, to reoccupy Gaza. But if it follows through on plans to launch a full-scale ground campaign and military occupation of Gaza, experts estimate that at least five divisions, or about 60,000 soldiers, would be needed — manpower that many of those who have served on the front lines suspect simply does not exist. He declined his call-up twice last year, but has served several stints since — a more common form of refusal among reservists who still believe Israel is under threat but are nonetheless hitting their limit, according to the reservists interviewed for this article. Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader.</p>

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly. During his television appearance, Waltz said he started the Signal group chat but unknowingly added a contact that happened to have Goldberg's number. “Of course I didn't see this loser in the group, it looked like someone else,” he said, and denied that a staffer was responsible. On the one hand, traditional, hawkish Republicans see Waltz as a strong vehicle to push Trump officials towards a more aggressive foreign policy, and advocate for him to stay in the administration. The use of Signal for internal government discussions has also been called into question.</p>

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte appealed for unity on Wednesday as European nations scale up their armed forces and defense industries after the United States warned that Europe must take care of its own security in future. NATO was formed 76 years ago to provide stability in Europe; a guarantee underwritten by the United States. His warning comes as Europe tries to wean itself off its security dependence on the United States, just as it reduced its reliance on Russian energy after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine three years ago, amid a drive to buy more European military equipment. Tusk said it was important to be prepared for any outcome of talks between Russia and the United States aimed at ending t he 3-year-old war in Ukraine.</p>

Someone tucked a heart-shaped note of encouragement into socks packed for Luigi Mangione to wear to court recently in the case surrounding the killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, prosecutors said in a court document released on Wednesday. A court officer intercepted the note, which urged the accused killer to “know there are thousands of people wishing you luck”, Manhattan prosecutors wrote in responding to recent requests from Mangione's lawyers. A message seeking comment on the prosecutors' filing was sent to Mangione's attorneys. Mangione, however, was allowed to change into clothes brought by his legal team.

Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri had visited Beijing on January 26-27 for a meeting of the Foreign Secretary-Vice Foreign Minister mechanism between both countries, following which both countries announced their decision to resume the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in the summer of 2025. The meeting was held to review the state of India-China bilateral relations, as agreed between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in Kazan last October.

This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed its war. Family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's renewed offensive and its tightened blockade on all supplies into Gaza. Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly two million Palestinians. Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>

Universities UK says ruling raises concerns about how to prevent harassment and hate speech on campus The regulator warned of a “a chilling effect” that could lead staff and students to self-censor and avoid voicing opposing views, for fear of disciplinary measures. “This judgment, however, raises concerns about how universities can, in practice, discharge freedom of speech and academic freedom duties alongside other important legal obligations, for example under legislation to prevent harassment and hate speech. “Clearly, future cases will not be the first case of their kind, so there will be a potential for higher fines in the future,” he said, adding: “I think universities should be looking at their policies and thinking carefully about what they need to do to comply with the law and to comply with regulatory requirements.” There is no doubt in my mind that these policies chill lawful speech.”</p>

The former president has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and says he is being politically persecuted. Combined with the other charges, it could result in a sentence of decades behind bars. As in his February indictment, Mr Gonet said part of the plot included a plan to kill Mr Lula and Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who were put under surveillance by the alleged conspirators. That was a reference to the riot on January 8 2023 when Bolsonaro supporters stormed and trashed the Supreme Court, presidential palace and Congress in Brasilia a week after Mr Lula took office. As well as Bolsonaro, the court will vote on accusations faced by his running mate during the 2022 election and former defence minister Walter Braga Netto, ex-justice minister Anderson Torres and his aide Mauro Cid, among others.</p>

Donald Trump's special envoy has come under fire for his comments around a 1994 deal transferring nuclear weapons from Ukraine to Russia, known as the Budapest Memorandum. Those nuclear weapons were inherited from the Soviet Union, but Ukraine agreed to give them up in return for security guarantees.

The Bavarian conservative leader Markus Söder called it an “attack on rural life” and demanded a special investigation. Radical protests have become a polarising force in Germany, with political tolerance for disruptive actions – such as climate activists gluing themselves to runways and farmers blocking streets with tractors – often dependent on the group carrying them out. The outgoing coalition's cuts to tractor diesel subsidies caused furious protests in 2024 that included sightings of makeshift gallows. “Such criminal actions are crimes and have nothing to do with freedom of expression or legitimate protest,” he said. Animal agriculture is responsible for 12-20% of the greenhouse gas pollutants worsening extreme weather, and climate scientists have found that eating less meat is a vital step to stop the planet from heating.</p>

The accusations came hours after Washington announced Tuesday that it had reached a tentative agreement with Ukraine and Russia to implement a pause on attacks on energy sites as well as taking steps to ensure safe navigation for ships in the Black Sea. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday Ukraine had agreed with U.S. negotiators in Riyadh “that a ceasefire for energy infrastructure can start today,” and expressed his country's willingness to comply with the agreement while warning Russia would face “strong retaliation” if it attacked Ukrainian energy facilities. We're not going into all the details, but there have already been eight confirmed hits on energy facilities,” Lytvyn wrote.

Initially announced in February at a joint press conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the initiative proposes relocating nearly two million Gazans to various countries, away from the now devastated territory described as a “demolition site.” Abroad, Palestinians would supposedly gain opportunities previously unavailable to them. Sudan was offered military and reconstruction aid, Somaliland international recognition as an independent state, while Somalia denied any talks had occurred. Cairo has long battled terrorism linked to the Muslim Brotherhood and fears radical elements disguised as civilians could infiltrate, threatening national security. Our children are slaughtered in their infancy, and these countries respond with empty slogans because they're not the ones suffering.” There must be room for negotiation that ensures security and rights, away from the use of force or continued escalation,” he reasoned.</p>

US President Donald Trump has ordered the declassification of all FBI files related to the agency's investigation into his first election campaign's alleged contacts with Russia. Crossfire Hurricane was prompted by the ‘Steele Dossier' – a compilation of unverified rumors about Trump and his alleged links to Russia. Durham criticized the FBI for showing a “serious lack of analytical rigor,” particularly when handling information from politically-affiliated sources. ‘Crossfire Hurricane' and Mueller's Russiagate investigation cast a long shadow over Trump's presidency, with allegations of “Russian collusion” persisting in the media even after Mueller's report found no evidence to back them up. It's a disgrace…but now you'll be able to see for yourselves.”</p>

Sweden has already decided on investments that are expected to put defence spending at 2.6 percent of GDP in a few years, Kristersson said, noting this already put it above NATO's two-percent spending target. While previous defence spending increases have been financed through the country's regular budget, Kristersson said that in order to rearm in such short time it was necessary to borrow funds for defence during a "transitional period". In addition, while funding was returning to previous levels, rebuilding a country's military takes time, Westberg said. "In some areas, such as buying ammunition or equipment... you can relatively easily convert funds into military capacity," the associate professor said.

Britain's Royal Society has decided the scientific academy will not take any action against a famous member, U.S. tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, after fellows met to discuss potential disciplinary measures, British media reported on Wednesday. The Royal Society, which began in 1660 and is the oldest national scientific academy in continuous existence, said last month that it would hold a meeting to discuss "principles around the public pronouncements and behaviours of fellows" after thousands of scientists expressed their concerns about Musk's membership. Past fellows of the Society have included Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking. Almost 3,500 scientists had signed an open letter expressing dismay at what they described as "continued silence and apparent inaction" from the Royal Society over Musk's fellowship.

In rare signs of unrest, top Republican senators are calling for an investigation into the Signal leak scandal and demanding answers from the Trump administration, as they raise concerns it will become a “significant political problem” if not addressed properly. During his television appearance, Waltz said he started the Signal group chat but unknowingly added a contact that happened to have Goldberg's number. “Of course I didn't see this loser in the group, it looked like someone else,” he said, and denied that a staffer was responsible. On the one hand, traditional, hawkish Republicans see Waltz as a strong vehicle to push Trump officials towards a more aggressive foreign policy, and advocate for him to stay in the administration. The use of Signal for internal government discussions has also been called into question.</p>

Trump, in an interview Wednesday on “The Vince Show,” repeated his desire for U.S. control of Greenland. Anne Merrild, a Greenlander and an expert on Arctic politics and development, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders. The U.S. has not articulated specific demands from Greenland or Denmark at this point. “But now Trump has scared most Greenlanders away from this idea about a close relationship to the United States because they don't trust him,” Jakobsen added.</p>

More than 100 officials from across the country have visited Tianmen in recent months to learn its “fertility secret,” state-run Xinhua News Agency said this month, as the Chinese leadership tries to replicate its success nationwide and reverse a stubbornly shrinking population. It also announced a gradual shift toward free preschool education, expanded state health-care coverage for childbirth and improved pediatric services — many of which Tianmen introduced in 2023. Tianmen's ability to quickly boost fertility shows the importance of comprehensive support for families, but it may be difficult to sustain or replicate elsewhere, said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, who focuses on China's demography. China became the world's second-largest economy partly because young people worked hard to achieve a better life. It also left behind a generation of young women determined to make their own choices about having children, free from state interference.</p>

Military officials say soldiers were conducting scheduled tactical training outside Vilnius Four United States army soldiers have been killed in Lithuania during training, the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, said while visiting Warsaw on Wednesday. “Whilst I was speaking the news came out about four American soldiers who were killed in an incident in Lithuania,” Rutte told reporters, adding that he did not know any details. “The M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle the four missing US Soldiers were operating during a training exercise has been located in Lithuania,” it said in a statement. The Baltic countries of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are all Nato members and have often had chilly ties with Russia, a key ally of Belarus, since declaring independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.</p>

But after strong public statements opposing the visit from Greenland's prime minister, Múte B Egede, and his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen, it was announced that the trip would be more contained in scale and feature only a visit to the island's US military base, Pituffik. Then they will instead make a visit to their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that,” Rasmussen told the Danish broadcaster DR. Rasmussen was speaking on Wednesday, as US planes were preparing to take off from Nuuk airport after reportedly being loaded with bulletproof cars that had been delivered in preparation for the visit. The Nuuk government responded by saying it had not issued any invitations for visits – “either official or private”. “So the vice-president now is looking basically to do a troop visit and keep it very traditional.”</p>

Anne Merrild, a professor and Arctic expert at Aalborg University in Denmark, said recent anti-U.S. demonstrations in Nuuk might have scared the Trump administration enough to revise the trip to avoid interactions with angry Greenlanders. The original itinerary was viewed as controversial because Greenland doesn't currently have a government after holding elections earlier this month, according to Marc Jacobsen, a professor at the Royal Danish Defense College. “Greenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don't want the U.S. to visit right now, when Greenland doesn't have a government in place,” Jacobsen said. Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk also turned out to be among his entourage. Danish MP Rasmus Jarlov wasn't happy with the visit, writing on X: “This level of disrespect from the coming US president towards very, very loyal allies and friends is record-setting.”</p>

The region has drawn increasing global attention due to its vast untapped energy and mineral resources, as well as its strategic trade routes. The NSR in Russia's exclusive economic zone within Arctic waters has been experiencing an unprecedented surge in development over the past decade. Moscow has extensively modernized the route, with significant investment from India and China, which hold stakes in several Arctic energy projects. He has also invited foreign partners to use the shipping artery. Russian authorities expect annual maritime cargo flows along the NSR to reach 200 million tons by 2030.</p>

The state has a Democratic governor, rising star Josh Shapiro, but is a persistent swing vote nationally, and is crucial to Democratic hopes of winning the White House in 2028. “It's only March, and Democrats have defied the odds again with another upset victory in Republican territory,” Heather Williams, president of the Democratic legislative campaign committee, said in a statement. Both wins affirm Democratic leadership in a moment when GOP power is synonymous with chaos.” Several Democrats in the House of Representatives, including Glenn Ivey and Delia Ramirez, have suggested Schumer resign, Reuters reported, prompting Schumer to tell NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday: “I'm not stepping down.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the popular congresswoman from New York who recently launched a “fighting oligarchy” tour with Bernie Sanders, has criticized what she called an “acquiesce” by Schumer to the Republicans.</p>

This is still early news so we do not know the details. VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) — Four U.S. Army soldiers have gone missing at a training area outside of Lithuania's capital, and a search is underway, the U.S. military said Wednesday. Lithuanian public broadcaster LRT reported that four U.S. soldiers and vehicle were reported missing Tuesday afternoon during an exercise at the General Silvestras Žukauskas training ground in Pabradė, a town located less than 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the border with Belarus.

Spain's centre-left minority coalition faces a balancing act in every vote as it weighs concessions to several other parties from across the spectrum that support it on a vote-by-vote basis and which have often opposing demands, such as the hard-left Podemos and centre-right Junts. In the meantime, Spain is rolling over its 2023 spending plan, as it did last year. However, Sanchez did not completely rule out submitting a 2025 spending plan - which would need to happen before the end of May. He said it should not be seen as normal "to face this context with an expired budget of a majority that no longer exists". Sanchez has said he could increase defence spending without going through parliament, drawing criticism from the opposition.</p>

People relax next to the day's catch after fishing on makeshift rafts in Cojimar, east of Havana, Wednesday, March 12, 2025. They are fishermen floating on makeshift rafts that have become common on the waters off the coast of Havana, as Cubans find innovative ways to fish in a country where it's complicated — if not impossible — to buy a fishing boat. Most use oars, but some fishermen have installed small engines to ease the physical effort at sea.</p>

However, with just under a week to go before the deadline, this might not happen as Taiwan and the South African government are still engaged in a possible change of date due to financial implications associated with this relocation. “In 1997, South Africa severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan and maintained a non-political, non-diplomatic engagement. Johannesburg, a thriving commercial and financial hub, is ideally positioned to foster productive economic collaborations. ”South Africa is committed to strengthening its non-diplomatic ties with the island, focusing on lucrative areas such as trade, investment, and education. This strategic approach will be facilitated through a non-binding Memorandum of Arrangement with the Taipei Authorities,” Phiri added.</p>

This time no outright intervention was apparent, perhaps because Hamas is keeping a lower profile since Israel resumed its war against it. Family elders from Beit Lahiya expressed support for the protests against Israel's renewed offensive and its tightened blockade on all supplies into Gaza. Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The war was triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 50,000 people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants.</p>

Some members will therefore occasionally use Signal while traveling abroad, because the government has its own communication system specifically to share classified information either over government-approved equipment or in a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF, which most Cabinet-level officials have installed in their homes, according to the Atlantic. “This is an outrageous national security breach and heads should roll,” Pennsylvania Rep.

Public television showed the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, speaking to a gilded conference room after an iftar dinner. Though NTV was running a headline that said hundreds of people had been arrested, mirroring statements made by the interior minister. This skewed coverage prompted opposition leader Özgür Özel and other members of his Republican People's party (CHP) to call for a boycott, targeting businesses that they claim have deep financial ties to the government or fund its media apparatus. Ten photojournalists were detained in dawn raids this week, with several charged by prosecutors the following day and facing jail time. “Media organisations that are critical of the government see themselves as playing their last game,” he said.</p>

Experiment onboard upcoming SpaceX mission will examine how nutrient-rich oyster mushrooms grow in microgravity FOODiQ Global's chief executive, Dr Flávia Fayet-Moore, described mushrooms as a “perfect space crop”, citing their fast growth, ability to be eaten raw and nutritional value. “Because we don't have technology to process food in space yet … Nasa is currently prioritising research into ‘grow, pick and eat' crops – things like lettuce, tomatoes and mushrooms,” she said. Last August, an Australian experiment led by Swinburne University astrophysicists Dr Sara Webb and Dr Rebecca Allen sent vials containing lion's mane, turkey tail and Cordyceps to the International Space Station. Aboard Fram2, if the mycelia fruit into oyster mushrooms, Philips will be responsible for documenting mushroom growth, crop yield and signs of contamination.</p>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientists-discover-rare-two-clawed-133129982.html'>Scientists discover weird Mongolian dinosaur that wielded 'sharp, huge' claws</a></h2><b>Source:</b> Yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-26 13:31:29 <p>
Called Duonychus tsogtbaatari, the dinosaur has 2-foot-long clawed fingers on each hand, one fewer than its fellow Therizinosauria. Despite having only two claws, Duonychus was an “effective grasper” that could reach branches or swaths of vegetation up to nearly 5 inches in diameter. A study co-author, Darla Zelenitsky, an associate professor at the University of Calgary in Canada, described Duonychus' claws as “sharp and huge,” about 1 foot long. Duonychus would have used their claws to grasp and pull vegetation to the mouth during feeding, Zelenitsky said in an email Wednesday, adding that claws could also have had other functions, like self-defense or grappling. The number of digits doesn't matter when it comes to hooking and pulling, Benton said, adding that the third finger may have been an “encumbrance” due to its short length.</p>

Euronews Tech Talks goes beyond discussions to explore the impact of new technologies on our lives. Rights groups accuse Hamas of violently suppressing dissent, quashing protests in the areas they control, while also jailing and torturing their critics. Hamas was also opposed to a power-sharing agreement with Fatah, the political group which previously controlled Gaza, and seized power in 2007. In Beit Lahiya, people held signs saying "Stop the war" and "We refuse to die" while others openly chanted "Hamas out". Israel is also demanding that the group give up power, disarm and send its leaders into exile.</p>

Despite rampant hypocrisy amongst rule-makers, it provides relative benchmarks and course-corrective measurements, which are absent when the world is adrift on an unordered international system. A similar concern was raised by Russian President Vladimir Putin at a plenary session hosted by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs where he remarked that trust is difficult to foster in an environment of contradictions and violations to the rules-based order. Today, shipbuilding in terms of tonnage is largely concentrated between South Korea and China, since the West abandoned it two decades ago. Beijing crystallizes shipbuilding expertise, logistics handling and owning port infrastructure as key focal points within its long-term strategic maritime economy. Without them, we risk repeating the mistakes of a previous generation – one that too hastily declared ‘peace for our time.'</p>

If there was indecision or disagreement, it added, a judge would have the final say. The topic was buried in parliament before being revived by Franceschini, who argues that rather than creating “endless problems” with double-barrelled surnames, or choosing between the mother's or father's, a law should be established for only the maternal surname to be used. Franceschini was mostly applauded by other opposition members, apart from a sceptical Carlo Calenda, who leads the centrist Azione party.</p>

This is the time when debts incurred over multiple lifetimes are redeemed, and learnings come through difficult life lessons. This reality check is important because it keeps our focus on realistic goals, thus encouraging a more practical approach to achieving dreams. It teaches us that saying no or stepping back is not just fair but quite essential for health and sanity maintenance. Saturn's transit through Pisces in 2025 will mark an extremely significant time for different zodiac signs, each one experiencing its own changes and challenges. During this phase, Aries people will start pondering deeper questions relating to life, career paths, relationships, and personal projections.</p>

President Donald Trump, right, speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 13, 2025. WARSAW, Poland (AP) — NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte appealed for unity on Wednesday as European nations scale up their armed forces and defense industries after the United States warned that Europe must take care of its own security in future. NATO was formed 76 years ago to provide stability in Europe; a guarantee underwritten by the United States. His warning comes as Europe tries to wean itself off its security dependence on the United States, just as it reduced its reliance on Russian energy after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine three years ago, amid a drive to buy more European military equipment. Tusk said it was important to be prepared for any outcome of talks between Russia and the United States aimed at ending t he 3-year-old war in Ukraine.</p>

New Delhi's statement came hours after the US body's annual religious freedom report claimed that minorities in India continue to face deteriorating treatment. "The USCIRF's persistent attempts to misrepresent isolated incidents and cast aspersions on India's vibrant multicultural society reflect a deliberate agenda rather than a genuine concern for religious freedom," the foreign ministry said. Labeling the US religious freedom body as "an entity of concern", India said, "Such efforts to undermine India's standing as a beacon of democracy and tolerance will not succeed. In fact, it is the USCIRF that should be designated as an entity of concern." In its current report, the US panel has recommended that India be designated as a "country of particular concern" over alleged violations of religious freedom and "impose targetted sanctions" against R&AW.</p>

Sentebale said in a statement to AFP that they had not received the resignations but confirmed that it was evolving from a "development organisation focused on addressing the impact of HIV/AIDS on the lives of children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana, to one that is addressing issues of youth health, wealth and climate resilience in Southern Africa".

Trump has called for the impeachment of these judges, earning a rare rebuke from Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. It's become clear the front line is not in Congress," said Randy Jones, a Democratic political consultant. "He could have taken the administration to court like everybody else is doing," Wilson said.

He contradicted US President Donald Trump by saying that a member of his staff was not responsible.

The vice president's decision to visit a US military base in Greenland has removed the risk of violating potential diplomatic taboos by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. Mr Jarlov noted that, after all, a vice president visiting an American military base is not controversial. “Greenland and Denmark have stated very clearly that they don't want the US to visit right now, when Greenland doesn't have a government in place,” following the election earlier this month. She and one of the couple's three children had planned to visit historic sites and learn about Greenland's culture, but her husband's participation has reoriented the trip around national security, her office said. Mr Vance said leaders in Denmark and North America had “ignored” Greenland for “far too long”.</p>

Amid widespread outrage over Washington's plan to "buy" the country, a high-level delegation led by Second Lady Usha Vance was to arrive in Greenland's capital Nuuk this week - that will now not happen. This plan now stands cancelled amid reports that Greenland was planning an unsavoury welcome for the US Second Lady. Greenland's acting head of government, Mute Egede, had labelled Usha Vance's visit as a "provocation" by the United States. Even Denmark's prime minister had called the visit an "unacceptable pressure" being put by Washington. Instead, they will visit their own base, Pituffik, and we have nothing against that," Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen told local broadcaster DR.</p>

Niger's military junta leader, Abdourahamane Tchiani, was sworn in as the country's president for a transition period of five years under a new charter that replaces the West African nation's constitution.

The five-year “flexible” transition period begins on Wednesday, according to Mahamane Roufai, the secretary general of the government.

He was speaking at a ceremony in the capital Niamey where the new transition charter recommended by a recent national conference was approved.

Mr Tchiani was also elevated to the country's highest military rank of army general, cementing his grip on power since June 2023 when he led soldiers that deposed the country's elected government.</p>

Palestinian operator group Hamas warned on Wednesday that hostages may be killed if Israel attempts to retrieve them by force and air strikes continue in the Gaza Strip. Israel restarted intense air strikes across the densely populated Gaza Strip last week followed by ground operations, shattering the relative calm afforded by a January ceasefire with Hamas. Since Israel resumed its military operations in Gaza, at least 830 Palestinians have been killed, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory. Israel's retaliatory military offensive has killed at least 50,183 people in Gaza, mostly civilians, according to the health ministry.

Fernandez, featuring as a striker for Argentina in this match, put his side two goals ahead 12 minutes in with a confident strike inside the box, then provided the cross for Alexis Mac Allister to get their third before half-time. Estevao, who will join Chelsea after his 18th birthday, was an unused substitute for Brazil, who dropped down to fourth in the table but remain on course for a spot at the World Cup, with the top six teams in South America qualifying automatically. Another beneficiary of that result were Ecuador, after Moises Caicedo captained them to a 0-0 draw away at Chile. Combined with their win over Venezuela last week and Brazil's loss, that leaves Ecuador second in the table and well placed to qualify, despite starting the campaign with a three-point deduction. There was little in the way of goalmouth action as they earned this point in Chile, although Ecuador did have a goal ruled out by VAR, but it was a result which benefited Caicedo and Ecuador far more than their opponents.</p>

Australia's love-hate relationship with fuel-guzzling utes and SUVs is now a looming election issue, after the Coalition indicated it may rethink Labor's vehicle emission standard. Labor's new vehicle efficiency standard (NVES), which became law on 1 January, enforces an emissions maximum for each car manufacturer, with a penaltyfor every gram of emissions over the target. Prior to January Australia was the only OECD country without a vehicle emission standard. According to its latest data, “pure” electric vehicle sales (excluding hybrids) were just 5.9% in February, down from 9.6% last year, while the preference for bigger cars continued. He said the government did not release its modelling on supply and demand, and called for it to sit down with industry to “work out a pathway forward”.</p>

A short time later, when another reporter asked if the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who texted detailed attack plans on the nonsecure group chat, should consider resigning, an agitated Trump replied: “Hegseth is doing a great job.

First authors carry out most of the work on a study, including research design, data collection and analysis. The data raise questions over how researchers at these universities are sustaining such spikes in research output while their first-authorship rates plummet significantly. Meho and his Beirut colleague Elie Akl are concerned that the trend could point to unethical behaviour, such as gift or sold authorship. Elizabeth Gadd, head of research culture and assessment at Loughborough University, agrees that it's a problem if ranking agencies aren't picking up on unethical practices. In a separate analysis, Achal Agrawal, a data scientist who founded the India Research Watchdog, showed that countries such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, China, Egypt and India, whose research output has been rising rapidly, are retracting studies at much higher rates than other countries.</p>

Niger's new leadership, which took power following a coup in July 2023, has taken several measures to cut ties with France. France's military presence in Africa has been controversial for decades, with critics arguing that it perpetuates neocolonial dynamics. Leaders in countries that have severed defense ties with Paris insist that the presence of French forces has been ineffective, prompting them to seek alternative alliances, including with Moscow. In a speech at a G20 meeting in South Africa last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused Western powers of exploiting natural resources from developing countries at low costs, imposing “pseudo-ecological taxes” on their products, and attempting to block cooperation between Africa, Asia, and Latin America with Russia and China.</p>

Multinational conglomerate Tata Group has reportedly become a global supplier of billionaire Elon Musk's electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla. The Tata group is now positioning itself for expanded opportunities and growing further, especially if Tesla sets up a manufacturing unit in India. The report said that Tesla's Senior procurement executives have been meeting with numerous current suppliers about manufacturing specific components. While the EV maker has not confirmed its manufacturing plans, reports indicate that it is in talks with several states, including Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Telangana, to explore options for setting up a production facility. The American EV maker has established partnerships with numerous Indian manufacturers, including prominent names such as Samvardhana Motherson, Suprajit Engineering, Sona BLW Precision Forgings, Varroc Engineering, Bharat Forge, and Sandhar Technologies, for sourcing vital components, but it is likely to source essential vehicle control components from Tata Electronics, including printed circuit board assemblies for Tesla's battery management systems, motor controller units and door control mechanism, the report said.</p>

Under a $6m agreement with the US, hundreds of migrants from Colombia and Ecuador were returned to their home countries on deportation flights. When the flight never materialized, some migrants who could afford it began taking small boats back to Colombia. From there many, including Álvarez, have opted to stay with friends or family in Colombian cities.</p>

New York, Two US lawmakers have introduced a bill seeking to sanction Pakistan's Army chief General Asim Munir for engaging in the "wrongful persecution and imprisonment" of political opponents and the release of detainees including former premier Imran Khan, a media report said. The “Pakistan Democracy Act” was introduced by Republican representative from South Carolina Joe Wilson and Democratic representative from California Jimmy Panetta on Monday, The Hill reported. Wilson called the 72-year-old former leader Khan a "political prisoner", and blamed Pakistan's powerful military for his "unjust detention", according to the news portal. Wilson told The Hill that he wrote a letter to President Trump urging him to “put pressure on Pakistan's military leadership including through visa bans, to restore democracy and release Mr Khan.” This article was generated from an automated news agency feed without modifications to text.</p>

This experience probably will challenge future US defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned. Russia has proven to be “adaptable and resilient” during what it views as a Western proxy war, enhancing its military capabilities across several domains, including unmanned systems, electronic warfare, and the integration of cyber operations with conventional military maneuvers, the report explains. It warns that Western efforts to undermine the Russian economy “have accelerated its investments in alternative partnerships and use of various tools of statecraft to offset US power, with China's backing and reinforcement.” Beijing considers the US use of unilateral sanctions illegal under international law and rooted in a “Cold War mentality.” The US assessment states that major non-Western nations are poised to align with Russia in order to pursue policies that challenge American dominance, such as de-dollarization. The US intelligence community posits that both Moscow and Kiev may have reasons to avoid a hasty resolution on unfavorable terms.</p>

The agreement came after Ukraine and US delegations held talks in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. Kirill Dmitriev, one of Russia's negotiators, welcomed it on X as "a major shift toward peace". He says Russia will be quite happy dragging the US through peace talks without making any meaningful concessions. No real deal can be agreed unless Donald Trump starts putting meaningful pressure on Vladimir Putin, he says. Last week, Mr Putin agreed to an immediate 30-day pause in strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure.</p>

More than 100 officials from across the country have visited Tianmen in recent months to learn its “fertility secret,” state-run Xinhua News Agency said this month, as the Chinese leadership tries to replicate its success nationwide and reverse a stubbornly shrinking population. It also announced a gradual shift toward free preschool education, expanded state health-care coverage for childbirth and improved pediatric services — many of which Tianmen introduced in 2023. Tianmen's ability to quickly boost fertility shows the importance of comprehensive support for families, but it may be difficult to sustain or replicate elsewhere, said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Melbourne, Australia, who focuses on China's demography. China became the world's second-largest economy partly because young people worked hard to achieve a better life. It also left behind a generation of young women determined to make their own choices about having children, free from state interference.</p>

However, Lee implied that some members of the commission's decision-making committee were reluctant to recognize cases in which adoptees had yet to prove beyond doubt that the biological details in their adoption papers had been falsified — either by meeting their birth parents or confirming information about them. Authorities provided no meaningful oversight as adoption agencies engaged in dubious or illicit practices while competing to send more children abroad. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies. It said the government “actively utilized” foreign adoptions, which “required no budget allocation,” rather than strengthening a social safety net for needy children.</p>

Their worst-case scenario now is to be forced into further rounds of qualification. In a slightly less dramatic reality, given Australia's goal difference now stands at plus-seven compared to their rivals' minus-two, a draw in that contest would almost certainly be enough for the Australians to punch their tickets to North America, as would a win over Japan in the preceding game. It's not always pretty but it's an approach that helped the coach once grind out an Asian Champions League crown and one which could now send him to a World Cup. Jackson Irvine is in career-best form and Nishan Velupillay can't stop scoring. Our definition of it isn't just to sit behind the ball and defend deep.</p>

The United States has named India, along with China, a "state actor" in enabling direct and indirect supply of precursor chemicals for illicit fentanyl drug production by criminal organisations. "China remains the primary source country for illicit fentanyl precursor chemicals and pill pressing equipment, followed by India," it added. Last year's report mentioned India as just one of several countries from where the Mexican groups were sourcing chemicals to a "lesser extent". Earlier this month, Trump said his administration would not rest until "we have ended the fentanyl epidemic in America once and for all." However, India is in talks with America to expedite a free trade deal that could help it avoid some of these taxes.</p>

Opposition lawmakers argued that she has been unduly influenced by her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Paetongtarn received 319 votes, with 161 voting against her and seven abstaining in the first no-confidence vote she faced since she took office last year after another Pheu Thai prime minister was removed by the Constitutional Court after it found he'd committed a serious ethical breach. Afterward, she posted on social media thanking all parties for taking part in the vote. “Every vote, whether in support or in opposition, is a force that will drive me and the Cabinet to continue to devoutly work for the people,” she wrote.</p>

Just this weekend, a Canadian professor warned that illegal immigration and drug smuggling in Canada would hit the roof, all thanks to Donald Trump's strict border policies. “I hope I'm wrong, but it would appear that we're going to be overwhelmed by the illegal immigrants fleeing American authorities coming into our country, and they very well might be bringing guns and drugs with them,” he said. While it's obvious that with Donald Trump back in the US, migrants are switching paths because they fear his policies to curb illegal immigration, these numbers had reportedly already started mounting even before the Trump administration returned to power with full swing. Sources contended that migrants are also illegally crossing into Canada “to avoid any immigration consequences that may happen if their case isn't adjudicated in their favour.” Moreover, they're keen on entering Canada before federal immigration agents working for Trump's mass deportation bid nab them. As per the New York Times, Canadian border authorities caught roughly 20 illegal migrants so far this year in Alberta.</p>

An official familiar with negotiations, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss them freely, said Russia is using the results to now demand that President Donald Trump lift sanctions, “and in doing so, they're even trying to steal from him the sense of success in his diplomacy.” Andriy Klymenko, head of the Black Sea Institute of Strategic Studies, said Russia's and Ukraine's positions remain “irreconcilable” and that the new agreements appear to amount only to “rhetorical acrobatics.” “Meanwhile, the Russians believe they've secured a massive rollback of sanctions — which isn't mentioned anywhere.” Later, in his daily evening address to the nation, Zelensky thanked Washington for its contributions and said Russia's behavior this week “will reveal a lot — if not everything.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday that the resumption of the Black Sea initiative was “agreeable” but that “we cannot take this man's word for it,” referring to Zelensky.</p>

“China will not sit idly by when its security interests are harmed or threatened,” the ministry said in February. Other American allies in Asia, including Japan, have so far balked at hosting U.S. missiles capable of striking China, but are developing their own comparable capabilities. Similar views have been espoused by some senior Trump appointees, including Andrew Byers, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for South and Southeast Asia, who has favored a less contentious relationship with Beijing.

“There is no aid, and only a few supplies are available in the market at extremely high prices.” Al Jazeera reporter Hossam Shabat was killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza on Monday, months after the Israeli military accused him of being a member of Hamas, an allegation rejected by Al Jazeera and condemned by the Committee to Protect Journalists as a “smear campaign.” Al Jazeera Media Network, in a statement early Tuesday, strongly condemned what it called Shabat's “assassination” and asked that the international community condemn Israel's “systematic killing of journalists.” It also accused Shabat of carrying out “attacks against IDF troops and Israeli civilians” but did not provide any evidence to support its claim. Israel's airstrikes into Lebanon had been intense and deadly, killing over 1,400 people including Hasan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's longtime leader.</p>

Agricultural experts said they were confused by the latest proposal, noting that while a prior agreement on shipping through the Black Sea had broken down in 2023, both Ukraine and Russia had been able to find ways to export their grain since then. “We believe that would weaken our position and the sanctions regime,” Zelensky said at a news conference. “Oral bilateral agreements can only be considered as the first step towards achieving a binding trilateral agreement,” said Nikolai Petrov, an expert with the New Eurasian Strategies Center, a think tank founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The talks in Riyadh over recent days came less than two years after Moscow unilaterally withdrew from an agreement to allow Black Sea grain exports from Ukraine, claiming that its demands to allow the export of Russian grain and fertilizer were not being met. Sizov said he thought it was unlikely that the U.S. proposal on Tuesday would affect global prices.</p>

He had campaigned in October last year by saying there would be “no new stadiums”. Victoria Park has been pushed for more than a year in certain quarters of the city. Crisafulli's “no new stadiums” promise was largely pitched at voters in Queensland's regional cities, which were critical to the LNP's election win. There are those who will be sceptical that this plan is above politics, when it appears so clearly designed to appease regional voters and other interest groups. Building a new (and more expensive) stadium at Victoria Park shifts that flashpoint north of the river.</p>

Gabbard, however, added that in the past years, it was seen that there has been "an erosion of a decades-long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus." Earlier in October 2024 also, the United States said it believes that Iran has not decided to build a nuclear weapon despite Tehran's strategic setbacks, including Israel's killing of Hezbollah leaders and two largely unsuccessful attempts to attack Israel. The report also noted that Iranian investment in its military has been a key plank of its efforts to confront diverse threats and try to deter and defend against an attack by the United States or Israel. It, however, added that Iranian political and economic struggles could be fodder for renewed domestic political unrest and protest inside Iran, unless Iran is granted sanctions relief.</p>

Mr Thompson, a father of two high school-aged children, had worked for decades at UnitedHealthcare and its parent company. Similar accommodations have been granted to other defendants at the facility where Mangione is being held. Defence lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo countered in the filing that there is "no connection to Mr. Mangione for any of said alleged threats." Mangione, an Ivy League-educated computer science graduate from a Maryland real estate family, has pleaded not guilty to the state charges. He also faces a parallel federal case that could result in the death penalty but has not yet entered a plea to those charges or to state-level gun possession and other charges in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested days after Thompson's death.</p>

With the Donald Trump administration's heightened immigration policies, several Indian individuals on H-1B visas and Green Cards have quite surprisingly been deported or forced to go through detention procedures. Immigration attorneys are now advising caution, especially for those planning to travel abroad. ALSO READ| Why are some Indian H-1B visa and Green Card holders being deported? Unlike EB-5, which had an annual cap, the gold card appears to have no actual limit. That being said, the green card backlog is so vast that the vast majority of Indian professionals are stuck in it; there's nothing to make it easier.</p>

The leader of Turkey's primary opposition party visited jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu on Tuesday, as sustained protests calling for his release entered their seventh night. After a two-hour visit with Imamoglu on Tuesday, Ozgur Ozel, who leads the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), sounded defiant. Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya accused opposition protesters of provocations and incitement, including more than 40 people who were detained for “vile insults” that targeted Erdogan's family. In a statement Tuesday, Turkey's Media and Law Studies Association said 11 journalists have been taken into custody for covering the protests. Turkey's political crisis also threatens to imperil the country's economy, which was already struggling after a long streak of high inflation.</p>

Moscow's statement further noted that the deal envisages a lifting of restrictions on Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial institutions involved in the international sale of food and fertilizers, as well as a removal of sanctions on its vessels, port services, and ability to purchase agricultural machinery and related goods. The White House did not provide details, but President Donald Trump confirmed that his administration is indeed considering lifting some of the sanctions against Moscow. “We did not agree to this so that it would be in a joint document. The US and Russia agreed to revive the defunct Black Sea Grain Initiative following 12 hours of talks focused on the Ukraine conflict which were held on Monday in Saudi Arabia by expert groups from both countries. Now, Russia needs ironclad guarantees from the US, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said, arguing that only a “direct order” from Washington could compel Kiev to observe any agreement.</p>

"Germany and Canada require paper ballots when tabulating votes, while the United States has a patchwork of methods that often lack basic chain-of-custody protections," he added. Trump's order also stated that while countries like Denmark and Sweden "sensibly" limit mail-in voting to those unable to vote in person and do not count late-arriving votes regardless of the date of postmark, many American elections now feature mass voting by mail, with many officials accepting ballots without postmarks or those received well after Election Day. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 18 US states along with Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Washington, DC, will count ballots that are postmarked on or before Election Day, regardless of when they arrive. Donald Trump's order also barred foreign nationals from contributing or donating in US elections.</p>

Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus on Tuesday said Bangladesh was witnessing a "festival of rumours" against his administration, blaming it on "the defeated force" -- an apparent reference to deposed premier Sheikh Hasina's regime. Home Ministry Senior Secretary Nasimul Ghani recently said that the country is in a wartime mode. Yunus, however, said his administration sought United Nations cooperation to prevent the spread of rumours and disinformation and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who recently visited Bangladesh, "assured us of extending the cooperation". Deposed premier Hasina's regime was ousted in a student-led mass protest spearheaded by now-defunct Students against Discrimination on August 5, 2024.

Russian foreign minister's comments come after Kyiv and Moscow agree to maritime ceasefire, despite Kremlin citing need for sanctions relief first. A Black Sea maritime security deal aims to bring Moscow back to predictable grain and fertiliser markets that would allow for profit and ensure global food security, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said in remarks published late on Tuesday. Donald Trump, during a phone conversation this month with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, suggested the US could help run and possibly own Ukraine's nuclear power plants, including Zaporizhzhia. Estonia's top diplomat said Russia has gained an upper hand in the ceasefire talks and suggested the US consider a time limit if there is no progress, ahead of a meeting with secretary of state Marco Rubio. Ukraine's SBU security service said on Tuesday it had detained a serviceman in the Sumy region it accused of helping Moscow attack Ukrainian troops fighting in Russia's Kursk region by giving away their location.</p>

Donald Trump brutally shut down CNN's Kaitlan Collins during a press briefing on Tuesday, March 25, when she attempted to question him about the “Signal” messaging incident that involved various top administration officials. However, before Collins could even finish her sentence, Trump replied sharply, “Excuse me, I didn't pick you.” However, he later defended National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who was allegedly responsible for Goldberg's unexpected inclusion. During a press conference at the Oval Office in February, Collins asked Trump, “Do you trust President Putin?” Trump also criticised Collins' network, saying Biden is a “friend of CNN.” “That's why nobody watches CNN anymore.</p>

And, with the security of Europe under greater strain than at any time almost in living memory, can its leaders, who are currently scrabbling around, find an adequate response? Some think the division is about more than Trump's particular views and that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to end. Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative government, told me earlier this month: "I think Article 5 is on life support. There is a short list of "very important things" that only the United States currently provides, according to historian Timothy Garton Ash. Ms van Rij stresses that, in her view, Europe does need to build a Europe-owned European defence industrial base - but she foresees difficulties.</p>

Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Georgia, an important presidential battleground, virtually all in-person voters use voting machines with a large touchscreen to record their votes. Representatives for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger did not immediately respond Tuesday evening to messages seeking comment. The Georgia Legislature last year passed a law requiring that QR codes be removed from ballots by July 2026. Other states have followed suit, most recently Kansas — which passed a nearly identical bill earlier this month after hearing testimony from Ohio's secretary of state.</p>

Relatives of Venezuelans jailed in El Salvador joined a government-sponsored rally on Tuesday demanding their release and return to the country. El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have any consular support from their government either. Even Salvadoran citizens have been living under a state of emergency that has suspended fundamental rights since 2022 and the country's judiciary is not considered independent. The U.S. government would pay an annual fee for their incarceration, Bukele wrote in a post on X. El Salvador has lived under a state of emergency since March 2022, when Congress granted Bukele extraordinary powers to fight the country's powerful street gangs.</p>

A 1,300-year-old Buddhist temple is among buildings destroyed after dry and windy weather saw mostly contained blazes spread again Wind-driven wildfires that were among South Korea's worst ever are ravaging southern regions, killing 18 people, destroying more than 200 structures and forcing 27,000 people to evacuate, officials said on Wednesday. The Uiseong fire, only 68% contained and exacerbated by strong winds, shows “unimaginable” scale and speed, said Lee Byung-doo, a forest disaster expert at the National Institute of Forest Science. The justice ministry did not immediately confirm local reports that it had begun relocating 2,600 inmates from a prison in Cheongsong county, also near Uiseong. Human-caused climate breakdown is responsible for a higher likelihood of fire and bigger burned areas in southern Europe, northern Eurasia, the US and Australia, with some scientific evidence of increases in southern China.</p>

President Donald Trump has signed an executive order introducing stricter election rules in the United States, including requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration and ensuring all ballots are received by Election Day. The order is expected to face legal challenges, as states have broad authority over election rules. It aligns with Trump's longstanding criticism of election processes, as he has frequently claimed rigging even before results are announced, news agency Associated Press reported. Currently, 18 states and Puerto Rico allow mailed ballots received after Election Day if they are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Trump's directive is expected to face legal challenges, as the Constitution grants states authority over elections.</p>

Waltz said he was not sure how Goldberg ended up on the chat. Later on Tuesday, Waltz said in an appearance on Fox News Channel's “The Ingraham Angle” that he built the message chain and that White House technical experts were trying to figure out how Goldberg's contact “may have been sucked in.” On Signal, Trump said “we won't be using it very much” in the future. One official reported to be on the Signal chain, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, acknowledged during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday that she was travelling overseas during the exchange.</p>

Public accounts committee also flags ‘persistent digital skills shortages' and uncompetitive civil service pay rates The government's ambition to boost efficiency by embedding AI in all aspects of its work risks being undermined by out-of-date technology, poor quality data and a lack of skilled staff, an influential Commons committee has warned. The report by the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) found that more than 20 government IT systems identified as “legacy”, meaning out of date and unsupported, have yet to be given funding to improve them. An official plan for the technology published in January called for the government to “rapidly pilot” AI-powered services, saying this would both increase productivity and improve people's experience of dealing with officialdom. It also calls for action to improve public confidence in the transparency and standards for how AI is used in government, saying that as of January this year, just 33 official records had been published setting out algorithm-assisted decisions and how they are made.</p>

Block, Jack Dorsey's financial technology company, plans to let go almost 1,000 current employees, while making other changes to its operations in its second such move in just over a year. Dorsey, who co-founded and previously ran Twitter before co-founding Block in 2009, informed employees of the impending cuts on Tuesday in an email, viewed by the Guardian, titled “smaller block”. The layoffs will impact more than 930 employees, with another nearly 200 managers being moved into non-management roles, and another nearly 800 open jobs will be closed, according to the email. Its revenue and profits have grown less over the last year, creating shareholder concern, even as Dorsey has taken back more operating control during that time. A spokesperson for Block did not respond to calls and email seeking comment.</p>

"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before," Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S. Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households. Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a defining policy of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.

After a delayed announcement, Mr. Trump said he is imposing a 25% tariff on all vehicles imported into the U.S. "This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before," he said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. New tariffs on U.S. car imports could drive up vehicle costs between $2,000 and $12,200 for some models, Anderson Economic Group has estimated. "The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence," Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors. He added, "Even those who might agree with the long-term benefits of tariffs have to acknowledge there will be a multi-quarter period of substantial disruption to the economy, with softer growth and higher inflation." A new analysis by Oxford Economics found that U.S. tariffs could raise the cost of some products by as much as 4%, with home appliances, musical instruments, tableware and utensils, and personal care items potentially seeing the biggest price hikes.</p>

Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said it was a "lie" to say that information discussed in the Signal chat would not be considered classified. The messages released today showed that a text from Defense Secretary Pete  Hegseth about imminent military strikes in Yemen were highly detailed. “Our committees have serious questions about this incident, and members need a full accounting to ensure it never happens again,” the senators wrote.</p>

The Atlantic on Wednesday published a transcript of text messages showing that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth detailed U.S. military attack plans in Yemen in a Signal group chat that inadvertently included the magazine's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg. When reached for comment, the White House referred NBC News to Leavitt's post. The National Security Council said Monday it was reviewing how Goldberg was accidentally added to a group text on Signal, an encrypted messaging platform that is widely believed to be more secure than other commercial texting applications but traditionally isn't used for high-level government communications. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Wednesday that he believes Gabbard and Ratcliffe “intentionally misled Congress yesterday in trying to make us believe that this was a casual conversation.” Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said Wednesday he would request an “expedited” Inspector General report into the matter.</p>

In a testy exchange with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard insist that no classified information was shared in the group chat about U.S. war plans that was sent to a journalist. FBI Director Kash Patel, joined at right by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, answers questions as the House Intelligence Committee holds a hearing on worldwide threats, at the Capitol, in Washington, Wednesday, March 26, 2025. Wednesday's hearing was called to discuss an updated report on national security threats facing the U.S. “You all know that's a lie,” Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, told Ratcliffe and Gabbard, who said that any decisions to classify or declassify military information falls to the secretary of defense. The discussion at times grew heated as Ratcliffe and Democratic lawmakers spoke over one another.</p>

Washington — Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal that included sensitive details about military strikes in Yemen after more text messages came to light and revealed new details about what was shared. Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if "its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations." "The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. "This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned."</p>

President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials — and inadvertently, one journalist — on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed. Speaking Wednesday during a congressional hearing, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said "the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices." On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying no "war plans" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had "provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible." Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m. She has combined open-source investigation methods with on-the-ground reporting to cover conflict, terrorism, and misinformation for over 15 years.</p>

She has expressed skepticism that any federal funds should go to public broadcasting. Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., and Rep. Scott Perry, R-Penn., introduced legislation to bar all funding for the CPB. Meanwhile, Brendan Carr, President Trump's newly appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has also initiated inquiries of NPR and PBS stations, arguing that their corporate underwriting spots violate federal laws and policies because they too closely resemble commercial advertisements.

Josh Hawley asked FBI Director Kash Patel Wednesday to look into alleged Biden-era abuses against Christians, urging Patel in a new letter to crack down on what the Missouri Republican described as First Amendment violations he said were carried out under the Biden administration. He also urged Patel to release by April 30 information compiled by the FBI's Richmond, Virginia, field office – including a memo that labeled certain traditionalist Catholics as potential "security risks" – and to address possible violations of the FACE Act, which Hawley said targeted pro-life protesters. But those responsible must be held accountable," Hawley said in the letter. Hawley zeroed in on these issues during Patel's confirmation hearing earlier this year.</p>

Atlantic magazine editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg reported that he was accidentally added to the Signal chat by a user named Mike Waltz. "We've got the best technical minds looking at how this happened," Waltz continued, adding that Goldberg's number had not been on his phone. When pressed further by show host Laura Ingraham on how the number got added, Waltz responded: "Well, if you have somebody else's contact, then somehow it … gets sucked in. Speaking to Newsmax, Trump said somebody who worked with Mike Waltz at a lower level had Goldberg's phone number.

Global stock markets mostly slipped Wednesday as investors digested conflicting signals from President Donald Trump about his coming wave of tariffs. In Europe, Paris and Frankfurt closed down while London edged up as data showed an unexpected slowdown to UK annual inflation. "All the tariff talk uncertainty has led to a sharp drop in confidence," said David Morrison, analyst at Trade Nation. The president told Newsmax on Tuesday that he did not "want to have too many exceptions" but added: "I'll probably be more lenient than reciprocal, because if I was reciprocal, that would be very tough for people." Trump's talk of tariff exemptions had earlier helped some Asian markets edge higher after recent slumps.</p>

National intelligence head Tusli Gabbard and CIA director John Ratcliffe argue ‘no classified information' was leaked “Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships. Democratic congressman Jimmy Gomez prompted fury from the witnesses when he asked Gabbard and Ratcliffe if they knew whether Hegseth, who pledged not to consume alcohol during his confirmation process after reports emerged that he had a history of excessive drinking, may have been under the influence when using the chat. When Ratcliffe and Gabbard appeared before a Senate intelligence committee hearing on Tuesday, Democrats questioned them extensively about the Signal group, while Republicans either avoided the topic or said they would ask about it in a private session. “I think President Trump has handled this matter well,” Republican senator Lindsey Graham said on Wednesday.</p>

Welcome to Day Three of "SignalGate," the fast-growing political controversy over at least 18 Trump administration officials' use of an unsecured Signal chat to discuss real-time attacks on Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month – as journalist Jeffrey Goldberg took notes for a magazine article he later published. But some Democratic lawmakers attacked chat participants for discussing military operations ahead of time that could have gotten U.S. troops killed if those details fell into the wrong hands. That's one reason U.S. officials are required to use more secure government-approved communications channels when discussing military operations, former National Security Agency official Gavin Wilde and other experts told USA TODAY. Compounding that concern is the fact that Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate tycoon and Trump golfing buddy and diplomatic envoy, was meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin while he was in the chat group, discussing a resolution of his country's war against Ukraine. Waltz told Fox News Tuesday night that he took “full responsibility for inviting a reporter into the chat.</p>

After the vague and evasive assertions by Trump officials at Monday's Senate intelligence committee hearing, from the White House, and from the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, that no war plans or classified material was shared, readers can make up their own minds. The strong suspicion voiced by a number of commentators is that this group, like other senior officials in the Trump administration, have been using services like Signal to avoid oversight despite potentially being in breach of federal laws on record retention. In other words, lives were casually put at risk to shirk another significant responsibility of the highest offices: accountability. But whether or not they will resign or be dismissed by a dysfunctional president, equally hostile to the notion he should be held accountable, is an open question. What should be clear to already shocked allies of the US is that not only is intelligence and other sensitive material not safe in the hands of Trump's senior security officials, but that they cannot be counted on to be truthful individually or as a group.</p>

When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth landed in Hawaii on Monday, making his first trip to the Pacific region as Pentagon chief, he brushed aside a journalist's questions about the blockbuster magazine article exposing how he and other top Trump administration officials had discussed sensitive military planning using an unclassified communication application, a major breach of government security norms. But Abrams did not lead the consortium, and group officials have repeatedly said she only served in an advisory role. Trump officials knew their legal justification for terminating dozens of Environmental Protection Agency grants was flawed, according to documents and internal emails reviewed by The Washington Post. “I believe there was discussion around targets in general,” Gabbard told Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona), a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. But in doing so, she acknowledged Goldberg was on the thread where top Trump officials were plotting a military operation targeting Yemen's Houthi militants.</p>

Cybersecurity experts widely consider Signal to be the leading easy-to-use encrypted messaging service, and there are no public reports of its ever having been compromised by hackers. Facing pressure from his right flank to take on judges who have ruled against Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., today floated the possibility of Congress eliminating some federal courts. "Of course, I don't want it all out there, because these were conversations back and forth that you should be able to have confidentially." “Well, I think it would be helpful, certainly,” Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the committee's ranking member, told NBC News today about whether he wants Hegseth to testify. "We are especially concerned that the reported deliberations may have constituted a security breach, because they relied upon an electronic messaging application that is not approved as a secure method for communicating classified information and because they inadvertently included at least one non-governmental party," read the letter, which was addressed to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz.</p>

Some 53 people were killed in the 15 March airstrikes, which US officials said targeted Iran-aligned Houthi rebels who have threatened maritime trade and Israel. Colorado's Michael Bennet accused those involved in the chat of sloppiness, incompetence and disrespect for US intelligence agencies.

The annual hearing on worldwide threats before the Senate Intelligence Committee offered a glimpse of the new administration's reorienting of priorities at a time when President Donald Trump has opened a new line of communication with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and as his administration has focused national security attention closer to home to counter violent crime that officials link to cross-border drug trafficking.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would make the announcement earlier today during a news briefing with reporters. While Wednesday's tariffs seem to only target finished auto products, existing tariffs on Chinese goods, for example, are affecting costs for domestic automotive production due to the number of parts imported from the country. Trump has deemed April 2, the day on which he is slated to announce further tariffs, "Liberation Day" for the US, saying other countries have "ripped [us] off" and that any new tariffs are "reciprocal." While the costs of the new auto tariffs on foreign imports are hard to quantify, analysis from various data firms suggest price hikes of $3,000 to as much as $12,000 for non-premium autos.

The Trump administration is also widely expected to restart involuntary collections on defaulted student loans sometime this year, though it's unclear if they have a plan worked out for resuming that process, which can involve garnishing paychecks and government benefits like Social Security payments.

At an event outside of Tokyo on Wednesday, the Japanese automaker said 10 new and updated vehicles are coming to North America by 2027. An emphasis on smart cars and making more compelling products for markets like China are “going to require a lot of work and a lot of investment that probably will need some partner,” said Ivan Espinosa, Nissan's new CEO, per Bloomberg. “There's another avenue, which is who should you partner with in order to develop this intelligent part of the future. Tesla and others refuted the deal, though Foxconn has been open to partnering with Nissan in some capacity. A new partner with cash or the ability to share development costs can't come soon enough for Nissan.</p>

Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell more than 5% on Wednesday as a new report suggested Chinese environmental rules could impact the AI giant's sales in China. Nvidia shares sank after the Financial Times reported Chinese regulators are encouraging firms to use data center chips that meet strict environmental requirements. However, the analysts said, "Positively for third-party data center operators, our checks point to Google (GOOG) stepping into backfill capacity that Microsoft walked away from in international markets, while our checks point to Meta (META) backfilling capacity in the U.S." The analysis follows a note from TD Cowen in February stating Microsoft recently canceled an unspecified number of data center leases. Renewed fears of an overextended AI trade surfaced earlier this month after chipmaker Marvell Technology's (MRVL) revenue outlook failed to impress investors, and semiconductor stocks fell.</p>

Over the past year, Meta (META), Dropbox (DBX), hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, Trade Desk (TTD), Fidelity National Financial (FNF), and Sonoma Pharmaceuticals (SNOA) have all floated plans to move their incorporations.

“We continue to see value seeking behavior across all customer groups,” Dollar Tree CEO Michael Creedon said on a call with analysts Wednesday. The combined company hoped that by joining forces it could grow its customer base, reduce costs and fend off Dollar General, which is located primarily in rural areas. “Our customers continue to report that their financial situation has worsened over the last year as they have been negatively impacted by ongoing inflation,” Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said on an earnings call Thursday.

We have an algorithmic tool called GeoMatch that takes historical administrative data from refugee or asylum seeker resettlement programs. One project is with the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance, which runs the state's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and a supplemental program that provides rebates when SNAP dollars are spent on fruits and vegetables at certain vendors. It's very costly to the government because they're essentially giving out produce with a 100 percent rebate.

While all equities generally move up and down according to people's belief in them, Tesla represents a pure example of faith investing because so much of its implied value is tied up in future endeavors. This week's rally also coincided with some good news on tariffs, lifting the "Magnificent Seven." Take Cathie Wood, who told our colleagues why Tesla stock would be worth $2,600 — essentially adding a zero to the current level — within five years. That thesis is entirely underpinned by robotaxis, which Wood says will make up 90% of the company's value.

Though he declines to name his clients, Dezenhall has reportedly worked with large corporations like General Electric, Exxon Mobil, and Procter & Gamble. If he stays with DOGE and keeps the slash-and-burn at this pace, it will be hard to balance both. If Musk remains at DOGE, do you really think new products would be enough for Tesla to overcome his political ambitions that are alienating customers? If Musk comes up with something amazing, people may revisit their sentiments, but I have no idea what that could be. Bloomberg just reported that Tesla chair Robyn Denholm refused to answer questions at an event about Musk and whether he was too distracted.</p>

TPG, a global alternative asset management firm, has agreed to acquire a majority stake in Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy's wind turbine generator businesses in India and Sri Lanka. Mint reported in May last year that Siemens Energy had put up for sale Siemens Gamesa's India wind turbine unit to cut losses and return its global wind turbine business to profitability by 2026. MAVCO Investments, backed by some Murugappa group family members, and former JSW Energy chief executive Prashant Jain will also make minority investments in Siemens Gamesa's India and Sri Lanka businesses. This ensures continued support and development in this vibrant market, while Siemens Gamesa can concentrate on other core markets,” Philip said in the statement.

Warren said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell raised this possibility during a press conference last Wednesday when he said in no uncertain terms that Trump's trade agenda would be likely to drive up prices, even amid considerable uncertainty about whether the price changes would be "transitory." Powell offered the example of washing machines that were hit with duties during Trump's first term. In a speech earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged the Fed to look at any tariff-related price hikes that way — while also digging the Fed for its handling of pandemic-era inflation it expected to be transitory but didn't turn out that way. Last week on the "All In" podcast, Lutnick noted that "inflation doesn't come from tariffs." "I have repeatedly called on [the president] to protect consumers from corporate price-gouging associated with tariffs," Warren said.</p>

"No one wants to sit because they are sitting forever in traffic, it has impacted us a lot,” said owner Theodora Tzouvaras. The restaurant, which serves burgers, sandwiches, fries and, of course, alcoholic beverages, was down $1,500 from last St. Patrick's Day, Hill said. Warehouse and factory workers would typically take the five minute drive to Townsquare Diner for lunch, said owner Pete Sederas. Tzouvaras of Theodora's Pizzeria, a staple in the Wharton community since 1996, said for her business "it feels like COVID again." Major League Barbers on South Main Street is another Wharton business that has been struggling since the sinkhole swallowed Route 80.</p>

A bankruptcy filing by personalized genomics firm 23andMe (ME) calls into question what happens to its most valuable asset: genetic data from 15 million customers. In exchange for a fee, customers received gene-based health indicators, ancestral histories, and subscription services that provided them with control over their data. And its assets — potentially including customer biometric data — become the property of a bankruptcy estate that is legally protected from creditors. One hope for customers worried about the safety of their data is that bankruptcy courts are accustomed to protecting individual healthcare records in proceedings involving hospitals or doctors' practices. But 23andMe falls into a gray area because its customers are not technically patients, and protecting healthcare information is tangential to the ombudsman role.</p>

GameStop GME shares are up some 15% on Wednesday, March 26 after the gaming merchandise retailer announced plans of using its corporate cash to buy Bitcoin BTCUSD. Today, the Virginia-headquartered firm owns more than 500,000 BTC in total, while its share price sits at about $33. GameStop shares may be worth buying at current levels because the retailer's earnings release also showed signed of improvement on Wednesday. While things seem to be picking up for GameStop, investors should note that Wall Street remains bearish as ever on GME shares. However, investors should note that Barchart is only tracking one analyst in coverage of GME.</p>

The chief investment officer said that the bitcoin of today has matured and become legitimized and accepted in a way it was not even five or 10 years ago. He pointed to institutional investors, hedge funds, ETFs and more than 70 corporations that now keep bitcoin as part of their holdings. Long term: extraordinarily bullish," Hougan said, sharing Bitwise's current outlook for bitcoin.</p>

That's because Bitcoin has historically been uncorrelated with any major asset class, including both the S&P 500 and tech stocks. This correlation is a mathematical measurement telling you how connected Bitcoin's moves (up or down) are with the broader market. However, discussions of trade tariffs and economic tightening measures from the White House often lead to a negative shift in sentiment. On rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. Right now, we're issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.</p>

He surprised me by confidently declaring, “You should've invested in gold instead of Bitcoin.” His comment wasn't just casual financial advice; it echoed a broader sentiment that's growing among investors lately. This behavior has been consistent throughout economic downturns, including the financial crisis of 2008, where gold prices soared in response to uncertainty. Secondly, regulators must recognize that traditional regulatory frameworks suitable for gold and other commodities may not directly apply to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. As digital assets become increasingly mainstream, Bitcoin's correlation with technology sectors, particularly blockchain and fintech, might strengthen, further distancing itself from gold. Rather than seeing Bitcoin purely as digital gold, recognizing its unique dynamics can guide better investment strategies, regulatory policies, and market analysis.</p>

Bitcoin, the digital currency and virtual payment system, has grown increasingly popular in recent years. Unlike traditional banking methods, however, cash withdrawals are made through a QR code that the machine provides. Bitcoin is a type of digital currency that can be bought, sold, and mined. It's run on the Blockchain, a record-keeping system of computers that tracks crypto transactions. Scammers will impersonate a government official, tech support, or business and urge victims to remove cash out of their bank accounts and instead deposit it into a Bitcoin ATM for added "protection."</p>

Bitcoin's recent relief rally, which took the original cryptocurrency to a two-week high on Monday, is at risk of being short-lived as broader market uncertainty continues to keep investors on the sidelines. 

A lack of bullish momentum, low volumes and ongoing macro tensions are combining to create the conditions for what some traders say is a potential “bull trap” in a directionless market. Market experts point to macroeconomic risks, including potential tariff escalations, inflation concerns, and geopolitical instability, which continue to cast a shadow over Bitcoin's price action.</p>

Furthermore, it uncovered early hints that ketone supplements may offer some protection against certain measures of brain aging. That raised the question of whether ketone supplements might be able to slow brain aging. They also considered only specific fMRI data, which may not reflect all aspects of brain aging, so we don't know if ketone supplements would help across the board. Mujica-Parodi said future studies could track brain aging in people taking these supplements over time and thus provide more insight into its long-term potential.

Anecdotal reports suggest drugs like Ozempic may curb not just appetite but also impulsive or addictive behaviour, hinting at links between metabolic health and our brains These quotes were all collected in a recent study led by Davide Arillotta at the University of Florence, Italy, from Reddit's weight-loss forums. Here, you will find many people rhapsodising about the benefits of drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. Among the comments, however, you will frequently find reports of other – wholly unexpected – behavioural changes. If this anecdotal data can be supported by controlled clinical trials, it may tell us a lot about how the brain processes anticipation and reward – and could also suggest whole new ways of dealing with addiction.</p>

With many companies racing to market rival versions of semaglutide in cheaper and easier-to-take forms, as well as mounting evidence that that GLP-1 drugs can target a host of health conditions, the treatments could have an impact that goes way beyond reversing the worldwide trend of rising obesity and possibly even putting a dent in alcohol sales.

For decades, conventional wisdom held that, to lose weight, you must eat less and move more. By suppressing appetite, they help tackle the first part of that equation, typically leading to dramatic weight loss. So, these results suggest that both deteriorate when taking weight-loss drugs, says Signe Sørensen Torekov at the University of Copenhagen. Because these drugs lead people to consume fewer calories, the body must break down fat, muscle and even bone for nutrients.

Feltman: I know you've done some writing on how naming conventions can change the way we talk about invasive species. And so it was like, “Do we wanna say ‘Japanese knotweed'?” First off, is that accurate? And then second off, we don't know where everyone's coming from when they read the label ... Heberling: Groups of people, but there are other things that aren't necessarily offensive—there's nothing offensive about “Japanese knotweed,” for instance—but it's more about the tone and how it's presented and also the biological accuracy of where exactly is this plant from.

For the many bony fishes, it's no longer a surprise to detect various chirps, hums or growls. Yet the evolutionary sister-branch, sharks and rays, built with cartilage, have been slower to get recognized for sounding off. She worked with 10 sharks and recorded multiple clickity bouts, averaging about nine clicks during a 20-second grasp. Sharks are sensitive to their watery world though and can detect the tickles of changing electric fields.

Ten juvenile rig sharks were observed making sounds by accident during routine behavioral experiments at the University of Auckland's Leigh Marine Laboratory. Rig sharks have broad, blunt teeth arranged in tightly packed, plate-like formations, which are ideal for crushing hard-shelled prey like crabs. The scientists observed that about 70% of these clicks were accompanied by calm, swaying body movements, but a few occurred without any visible motion at all. However, some known predators of rig sharks, such as New Zealand fur seals (Arctocephalus forsteri), are sensitive to higher frequencies and might be startled or confused by the sharp clicks.

It is widely considered to be a leading easy-to-use, encrypted messaging service among cybersecurity experts, since there are no public reports of hackers intercepting users' messages in-transit by cracking the platform's end-to-end encryption protocol. Signal's end-to-end encryption technology is open-source, meaning that developers can take a look under the hood and verify its security. Last year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommended that American citizens use encrypted messaging apps like Signal to keep their messages private. This work has been completed for some time and is unrelated to any current events,” the organisation said in a post on X. While it is not possible to fully remove the risks associated with encrypted chat apps like Signal, here are a few ways you can minimise them:</p>

This is another challenging question that I think each person needs to answer on his or her own. But my simplest advice is just to use much less of it than we usually do. This follows advice that Aristotle, one of my favorite philosophers, gives in the “Nicomachean Ethics.” There, Aristotle says that good moral characteristics are usually a middle ground between two extremes: for example, like courage is in between timidity and being overly rash. Additionally, philosophical reflection on what's required for a flourishing human life is perennial — since humans haven't changed that much in the past 3,000 years, neither has the relevance of philosophers' arguments about what makes our lives go well.

What began as a high-tech conference on Maui with 300 attendees more than 25 years ago has grown into a gathering of more than 1,300 people from 25 countries. Nishimoto rose to become a senior manager, then started his own business Pacific Defense Solutions developing software. He sold his software company to KBR and has begun a new startup business, EO Solutions, which works as a subcontractor with KBR focusing on the use of software and artificial intelligence. He said the MEDB also makes sure the conference is culturally sensitive and follows protocols established decades ago to foster not only respect but also participation by native Hawaiian cultural experts. Conference organizers said that so far in the last 25 years, it has welcomed over 17,000 international participants from 42 countries.</p>

PHOENIX — Several high-profile technology companies have set up operations in Arizona, sparking concerns about the environmental impact of their services. Arizona currently has about 118 data centers, most of which sit within metro Phoenix. In fact, Ren said a medium-sized data center uses the same amount of energy as around 300,000 households. Ren said it's important to look at the cost-benefit analysis of data centers because water use and energy demand will be quite substantial in Arizona due to its hot, arid climate. As technology companies flock to Arizona, setting up various data centers and other facilities, one expert considers their environmental impact.</p>

However, Starlink might encounter fierce competition from Chinese satellite broadband providers like SpaceSail in the foreseeable future. Elon Musk's goal for Starlink is to acquire at least 1 million new users each year, a target that could gain significant momentum following its launch in India. The telecom regulator is poised to allocate spectrum for satellite services, with consultations from stakeholders and experts nearly complete. Once the necessary regulatory approval and spectrum allocation from the Government of India are secured, Starlink is set to officially begin its operations, especially now that it has partnered with Jio and Airtel, which bodes well for a timely approval. Meanwhile, the government's efforts to tackle cyber fraud are intensifying and show no signs of slowing down.</p>

China's Foreign Ministry also lashed back, saying the entity list and other export controls were an abuse meant to “unjustly suppress Chinese enterprises.” China firmly opposes and strongly condemns this,” ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a routine news briefing Wednesday.

Apple's iOS 19 is turning out to be an interesting software update for iPhone users because it is said to bring along a massive visual overhaul; something that's not changed with the mobile operating system for a really long time. However, it is advised to take the below information with a pinch of salt as this could be based on an early build. The same applies to buttons and other UI elements in most native apps. This surely seems like a good break from the regular and mostly flat user interface that iOS has grown into compared to its skeuomorphic past.

CISA, which is responsible for protecting federal government networks from cybercriminals and foreign spies, declined comment.

Financial advisers face mounting pressure to improve efficiency, driven by both regulatory demands and commercial realities. Risk profiling tools are used by nearly all advisers and they have mostly been integrated into advice firms' centralised investment processes. The regulator's retirement income advice review may prompted some advisers to use of cash flow planning for clients approaching or in retirement, but many advisers now see commercial benefits from using the tool to engage clients in a rich experience of thinking hard about their finances. Client portals aim to streamline workflows, but relatively few clients use them and they often complain about their poor useability. But innovative solutions from tech providers like Pension Lab, Re:LoA and Unipass are gaining traction with some advice firms.</p>

Artificial intelligence company Anthropic convinced a California federal judge on Tuesday to reject a preliminary bid to block it from using lyrics owned by Universal Music Group tab and other music publishers to train its AI-powered chatbot Claude. U.S. District Judge Eumi Lee said that the publishers' request was too broad and that they failed to show Anthropic's conduct caused them “irreparable harm.” Music publishers UMG, Concord and ABKCO sued Anthropic in 2023, alleging that it infringed their copyrights in lyrics from at least 500 songs by musicians including Beyoncé, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys. The lawsuit is one of several arguing that copyrighted works by authors, news outlets, visual artists and others have been misused without consent or payment to develop AI products. Tech companies including OpenAI, Microsoft tab and Meta Platforms have said that their systems make “fair use” of copyrighted material under U.S. copyright law by studying it to learn to create new, transformative content.</p>

The new version, powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o model, can generate intricate visuals, including multi-panel comic strips with custom characters and dialogue. OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT in late 2022, training it on vast amounts of text data from across the internet. While the chatbot initially lacked image-generation capabilities, OpenAI later released DALL-E, a separate tool designed for that purpose. The latest iteration of ChatGPT, however, merges these functionalities into a single, more powerful system that learns from both text and visual data.

Even with NCPDP working toward a Structured and Codified Sig Standard, adoption by EHRs would be difficult as medications are not their sole focus. "One method that other systems have taken is to simply accept and load whatever free-text entries are received from the EHR," he continued. This improvement occurs completely behind the scenes and does not require any manual activation or intervention by a user." "Complex sigs exist that the e-prescribing system is not designed to handle by default, such as non-standard frequencies," he explained. Wise also has seen data variance at the hospice level as some organizations use manual entry or create their own drug entries compared with others that stick to a prepopulated list.</p>

How can we be sure that this “panel of experts” has the knowledge particular to each person who is requesting assisted suicide? Regardless of the initial criteria under which assisted suicide is permissible, evidence from other jurisdictions strongly suggests that they will be rapidly loosened. Your question raises concerns about a number of mental health issues which might lead people to request assisted suicide. We do not suggest that people should be kept alive at all costs by what we describe as “extraordinary means.” There comes a point when a person, because of their underlying condition, may refuse further treatment and accept care which respects the dignity of the human person. A person may exercise his or her autonomy about treatment but not intend to end their life prematurely and deliberately.</p>

Walgreens has agreed to pay $5 million to settle a lawsuit filed in federal court for the Northern District of Illinois more than 10 years ago. This was to induce all patients at the Cook County Health and Hospitals System CORE center, an ambulatory healthcare center in Illinois, to fill prescriptions at a specialty pharmacy called Walgreens C&M, according to the lawsuit. The case began in 2014 when plaintiff whistleblowers Sarah Castillo Baier and Rita Svendsen Baier sued Walgreens and a retail pharmacy branch manager alleging violation of the False Claims Act. Earlier this month, Walgreens Boots Alliance announced it had entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an entity affiliated with private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at $23.7 billion. Walgreens has suffered losses due in large part to VillageMD.</p>

When Wyden pressed him for a "yes" or "no" answer on whether he would cut Medicaid, the nominee replied, "The way you protect Medicaid is making sure it is viable at every level, which includes having enough practitioners to afford the services, paying them enough to do what you request of them, and making sure that patients are able to actually use Medicaid."</p>

The team reported a decrease in physician burnout rates and intentions to quit in 2025 relative to 2024 — a welcome finding after multiple years of high physician turnover following the COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty-one percent of physicians report having adequate time with patients, up from 43% in 2023. While 35% of respondents said patient volumes and costs negatively impact their ability to provide quality care at least once a week, that's down from the 50% of respondents who said volumes and costs impacted care at least once a week in 2023.

Atlanta, GA—Today, Reproductive Freedom for All Georgia strongly condemned House Bill 441, an extreme and politically motivated measure that would criminalize abortion at all stages of pregnancy by establishing legal personhood at fertilization. Ahead of a hearing today at the state capitol, reproductive advocates will rally and testify against this dangerous legislation in the fight to protect reproductive rights in Georgia. Lawmakers will debate a measure that escalates previous abortion restrictions, putting more lives at risk while ignoring Georgia's ongoing healthcare crisis. That law took effect in 2022 after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Reproductive Freedom for All is powered by its more than 4 million members from every state and congressional district in the country, representing the 8 in 10 Americans who support legal abortion.</p>

The selected health systems will work with research and education group Essential Hospitals Institute to cover key topics that include building trust, increasing care capacity, financing and staffing.UVA Health's mobile care unit, which formally launched in January, can provide initial care and then help a patient establish care at a brick-and-mortar outpatient clinic; provide non-emergency care that can't wait for a scheduled visit; or serve as a patient's primary care provider.The mobile care unit's services include:• general health check-ups• chronic disease management• pediatric care• care for minor illnesses and injuries• women's health • lab tests

“There are very few of these mobile care units in the United States that provide primary care services,” said Novella W. Thompson, M.B.A., administrator of UVA Health's Population Health Department, in a statement. “Through the collaborative, we hope to share our lessons learned and best practices, as well as see how other health systems are focusing their services and measuring healthy outcomes for all.”

Besides UVA Health, the following hospitals are participating in the learning collaborative:• Carilion Clinic, Roanoke, Va.: Primary Care Mobile Health Enhancement Project supports patients with transportation challenges or post-hospital care needs at home via its Family and Community Medicine Mobile Health team.• East Alabama Medical Center, Opelika, Ala.: Opelika Neighborhood Mobile Wellness Clinic provides free screenings and resources to underserved rural areas.• Huntsville Hospital Health System, Huntsville, Ala.: Vámonos: Making Healthcare Accessible to Non-English Speakers in Madison County Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) offers free preventive care in underserved Madison County communities.• WVU Medicine, Morgantown, W.Va.: Mobile Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Treatment (COAT) program ensures access to quality care in the state's rural areas.

But I think it's really important we recognise that some of our staff work in departments, children's services or housing or anything, where they can see some really distressing stuff and it is going to take a toll on their mental health.” He said mental health first aiders are there to signpost or just listen saying: “I think potentially mental health first aiders could be a good initiative for Rhondda Cynon Taf if you'd be prepared to explore it.” Councillor Ros Davis said she had also done that training and she thinks it's really excellent and something she would support. But Mr Evans said a lot of it comes down to volume with the numbers staying constant.</p>

These organizations benefit from the essential nature of their services, which ensures consistent demand, particularly as populations age and chronic diseases become more prevalent. However, profitability can be pressured by rising labor costs, regulatory requirements, and the challenges of balancing care quality with cost efficiency. Looking ahead, hospital chains stand to benefit from tailwinds such as increasing healthcare utilization driven by an aging population that generally has higher incidents of disease. AI can also be a tailwind in areas such as predictive analytics for more personalized treatment and efficiency (intake, staffing, resourcing allocation).

"It's more advanced forensic testing, which a lot of the evidence from this case will run through," Schoeberl said. Attorney Gina Ruggieri, who filed a notice stating she would be representing Chappelle instead of his previously appointed public defender, did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. "We hold Airmen accountable for their actions, and if service members are found in violation of military or civilian law, they will be punished."

On Monday, we all laid out our predictions for how each of the six divisions would finish, 1-5, and picked our three wild-card teams in each league. R.J. Anderson: There are two main approaches worth taking to preseason World Series picks: either you go with the best teams on paper, or you embrace chaos by choosing a couple viable dark horse clubs. Julian McWilliams: If healthy, the Red Sox could make their first World Series appearance since 2018. While their roster has plenty of question marks, they boast one of the best offenses in the AL. Their pitching staff, anchored by Garrett Crochet, has depth, and Alex Cora remains one of the game's top managers, thriving in high-stakes matchups. Picking a repeat champ just felt too boring for me anyway.</p>

While they are still expected to select Cam Ward with the No. Boyle, 30, spent his first three seasons in the NFL as one of Aaron Rodgers' backups. Boyle lost each of those starts and threw twice as many interceptions (six) as touchdowns (three), but he did complete an impressive 64.9% of his passes for a Lions team that went just 3-13-1 that season. Boyle's longevity is impressive when you consider how his NFL career started. But I'd say everything is still on the table right now."</p>

We monitor the network to catch these types of issues," a spokesperson for Swiatek said. The man in question has since been banned from all WTA tournaments. While it's uncertain as to whether or not the harassment incident and subsequent reaction affected her play, Swiatek ended up losing her quarterfinal match on Wednesday to Alexandra Eala.</p>

"It's also our job to set up a quarterback room," the general manager continued, confirming the Vikings included Rodgers on a list of potential offseason targets for veteran competition or insurance. "A player like him, he's always gonna be in those conversations," Adofo-Mensah said, noting that coach Kevin O'Connell had extensive dialogue with Rodgers during free agency.

Off the field, Wilson probably didn't want to relocate his family for a second straight offseason. There have been rumblings that the Steelers' decision to move on from Wilson had more to do with off-field matters regarding Wilson's relationship with several people within the organization, specifically offensive coordinator Arthur Smith. Those are just rumors, however, as no direct member of the Steelers' coaching staff/front office has publicly given this narrative any credence. Fortunately for Wilson, it appears that he will get another starting opportunity with the Giants, who among other things have an impressive receiving corps that is led by Malik Nabers. Nabers is coming off a stellar Pro Bowl rookie season that included becoming the fastest player to reach 100 career receptions, needing only 14 games to do so.</p>

Toppin might be the only person in college basketball who would genuinely pick Rodman as his favorite player. Toppin's love of rebounding and his growing offensive prowess has been critical for Texas Tech this season, setting up a Thursday Sweet 16 game against 10-seed Arkansas. Texas wanted Toppin and it's easy to imagine the Longhorns faring much better than a First Four exit that ultimately resulted in Terry's dismissal after three seasons. Texas boosters, which went all-in on NIL last season with the football program, didn't seem as willing to open up for Terry. Texas basketball sources say an asking price upwards of seven-figures ultimately proved too expensive for the Longhorns.</p>

He called the process "very straightforward" and keeping women's sports fair an issue that was "important" to him. However, women's sports advocates have pointed out that the NCAA's rules do not go far enough. The only states that do not allow this are Florida, Texas, Kansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Montana. Meanwhile, there are 14 states that allow sex on a birth certificate to be changed without any medical documentation required, including California, New York, Massachusetts and Michigan.</p>

"I see a young, athletic, talented, full-of-potential player," Vrabel said on OutKick's Don't @ Me with Dan Dakich. His veteran presence should have a significant impact on an offense that looked deflated in 2024. This will not be Vrabel's first draft experience as a head coach.</p>

3 overall pick in the NFL Draft, Trey Lance is without a team, drawing little interest as a free agent this offseason. 3 quarterback, Lance does have family ties to the Roughriders. His father, Carlton, once played one season as a cornerback for Saskatchewan, earning CFL All-Rookie honors. Trey Lance, meanwhile, has gone from potential face of the 49ers to afterthought backup in his young NFL career. He was then traded to the Cowboys after Brock Purdy's emergence as the 49ers' unlikely starter, spending the last two years behind both Dak Prescott and Cooper Rush in Dallas, where he appeared in just four total games.</p>

If you aren't into gambling, that's cool, too, because we're basically just discussing who might be decent picks to lead the league in a stat. He won 16 last year -- only two away from the MLB lead -- despite not getting run support on a regular basis. He's now hitting behind Francisco Lindor and Juan Soto, both of whom I expect to be all over the bases this season. There's a short porch in Fenway to left, too, but the Green Monster means some of those homers from past years turn into doubles.

If there's any narrative that holds true in the NFL, it's hard to win a Super Bowl. Hurts has been to two Super Bowl at this stage in his career -- and he is only 27 years old. Outside of an MVP award, Dak Prescott has accomplished nearly everything a quarterback could accomplish in the regular season. Jackson was the first player with 40+ passing touchdowns and fewer than five interceptions in a season last year. There are other factors outside of Allen, who has the most playoff wins without reaching a Super Bowl (seven).</p>

“Sports media is no longer a one-way conversation,” Galactic Chief Executive Officer Stuart Stott said in the statement.

Some online-wagering businesses have at times run afoul of US regulations and been forced to scale back their offerings.

This partnership model also demonstrates strategic efficiency - rather than building all capabilities in-house, GENI is leveraging Deep Blue's category expertise and Precise's technology infrastructure, likely accelerating market entry while controlling development costs. The new WS/AIM service addresses a significant market inefficiency - despite surging viewership, women's sports have lacked sophisticated audience targeting capabilities that are standard in other advertising sectors. The WS/AIM Service was designed to transform fan insights into first-party audience segments, which will be activated through publisher-direct inventory, creating scalable media buying opportunities. "This partnership enables brands to connect with these growing fan bases through newly created audience segments and gametime capabilities that match the excitement of live women's sports."</p>

Payments will be decided by “a ranking based on sporting and commercial criteria,” FIFA said without providing details. Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea also qualified by either winning a Champions League title from 2021 to 2024, or having consistent results in the competition over those four seasons. FIFA aims to share $250 million among clubs worldwide who did not qualify for the tournament. The competition's total prize fund has now risen by almost 25% for each season through 2027.</p>

The decision was reached by Red Bull bosses, including team principal Christian Horner, at a meeting in Dubai on Monday, insiders have told BBC Sport. The move, first confirmed by Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf, comes after a dire start to Lawson's Red Bull career. Lawson's two races in his first full season at Red Bull will go down as one of the shortest ever driver stints for an F1 team. While Lawson at least gets to stay on the grid, Japanese driver Yuji Ide had no such luck in 2006. Indian driver Karun Chandhok managed one race more than De Vries in 2010, when he lost his place at the HRT team to Japan's Sakon Yamamoto after just 11 grands prix.</p>

Once Pitino turned down VCU, that program pivoted and is hiring Bryant's Phil Martelli Jr., sources told CBS Sports. Sources said that Rick and Richard will welcome the rare opportunity to coach against each other. Pitino is succeeding Sean Miller, who abruptly left Xavier for a second time, opting to take the Texas job on Sunday. Sources said the circumstances surrounding Miller's messy exit wound up affecting Charleston coach Chris Mack's candidacy. But unlike Miller, Mack spent nearly two decades of his life at Xavier -- and is the winningest coach in program history.</p>

Coe, a former Olympic medal-winning middle-distance runner, said the body had made the decision following an “exhaustive review” and consultations with more than 70 sporting and advocacy groups. Coe, who earlier this month mounted an unsuccessful bid to lead the International Olympic Committee, said competitors would be subject to non-invasive cheek swabs and dry blood-spot tests and would only be checked once in their career. World Athletics in 2023 announced a ban on transgender women who had gone through male puberty, pending a review into the eligibility requirements for participants in female competition. The move overturned previous rules that allowed transgender women to compete if they maintained a blood testosterone level of no more than 5nmol/L for the preceding 12 months. While broadly aimed at athletes who have changed their gender, World Athletics's testing requirements would also affect small numbers of competitors who were born with atypical sex chromosomes.</p>

Serena Williams and Patrick Mouratoglou enjoyed real success together as the former won ten Grand Slam titles with the Frenchman by her side. 43-year-old Williams said she would lose 6-0, 6-0 to Andy Murray if they ever played a match, as Mouratoglou now reveals what happened when the 23-time Grand Slam winner trained with ATP stars. “We had the idea with Serena to play a match against Andy Murray and then we had also an idea on how to reduce the difference between men and women to make this match extremely competitive,” said Mouratoglou. In 2020, Mouratoglou helped launch Ultimate Tennis Showdown [UTS], a modern ‘reinvention' of tennis that has since attracted some of the sport's biggest names. It's fair to say Mouratoglou's UTS has been successful since its launch five years ago, as many will no doubt be interested to see what his ideas for a mixed gender competition look like.</p>

2 Iga Swiatek has been granted extra security after an incident in which an unruly fan verbally abused her during a practice session at the Miami Open last weekend, according to a report by the BBC. The spectator, who was characterized as "aggressive and taunting," allegedly shouted personal insults about Swiatek's family after previously having sent her abusive messages online. We monitor the network to catch these types of issues," a spokesperson for Swiatek said. At the Dubai Championships, a stoppage in play occurred after Emma Raducanu was frightened by the presence of a man who had been stalking her during her second round match, leading to enhanced security being put in place for her. The man in question has since been banned from all WTA tournaments.</p>

When Palisades Charter High School burned down, Stevenson, who coaches six of the school's players, knew immediately how badly the girls' and boys' varsity teams had been impacted, many without home courts, and some without homes. Working with Palisades coach Bud Kling and WTA Foundation Executive Director Ann Austin, Stevenson organized a trip for both teams to attend the BNP Paribas Open on March 7. “It was so important for these players to receive positive support after nearly two months without any normalcy in their lives,” Stevenson said. At a ceremony in the WTA suite at Indian Wells, Fernandez -- joined by Hall of Famer Pam Shriver -- presented Palisades Tennis Center Director Mike Tomas with a check for $25,000 to support the rebuild. She also announced a second $25,000 commitment to aid the Altadena tennis community.</p>

But once again Berrettini fought back and saved all three after winning seven straight points, before clinching victory on his second match point to leave de Minaur gutted. And de Minaur was shown little mercy from tennis fans on social media, who were left gobsmacked by the Aussie's huge "choke".

Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine, has written a new book, "My Mother and I." Prince Harry is parting ways with Sentebale, an African charity he co-founded in honor of his mother, Princess Diana, nearly two decades ago. Former trustees Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Dr Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West also explained why they chose to unanimously resign from the charity. "As a group of British and African trustees, we have made the difficult decision to unanimously resign as board members of Sentebale," the former trustees said in a statement to Fox News Digital. This was not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity."</p>

Michael Waltz: "Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc).
